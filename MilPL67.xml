<note>
<p>Important: this text is a copy of the first edition of Milton's
Paradise Lost (1667), and will differ in significant ways from the
revised
version (1674); most obviously, the 1667 version is divided into ten
and not twelve books, and lacks certain revisions made in 1674.
Users wishing to search this electronic text need to remember that the
electronic text retains the lexicographical and typographical
features of the first edition, including all uses of "vv" for "w", and
all the variations in spelling typical of a seventeenth-century
edition.</p>
</note>
<note>
<p>The Scolar edition is a "hybrid" facsimile: it is
neither a diplomatic facsimile of one copy nor an eclectic facsimile of an
"ideal" copy.  Instead, the Scolar editors have reproduced a copy owned by the
press, and the 85 times they came up against legibility problems with their
copy, they substituted pages from five different copies held by the
British Museum.</p>
