<div1 type="chapter" n="1" id="d3">
<pb n="1"/>
<p>SINCE EARLIEST CHILDHOOD I HAVE BEEN
strangely fascinated by the mystery surrounding the history
of the last days of twentieth century Europe.  My
interest is keenest, perhaps, not so much in relation to
known facts as to speculation upon the unknowable of
the two centuries that have rolled by since human
intercourse between the Western and Eastern Hemispheres
ceased &mdash; the mystery of Europe's state following
the termination of the Great War &mdash; provided, of course,
that the war had been terminated.</p>
<p>From out of the meagerness of our censored histories
we learned that for fifteen years after the cessation of
diplomatic relations between the United States of North
America and the belligerent nations of the Old World,
news of more or less doubtful authenticity filtered, from
time to time, into the Western Hemisphere from the
Eastern.</p>
<p>Then came the fruition of that historic propaganda
which is best described by its own slogan: "The East
for the East &mdash; the West for the West," and all further
intercourse was stopped by statute.</p>
<p>Even prior to this, transoceanic commerce had
practically ceased, owing to the perils and hazards of
the mine-strewn waters of both the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans.  Just when submarine activities ended we do

<pb n="2"/>
not know but the last vessel of this type sighted by a
Pan-American merchantman was the huge Q 138, which
discharged twenty-nine torpedoes at a Brazilian tank
steamer off the Bermudas in the fall of 1972.  A heavy
sea and the excellent seamanship of the master of the
Brazilian permitted the Pan-American to escape and report
this last of a long series of outrages upon our commerce.
God alone knows how many hundreds of our
ancient ships fell prey to the roving steel sharks of
blood-frenzied Europe.  Countless were the vessels and
men that passed over our eastern and western horizons
never to return; but whether they met their fates before
the belching tubes of submarines or among the aimlessly
drifting mine fields, no man lived to tell.</p>
<p>And then came the great Pan-American Federation
which linked the Western Hemisphere from pole to pole
under a single flag, which joined the navies of the New
World into the mightiest fighting force that ever sailed
the seven seas &mdash; the greatest argument for peace the
world had ever known.</p>
<p>Since that day peace had reigned from the western
shores of the Azores to the western shores of the
Hawaiian Islands, nor has any man of either hemisphere
dared cross 30dW. or 175dW.  From 30d to 175d is ours &mdash;
from 30d to 175d is peace, prosperity and happiness.</p>
<p>Beyond was the great unknown.  Even the geographies
of my boyhood showed nothing beyond.  We were
taught of nothing beyond.  Speculation was discouraged.
For two hundred years the Eastern Hemisphere had been
wiped from the maps and histories of Pan-America.  Its
mention in fiction, even, was forbidden.</p>
<p>Our ships of peace patrol thirty and one hundred
seventy-five.  What ships from beyond they have warned
only the secret archives of government show; but, a
naval officer myself, I have gathered from the traditions

<pb n="3"/>
of the service that it has been fully two hundred years
since smoke or sail has been sighted east of 30d or west
of 175d.  The fate of the relinquished provinces which
lay beyond the dead lines we could only speculate upon.
That they were taken by the military power, which rose
so suddenly in China after the fall of the republic, and
which wrested Manchuria and Korea from Russia and
Japan, and also absorbed the Philippines, is quite within
the range of possibility.</p>
<p>It was the commander of a Chinese man-of-war who
received a copy of the edict of 1972 from the hand of
my illustrious ancestor, Admiral Turck, on one hundred
seventy-five, two hundred and six years ago, and from
the yellowed pages of the admiral's diary I learned that
the fate of the Philippines was even then presaged by
these Chinese naval officers.</p>
<p>Yes, for over two hundred years no man crossed 30d
to 175d and lived to tell his story &mdash; not until chance
drew me across and back again, and public opinion,
revolting at last against the drastic regulations of our
long-dead forbears, demanded that my story be given
to the world, and that the narrow interdict which
commanded peace, prosperity, and happiness to halt at
30d and 175d be removed forever.</p>
<p>I am glad that it was given to me to be an instrument
in the hands of Providence for the uplifting of benighted
Europe, and the amelioration of the suffering,
degradation, and abysmal ignorance in which I found
her.</p>
<p>I shall not live to see the complete regeneration of
the savage hordes of the Eastern Hemisphere &mdash; that is a
work which will require many generations, perhaps
ages, so complete has been their reversion to savagery;
but I know that the work has been started, and I am

<pb n="4"/>
proud of the share in it which my generous countrymen
have placed in my hands.</p>
<p>The government already possesses a complete official
report of my adventures beyond thirty.  In the narrative
I purpose telling my story in a less formal, and I hope,
a more entertaining, style; though, being only a naval
officer and without claim to the slightest literary ability,
I shall most certainly fall far short of the possibilities
which are inherent in my subject.  That I have passed
through the most wondrous adventures that have befallen
a civilized man during the past two centuries encourages
me in the belief that, however ill the telling,
the facts themselves will command your interest to the
final page.</p>
<p>Beyond thirty!  Romance, adventure, strange peoples,
fearsome beasts &mdash; all the excitement and scurry of the
lives of the twentieth century ancients that have been
denied us in these dull days of peace and prosaic prosperity &mdash;
all, all lay beyond thirty, the invisible barrier
between the stupid, commercial present and the carefree,
barbarous past.</p>
<p>What boy has not sighed for the good old days of
wars, revolutions, and riots; how I used to pore over
the chronicles of those old days, those dear old days,
when workmen went armed to their labors; when they
fell upon one another with gun and bomb and dagger,
and the streets ran red with blood!  Ah, but those were
the times when life was worth the living; when a man
who went out by night knew not at which dark corner
a "footpad" might leap upon and slay him; when wild
beasts roamed the forest and the jungles, and there were
savage men, and countries yet unexplored.</p>
<p>Now, in all the Western Hemisphere dwells no man
who may not find a school house within walking distance
of his home, or at least within flying distance.

<pb n="5"/>
The wildest beast that roams our waste places lairs in
the frozen north or the frozen south within a government
reserve, where the curious may view him and feed
him bread crusts from the hand with perfect impunity.</p>
<p>But beyond thirty!  And I have gone there, and come
back; and now you may go there, for no longer is it
high treason, punishable by disgrace or death, to cross
30d or 175d.</p>
<p>My name is Jefferson Turck.  I am a lieutenant in the
navy &mdash; in the great Pan-American navy, the only navy
which now exists in all the world.</p>
<p>I was born in Arizona, in the United States of North
America, in the year of our Lord 2116.  Therefore, I am
twenty-one years old.</p>
<p>In early boyhood I tired of the teeming cities and
overcrowded rural districts of Arizona.  Every generation
of Turcks for over two centuries has been represented in
the navy.  The navy called to me, as did the
free, wide, unpeopled spaces of the mighty oceans.  And
so I joined the navy, coming up from the ranks, as we
all must, learning our craft as we advance.  My promotion
was rapid, for my family seems to inherit naval
lore.  We are born officers, and I reserve to myself no
special credit for an early advancement in the service.</p>
<p>At twenty I found myself a lieutenant in command of
the aero-submarine <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>, of the SS-96 class.  The
<hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> was one of the first of the air and underwater
craft which have been so greatly improved since
its launching, and was possessed of innumerable weaknesses
which, fortunately, have been eliminated in more
recent vessels of similar type.</p>
<p>Even when I took command, she was fit only for the
junk pile; but the world-old parsimony of government
retained her in active service, and sent two hundred

<pb n="6"/>
men to sea in her, with myself, a mere boy, in command
of her, to patrol thirty from Iceland to the Azores.</p>
<p>Much of my service had been spent aboard the great
merchantmen-of-war.  These are the utility naval vessels
that have transformed the navies of old, which burdened
the peoples with taxes for their support, into the present
day fleets of self-supporting ships that find ample time
for target practice and gun drill while they bear freight
and the mails from the continents to the far-scattered
island of Pan-America.</p>
<p>This change in service was most welcome to me,
especially as it brought with it coveted responsibilities
of sole command, and I was prone to overlook the
deficiencies of the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> in the natural pride
I felt in my first ship.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> was fully equipped for two months'
patrolling &mdash; the ordinary length of assignment to this
service &mdash; and a month had already passed, its monotony
entirely unrelieved by sight of another craft, when the
first of our misfortunes befell.</p>
<p>We had been riding out a storm at an altitude of about
three thousand feet.  All night we had hovered above the
tossing billows of the moonlight clouds.  The detonation
of the thunder and the glare of lightning through an
occasional rift in the vaporous wall proclaimed the
continued fury of the tempest upon the surface of the sea;
but we, far above it all, rode in comparative ease upon
the upper gale.  With the coming of dawn the clouds
beneath us became a glorious sea of gold and silver,
soft and beautiful; but they could not deceive us as to
the blackness and the terrors of the storm-lashed ocean
which they hid.</p>
<p>I was at breakfast when my chief engineer entered
and saluted.  His face was grave, and I thought he was
even a trifle paler than usual.</p>

<pb n="7"/>
<p>"Well?" I asked.</p>
<p>He drew the back of his forefinger nervously across
his brow in a gesture that was habitual with him in
moments of mental stress.</p>
<p>"The gravitation-screen generators, sir," he said.
"Number one went to the bad about an hour and a half
ago.  We have been working upon it steadily since; but
I have to report, sir, that it is beyond repair."</p>
<p>"Number two will keep us supplied," I answered.
"In the meantime we will send a wireless for relief."</p>
<p>"But that is the trouble, sir," he went on.  "Number
two has stopped.  I knew it would come, sir.  I made a
report on these generators three years ago.  I advised
then that they both be scrapped.  Their principle is
entirely wrong.  They're done for."  And, with a grim
smile, "I shall at least have the satisfaction of knowing
my report was accurate."</p>
<p>"Have we sufficient reserve screen to permit us to
make land, or, at least, meet our relief halfway?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"No, sir," he replied gravely; "we are sinking now."</p>
<p>"Have you anything further to report?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, sir," he said.</p>
<p>"Very good," I replied; and, as I dismissed him, I
rang for my wireless operator.  When he appeared, I
gave him a message to the secretary of the navy, to
whom all vessels in service on thirty and one hundred
seventy-five report direct.  I explained our predicament,
and stated that with what screening force remained I
should continue in the air, making as rapid headway
toward St. Johns as possible, and that when we were
forced to take to the water I should continue in the same
direction.</p>
<p>The accident occurred directly over 30d and about
52d N.  The surface wind was blowing a tempest from

<pb n="8"/>
the west.  To attempt to ride out such a storm upon the
surface seemed suicidal, for the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> was not
designed for surface navigation except under fair weather
conditions.  Submerged, or in the air, she was tractable
enough in any sort of weather when under control; but
without her screen generators she was almost helpless,
since she could not fly, and, if submerged, could not
rise to the surface.</p>
<p>All these defects have been remedied in later models;
but the knowledge did not help us any that day aboard
the slowly settling <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>, with an angry sea roaring
beneath, a tempest raging out of the west, and 30d only
a few knots astern.</p>
<p>To cross thirty or one hundred seventy-five has been,
as you know, the direst calamity that could befall a
naval commander.  Court-martial and degradation follow
swiftly, unless as is often the case, the unfortunate
man takes his own life before this unjust and heartless
regulation can hold him up to public scorn.</p>
<p>There has been in the past no excuse, no circumstance,
that could palliate the offense.</p>
<p>"He was in command, and he took his ship across
thirty!"  That was sufficient.  It might not have been in
any way his fault, as, in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>, it
could not possibly have been justly charged to my account
that the gravitation-screen generators were worthless; but
well I knew that should chance have it that we
were blown across thirty today &mdash; as we might easily be
before the terrific west wind that we could hear howling
below us, the responsibility would fall upon my shoulders.</p>
<p>In a way, the regulation was a good one, for it certainly
accomplished that for which it was intended.  We
all fought shy of 30d on the east and 175d on the west,
and, though we had to skirt them pretty close, nothing

<pb n="9"/>
but an act of God ever drew one of us across.  You all
are familiar with the naval tradition that a good officer
could sense proximity to either line, and for my part, I
am firmly convinced of the truth of this as I am that the
compass finds the north without recourse to tedious
processes of reasoning.</p>
<p>Old Admiral Sanchez was wont to maintain that he
could smell thirty, and the men of the first ship in which
I sailed claimed that Coburn, the navigating officer,
knew by name every wave along thirty from 60dN. to
60dS.  However, I'd hate to vouch for this.</p>
<p>Well, to get back to my narrative; we kept on dropping
slowly toward the surface the while we bucked the
west wind, clawing away from thirty as fast as we could.
I was on the bridge, and as we dropped from the brilliant
sunlight into the dense vapor of clouds and on
down through them to the wild, dark storm strata beneath,
it seemed that my spirits dropped with the falling
ship, and the buoyancy of hope ran low in sympathy.</p>
<p>The waves were running to tremendous heights, and
the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> was not designed to meet such waves
head on.  Her elements were the blue ether, far above
the raging storm, or the greater depths of ocean, which
no storm could ruffle.</p>
<p>As I stood speculating upon our chances once we
settled into the frightful Maelstrom beneath us and at
the same time mentally computing the hours which must
elapse before aid could reach us, the wireless operator
clambered up the ladder to the bridge, and, disheveled
and breathless, stood before me at salute.  It needed but
a glance at him to assure me that something was amiss.</p>
<p>"What now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The wireless, sir!" he cried.  "My God, sir, I cannot
send."</p>
<p>"But the emergency outfit?" I asked.</p>

<pb n="10"/>
<p>"I have tried everything, sir.  I have exhausted every
resource.  We cannot send," and he drew himself up
and saluted again.</p>
<p>I dismissed him with a few kind words, for I knew
that it was through no fault of his that the mechanism
was antiquated and worthless, in common with the balance
of the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>'s equipment.  There was no finer
operator in Pan-America than he.</p>
<p>The failure of the wireless did not appear as momentous
to me as to him, which is not unnatural, since it
is but human to feel that when our own little cog slips,
the entire universe must necessarily be put out of gear.
I knew that if this storm were destined to blow us across
thirty, or send us to the bottom of the ocean, no help
could reach us in time to prevent it.  I had ordered the
message sent solely because regulations required it, and
not with any particular hope that we could benefit by it
in our present extremity.</p>
<p>I had little time to dwell upon the coincidence of the
simultaneous failure of the wireless and the buoyancy
generators, since very shortly after the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> had
dropped so low over the waters that all my attention
was necessarily centered upon the delicate business of
settling upon the waves without breaking my ship's
back.  With our buoyancy generators in commission it
would have been a simple thing to enter the water, since
then it would have been but a trifling matter of a forty-five
degree dive into the base of a huge wave.  We should
have cut into the water like a hot knife through butter,
and have been totally submerged with scarce a jar &mdash; I have
done it a thousand times &mdash; but I did not dare submerge
the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> for fear that it would remain submerged
to the end of time &mdash; a condition far from conducive to
the longevity of commander or crew.</p>
<p>Most of my officers were older men than I.  John Alvarez,

<pb n="11"/>
my first officer, is twenty years my senior.  He
stood at my side on the bridge as the ship glided closer
and closer to those stupendous waves.  He watched my
every move, but he was by far too fine an officer and
gentleman to embarrass me by either comment or suggestion.</p>
<p>When I saw that we soon would touch, I ordered the
ship brought around broadside to the wind, and there
we hovered a moment until a huge wave reached up
and seized us upon its crest, and then I gave the order
that suddenly reversed the screening force, and let us
into the ocean.  Down into the trough we went, wallowing
like the carcass of a dead whale, and then began
the fight, with rudder and propellers, to force the
<hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> back into the teeth of the gale and drive
her on and on, farther and farther from relentless thirty.</p>
<p>I think that we should have succeeded, even though
the ship was wracked from stem to stern by the terrific
buffetings she received, and though she were half submerged
the greater part of the time, had no further
accident befallen us.</p>
<p>We were making headway, though slowly, and it began
to look as though we were going to pull through.
Alvarez never left my side, though I all but ordered him
below for much-needed rest.  My second officer, Porfirio
Johnson, was also often on the bridge.  He was a
good officer, but a man for whom I had conceived a
rather unreasoning aversion almost at the first moment
of meeting him, an aversion which was not lessened by
the knowledge which I subsequently gained that he
looked upon my rapid promotion with jealousy.  He was
ten years my senior both in years and service, and I
rather think he could never forget the fact that he had
been an officer when I was a green apprentice.</p>
<p>As it became more and more apparent that the
<hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>,

<pb n="12"/>
under my seamanship, was weathering the tempest and
giving promise of pulling through safely, I
could have sworn that I perceived a shade of annoyance
and disappointment growing upon his dark countenance.
He left the bridge finally and went below.  I do
not know that he is directly responsible for what
followed so shortly after; but I have always had my
suspicions, and Alvarez is even more prone to place the
blame upon him than I.</p>
<p>It was about six bells of the forenoon watch that
Johnson returned to the bridge after an absence of some
thirty minutes.  He seemed nervous and ill at ease &mdash; a
fact which made little impression on me at the time,
but which both Alvarez and I recalled subsequently.</p>
<p>Not three minutes after his reappearance at my side
the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> suddenly commenced to lose headway.  I
seized the telephone at my elbow, pressing upon the
button which would call the chief engineer to the
instrument in the bowels of the ship, only to find him
already at the receiver attempting to reach me.</p>
<p>"Numbers one, two, and five engines have broken
down, sir," he called.  "Shall we force the remaining
three?"</p>
<p>"We can do nothing else," I bellowed into the
transmitter.</p>
<p>"They won't stand the gaff, sir," he returned.</p>
<p>"Can you suggest a better plan?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, sir," he replied.</p>
<p>"Then give them the gaff, lieutenant," I shouted
back, and hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>For twenty minutes the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> bucked the great
seas with her three engines.  I doubt if she advanced a
foot; but it was enough to keep her nose in the wind,
and, at least, we were not drifting toward thirty.</p>

<pb n="13"/>
<p>Johnson and Alvarez were at my side when, without
warning, the bow swung swiftly around and the ship
fell into the trough of the sea.</p>
<p>"The other three have gone," I said, and I happened
to be looking at Johnson as I spoke.  Was it the shadow
of a satisfied smile that crossed his thin lips?  I do not
know; but at least he did not weep.</p>
<p>"You always have been curious, sir, about the great
unknown beyond thirty," he said.  "You are in a good
way to have your curiosity satisfied."  And then I could
not mistake the slight sneer that curved his upper lip.
There must have been a trace of disrespect in his tone
or manner which escaped me, for Alvarez turned upon
him like a flash.</p>
<p>"When Lieutenant Turck crosses thirty," he said,
"we shall all cross with him, and God help the officer
or the man who reproaches him!"</p>
<p>"I shall not be a party to high treason," snapped
Johnson.  "The regulations are explicit, and if the
<hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> crosses thirty it devolves upon you to
place Lieutenant Turck under arrest and immediately exert
every endeavor to bring the ship back into Pan-American
waters."</p>
<p>"I shall not know," replied Alvarez, "that the
<hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> passes thirty; nor shall any other man
aboard know it," and, with his words, he drew a revolver from
his pocket, and before either I or Johnson could prevent
it had put a bullet into every instrument upon the bridge,
ruining them beyond repair.</p>
<p>And then he saluted me, and strode from the bridge,
a martyr to loyalty and friendship, for, though no man
might know that Lieutenant Jefferson Turck had taken
his ship across thirty, every man aboard would know
that the first officer had committed a crime that was

<pb n="14"/>
punishable by both degradation and death.  Johnson
turned and eyed me narrowly.</p>
<p>"Shall I place him under arrest?" he asked.</p>
<p>"You shall not," I replied.  "Nor shall anyone else."</p>
<p>"You become a party to his crime!" he cried angrily.</p>
<p>"You may go below, Mr. Johnson," I said, "and
attend to the work of unpacking the extra instruments
and having them properly set upon the bridge."</p>
<p>He saluted, and left me, and for some time I stood,
gazing out upon the angry waters, my mind filled with
unhappy reflections upon the unjust fate that had
overtaken me, and the sorrow and disgrace that I had
unwittingly brought down upon my house.</p>
<p>I rejoiced that I should leave neither wife nor child
to bear the burden of my shame throughout their lives.</p>
<p>As I thought upon my misfortune, I considered more
clearly than ever before the unrighteousness of the
regulation which was to prove my doom, and in the natural
revolt against its injustice my anger rose, and there
mounted within me a feeling which I imagine must have
paralleled that spirit that once was prevalent among the
ancients called anarchy.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life I found my sentiments
arraying themselves against custom, tradition, and even
government.  The wave of rebellion swept over me in an
instant, beginning with an heretical doubt as to the
sanctity of the established order of things &mdash; that fetish
which has ruled Pan-Americans for two centuries, and
which is based upon a blind faith in the infallibility of
the prescience of the long-dead framers of the articles
of Pan-American federation &mdash; and ending in an adamantine
determination to defend my honor and my life to
the last ditch against the blind and senseless regulation
which assumed the synonymity of misfortune and treason.</p>

<pb n="15"/>
<p>I would replace the destroyed instruments upon the
bridge; every officer and man should know when we
crossed thirty.  But then I should assert the spirit which
dominated me, I should resist arrest, and insist upon
bringing my ship back across the dead line, remaining
at my post until we had reached New York.  Then I
should make a full report, and with it a demand upon
public opinion that the dead lines be wiped forever from
the seas.</p>
<p>I knew that I was right.  I knew that no more loyal
officer wore the uniform of the navy.  I knew that I
was a good officer and sailor, and I didn't propose
submitting to degradation and discharge because a lot
of old, preglacial fossils had declared over two hundred
years before that no man should cross thirty.</p>
<p>Even while these thoughts were passing through my
mind I was busy with the details of my duties.  I had
seen to it that a sea anchor was rigged, and even now
the men had completed their task, and the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>
was swinging around rapidly, her nose pointing once
more into the wind, and the frightful rolling consequent
upon her wallowing in the trough was happily diminishing.</p>
<p>It was then that Johnson came hurrying to the
bridge.  One of his eyes was swollen and already
darkening, and his lip was cut and bleeding.  Without
even the formality of a salute, he burst upon me, white
with fury.</p>
<p>"Lieutenant Alvarez attacked me!" he cried.  "I
demand that he be placed under arrest.  I found him
in the act of destroying the reserve instruments, and
when I would have interfered to protect them he fell
upon me and beat me.  I demand that you arrest
him!"</p>
<p>"You forget yourself, Mr. Johnson," I said.  "You

<pb n="16"/>
are not in command of the ship.  I deplore the action of
Lieutenant Alvarez, but I cannot expunge from my mind
the loyalty and self-sacrificing friendship which has
prompted him to his acts.  Were I you, sir, I should
profit by the example he has set.  Further, Mr. Johnson,
I intend retaining command of the ship, even though
she crosses thirty, and I shall demand implicit obedience
from every officer and man aboard until I am properly
relieved from duty by a superior officer in the port
of New York."</p>
<p>"You mean to say that you will cross thirty without
submitting to arrest?" he almost shouted.</p>
<p>"I do, sir," I replied.  "And now you may go below,
and, when again you find it necessary to address me,
you will please be so good as to bear in mind the fact
that I am your commanding officer, and as such entitled
to a salute."</p>
<p>He flushed, hesitated a moment, and then, saluting,
turned upon his heel and left the bridge.  Shortly
after, Alvarez appeared.  He was pale, and seemed to
have aged ten years in the few brief minutes since I
last had seen him.  Saluting, he told me very simply
what he had done, and asked that I place him under
arrest.</p>
<p>I put my hand on his shoulder, and I guess that my
voice trembled a trifle as, while reproving him for his
act, I made it plain to him that my gratitude was no less
potent a force than his loyalty to me.  Then it was that
I outlined to him my purpose to defy the regulation that
had raised the dead lines, and to take my ship back
to New York myself.</p>
<p>I did not ask him to share the responsibility with me.
I merely stated that I should refuse to submit to arrest,
and that I should demand of him and every other officer

<pb n="17"/>
and man implicit obedience to my every command until
we docked at home.</p>
<p>His face brightened at my words, and he assured me
that I would find him as ready to acknowledge my command
upon the wrong side of thirty as upon the right,
an assurance which I hastened to tell him I did not
need.</p>
<p>The storm continued to rage for three days, and as
far as the wind scarce varied a point during all that
time, I knew that we must be far beyond thirty, drifting
rapidly east by south.  All this time it had been
impossible to work upon the damaged engines or the
gravity-screen generators; but we had a full set of
instruments upon the bridge, for Alvarez, after
discovering my intentions, had fetched the reserve
instruments from his own cabin, where he had hidden them.
Those which Johnson had seen him destroy had been
a third set which only Alvarez had known was aboard
the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>.</p>
<p>We waited impatiently for the sun, that we might
determine our exact location, and upon the fourth day
our vigil was rewarded a few minutes before noon.</p>
<p>Every officer and man aboard was tense with nervous
excitement as we awaited the result of the reading.  The
crew had known almost as soon as I that we were
doomed to cross thirty, and I am inclined to believe
that every man jack of them was tickled to death, for
the spirits of adventure and romance still live in the
hearts of men of the twenty-second century, even though
there be little for them to feed upon between thirty and
one hundred seventy-five.</p>
<p>The men carried none of the burdens of responsibility.
They might cross thirty with impunity, and
doubtless they would return to be heroes at home; but

<pb n="18"/>
how different the home-coming of their commanding
officer!</p>
<p>The wind had dropped to a steady blow, still from
west by north, and the sea had gone down correspondingly.
The crew, with the exception of those
whose duties kept them below, were ranged on deck
below the bridge.  When our position was definitely
fixed I personally announced it to the eager, waiting
men.</p>
<p>"Men," I said, stepping forward to the handrail and
looking down into their upturned, bronzed faces, "you
are anxiously awaiting information as to the ship's
position.  It has been determined at latitude fifty
degrees seven minutes north, longitude twenty degrees
sixteen minutes west."</p>
<p>I paused and a buzz of animated comment ran through
the massed men beneath me.  "Beyond thirty.  But there
will be no change in commanding officers, in routine
or in discipline, until after we have docked again in
New York."</p>
<p>As I ceased speaking and stepped back from the rail
there was a roar of applause from the deck such as I
never before had heard aboard a ship of peace.  It
recalled to my mind tales that I had read of the good old
days when naval vessels were built to fight, when ships
of peace had been man-of-war, and guns had flashed in
other than futile target practice, and decks had run red
with blood.</p>
<p>With the subsistence of the sea, we were able to go
to work upon the damaged engines to some effect, and
I also set men to examining the gravitation-screen
generators with a view to putting them in working order
should it prove not beyond our resources.</p>
<p>For two weeks we labored at the engines, which
indisputably showed evidence of having been tampered

<pb n="19"/>
with.  I appointed a board to investigate and report upon
the disaster.  But it accomplished nothing other than to
convince me that there were several officers upon it who
were in full sympathy with Johnson, for, though no
charges had been preferred against him, the board went
out of its way specifically to exonerate him in its
findings.</p>
<p>All this time we were drifting almost due east.  The
work upon the engines had progressed to such an extent
that within a few hours we might expect to be able to
proceed under our own power westward in the direction
of Pan-American waters.</p>
<p>To relieve the monotony I had taken to fishing, and
early that morning I had departed from the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>
in one of the boats on such an excursion.  A gentle west
wind was blowing.  The sea shimmered in the sunlight.
A cloudless sky canopied the west for our sport, as I
had made it a point never voluntarily to make an inch
toward the east that I could avoid.  At least, they should
not be able to charge me with a willful violation of the
dead lines regulation.</p>
<p>I had with me only the boat's ordinary complement
of men &mdash; three in all, and more than enough to handle
any small power boat.  I had not asked any of my
officers to accompany me, as I wished to be alone,
and very glad am I now that I had not.  My only regret
is that, in view of what befell us, it had been necessary
to bring the three brave fellows who manned the
boat.</p>
<p>Our fishing, which proved excellent, carried us so far
to the west that we no longer could see the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>.
The day wore on, until at last, about mid-afternoon, I
gave the order to return to the ship.</p>
<p>We had proceeded but a short distance toward the
east when one of the men gave an exclamation of excitement,

<pb n="20"/>
at the same time pointing eastward.  We all
looked on in the direction he had indicated, and there, a
short distance above the horizon, we saw the outlines
of the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> silhouetted against the sky.</p>
<p>"They've repaired the engines and the generators
both," exclaimed one of the men.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible, but yet it had evidently been
done.  Only that morning, Lieutenant Johnson had told
me that he feared that it would be impossible to repair
the generators.  I had put him in charge of this work, since
he always had been accounted one of the best
gravitation-screen men in the navy.  He had invented several
of the improvements that are incorporated in the later models
of these generators, and I am convinced that he knows more
concerning both the theory and the practice of screening
gravitation than any living Pan-American.</p>
<p>At the sight of the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> once more under
control, the three men burst into a glad cheer.  But, for
some reason which I could not then account, I was
strangely overcome by a premonition of personal
misfortune.  It was not that I now anticipated an early
return to Pan-America and a board of inquiry, for I had
rather looked forward to the fight that must follow my
return.  No, there was something else, something
indefinable and vague that cast a strange gloom upon me
as I saw my ship rising farther above the water and making
straight in our direction.</p>
<p>I was not long in ascertaining a possible explanation
of my depression, for, though we were plainly visible
from the bridge of the aero-submarine and to the hundreds
of men who swarmed her deck, the ship passed
directly above us, not five hundred feet from the water,
and sped directly westward.</p>
<p>We all shouted, and I fired my pistol to attract their
attention, though I knew full well that all who cared to

<pb n="21"/>
had observed us, but the ship moved steadily away,
growing smaller and smaller to our view until at last
she passed completely out of sight.</p></div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="2" id="d4"><pb n="22"/>
<p>WHAT COULD IT MEAN?  I HAD LEFT ALVAREZ
in command.  He was my most loyal subordinate.  It was
absolutely beyond the pale of possibility that Alvarez
should desert me.  No, there was some other explanation.
Something occurred to place my second officer,
Porfirio Johnson, in command.  I was sure of it but why
speculate?  The futility of conjecture was only too
palpable.  The <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> had abandoned us in midocean.
Doubtless none of us would survive to know why.</p>
<p>The young man at the wheel of the power boat had
turned her nose about as it became evident that the ship
intended passing over us, and now he still held her in
futile pursuit of the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>.</p>
<p>"Bring her about, Snider," I directed, "and hold her
due east.  We can't catch the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>, and we can't
cross the Atlantic in this.  Our only hope lies in making
the nearest land, which, unless I am mistaken, is the
Scilly Islands, off the southwest coast of England.  Ever
heard of England, Snider?"</p>
<p>"There's a part of the United States of North America
that used to be known to the ancients as New England,"
he replied.  "Is that where you mean, sir?"</p>
<p>"No, Snider," I replied.  "The England I refer to was
an island off the continent of Europe.  It was the seat of
a very powerful kingdom that flourished over two hundred

<pb n="23"/>
years ago.  A part of the United States of North
America and all of the Federated States of Canada once
belonged to this ancient England."</p>
<p>"Europe," breathed one of the men, his voice tense
with excitement.  "My grandfather used to tell me stories
of the world beyond thirty.  He had been a great
student, and he had read much from forbidden books."</p>
<p>"In which I resemble your grandfather," I said, "for
I, too, have read more even than naval officers are supposed
to read, and, as you men know, we are permitted
a greater latitude in the study of geography and history
than men of other professions.</p>
<p>"Among the books and papers of Admiral Porter
Turck, who lived two hundred years ago, and from
whom I am descended, many volumes still exist, and
are in my possession, which deal with the history and
geography of ancient Europe.  Usually I bring several
of these books with me upon a cruise, and this time,
among others, I have maps of Europe and her surrounding
waters.  I was studying them as we came away from
the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> this morning, and luckily I have them
with me."</p>
<p>"You are going to try to make Europe, sir?" asked
Taylor, the young man who had last spoken.</p>
<p>"It is the nearest land," I replied.  "I have always
wanted to explore the forgotten lands of the Eastern
Hemisphere.  Here's our chance.  To remain at sea is to
perish.  None of us ever will see home again.  Let us
make the best of it, and enjoy while we do live that
which is forbidden the balance of our race &mdash; the adventure
and the mystery which lie beyond thirty."</p>
<p>Taylor and Delcarte seized the spirit of my mood but
Snider, I think, was a trifle sceptical.</p>
<p>"It is treason, sir," I replied, "but there is no law
which compels us to visit punishment upon ourselves.

<pb n="24"/>
Could we return to Pan-America, I should be the first
to insist that we face it.  But we know that's not possible.
Even if this craft would carry us so far, we haven't
enough water or food for more than three days.</p>
<p>"We are doomed, Snider, to die far from home and
without ever again looking upon the face of another
fellow countryman than those who sit here now in this
boat.  Isn't that punishment sufficient for even the most
exacting judge?"</p>
<p>Even Snider had to admit that it was.</p>
<p>"Very well, then, let us live while we live, and enjoy
to the fullest whatever of adventure or pleasure each
new day brings, since any day may be our last, and we
shall be dead for a considerable while."</p>
<p>I could see that Snider was still fearful, but Taylor
and Delcarte responded with a hearty, "Aye, aye, sir!"</p>
<p>They were of different mold.  Both were sons of naval
officers.  They represented the aristocracy of birth, and
they dared to think for themselves.</p>
<p>Snider was in the minority, and so we continued toward
the east.  Beyond thirty, and separated from my
ship, my authority ceased.  I held leadership, if I was
to hold it at all, by virtue of personal qualifications
only, but I did not doubt my ability to remain the
director of our destinies in so far as they were amenable
to human agencies.  I have always led.  While my brain
and brawn remain unimpaired I shall continue always
to lead.  Following is an art which Turcks do not easily
learn.</p>
<p>It was not until the third day that we raised land,
dead ahead, which I took, from my map, to be the
isles of Scilly.  But such a gale was blowing that I did
not dare attempt to land, and so we passed to the
north of them, skirted Land's End, and entered the
English Channel.</p>

<pb n="25"/>
<p>I think that up to that moment I had never experienced
such a thrill as passed through me when I realized
that I was navigating these historic waters.  The
lifelong dreams that I never had dared hope to see
fulfilled were at last a reality &mdash; but under what forlorn
circumstances!</p>
<p>Never could I return to my native land.  To the end of
my days I must remain in exile.  Yet even these thoughts
failed to dampen my ardor.</p>
<p>My eyes scanned the waters.  To the north I could see
the rockbound coast of Cornwall.  Mine were the first
American eyes to rest upon it for more than two hundred
years.  In vain, I searched for some sign of ancient
commerce that, if history is to be believed, must have
dotted the bosom of the Channel with white sails and
blackened the heavens with the smoke of countless funnels,
but as far as eye could reach the tossing waters of
the Channel were empty and deserted.</p>
<p>Toward midnight the wind and sea abated, so that
shortly after dawn I determined to make inshore in an
attempt to effect a landing, for we were sadly in need
of fresh water and food.</p>
<p>According to my observations, we were just off Ram
Head, and it was my intention to enter Plymouth Bay
and visit Plymouth.  From my map it appeared that this
city lay back from the coast a short distance, and there
was another city given as Devonport, which appeared
to lie at the mouth of the river Tamar.</p>
<p>However, I knew that it would make little difference
which city we entered, as the English people were
famed of old for their hospitality toward visiting
mariners.  As we approached the mouth of the bay I looked
for the fishing craft which I expected to see emerging
thus early in the day for their labors.  But even after we
rounded Ram Head and were well within the waters of

<pb n="26"/>
the bay I saw no vessel.  Neither was there buoy nor
light nor any other mark to show larger ships the channel,
and I wondered much at this.</p>
<p>The coast was densely overgrown, nor was any
building or sign of man apparent from the water.  Up
the bay and into the River Tamar we motored through
a solitude as unbroken as that which rested upon the
waters of the Channel.  For all we could see, there was
no indication that man had ever set his foot upon this
silent coast.</p>
<p>I was nonplused, and then, for the first time, there
crept over me an intuition of the truth.</p>
<p>Here was no sign of war.  As far as this portion of
the Devon coast was concerned, that seemed to have
been over for many years, but neither were there any
people.  Yet I could not find it within myself to believe
that I should find no inhabitants in England.  Reasoning
thus, I discovered that it was improbable that a
state of war still existed, and that the people all had
been drawn from this portion of England to some
other, where they might better defend themselves
against an invader.</p>
<p>But what of their ancient coast defenses?  What was
there here in Plymouth Bay to prevent an enemy landing
in force and marching where they wished?  Nothing.  I
could not believe that any enlightened military
nation, such as the ancient English are reputed to
have been, would have voluntarily so deserted an exposed
coast and an excellent harbor to the mercies of
an enemy.</p>
<p>I found myself becoming more and more deeply involved
in quandary.  The puzzle which confronted me I
could not unravel.  We had landed, and I now stood
upon the spot where, according to my map, a large city
should rear its spires and chimneys.  There was nothing

<pb n="27"/>
but rough, broken ground covered densely with weeds
and brambles, and tall, rank, grass.</p>
<p>Had a city ever stood there, no sign of it remained.
The roughness and unevenness of the ground suggested
something of a great mass of debris hidden by the
accumulation of centuries of undergrowth.</p>
<p>I drew the short cutlass with which both officers and
men of the navy are, as you know, armed out of courtesy
to the traditions and memories of the past, and with
its point dug into the loam about the roots of the
vegetation growing at my feet.</p>
<p>The blade entered the soil for a matter of seven
inches, when it struck upon something stonelike.
Digging about the obstacle, I presently loosened it,
and when I had withdrawn it from its sepulcher I
found the thing to be an ancient brick of clay, baked
in an oven.</p>
<p>Delcarte we had left in charge of the boat; but Snider
and Taylor were with me, and following my example,
each engaged in the fascinating sport of prospecting for
antiques.  Each of us uncovered a great number of these
bricks, until we commenced to weary of the monotony
of it, when Snider suddenly gave an exclamation of
excitement, and, as I turned to look, he held up a human
skull for my inspection.</p>
<p>I took it from him and examined it.  Directly in the
center of the forehead was a small round hole.  The
gentleman had evidently come to his end defending his
country from an invader.</p>
<p>Snider again held aloft another trophy of the
search &mdash; a metal spike and some tarnished and corroded
metal ornaments.  They had lain close beside
the skull.</p>
<p>With the point of his cutlass Snider scraped the

<pb n="28"/>
dirt and verdigris from the face of the larger ornament.</p>
<p>"An inscription," he said, and handed the thing to
me.</p>
<p>They were the spike and ornaments of an ancient
German helmet.  Before long we had uncovered many
other indications that a great battle had been fought
upon the ground where we stood.  But I was then, and
still am, at loss to account for the presence of German
soldiers upon the English coast so far from London,
which history suggests would have been the natural goal
of an invader.</p>
<p>I can only account for it by assuming that either
England was temporarily conquered by the Teutons, or that
an invasion of so vast proportions was undertaken that
German troops were hurled upon the England coast in
huge numbers and that landings were necessarily effected
at many places simultaneously.  Subsequent discoveries
tend to strengthen this view.</p>
<p>We dug about for a short time with our cutlasses until
I became convinced that a city had stood upon the spot
at some time in the past, and that beneath our feet,
crumbled and dead, lay ancient Devonport.</p>
<p>I could not repress a sigh at the thought of the havoc
war had wrought in this part of England, at least.
Farther east, nearer London, we should find things very
different.  There would be the civilization that two
centuries must have wrought upon our English cousins as
they had upon us.  There would be mighty cities,
cultivated fields, happy people.  There we would be
welcomed as long-lost brothers.  There would we find a
great nation anxious to learn of the world beyond their
side of thirty, as I had been anxious to learn of that
which lay beyond our side of the dead line.</p>
<p>I turned back toward the boat.</p>

<pb n="29"/>
<p>"Come, men!" I said.  "We will go up the river and
fill our casks with fresh water, search for food and fuel,
and then tomorrow be in readiness to push on toward
the east.  I am going to London."</p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="3" id="d5"><pb n="30"/>
<p>THE REPORT OF A GUN BLASTED THE SILENCE
of a dead Devonport with startling abruptness.</p>
<p>It came from the direction of the launch, and in an
instant we three were running for the boat as fast as our
legs would carry us.  As we came in sight of it we saw
Delcarte a hundred yards inland from the launch,
leaning over something which lay upon the ground.  As we
called to him he waved his cap, and stooping, lifted a
small deer for our inspection.</p>
<p>I was about to congratulate him on his trophy when
we were startled by a horrid, half-human, half-bestial
scream a little ahead and to the right of us.  It seemed
to come from a clump of rank and tangled bush not far
from where Delcarte stood.  It was a horrid, fearsome
sound, the like of which never had fallen upon my ears
before.</p>
<p>We looked in the direction from which it came.  The
smile had died from Delcarte's lips.  Even at the
distance we were from him I saw his face go suddenly
white, and he quickly threw his rifle to his shoulder.  At
the same moment the thing that had given tongue to the
cry moved from the concealing brushwood far enough
for us, too, to see it.</p>
<p>Both Taylor and Snider gave little gasps of
astonishment and dismay.</p>

<pb n="31"/>
<p>"What is it, sir?" asked the latter.</p>
<p>The creature stood about the height of a tall man's
waist, and was long and gaunt and sinuous, with a
tawny coat striped with black, and with white throat
and belly.  In conformation it was similar to a cat &mdash; a
huge cat, exaggerated colossal cat, with fiendish eyes
and the most devilish cast of countenance, as it wrinkled
its bristling snout and bared its great yellow fangs.</p>
<p>It was pacing, or rather, slinking, straight for
Delcarte, who had now leveled his rifle upon it.</p>
<p>"What is it, sir?" mumbled Snider again, and then
a half-forgotten picture from an old natural history
sprang to my mind, and I recognized in the frightful
beast the <hi rend="italic">Felis tigris</hi> of ancient Asia, specimens
of which had, in former centuries, been exhibited in the
Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Snider and Taylor were armed with rifles and
revolvers, while I carried only a revolver.  Seizing Snider's
rifle
from his trembling hands, I called to Taylor to follow
me, and together we ran forward, shouting, to attract
the beast's attention from Delcarte until we should all
be quite close enough to attack with the greatest
assurance of success.</p>
<p>I cried to Delcarte not to fire until we reached his
side, for I was fearful lest our small caliber,
steel-jacketed bullets should, far from killing the beast,
tend merely to enrage it still further.  But he misunderstood
me, thinking that I had ordered him to fire.</p>
<p>With the report of his rifle the tiger stopped short in
apparent surprise, then turned and bit savagely at its
shoulder for an instant, after which it wheeled again
toward Delcarte, issuing the most terrific roars and
screams, and launched itself, with incredible speed,
toward the brave fellow, who now stood his ground

<pb n="32"/>
pumping bullets from his automatic rifle as rapidly as
the weapon would fire.</p>
<p>Taylor and I also opened up on the creature, and as
it was broadside to us it offered a splendid target, though
for all the impression we appeared to make upon the
great cat we might as well have been launching soap
bubbles at it.</p>
<p>Straight as a torpedo it rushed for Delcarte, and, as
Taylor and I stumbled on through the tall grass toward
our unfortunate comrade, we saw the tiger rear upon
him and crush him to the earth.</p>
<p>Not a backward step had the noble Delcarte taken.
Two hundred years of peace had not sapped the red
blood from his courageous line.  He went down beneath
that avalanche of bestial savagery still working his gun
and with his face toward his antagonist.  Even in the
instant that I thought him dead I could not help but feel
a thrill of pride that he was one of my men, one of my
class, a Pan-American gentleman of birth.  And that he
had demonstrated one of the principal contentions of
the army-and-navy adherents &mdash; that military training was
necessary for the salvation of personal courage in the
Pan-American race which for generations had had to
face no dangers more grave than those incident to
ordinary life in a highly civilized community, safeguarded
by every means at the disposal of a perfectly organized
and all-powerful government utilizing the best that
advanced science could suggest.</p>
<p>As we ran toward Delcarte, both Taylor and I were
struck by the fact that the beast upon him appeared not
to be mauling him, but lay quiet and motionless upon
its prey, and when we were quite close, and the muzzles
of our guns were at the animal's head, I saw the
explanation of this sudden cessation of hostilities &mdash;
<hi rend="italic">Felis tigris</hi> was dead.</p>

<pb n="33"/>
<p>One of our bullets, or one of the last that Delcarte
fired, had penetrated the heart, and the beast had died
even as it sprawled forward crushing Delcarte to the
ground.</p>
<p>A moment later, with our assistance, the man had
scrambled from beneath the carcass of his would-be
slayer, without a scratch to indicate how close to death
he had been.</p>
<p>Delcarte's buoyance was entirely unruffled.  He came
from under the tiger with a broad grin on his handsome
face, nor could I perceive that a muscle trembled or
that his voice showed the least indication of
nervousness or excitement.</p>
<p>With the termination of the adventure, we began to
speculate upon the explanation of the presence of this
savage brute at large so great a distance from its native
habitat.  My readings had taught me that it was
practically unknown outside of Asia, and that, so late as
the twentieth century, at least, there had been no savage
beasts outside captivity in England.</p>
<p>As we talked, Snider joined us, and I returned his
rifle to him.  Taylor and Delcarte picked up the slain
deer, and we all started down toward the launch, walking
slowly.  Delcarte wanted to fetch the tiger's skin, but
I had to deny him permission, since we had no means
to properly cure it.</p>
<p>Upon the beach, we skinned the deer and cut away
as much meat as we thought we could dispose of, and
as we were again embarking to continue up the river
for fresh water and fuel, we were startled by a series of
screams from the bushes a short distance away.</p>
<p>"Another <hi rend="italic">Felis tigris</hi>," said Taylor.</p>
<p>"Or a dozen of them," supplemented Delcarte, and,
even as he spoke, there leaped into sight, one after

<pb n="34"/>
another, eight of the beasts, full grown &mdash; magnificent
specimens.</p>
<p>At the sight of us, they came charging down like
infuriated demons.  I saw that three rifles would be no
match for them, and so I gave the word to put out from
shore, hoping that the "tiger," as the ancients called
him, could not swim.</p>
<p>Sure enough, they all halted at the beach, pacing back
and forth, uttering fiendish cries, and glaring at us in
the most malevolent manner.</p>
<p>As we motored away, we presently heard the calls of
similar animals far inland.  They seemed to be answering
the cries of their fellows at the water's edge, and
from the wide distribution and great volume of the
sound we came to the conclusion that enormous numbers
of these beasts must roam the adjacent country.</p>
<p>"They have eaten up the inhabitants," murmured
Snider, shuddering.</p>
<p>"I imagine you are right," I agreed, "for their
extreme boldness and fearlessness in the presence of man
would suggest either that man is entirely unknown to
them, or that they are extremely familiar with him as
their natural and most easily procured prey."</p>
<p>"But where did they come from?" asked Delcarte.
"Could they have traveled here from Asia?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.  The thing was a puzzle to me.  I
knew that it was practically beyond reason to imagine
that tigers had crossed the mountain ranges and rivers
and all the great continent of Europe to travel this far
from their native lairs, and entirely impossible that they
should have crossed the English Channel at all.  Yet here
they were, and in great numbers.</p>
<p>We continued up the Tamar several miles, filled our
casks, and then landed to cook some of our deer steak,
and have the first square meal that had fallen to our lot

<pb n="35"/>
since the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> deserted us.  But scarce had we
built our fire and prepared the meat for cooking than Snider,
whose eyes had been constantly roving about the landscape
from the moment that we left the launch, touched
me on the arm and pointed to a clump of bushes which
grew a couple of hundred yards away.</p>
<p>Half concealed behind their screening foliage I saw
the yellow and black of a big tiger, and, as I looked,
the beast stalked majestically toward us.  A moment
later, he was followed by another and another, and it is
needless to state that we beat a hasty retreat to the
launch.</p>
<p>The country was apparently infested by these huge
Carnivora, for after three other attempts to land and
cook our food we were forced to abandon the idea
entirely, as each time we were driven off by hunting
tigers.</p>
<p>It was also equally impossible to obtain the necessary
ingredients for our chemical fuel, and, as we had very
little left aboard, we determined to step our folding mast
and proceed under sail, hoarding our fuel supply for
use in emergencies.</p>
<p>I may say that it was with no regret that we bid adieu
to Tigerland, as we rechristened the ancient Devon, and,
beating out into the Channel, turned the launch's nose
southeast, to round Bolt Head and continue up the coast
toward the Strait of Dover and the North Sea.</p>
<p>I was determined to reach London as soon as possible,
that we might obtain fresh clothing, meet with cultured
people, and learn from the lips of Englishmen the
secrets of the two centuries since the East had been
divorced from the West.</p>
<p>Our first stopping place was the Isle of Wight.  We
entered the Solent about ten o'clock one morning, and
I must confess that my heart sank as we came close to
shore.  No lighthouse was visible, though one was plainly

<pb n="36"/>
indicated upon my map.  Upon neither shore was sign
of human habitation.  We skirted the northern shore of
the island in fruitless search for man, and then at last
landed upon an eastern point, where Newport should
have stood, but where only weeds and great trees and
tangled wild wood rioted, and not a single manmade
thing was visible to the eye.</p>
<p>Before landing, I had the men substitute soft bullets
for the steel-jacketed projectiles with which their belts
and magazines were filled.  Thus equipped, we felt upon
more even terms with the tigers, but there was no sign
of the tigers, and I decided that they must be confined
to the mainland.</p>
<p>After eating, we set out in search of fuel, leaving
Taylor to guard the launch.  For some reason I could not
trust Snider alone.  I knew that he looked with
disapproval upon my plan to visit England, and I did not
know but what at his first opportunity, he might desert
us, taking the launch with him, and attempt to return
to Pan-America.</p>
<p>That he would be fool enough to venture it, I did not
doubt.</p>
<p>We had gone inland for a mile or more, and were
passing through a park-like wood, when we came suddenly
upon the first human beings we had seen since
we sighted the English coast.</p>
<p>There were a score of men in the party.  Hairy,
half-naked men they were, resting in the shade of a great
tree.  At the first sight of us they sprang to their feet
with wild yells, seizing long spears that had lain beside
them as they rested.</p>
<p>For a matter of fifty yards they ran from us as rapidly
as they could, and then they turned and surveyed us for
a moment.  Evidently emboldened by the scarcity of our

<pb n="37"/>
numbers, they commenced to advance upon us, brandishing
their spears and shouting horribly.</p>
<p>They were short and muscular of build, with long
hair and beards tangled and matted with filth.  Their
heads, however, were shapely, and their eyes, though
fierce and warlike, were intelligent.</p>
<p>Appreciation of these physical attributes came later,
of course, when I had better opportunity to study the
men at close range and under circumstances less fraught
with danger and excitement.  At the moment I saw, and
with unmixed wonder, only a score of wild savages
charging down upon us, where I had expected to find a
community of civilized and enlightened people.</p>
<p>Each of us was armed with rifle, revolver, and cutlass,
but as we stood shoulder to shoulder facing the wild
men I was loath to give the command to fire upon them,
inflicting death or suffering upon strangers with whom
we had no quarrel, and so I attempted to restrain them
for the moment that we might parley with them.</p>
<p>To this end I raised my left hand above my head with
the palm toward them as the most natural gesture
indicative of peaceful intentions which occurred to me.
At the same time I called aloud to them that we were
friends, though, from their appearance, there was
nothing to indicate that they might understand
Pan-American, or ancient English, which are of course
practically identical.</p>
<p>At my gesture and words they ceased their shouting
and came to a halt a few paces from us.  Then, in deep
tones, one who was in advance of the others and whom
I took to be the chief or leader of the party replied in a
tongue which while intelligible to us, was so distorted
from the English language from which it evidently had
sprung, that it was with difficulty that we interpreted it.</p>

<pb n="38"/>
<p>"Who are you," he asked, "and from what country?"</p>
<p>I told him that we were from Pan-America, but he
only shook his head and asked where that was.  He had
never heard of it, or of the Atlantic Ocean which I told
him separated his country from mine.</p>
<p>"It has been two hundred years," I told him, "since
a Pan-American visited England."</p>
<p>"England?" he asked.  "What is England?"</p>
<p>"Why this is a part of England!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"This is Grubitten," he assured me.  "I know nothing
about England, and I have lived here all my life."</p>
<p>It was not until long after that the derivation of
Grubitten occurred to me.  Unquestionably it is a corruption
of Great Britain, a name formerly given to the large
island comprising England, Scotland and Wales.
Subsequently we heard it pronounced Grabrittin and
Grubritten.</p>
<p>I then asked the fellow if he could direct us to Ryde
or Newport; but again he shook his head, and said that
he never had heard of such countries.  And when I asked
him if there were any cities in this country he did not
know what I meant, never having heard the word cities.</p>
<p>I explained my meaning as best I could by stating
that by city I referred to a place where many people
lived together in houses.</p>
<p>"Oh," he exclaimed, "you mean a camp!  Yes, there
are two great camps here, East Camp and West Camp.
We are from East Camp."</p>
<p>The use of the word camp to describe a collection of
habitations naturally suggested war to me, and my next
question was as to whether the war was over, and who
had been victorious.</p>
<p>"No," he replied to this question.  "The war is not
yet over.  But it soon will be, and it will end, as it always

<pb n="39"/>
does, with the Westenders running away.  We, the
Eastenders, are always victorious."</p>
<p>"No," I said, seeing that he referred to the petty
tribal wars of his little island, "I mean the Great War,
the war with Germany.  Is it ended &mdash; and who was
victorious?"</p>
<p>He shook his head impatiently.</p>
<p>"I never heard," he said, "of any of these strange
countries of which you speak."</p>
<p>It seemed incredible, and yet it was true.  These
people living at the very seat of the Great War knew
nothing of it, though but two centuries had passed since, to
our knowledge, it had been running in the height of its
titanic frightfulness all about them, and to us upon the
far side of the Atlantic still was a subject of keen
interest.</p>
<p>Here was a lifelong inhabitant of the Isle of Wight
who never had heard of either Germany or England!  I
turned to him quite suddenly with a new question.</p>
<p>"What people live upon the mainland?" I asked, and
pointed in the direction of the Hants coast.</p>
<p>"No one lives there," he replied.</p>
<p>"Long ago, it is said, my people dwelt across the
waters upon that other land; but the wild beasts
devoured them in such numbers that finally they were
driven here, paddling across upon logs and driftwood,
nor has any dared return since, because of the frightful
creatures which dwell in that horrid country."</p>
<p>"Do no other peoples ever come to your country in
ships?" I asked.</p>
<p>He never heard the word ship before, and did not
know its meaning.  But he assured me that until we came
he had thought that there were no other peoples in the
world other than the Grubittens, who consist of the

<pb n="40"/>
Eastenders and the Westenders of the ancient Isle of
Wight.</p>
<p>Assured that we were inclined to friendliness, our
new acquaintances led us to their village, or, as they
call it, camp.  There we found a thousand people,
perhaps, dwelling in rude shelters, and living upon the
fruits of the chase and such sea food as is obtainable
close to shore, for they had no boats, nor any knowledge
of such things.</p>
<p>Their weapons were most primitive, consisting of
rude spears tipped with pieces of metal pounded
roughly into shape.  They had no literature, no religion,
and recognized no law other than the law of might.
They produced fire by striking a bit of flint and steel
together, but for the most part they ate their food raw.
Marriage is unknown among them, and while they have
the word, mother, they did not know what I meant by
"father."  The males fight for the favor of the females.
They practice infanticide, and kill the aged and
physically unfit.</p>
<p>The family consists of the mother and the children,
the men dwelling sometimes in one hut and sometimes
in another.  Owing to their bloody duels, they are always
numerically inferior to the women, so there is shelter
for them all.</p>
<p>We spent several hours in the village, where we were
objects of the greatest curiosity.  The inhabitants
examined our clothing and all our belongings, and asked
innumerable questions concerning the strange country
from which we had come and the manner of our coming.</p>
<p>I questioned many of them concerning past historical
events, but they knew nothing beyond the narrow limits
of their island and the savage, primitive life they led
there.  London they had never heard of, and they assured

<pb n="41"/>
me that I would find no human beings upon the mainland.</p>
<p>Much saddened by what I had seen, I took my departure
from them, and the three of us made our way
back to the launch, accompanied by about five hundred
men, women, girls, and boys.</p>
<p>As we sailed away, after procuring the necessary
ingredients of our chemical fuel, the Grubittens lined the
shore in silent wonder at the strange sight of our dainty
craft dancing over the sparkling waters, and watched us
until we were lost to their sight.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="d6"><pb n="42"/>
<p>IT WAS DURING THE MORNING OF JULY 6, 2137,
that we entered the mouth of the Thames &mdash; to the best
of my knowledge the first Western keel to cut those
historic waters for two hundred and twenty-one years!</p>
<p>But where were the tugs and the lighters and the
barges, the lightships and the buoys, and all those
countless attributes which went to make up the myriad
life of the ancient Thames?</p>
<p>Gone!  All gone!  Only silence and desolation reigned
where once the commerce of the world had centered.</p>
<p>I could not help but compare this once great
waterway with the waters about our New York, or Rio, or
San Diego, or Valparaiso.  They had become what they
are today during the two centuries of the profound peace
which we of the navy have been prone to deplore.  And
what, during this same period, had shorn the waters of
the Thames of their pristine grandeur?</p>
<p>Militarist that I am, I could find but a single word of
explanation &mdash; war!</p>
<p>I bowed my head and turned my eyes downward from
the lonely and depressing sight, and in a silence which
none of us seemed willing to break, we proceeded up
the deserted river.</p>
<p>We had reached a point which, from my map, I imagined
must have been about the former site of Erith,

<pb n="43"/>
when I discovered a small band of antelope a short
distance inland.  As we were now entirely out of meat once
more, and as I had given up all expectations of finding
a city upon the site of ancient London, I determined to
land and bag a couple of the animals.</p>
<p>Assured that they would be timid and easily frightened,
I decided to stalk them alone, telling the men to
wait at the boat until I called to them to come and carry
the carcasses back to the shore.</p>
<p>Crawling carefully through the vegetation, making use
of such trees and bushes as afforded shelter, I came at
last almost within easy range of my quarry, when the
antlered head of the buck went suddenly into the air,
and then, as though in accordance with a prearranged
signal, the whole band moved slowly off, farther inland.</p>
<p>As their pace was leisurely, I determined to follow them
until I came again within range, as I was sure that they
would stop and feed in a short time.</p>
<p>They must have led me a mile or more at least before
they again halted and commenced to browse upon the
rank, luxuriant grasses.  All the time that I had followed
them I had kept both eyes and ears alert for sign or
sound that would indicate the presence of <hi rend="italic">Felis tigris</hi>;
but so far not the slightest indication of the beast had
been apparent.</p>
<p>As I crept closer to the antelope, sure this time of a
good shot at a large buck, I suddenly saw something
that caused me to forget all about my prey in wonderment.</p>
<p>It was the figure of an immense grey-black creature,
rearing its colossal shoulders twelve or fourteen feet
above the ground.  Never in my life had I seen such a
beast, nor did I at first recognize it, so different in
appearance

<pb n="44"/>
is the live reality from the stuffed, unnatural
specimens preserved to us in our museums.</p>
<p>But presently I guessed the identity of the mighty
creature as <hi rend="italic">Elephas africanus</hi>, or, as the ancients
commonly described it, African elephant.</p>
<p>The antelope, although in plain view of the huge
beast, paid not the slightest attention to it, and I was
so wrapped up in watching the mighty pachyderm that
I quite forgot to shoot at the buck and presently, and in
quite a startling manner, it became impossible to do so.</p>
<p>The elephant was browsing upon the young and
tender shoots of some low bushes, waving his great ears
and switching his short tail.  The antelope, scarce twenty
paces from him, continued their feeding, when suddenly,
from close beside the latter, there came a most
terrifying roar, and I saw a great, tawny body shoot,
from the concealing verdure beyond the antelope, full
upon the back of a small buck.</p>
<p>Instantly the scene changed from one of quiet and
peace to indescribable chaos.  The startled and terrified
buck uttered cries of agony.  His fellows broke and
leaped off in all directions.  The elephant raised his
trunk, and, trumpeting loudly, lumbered off through
the wood, crushing down small trees and trampling
bushes in his mad flight.</p>
<p>Growling horribly, a huge lion stood across the body
of his prey &mdash; such a creature as no Pan-American of the
twenty-second century had ever beheld until my eyes
rested upon this lordly specimen of "the king of
beasts."  But what a different creature was this
fierce-eyed demon, palpitating with life and vigor, glossy
of coat, alert, growling, magnificent, from the dingy,
moth-eaten replicas beneath their glass cases in the
stuffy halls of our public museums.</p>
<p>I had never hoped or expected to see a living lion,

<pb n="45"/>
tiger, or elephant &mdash; using the common terms that were
familiar to the ancients, since they seem to me less
unwieldy than those now in general use among us &mdash; and
so it was with sentiments not unmixed with awe that I
stood gazing at this regal beast as, above the carcass of
his kill, he roared out his challenge to the world.</p>
<p>So enthralled was I by the spectacle that I quite forgot
myself, and the better to view him, the great lion, I had
risen to my feet and stood, not fifty paces from him, in
full view.</p>
<p>For a moment he did not see me, his attention being
directed toward the retreating elephant, and I had ample
time to feast my eyes upon his splendid proportions,
his great head, and his thick black mane.</p>
<p>Ah, what thoughts passed through my mind in those
brief moments as I stood there in rapt fascination!  I had
come to find a wondrous civilization, and instead I
found a wild-beast monarch of the realm where English
kings had ruled.  A lion reigned, undisturbed, within a
few miles of the seat of one of the greatest governments
the world has ever known, his domain a howling wilderness,
where yesterday fell the shadows of the largest
city in the world.</p>
<p>It was appalling; but my reflections upon this
depressing subject were doomed to sudden extinction.  The
lion had discovered me.</p>
<p>For an instant he stood silent and motionless as one
of the mangy effigies at home, but only for an instant.
Then, with a most ferocious roar, and without the
slightest hesitancy or warning, he charged upon me.</p>
<p>He forsook the prey already dead beneath him for the
pleasures of the delectable tidbit, man.  From the
remorselessness with which the great Carnivora of
modern England hunted man, I am constrained to believe

<pb n="46"/>
that, whatever their appetites in times past, they have
cultivated a gruesome taste for human flesh.</p>
<p>As I threw my rifle to my shoulder, I thanked God,
the ancient God of my ancestors, that I had replaced
the hard-jacketed bullets in my weapon with soft-nosed
projectiles, for though this was my first experience with
<hi rend="italic">Felis leo</hi>, I knew the moment that I faced that charge
that even my wonderfully perfected firearm would be
as futile as a peashooter unless I chanced to place my
first bullet in a vital spot.</p>
<p>Unless you had seen it you could not believe credible
the speed of a charging lion.  Apparently the animal is
not built for speed, nor can he maintain it for long.  But
for a matter of forty or fifty yards there is, I believe,
no animal on earth that can overtake him.</p>
<p>Like a bolt he bore down upon me, but, fortunately
for me, I did not lose my head.  I guessed that no bullet
would kill him instantly.  I doubted that I could pierce
his skull.  There was hope, though, in finding his heart
through his exposed chest, or, better yet, of breaking
his shoulder or foreleg, and bringing him up long
enough to pump more bullets into him and finish him.</p>
<p>I covered his left shoulder and pulled the trigger as
he was almost upon me.  It stopped him.  With a terrific
howl of pain and rage, the brute rolled over and over
upon the ground almost to my feet.  As he came I
pumped two more bullets into him, and as he struggled
to rise, clawing viciously at me, I put a bullet in his
spine.</p>
<p>That finished him, and I am free to admit that I was
mighty glad of it.  There was a great tree close behind
me, and, stepping within its shade, I leaned against it,
wiping the perspiration from my face, for the day was
hot, and the exertion and excitement left me exhausted.</p>
<p>I stood there, resting, for a moment, preparatory to

<pb n="47"/>
turning and retracing my steps to the launch, when,
without warning, something whizzed through space
straight toward me.  There was a dull thud of impact as
it struck the tree, and as I dodged to one side and turned
to look at the thing I saw a heavy spear imbedded in
the wood not three inches from where my head had
been.</p>
<p>The thing had come from a little to one side of me,
and, without waiting to investigate at the instant, I
leaped behind the tree, and, circling it, peered around
the other side to get a sight of my would-be murderer.</p>
<p>This time I was pitted against men &mdash; the spear told
me that all too plainly &mdash; but so long as they didn't take
me unawares or from behind I had little fear of them.</p>
<p>Cautiously I edged about the far side of the trees until
I could obtain a view of the spot from which the spear
must have come, and when I did I saw the head of a
man just emerging from behind a bush.</p>
<p>The fellow was quite similar in type to those I had
seen upon the Isle of Wight.  He was hairy and
unkempt, and as he finally stepped into view I saw that
he was garbed in the same primitive fashion.</p>
<p>He stood for a moment gazing about in search of me,
and then he advanced.  As he did so a number of others,
precisely like him, stepped from the concealing verdure
of nearby bushes and followed in his wake.  Keeping the
trees between them and me, I ran back a short distance
until I found a clump of underbrush that would
effectually conceal me, for I wished to discover the
strength of the party and its armament before attempting
to parley with it.</p>
<p>The useless destruction of any of these poor creatures
was the farthest idea from my mind.  I should have liked
to have spoken with them, but I did not care to risk

<pb n="48"/>
having to use my high-powered rifle upon them other
than in the last extremity.</p>
<p>Once in my new place of concealment, I watched
them as they approached the tree.  There were about
thirty men in the party and one woman &mdash; a girl whose
hands seemed to be bound behind her and who was
being pulled along by two of the men.</p>
<p>They came forward warily, peering cautiously into
every bush and halting often.  At the body of the lion,
they paused, and I could see from their gesticulations
and the higher pitch of their voices that they were much
excited over my kill.</p>
<p>But presently they resumed their search for me, and
as they advanced I became suddenly aware of the
unnecessary brutality with which the girl's guards were
treating her.  She stumbled once, not far from my place
of concealment, and after the balance of the party had
passed me.  As she did so one of the men at her side
jerked her roughly to her feet and struck her across the
mouth with his fist.</p>
<p>Instantly my blood boiled, and forgetting every
consideration of caution, I leaped from my concealment,
and, springing to the man's side, felled him with a blow.</p>
<p>So unexpected had been my act that it found him and
his fellow unprepared; but instantly the latter drew the
knife that protruded from his belt and lunged viciously
at me, at the same time giving voice to a wild cry of
alarm.</p>
<p>The girl shrank back at sight of me, her eyes wide in
astonishment, and then my antagonist was upon me.  I
parried his first blow with my forearm, at the same time
delivering a powerful blow to his jaw that sent him
reeling back; but he was at me again in an instant, though
in the brief interim I had time to draw my revolver.</p>
<p>I saw his companion crawling slowly to his feet, and

<pb n="49"/>
the others of the party racing down upon me.  There
was no time to argue now, other than with the weapons
we wore, and so, as the fellow lunged at me again with
the wicked-looking knife, I covered his heart and pulled
the trigger.</p>
<p>Without a sound, he slipped to the earth, and then I
turned the weapon upon the other guard, who was now
about to attack me.  He, too, collapsed, and I was alone
with the astonished girl.</p>
<p>The balance of the party was some twenty paces from
us, but coming rapidly.  I seized her arm and drew her
after me behind a nearby tree, for I had seen that with
both their comrades down the others were preparing to
launch their spears.</p>
<p>With the girl safe behind the tree, I stepped out in
sight of the advancing foe, shouting to them that I was
no enemy, and that they should halt and listen to me.
But for answer they only yelled in derision and launched
a couple of spears at me, both of which missed.</p>
<p>I saw then that I must fight, yet still I hated to slay
them, and it was only as a final resort that I dropped
two of them with my rifle, bringing the others to a
temporary halt.  Again, I appealed to them to desist.  But
they only mistook my solicitude for them for fear, and,
with shouts of rage and derision, leaped forward once
again to overwhelm me.</p>
<p>It was now quite evident that I must punish them
severely, or &mdash; myself &mdash; die and relinquish the girl once
more to her captors.  Neither of these things had I the
slightest notion of doing, and so I again stepped from
behind the tree, and, with all the care and deliberation
of target practice, I commenced picking off the
foremost of my assailants.</p>
<p>One by one the wild men dropped, yet on came the
others, fierce and vengeful, until, only a few remaining,

<pb n="50"/>
these seemed to realize the futility of combating my
modern weapon with their primitive spears, and, still
howling wrathfully, withdrew toward the west.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, I had an opportunity to turn
my attention toward the girl, who had stood, silent and
motionless, behind me as I pumped death into my
enemies and hers from my automatic rifle.</p>
<p>She was of medium height, well formed, and with
fine, clear-cut features.  Her forehead was high, and her
eyes both intelligent and beautiful.  Exposure to the sun
had browned a smooth and velvety skin to a shade which
seemed to enhance rather than mar an altogether lovely
picture of youthful femininity.</p>
<p>A trace of apprehension marked her expression &mdash; I
cannot call it fear since I have learned to know her &mdash;
and astonishment was still apparent in her eyes.  She
stood quite erect, her hands still bound behind her, and
met my gaze with level, proud return.</p>
<p>"What language do you speak?" I asked.  "Do you
understand mine?"</p>
<p>"Yes," she replied.  "It is similar to my own.  I am
Grabritin.  What are you?"</p>
<p>"I am a Pan-American," I answered.  She shook her
head.  "What is that?"</p>
<p>I pointed toward the west.  "Far away, across the
ocean."</p>
<p>Her expression altered a trifle.  A slight frown
contracted her brow.  The expression of apprehension
deepened.</p>
<p>"Take off your cap," she said, and when, to humor
her strange request, I did as she bid, she appeared
relieved.  Then she edged to one side and leaned over
seemingly to peer behind me.  I turned quickly to see
what she discovered, but finding nothing, wheeled about
to see that her expression was once more altered.</p>

<pb n="51"/>
<p>"You are not from there?" and she pointed toward
the east.  It was a half question.  "You are not from
across the water there?"</p>
<p>"No," I assured her.  "I am from Pan-America, far
away to the west.  Have you ever heard of Pan-America?"</p>
<p>She shook her head in negation.  "I do not care where
you are from," she explained, "if you are not from
there, and I am sure you are not, for the men from there
have horns and tails."</p>
<p>It was with difficulty that I restrained a smile.</p>
<p>"Who are the men from there?" I asked.</p>
<p>"They are bad men," she replied.  "Some of my
people do not believe that there are such creatures.  But
we have a legend &mdash; a very old, old legend, that once the
men from there came across to Grabritin.  They came
upon the water, and under the water, and even in the
air.  They came in great numbers, so that they rolled
across the land like a great gray fog.  They brought with
them thunder and lightning and smoke that killed, and
they fell upon us and slew our people by the thousands
and the hundreds of thousands.  But at last we drove
them back to the water's edge, back into the sea, where
many were drowned.  Some escaped, and these our
people followed &mdash; men, women, and even children, we
followed them back.  That is all.  The legend says our
people never returned.  Maybe they were all killed.
Maybe they are still there.  But this, also, is in the
legend, that as we drove the men back across the water
they swore that they would return, and that when they
left our shores they would leave no human being alive
behind them.  I was afraid that you were from there."</p>
<p>"By what name were these men called?" I asked.</p>
<p>"We call them only the 'men from there,'" she replied,

<pb n="52"/>
pointing toward the east.  "I have never heard that
they had another name."</p>
<p>In the light of what I knew of ancient history, it was
not difficult for me to guess the nationality of those she
described simply as "the men from over there."  But
what utter and appalling devastation the Great War must
have wrought to have erased not only every sign of
civilization from the face of this great land, but even the
name of the enemy from the knowledge and language
of the people.</p>
<p>I could only account for it on the hypothesis that the
country had been entirely depopulated except for a few
scattered and forgotten children, who, in some marvelous
manner, had been preserved by Providence to repopulate
the land.  These children had, doubtless, been
too young to retain in their memories to transmit to
their children any but the vaguest suggestion of the
cataclysm which had overwhelmed their parents.</p>
<p>Professor Cortoran, since my return to Pan-America,
has suggested another theory which is not entirely
without claim to serious consideration.  He points out that
it is quite beyond the pale of human instinct to desert little
children as my theory suggests the ancient English must
have done.  He is more inclined to believe that the
expulsion of the foe from England was synchronous with
widespread victories by the allies upon the continent,
and that the people of England merely emigrated from
their ruined cities and their devastated, blood-drenched
fields to the mainland, in the hope of finding, in the
domain of the conquered enemy, cities and farms which
would replace those they had lost.</p>
<p>The learned professor assumes that while a
long-continued war had strengthened rather than weakened
the instinct of paternal devotion, it had also dulled other
humanitarian instincts, and raised to the first magnitude

<pb n="53"/>
the law of the survival of the fittest, with the result that
when the exodus took place the strong, the intelligent,
and the cunning, together with their offspring, crossed
the waters of the Channel or the North Sea to the
continent, leaving in unhappy England only the helpless
inmates of asylums for the feebleminded and insane.</p>
<p>My objections to this, that the present inhabitants of
England are mentally fit, and could therefore not have
descended from an ancestry of undiluted lunacy he
brushes aside with the assertion that insanity is not
necessarily hereditary; and that even though it was, in many
cases a return to natural conditions from the state of
high civilization, which is thought to have induced
mental disease in the ancient world, would, after several
generations, have thoroughly expunged every trace of
the affliction from the brains and nerves of the
descendants of the original maniacs.</p>
<p>Personally, I do not place much stock in Professor
Cortoran's theory, though I admit that I am prejudiced.
Naturally one does not care to believe that the object
of his greatest affection is descended from a gibbering
idiot and a raving maniac.</p>
<p>But I am forgetting the continuity of my narrative &mdash;
a continuity which I desire to maintain, though I fear
that I shall often be led astray, so numerous and varied
are the bypaths of speculation which lead from the present
day story of the Grabritins into the mysterious past
of their forbears.</p>
<p>As I stood talking with the girl I presently recollected
that she still was bound, and with a word of apology, I
drew my knife and cut the rawhide thongs which confined
her wrists at her back.</p>
<p>She thanked me, and with such a sweet smile that I
should have been amply repaid by it for a much more
arduous service.</p>

<pb n="54"/>
<p>"And now," I said, "let me accompany you to your
home and see you safely again under the protection of
your friends."</p>
<p>"No," she said, with a hint of alarm in her voice;
"you must not come with me &mdash; Buckingham will kill
you."</p>
<p>Buckingham.  The name was famous in ancient English
history.  Its survival, with many other illustrious
names, is one of the strongest arguments in refutal of
Professor Cortoran's theory; yet it opens no new doors
to the past, and, on the whole, rather adds to than
dissipates the mystery.</p>
<p>"And who is Buckingham," I asked, "and why
should he wish to kill me?"</p>
<p>"He would think that you had stolen me," she
replied, "and as he wishes me for himself, he will kill
any other whom he thinks desires me.  He killed Wettin
a few days ago.  My mother told me once that Wettin
was my father.  He was king.  Now Buckingham is
king."</p>
<p>Here, evidently, were a people slightly superior to
those of the Isle of Wight.  These must have at least the
rudiments of civilized government since they recognized
one among them as ruler, with the title, king.
Also, they retained the word father.  The girl's
pronunciation, while far from identical with ours, was much
closer than the tortured dialect of the Eastenders of the
Isle of Wight.  The longer I talked with her the more
hopeful I became of finding here, among her people,
some records, or traditions, which might assist in
clearing up the historic enigma of the past two centuries.
I asked her if we were far from the city of London, but
she did not know what I meant.  When I tried to explain,
describing mighty buildings of stone and brick, broad

<pb n="55"/>
avenues, parks, palaces, and countless people, she but
shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>"There is no such place near by," she said.  "Only
the Camp of the Lions has places of stone where the
beasts lair, but there are no people in the Camp of the
Lions.  Who would dare go there!"  And she shuddered.</p>
<p>"The Camp of the Lions," I repeated.  "And where
is that, and what?"</p>
<p>"It is there," she said, pointing up the river toward
the west.  "I have seen it from a great distance, but I
have never been there.  We are much afraid of the lions,
for this is their country, and they are angry that man
has come to live here.</p>
<p>"Far away there," and she pointed toward the
southwest, "is the land of tigers, which is even worse
than this, the land of the lions, for the tigers are more
numerous than the lions and hungrier for human flesh.
There were tigers here long ago, but both the lions and
the men set upon them and drove them off."</p>
<p>"Where did these savage beasts come from?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Oh," she replied, "they have been here always.  It
is their country."</p>
<p>"Do they not kill and eat your people?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Often, when we meet them by accident, and we are
too few to slay them, or when one goes too close to
their camp.  But seldom do they hunt us, for they find
what food they need among the deer and wild cattle,
and, too, we make them gifts, for are we not intruders
in their country?  Really we live upon good terms with
them, though I should not care to meet one were there
not many spears in my party."</p>
<p>"I should like to visit this Camp of the Lions," I
said.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you must not!" cried the girl.  "That would

<pb n="56"/>
be terrible.  They would eat you."  For a moment, then,
she seemed lost in thought, but presently she turned
upon me with: "You must go now, for any minute
Buckingham may come in search of me.  Long since
should they have learned that I am gone from the
camp &mdash; they watch over me very closely &mdash; and they will
set out after me.  Go!  I shall wait here until they come
in search of me."</p>
<p>"No," I told her.  "I'll not leave you alone in a land
infested by lions and other wild beasts.  If you won't let
me go as far as your camp with you, then I'll wait here
until they come in search of you."</p>
<p>"Please go!" she begged.  "You have saved me, and
I would save you, but nothing will save you if
Buckingham gets his hands on you.  He is a bad man.  He
wishes to have me for his woman so that he may be king.
He would kill anyone who befriended me, for fear that I
might become another's."</p>
<p>"Didn't you say that Buckingham is already the
king?" I asked.</p>
<p>"He is.  He took my mother for his woman after he
had killed Wettin.  But my mother will die soon &mdash; she is
very old &mdash; and then the man to whom I belong will become
king."</p>
<p>Finally, after much questioning, I got the thing
through my head.  It appears that the line of descent is
through the women.  A man is merely head of his wife's
family &mdash; that is all.  If she chances to be the oldest
female member of the "royal" house, he is king.  Very
naively the girl explained that there was seldom any
doubt as to whom a child's mother was.</p>
<p>This accounted for the girl's importance in the
community and for Buckingham's anxiety to claim her,
though she told me that she did not wish to become his
woman, for he was a bad man and would make a bad

<pb n="57"/>
king.  But he was powerful, and there was no other man
who dared dispute his wishes.</p>
<p>"Why not come with me," I suggested, "if you do
not wish to become Buckingham's?"</p>
<p>"Where would you take me?" she asked.</p>
<p>Where, indeed!  I had not thought of that.  But before
I could reply to her question she shook her head and
said, "No, I cannot leave my people.  I must stay and
do my best, even if Buckingham gets me, but you must
go at once.  Do not wait until it is too late.  The lions
have had no offering for a long time, and Buckingham
would seize upon the first stranger as a gift to them."</p>
<p>I did not perfectly understand what she meant, and
was about to ask her when a heavy body leaped upon
me from behind, and great arms encircled my neck.  I
struggled to free myself and turn upon my antagonist,
but in another instant I was overwhelmed by a half
dozen powerful, half-naked men, while a score of others
surrounded me, a couple of whom seized the girl.</p>
<p>I fought as best I could for my liberty and for hers,
but the weight of numbers was too great, though I had
the satisfaction at least of giving them a good fight.</p>
<p>When they had overpowered me, and I stood, my
hands bound behind me, at the girl's side, she gazed
commiseratingly at me.</p>
<p>"It is too bad that you did not do as I bid you,"
she said, "for now it has happened just as I feared &mdash;
Buckingham has you."</p>
<p>"Which is Buckingham?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I am Buckingham," growled a burly, unwashed
brute, swaggering truculently before me.  "And who
are you who would have stolen my woman?"</p>
<p>The girl spoke up then and tried to explain that I had
not stolen her; but on the contrary I had saved her from

<pb n="58"/>
the men from the "Elephant Country" who were carrying
her away.</p>
<p>Buckingham only sneered at her explanation, and a
moment later gave the command that started us all off
toward the west.  We marched for a matter of an hour
or so, coming at last to a collection of rude huts,
fashioned from branches of trees covered with skins and
grasses and sometimes plastered with mud.  All about
the camp they had erected a wall of saplings pointed at
the tops and fire hardened.</p>
<p>This palisade was a protection against both man and
beasts, and within it dwelt upward of two thousand
persons, the shelters being built very close together, and
sometimes partially underground, like deep trenches,
with the poles and hides above merely as protection
from the sun and rain.</p>
<p>The older part of the camp consisted almost wholly
of trenches, as though this had been the original form
of dwellings which was slowly giving way to the drier
and airier surface domiciles.  In these trench habitations
I saw a survival of the military trenches which formed
so famous a part of the operation of the warring nations
during the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The women wore a single light deerskin about their
hips, for it was summer, and quite warm.  The men,
too, were clothed in a single garment, usually the pelt
of some beast of prey.  The hair of both men and women
was confined by a rawhide thong passing about the
forehead and tied behind.  In this leathern band were
stuck feathers, flowers, or the tails of small mammals.  All
wore necklaces of the teeth or claws of wild beasts, and
there were numerous metal wristlets and anklets among
them.</p>
<p>They wore, in fact, every indication of a most primitive
people &mdash; a race which had not yet risen to the

<pb n="59"/>
heights of agriculture or even the possession of domestic
animals.  They were hunters &mdash; the lowest plane in the
evolution of the human race of which science takes
cognizance.</p>
<p>And yet as I looked at their well shaped heads, their
handsome features, and their intelligent eyes, it was
difficult to believe that I was not among my own.  It was
only when I took into consideration their mode of living,
their scant apparel, the lack of every least luxury
among them, that I was forced to admit that they were,
in truth, but ignorant savages.</p>
<p>Buckingham had relieved me of my weapons, though
he had not the slightest idea of their purpose or uses,
and when we reached the camp he exhibited both me
and my arms with every indication of pride in this great
capture.</p>
<p>The inhabitants flocked around me, examining my
clothing, and exclaiming in wonderment at each new
discovery of button, buckle, pocket, and flap.  It seemed
incredible that such a thing could be, almost within a
stone's throw of the spot where but a brief two centuries
before had stood the greatest city of the world.</p>
<p>They bound me to a small tree that grew in the middle
of one of their crooked streets, but the girl they
released as soon as we had entered the enclosure.  The
people greeted her with every mark of respect as she
hastened to a large hut near the center of the camp.</p>
<p>Presently she returned with a fine looking,
white-haired woman, who proved to be her mother.  The
older woman carried herself with a regal dignity that
seemed quite remarkable in a place of such primitive
squalor.</p>
<p>The people fell aside as she approached, making a
wide way for her and her daughter.  When they had
come near and stopped before me the older woman
addressed me.</p>

<pb n="60"/>
<p>"My daughter has told me," she said, "of the manner
in which you rescued her from the men of the elephant
country.  If Wettin lived you would be well treated,
but Buckingham has taken me now, and is king.  You
can hope for nothing from such a beast as Buckingham."</p>
<p>The fact that Buckingham stood within a pace of us
and was an interested listener appeared not to temper
her expressions in the slightest.</p>
<p>"Buckingham is a pig," she continued.  "He is a
coward.  He came upon Wettin from behind and ran his
spear through him.  He will not be king for long.  Some
one will make a face at him, and he will run away and
jump into the river."</p>
<p>The people began to titter and clap their hands.
Buckingham became red in the face.  It was evident that he
was far from popular.</p>
<p>"If he dared," went on the old lady, "he would kill
me now, but he does not dare.  He is too great a coward.
If I could help you I should gladly do so.  But I am only
queen &mdash; the vehicle that has helped carry down, unsullied,
the royal blood from the days when Grabritin was
a mighty country."</p>
<p>The old queen's words had a noticeable effect upon
the mob of curious savages which surrounded me.  The moment
they discovered that the old queen was friendly
to me and that I had rescued her daughter they commenced
to accord me a more friendly interest, and I
heard many words spoken in my behalf, and demands
were made that I not be harmed.</p>
<p>But now Buckingham interfered.  He had no intention
of being robbed of his prey.  Blustering and storming,
he ordered the people back to their huts, at the same
time directing two of his warriors to confine me in a
dugout in one of the trenches close to his own shelter.</p>

<pb n="61"/>
<p>Here they threw me upon the ground, binding my
ankles together and trussing them up to my wrists behind.
There they left me, lying upon my stomach &mdash; a
most uncomfortable and strained position, to which was
added the pain where the cords cut into my flesh.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago my mind had been filled with the
anticipation of the friendly welcome I should find
among the cultured Englishmen of London.  Today I
should be sitting in the place of honor at the banquet
board of one of London's most exclusive clubs, feted
and lionized.</p>
<p>The actuality!  Here I lay, bound hand and foot,
doubtless almost upon the very site of a part of ancient
London, yet all about me was a primeval wilderness,
and I was a captive of half-naked wild men.</p>
<p>I wondered what had become of Delcarte and Taylor
and Snider.  Would they search for me?  They could never
find me, I feared, yet if they did, what could they
accomplish against this horde of savage warriors?</p>
<p>Would that I could warn them.  I thought of the girl &mdash;
doubtless she could get word to them, but how was I to
communicate with her?  Would she come to see me before
I was killed?  It seemed incredible that she should
not make some slight attempt to befriend me; yet, as I
recalled, she had made no effort to speak with me after
we had reached the village.  She had hastened to her
mother the moment she had been liberated.  Though she
had returned with the old queen, she had not spoken to
me, even then.  I began to have my doubts.</p>
<p>Finally, I came to the conclusion that I was absolutely
friendless except for the old queen.  For some
unaccountable reason my rage against the girl for her
ingratitude rose to colossal proportions.</p>
<p>For a long time I waited for some one to come to my
prison whom I might ask to bear word to the queen,

<pb n="62"/>
but I seemed to have been forgotten.  The strained
position in which I lay became unbearable.  I wriggled and
twisted until I managed to turn myself partially upon
my side, where I lay half facing the entrance to the
dugout.</p>
<p>Presently my attention was attracted by the shadow
of something moving in the trench without, and a moment
later the figure of a child appeared, creeping upon
all fours, as, wide-eyed, and prompted by childish
curiosity, a little girl crawled to the entrance of my hut
and peered cautiously and fearfully in.</p>
<p>I did not speak at first for fear of frightening the little
one away.  But when I was satisfied that her eyes had
become sufficiently accustomed to the subdued light of
the interior, I smiled.</p>
<p>Instantly the expression of fear faded from her eyes
to be replaced with an answering smile.</p>
<p>"Who are you, little girl?" I asked.</p>
<p>"My name is Mary," she replied.  "I am Victory's
sister."</p>
<p>"And who is Victory?"</p>
<p>"You do not know who Victory is?" she asked, in
astonishment.</p>
<p>I shook my head in negation.</p>
<p>"You saved her from the elephant country people,
and yet you say you do not know her!" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Oh, so she is Victory, and you are her sister!  I have
not heard her name before.  That is why I did not know
whom you meant," I explained.  Here was just the messenger
for me.  Fate was becoming more kind.</p>
<p>"Will you do something for me, Mary?" I asked.</p>
<p>"If I can."</p>
<p>"Go to your mother, the queen, and ask her to come
to me," I said.  "I have a favor to ask."</p>

<pb n="63"/>
<p>She said that she would, and with a parting smile she
left me.</p>
<p>For what seemed many hours I awaited her return,
chafing with impatience.  The afternoon wore on and
night came, and yet no one came near me.  My captors
brought me neither food nor water.  I was suffering
considerable pain where the rawhide thongs cut into my
swollen flesh.  I thought that they had either forgotten
me, or that it was their intention to leave me here to
die of starvation.</p>
<p>Once I heard a great uproar in the village.  Men were
shouting &mdash; women were screaming and moaning.  After
a time this subsided, and again there was a long interval
of silence.</p>
<p>Half the night must have been spent when I heard a
sound in the trench near the hut.  It resembled muffled
sobs.  Presently a figure appeared, silhouetted against
the lesser darkness beyond the doorway.  It crept inside
the hut.</p>
<p>"Are you here?" whispered a childlike voice.</p>
<p>It was Mary!  She had returned.  The thongs no longer
hurt me.  The pangs of hunger and thirst disappeared.  I
realized that it had been loneliness from which I
suffered most.</p>
<p>"Mary!" I exclaimed.  "You are a good girl.  You
have come back, after all.  I had commenced to think
that you would not.  Did you give my message to the
queen?  Will she come?  Where is she?"</p>
<p>The child's sobs increased, and she flung herself upon
the dirt floor of the hut, apparently overcome by grief.</p>
<p>"What is it?" I asked.  "Why do you cry?"</p>
<p>"The queen, my mother, will not come to you," she
said, between sobs.  "She is dead.  Buckingham has
killed her.  Now he will take Victory, for Victory is
queen.  He kept us fastened up in our shelter, for fear

<pb n="64"/>
that Victory would escape him, but I dug a hole beneath
the back wall and got out.  I came to you, because you
saved Victory once before, and I thought that you might
save her again, and me, also.  Tell me that you will."</p>
<p>"I am bound and helpless, Mary," I replied.
"Otherwise I would do what I could to save you and your
sister."</p>
<p>"I will set you free!" cried the girl, creeping up to my
side.  "I will set you free, and then you may come and
slay Buckingham."</p>
<p>"Gladly!" I assented.</p>
<p>"We must hurry," she went on, as she fumbled with
the hard knots in the stiffened rawhide, "for Buckingham
will be after you soon.  He must make an offering
to the lions at dawn before he can take Victory.  The
taking of a queen requires a human offering!"</p>
<p>"And I am to be the offering?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, tugging at a knot.  "Buckingham
has been wanting a sacrifice ever since he killed Wettin,
that he might slay my mother and take Victory."</p>
<p>The thought was horrible, not solely because of the
hideous fate to which I was condemned, but from the
contemplation it engendered of the sad decadence of a
once enlightened race.  To these depths of ignorance,
brutality, and superstition had the vaunted civilization
of twentieth century England been plunged, and by
what?  War!  I felt the structure of our time-honored
militaristic arguments crumbling about me.</p>
<p>Mary labored with the thongs that confined me.  They
proved refractory &mdash; defying her tender, childish fingers.
She assured me, however, that she would release me,
if "they" did not come too soon.</p>
<p>But, alas, they came.  We heard them coming down
the trench, and I bade Mary hide in a corner, lest she
be discovered and punished.  There was naught else she

<pb n="65"/>
could do, and so she crawled away into the Stygian
blackness behind me.</p>
<p>Presently two warriors entered.  The leader exhibited
a unique method of discovering my whereabouts in the
darkness.  He advanced slowly, kicking out viciously
before him.  Finally he kicked me in the face.  Then he
knew where I was.</p>
<p>A moment later I had been jerked roughly to my feet.
One of the fellows stopped and severed the bonds that
held my ankles.  I could scarcely stand alone.  The two
pulled and hauled me through the low doorway and
along the trench.  A party of forty or fifty warriors were
awaiting us at the brink of the excavation some hundred
yards from the hut.</p>
<p>Hands were lowered to us, and we were dragged to
the surface.  Then commenced a long march.  We stumbled
through the underbrush wet with dew, our way
lighted by a score of torchbearers who surrounded us.
But the torches were not to light the way &mdash; that was but
incidental.  They were carried to keep off the huge
Carnivora that moaned and coughed and roared about us.</p>
<p>The noises were hideous.  The whole country seemed
alive with lions.  Yellow-green eyes blazed wickedly at
us from out the surrounding darkness.  My escort carried
long, heavy spears.  These they kept ever pointed
toward the beast of prey, and I learned from snatches
of the conversation I overheard that occasionally there
might be a lion who would brave even the terrors of fire
to leap in upon human prey.  It was for such that the
spears were always couched.</p>
<p>But nothing of the sort occurred during this hideous
death march, and with the first pale heralding of dawn
we reached our goal &mdash; an open place in the midst of a
tangled wildwood.  Here rose in crumbling grandeur the
first evidences I had seen of the ancient civilization

<pb n="66"/>
which once had graced fair Albion &mdash; a single, time-worn
arch of masonry.</p>
<p>"The entrance to the Camp of the Lions!" murmured
one of the party in a voice husky with awe.</p>
<p>Here the party knelt, while Buckingham recited a
weird, prayer-like chant.  It was rather long, and I recall
only a portion of it, which ran, if my memory serves
me, somewhat as follows:</p>

<l><hi rend="italic">           Lord of Grabritin, we</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">           Fall on our knees to thee,</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">           This gift to bring.</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">           Greatest of kings are thou!</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">           To thee we humbly bow!</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">           Peace to our camp allow.</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic">           God save thee, king!</hi></l>

<p>Then the party rose, and dragging me to the
crumbling arch, made me fast to a huge, corroded, copper
ring which was dangling from an eyebolt imbedded in
the masonry.</p>
<p>None of them, not even Buckingham, seemed to feel
any personal animosity toward me.  They were naturally
rough and brutal, as primitive men are supposed to have
been since the dawn of humanity, but they did not go
out of their way to maltreat me.</p>
<p>With the coming of dawn the number of lions about
us seemed to have greatly diminished &mdash; at least they
made less noise &mdash; and as Buckingham and his party
disappeared into the woods, leaving me alone to my
terrible fate, I could hear the grumblings and growlings
of the beasts diminishing with the sound of the chant,
which the party still continued.  It appeared that the
lions had failed to note that I had been left for their

<pb n="67"/>
breakfast, and had followed off after their worshippers
instead.</p>
<p>But I knew the reprieve would be but for a short time,
and though I had no wish to die, I must confess that I
rather wished the ordeal over and the peace of oblivion
upon me.</p>
<p>The voices of the men and the lions receded in the
distance, until finally quiet reigned about me, broken
only by the sweet voices of birds and the sighing of the
summer wind in the trees.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible to believe that in this peaceful
woodland setting the frightful thing was to occur which
must come with the passing of the next lion who
chanced within sight or smell of the crumbling arch.</p>
<p>I strove to tear myself loose from my bonds, but
succeeded only in tightening them about my arms.  Then I
remained passive for a long time, letting the scenes of
my lifetime pass in review before my mind's eye.</p>
<p>I tried to imagine the astonishment, incredulity, and
horror with which my family and friends would be
overwhelmed if, for an instant, space could be annihilated
and they could see me at the gates of London.</p>
<p>The gates of London!  Where was the multitude
hurrying to the marts of trade after a night of pleasure
or rest?  Where was the clang of tramcar gongs, the screech
of motor horns, the vast murmur of a dense throng?</p>
<p>Where were they?  And as I asked the question a lone,
gaunt lion strode from the tangled jungle upon the far
side of the clearing.  Majestically and noiselessly upon
his padded feet the king of beasts moved slowly toward
the gates of London and toward me.</p>
<p>Was I afraid?  I fear that I was almost afraid.  I know
that I thought that fear was coming to me, and so I
straightened up and squared my shoulders and looked
the lion straight in the eyes &mdash; and waited.</p>

<pb n="68"/>
<p>It is not a nice way to die &mdash; alone, with one's hands
fast bound, beneath the fangs and talons of a beast of
prey.  No, it is not a nice way to die, not a pretty way.</p>
<p>The lion was halfway across the clearing when I heard
a slight sound behind me.  The great cat stopped in his
tracks.  He lashed his tail against his sides now, instead
of simply twitching its tip, and his low moan became a
thunderous roar.</p>
<p>As I craned my neck to catch a glimpse of the thing
that had aroused the fury of the beast before me, it
sprang through the arched gateway and was at my side &mdash;
with parted lips and heaving bosom and disheveled
hair &mdash; a bronzed and lovely vision to eyes that had never
harbored hope of rescue.</p>
<p>It was Victory, and in her arms she clutched my rifle
and revolver.  A long knife was in the doeskin belt that
supported the doeskin skirt tightly about her lithe limbs.
She dropped my weapons at my feet, and, snatching
the knife from its resting place, severed the bonds that
held me.  I was free, and the lion was preparing to
charge.</p>
<p>"Run!" I cried to the girl, as I bent and seized my
rifle.  But she only stood there at my side, her bared
blade ready in her hand.</p>
<p>The lion was bounding toward us now in prodigious
leaps.  I raised the rifle and fired.  It was a lucky shot,
for I had no time to aim carefully, and when the beast
crumpled and rolled, lifeless, to the ground, I went
upon my knees and gave thanks to the God of my ancestors.</p>
<p>And, still upon my knees, I turned, and taking the
girl's hand in mine, I kissed it.  She smiled at that, and
laid her other hand upon my head.</p>
<p>"You have strange customs in your country," she
said.</p>

<pb n="69"/>
<p>I could not but smile at that when I thought how
strange it would seem to my countrymen could they but
see me kneeling there on the site of London, kissing
the hand of England's queen.</p>
<p>"And now," I said, as I rose, "you must return to
the safety of your camp.  I will go with you until you
are near enough to continue alone in safety.  Then I shall
try to return to my comrades."</p>
<p>"I will not return to the camp," she replied.</p>
<p>"But what shall you do?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I do not know.  Only I shall never go back while
Buckingham lives.  I should rather die than go back to
him.  Mary came to me, after they had taken you from
the camp, and told me.  I found your strange weapons
and followed with them.  It took me a little longer, for
often I had to hide in the trees that the lions might not
get me, but I came in time, and now you are free to go
back to your friends."</p>
<p>"And leave you here?" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>She nodded, but I could see through all her brave
front that she was frightened at the thought.  I could not
leave her, of course, but what in the world I was to do,
cumbered with the care of a young woman, and a queen
at that, I was at a loss to know.  I pointed out that phase
of it to her, but she only shrugged her shapely shoulders
and pointed to her knife.</p>
<p>It was evident that she felt entirely competent to
protect herself.</p>
<p>As we stood there we heard the sound of voices.  They
were coming from the forest through which we had
passed when we had come from camp.</p>
<p>"They are searching for me," said the girl.  "Where
shall we hide?"</p>
<p>I didn't relish hiding.  But when I thought of the
innumerable dangers which surrounded us and the
comparatively

<pb n="70"/>
small amount of ammunition that I had with
me, I hesitated to provoke a battle with Buckingham
and his warriors when, by flight, I could avoid them
and preserve my cartridges against emergencies which
could not be escaped.</p>
<p>"Would they follow us there?" I asked, pointing
through the archway into the Camp of the Lions.</p>
<p>"Never," she replied, "for, in the first place, they
would know that we would not dare go there, and in
the second they themselves would not dare."</p>
<p>"Then we shall take refuge in the Camp of the Lions,"
I said.</p>
<p>She shuddered and drew closer to me.</p>
<p>"You dare?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Why not?" I returned.  "We shall be safe from
Buckingham, and you have seen, for the second time in
two days, that lions are harmless before my weapons.
Then, too, I can find my friends easiest in this
direction, for the River Thames runs through this place
you call the Camp of the Lions, and it is farther down the
Thames that my friends are awaiting me.  Do you not
dare come with me?"</p>
<p>"I dare follow wherever you lead," she answered
simply.</p>
<p>And so I turned and passed beneath the great arch
into the city of London.</p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="5" id="d7"><pb n="71"/>
<p>AS WE ENTERED DEEPER INTO WHAT HAD
once been the city, the evidences of man's past occupancy
became more frequent.  For a mile from the arch
there was only a riot of weeds and undergrowth and
trees covering small mounds and little hillocks that, I
was sure, were formed of the ruins of stately buildings
of the dead past.</p>
<p>But presently we came upon a district where shattered
walls still raised their crumbling tops in sad silence
above the grass-grown sepulchers of their fallen
fellows.  Softened and mellowed by ancient ivy stood
these sentinels of sorrow, their scarred faces still
revealing the rents and gashes of shrapnel and of bomb.</p>
<p>Contrary to our expectations, we found little indication
that lions in any great numbers laired in this part
of ancient London.  Well-worn pathways, molded by
padded paws, led through the cavernous windows or
doorways of a few of the ruins we passed, and once we
saw the savage face of a great, black-maned lion scowling
down upon us from a shattered stone balcony.</p>
<p>We followed down the bank of the Thames after we
came upon it.  I was anxious to look with my own eyes
upon the famous bridge, and I guessed, too, that the
river would lead me into the part of London where stood
Westminster Abbey and the Tower.</p>

<pb n="72"/>
<p>Realizing that the section through which we had been
passing was doubtless outlying, and therefore not so
built up with large structures as the more centrally
located part of the old town, I felt sure that farther down
the river I should find the ruins larger.  The bridge would
be there in part, at least, and so would remain the walls
of many of the great edifices of the past.  There would
be no such complete ruin of large structures as I had
seen among the smaller buildings.</p>
<p>But when I had come to that part of the city which I
judged to have contained the relics I sought I found
havoc that had been wrought there even greater than
elsewhere.</p>
<p>At one point upon the bosom of the Thames there
rises a few feet above the water a single, disintegrating
mound of masonry.  Opposite it, upon either bank of
the river, are tumbled piles of ruins overgrown with
vegetation.</p>
<p>These, I am forced to believe, are all that remain of
London Bridge, for nowhere else along the river is there
any other slightest sign of pier or abutment.</p>
<p>Rounding the base of a large pile of grass-covered
debris, we came suddenly upon the best preserved ruin
we had yet discovered.  The entire lower story and part
of the second story of what must once have been a
splendid public building rose from a great knoll of
shrubbery and trees, while ivy, thick and luxuriant,
clambered upward to the summit of the broken walls.</p>
<p>In many places the gray stone was still exposed, its
smoothly chiseled face pitted with the scars of battle.
The massive portal yawned, somber and sorrowful,
before us, giving a glimpse of marble halls within.</p>
<p>The temptation to enter was too great.  I wished to
explore the interior of this one remaining monument of
civilization now dead beyond recall.  Through this same

<pb n="73"/>
portal, within these very marble halls, had Gray and
Chamberlin and Kitchener and Shaw, perhaps, come
and gone with the other great ones of the past.</p>
<p>I took Victory's hand in mine.</p>
<p>"Come!" I said.  "I do not know the name by which
this great pile was known, nor the purposes it fulfilled.
It may have been the palace of your sires, Victory.  From
some great throne within, your forebears may have
directed the destinies of half the world.  Come!"</p>
<p>I must confess to a feeling of awe as we entered the
rotunda of the great building.  Pieces of massive furniture
of another day still stood where man had placed
them centuries ago.  They were littered with dust and
broken stone and plaster, but, otherwise, so perfect was
their preservation I could hardly believe that two
centuries had rolled by since human eyes were last set
upon them.</p>
<p>Through one great room after another we wandered,
hand in hand, while Victory asked many questions and
for the first time I began to realize something of the
magnificence and power of the race from whose loins
she had sprung.</p>
<p>Splendid tapestries, now mildewed and rotting, hung
upon the walls.  There were mural paintings, too,
depicting great historic events of the past.  For the first
time Victory saw the likeness of a horse, and she was
much affected by a huge oil which depicted some ancient
cavalry charge against a battery of field guns.</p>
<p>In other pictures there were steamships, battleships,
submarines, and quaint looking railway trains &mdash; all small
and antiquated in appearance to me, but wonderful to
Victory.  She told me that she would like to remain for
the rest of her life where she could look at those
pictures daily.</p>
<p>From room to room we passed until presently we

<pb n="74"/>
emerged into a mighty chamber, dark and gloomy, for
its high and narrow windows were choked and clogged
by ivy.  Along one paneled wall we groped, our eyes
slowly becoming accustomed to the darkness.  A rank
and pungent odor pervaded the atmosphere.</p>
<p>We had made our way about half the distance across
one end of the great apartment when a low growl from
the far end brought us to a startled halt.</p>
<p>Straining my eyes through the gloom, I made out a
raised dais at the extreme opposite end of the hall.  Upon
the dais stood two great chairs, highbacked and with
great arms.</p>
<p>The throne of England!  But what were those strange
forms about it?</p>
<p>Victory gave my hand a quick, excited little squeeze.</p>
<p>"The lions!" she whispered.</p>
<p>Yes, lions indeed!  Sprawled about the dais were a
dozen huge forms, while upon the seat of one of the
thrones a small cub lay curled in slumber.</p>
<p>As we stood there for a moment, spellbound by the
sight of those fearsome creatures occupying the very
thrones of the sovereigns of England, the low growl was
repeated, and a great male rose slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>His devilish eyes bored straight through the
semi-darkness toward us.  He had discovered the interloper.
What right had man within this palace of the beasts?
Again he opened his giant jaws, and this time there
rumbled forth a warning roar.</p>
<p>Instantly eight or ten of the other beasts leaped to
their feet.  Already the great fellow who had spied us
was advancing slowly in our direction.  I held my rifle
ready, but how futile it appeared in the face of this
savage horde.</p>
<p>The foremost beast broke into a slow trot, and at his
heels came the others.  All were roaring now, and the

<pb n="75"/>
din of their great voices reverberating through the halls
and corridors of the palace formed the most frightful
chorus of thunderous savagery imaginable to the mind
of man.</p>
<p>And then the leader charged, and upon the hideous
pandemonium broke the sharp crack of my rifle, once,
twice, thrice.  Three lions rolled, struggling and biting,
to the floor.  Victory seized my arm, with a quick, "This
way!  Here is a door," and a moment later we were in
a tiny antechamber at the foot of a narrow stone
staircase.</p>
<p>Up this we backed, Victory just behind me, as the
first of the remaining lions leaped from the throne room
and sprang for the stairs.  Again I fired, but others of
the ferocious beasts leaped over their fallen fellows and
pursued us.</p>
<p>The stairs were very narrow &mdash; that was all that saved
us &mdash; for as I backed slowly upward, but a single lion
could attack me at a time, and the carcasses of those I
slew impeded the rushes of the others.</p>
<p>At last we reached the top.  There was a long corridor
from which opened many doorways.  One, directly behind
us, was tight closed.  If we could open it and pass
into the chamber behind we might find a respite from
attack.</p>
<p>The remaining lions were roaring horribly.  I saw one
sneaking very slowly up the stairs toward us.</p>
<p>"Try that door," I called to Victory.  "See if it will
open."</p>
<p>She ran up to it and pushed.</p>
<p>"Turn the knob!" I cried, seeing that she did not
know how to open a door, but neither did she know
what I meant by knob.</p>
<p>I put a bullet in the spine of the approaching lion and
leaped to Victory's side.  The door resisted my first efforts

<pb n="76"/>
to swing it inward.  Rusted hinges and swollen
wood held it tightly closed.  But at last it gave, and just
as another lion mounted to the top of the stairway it
swung in, and I pushed Victory across the threshold.</p>
<p>Then I turned to meet the renewed attack of the savage
foe.  One lion fell in his tracks, another stumbled
to my very feet, and then I leaped within and slammed
the portal to.</p>
<p>A quick glance showed me that this was the only door
to the small apartment in which we had found sanctuary,
and, with a sigh of relief, I leaned for a moment
against the panels of the stout barrier that separated us
from the ramping demons without.</p>
<p>Across the room, between two windows, stood a
flat-topped desk.  A little pile of white and brown lay
upon it close to the opposite edge.  After a moment of rest
I crossed the room to investigate.  The white was the
bleached human bones &mdash; the skull, collar bones, arms,
and a few of the upper ribs of a man.  The brown was
the dust of a decayed military cap and blouse.  In a chair
before the desk were other bones, while more still
strewed the floor beneath the desk and about the chair.
A man had died sitting there with his face buried in his
arms &mdash; two hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Beneath the desk were a pair of spurred military
boots, green and rotten with decay.  In them were the
leg bones of a man.  Among the tiny bones of the hands
was an ancient fountain pen, as good, apparently, as
the day it was made, and a metal covered memoranda
book, closed over the bones of an index finger.</p>
<p>It was a gruesome sight &mdash; a pitiful sight &mdash; this lone
inhabitant of mighty London.</p>
<p>I picked up the metal covered memoranda book.  Its
pages were rotten and stuck together.  Only here and
there was a sentence or a part of a sentence legible.

<pb n="77"/>
The first that I could read was near the middle of the
little volume:</p>
<p>"His majesty left for Tunbridge Wells today, he . . .
jesty was stricken . . . terday.  God give she does not
die . . . am military governor of Lon . . ."</p>
<p>And farther on:</p>
<p>"It is awful . . . hundred deaths today . . . worse
than the bombardm . . ."</p>
<p>Nearer the end I picked out the following:</p>
<p>"I promised his maj . . . e will find me here when
he ret . . . alone."</p>
<p>The most legible passage was on the next page:</p>
<p>"Thank God we drove them out.  There is not a single
. . . man on British soil today; but at what awful cost.
I tried to persuade Sir Phillip to urge the people to
remain.  But they are mad with fear of the Death, and
rage at our enemies.  He tells me that the coast cities
are packed . . . waiting to be taken across.  What will
become of England, with none left to rebuild her
shattered cities!"</p>
<p>And the last entry:</p>
<p>". . . alone.  Only the wild beasts . . .  A lion is
roaring now beneath the palace windows.  I think the
people feared the beasts even more than they did the
Death.  But they are gone, all gone, and to what?  How
much better conditions will they find on the continent?
All gone &mdash; only I remain.  I promised his majesty, and
when he returns he will find that I was true to my trust,
for I shall be awaiting him.  God save the King!"</p>
<p>That was all.  This brave and forever nameless officer
died nobly at his post &mdash; true to his country and his king.
It was the Death, no doubt, that took him.</p>
<p>Some of the entries had been dated.  From the few
legible letters and figures which remained I judge the

<pb n="78"/>
end came some time in August, 1937, but of that I am
not at all certain.</p>
<p>The diary has cleared up at least one mystery that
had puzzled me not a little, and now I am surprised
that I had not guessed its solution myself &mdash; the presence
of African and Asiatic beasts in England.</p>
<p>Acclimated by years of confinement in the zoological
gardens, they were fitted to resume in England the wild
existence for which nature had intended them, and once
free, had evidently bred prolifically, in marked contrast
to the captive exotics of twentieth century Pan-America,
which had gradually become fewer until extinction
occurred some time during the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>The palace, if such it was, lay not far from the banks
of the Thames.  The room in which we were imprisoned
overlooked the river, and I determined to attempt to
escape in this direction.</p>
<p>To descend through the palace was out of the
question, but outside we could discover no lions.  The
stems of the ivy which clambered upward past the window
of the room were as large around as my arm.  I knew that
they would support our weight, and as we could gain
nothing by remaining longer in the palace, I decided to
descend by way of the ivy and follow along down the
river in the direction of the launch.</p>
<p>Naturally I was much handicapped by the presence
of the girl.  But I could not abandon her, though I had
no idea what I should do with her after rejoining my
companions.  That she would prove a burden and an
embarrassment I was certain, but she had made it
equally plain to me that she would never return to her
people to mate with Buckingham.</p>
<p>I owed my life to her, and, all other considerations
aside, that was sufficient demand upon my gratitude
and my honor to necessitate my suffering every
inconvenience

<pb n="79"/>
in her service.  Too, she was queen of England.
But, by far the most potent argument in her favor,
she was a woman in distress &mdash; and a young and
very beautiful one.</p>
<p>And so, though I wished a thousand times that she
was back in her camp, I never let her guess it, but did
all that lay within my power to serve and protect her.  I
thank God now that I did so.</p>
<p>With the lions still padding back and forth beyond
the closed door, Victory and I crossed the room to one
of the windows.  I had outlined my plan to her, and
she had assured me that she could descend the ivy
without assistance.  In fact, she smiled a trifle at my
question.</p>
<p>Swinging myself outward, I began the descent, and
had come to within a few feet of the ground, being
just opposite a narrow window, when I was startled
by a savage growl almost in my ear, and then a great
taloned paw darted from the aperture to seize me,
and I saw the snarling face of a lion within the
embrasure.</p>
<p>Releasing my hold upon the ivy, I dropped the
remaining distance to the ground, saved from laceration
only because the lion's paw struck the thick stem of
ivy.</p>
<p>The creature was making a frightful racket now,
leaping back and forth from the floor at the broad window
ledge, tearing at the masonry with his claws in vain
attempts to reach me.  But the opening was too narrow,
and the masonry too solid.</p>
<p>Victory had commenced the descent, but I called to
her to stop just above the window, and, as the lion
reappeared, growling and snarling, I put a .33 bullet in
his face, and at the same moment Victory slipped

<pb n="80"/>
quickly past him, dropping into my upraised arms that
were awaiting her.</p>
<p>The roaring of the beasts that had discovered us,]
together with the report of my rifle, had set the balance
of the fierce inmates of the palace into the most frightful
uproar I have ever heard.</p>
<p>I feared that it would not be long before intelligence
or instinct would draw them from the interiors and set
them upon our trail, the river.  Nor had we much more
than reached it when a lion bounded around the corner
of the edifice we had just quitted and stood looking
about as though in search of us.</p>
<p>Following, came others, while Victory and I crouched
in hiding behind a clump of bushes close to the bank
of the river.  The beasts sniffed about the ground for a
while, but they did not chance to go near the spot where
we had stood beneath the window that had given us
escape.</p>
<p>Presently a black-maned male raised his head, and,
with cocked ears and glaring eyes, gazed straight at
the bush behind which we lay.  I could have sworn
that he had discovered us, and when he took a few
short and stately steps in our direction I raised my
rifle and covered him.  But, after a long, tense
moment he looked away, and turned to glare in another
direction.</p>
<p>I breathed a sigh of relief, and so did Victory.  I could
feel her body quiver as she lay pressed close to me, our
cheeks almost touching as we both peered through the
same small opening in the foliage.</p>
<p>I turned to give her a reassuring smile as the lion
indicated that he had not seen us, and as I did so she, too,
turned her face toward mine, for the same purpose,
doubtless.  Anyway, as our heads turned simultaneously, our

<pb n="81"/>
lips brushed together.  A startled expression came into
Victory's eyes as she drew back in evident confusion.</p>
<p>As for me, the strangest sensation that I have ever
experienced claimed me for an instant.  A peculiar,
tingling thrill ran through my veins, and my head swam.
I could not account for it.</p>
<p>Naturally, being a naval officer and consequently in
the best society of the federation, I have seen much of
women.  With others, I have laughed at the assertions
of the savants that modern man is a cold and passionless
creation in comparison with the males of former ages &mdash;
in a word, that love, as the one grand passion, had
ceased to exist.</p>
<p>I do not know, now, but that they were more nearly
right than we have guessed, at least in so far as modern
civilized woman is concerned.  I have kissed many
women &mdash; young and beautiful and middle aged and old,
and many that I had no business kissing &mdash; but never
before had I experienced that remarkable and altogether
delightful thrill that followed the accidental brushing of
my lips against the lips of Victory.</p>
<p>The occurrence interested me, and I was tempted to
experiment further.  But when I would have essayed it
another new and entirely unaccountable force restrained
me.  For the first time in my life I felt embarrassment
in the presence of a woman.</p>
<p>What further might have developed I cannot say, for
at that moment a perfect she-devil of a lioness, with
keener eyes than her lord and master, discovered us.
She came trotting toward our place of concealment,
growling and baring her yellow fangs.</p>
<p>I waited for an instant, hoping that I might be
mistaken, and that she would turn off in some other
direction.  But no &mdash; she increased her trot to a gallop, and

<pb n="82"/>
then I fired at her, but the bullet, though it struck her
full in the breast, didn't stop her.</p>
<p>Screaming with pain and rage, the creature fairly flew
toward us.  Behind her came other lions.  Our case
looked hopeless.  We were upon the brink of the river.
There seemed no avenue of escape, and I knew that
even my modern automatic rifle was inadequate in the
face of so many of these fierce beasts.</p>
<p>To remain where we were would have been suicidal.
We were both standing now, Victory keeping her place
bravely at my side, when I reached the only decision
open to me.</p>
<p>Seizing the girl's hand, I turned, just as the lioness
crashed into the opposite side of the bushes, and,
dragging Victory after me, leaped over the edge of the bank
into the river.</p>
<p>I did not know that lions are not fond of water, nor
did I know if Victory could swim, but death, immediate
and terrible, stared us in the face if we remained, and
so I took the chance.</p>
<p>At this point the current ran close to the shore, so
that we were immediately in deep water, and, to my
intense satisfaction, Victory struck out with a strong,
overhand stroke and set all my fears on her account at
rest.</p>
<p>But my relief was short-lived.  That lioness, as I have
said before, was a veritable devil.  She stood for a
moment glaring at us, then like a shot she sprang into the
river and swam swiftly after us.</p>
<p>Victory was a length ahead of me.</p>
<p>"Swim for the other shore!" I called to her.</p>
<p>I was much impeded by my rifle, having to swim with
one hand while I clung to my precious weapon with the
other.  The girl had seen the lioness take to the water,

<pb n="83"/>
and she had also seen that I was swimming much more
slowly than she, and what did she do?  She started to
drop back to my side.</p>
<p>"Go on!" I cried.  "Make for the other shore, and
then follow down until you find my friends.  Tell them
that I sent you, and with orders that they are to protect
you.  Go on!  Go on!"</p>
<p>But she only waited until we were again swimming
side by side, and I saw that she had drawn her long
knife, and was holding it between her teeth.</p>
<p>"Do as I tell you!" I said to her sharply, but she
shook her head.</p>
<p>The lioness was overhauling us rapidly.  She was
swimming silently, her chin just touching the water, but
blood was streaming from between her lips.  It was
evident that her lungs were pierced.</p>
<p>She was almost upon me.  I saw that in a moment she
would take me under her forepaws, or seize me in those
great jaws.  I felt that my time had come, but I meant
to die fighting.  And so I turned, and, treading water,
raised my rifle above my head and awaited her.</p>
<p>Victory, animated by a bravery no less ferocious than
that of the dumb beast assailing us, swam straight for
me.  It all happened so swiftly that I cannot recall the
details of the kaleidoscopic action which ensued.  I knew
that I rose high out of the water, and, with clubbed
rifle, dealt the animal a terrific blow upon the skull,
that I saw Victory, her long blade flashing in her hand,
close, striking, upon the beast, that a great paw fell
upon her shoulder, and that I was swept beneath the
surface of the water like a straw before the prow of a
freighter.</p>
<p>Still clinging to my rifle, I rose again, to see the
lioness struggling in her death throes but an arm's length

<pb n="84"/>
from me.  Scarcely had I risen than the beast turned
upon her side, struggled frantically for an instant, and
then sank.</p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="6" id="d8"><pb n="85"/>
<p>VICTORY WAS NOWHERE IN SIGHT.  ALONE, I
floated upon the bosom of the Thames.  In that brief
instant I believe that I suffered more mental anguish
than I have crowded into all the balance of my life
before or since.  A few hours before, I had been wishing
that I might be rid of her, and now that she was gone I
would have given my life to have her back again.</p>
<p>Wearily I turned to swim about the spot where she
had disappeared, hoping that she might rise once at
least, and I would be given the opportunity to save her,
and, as I turned, the water boiled before my face and
her head shot up before me.  I was on the point of
striking out to seize her, when a happy smile illumined her
features.</p>
<p>"You are not dead!" she cried.  "I have been searching
the bottom for you.  I was sure that the blow she
gave you must have disabled you," and she glanced
about for the lioness.</p>
<p>"She has gone?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Dead," I replied.</p>
<p>"The blow you struck her with the thing you call rifle
stunned her," she explained, "and then I swam in close
enough to get my knife into her heart."</p>
<p>Ah, such a girl!  I could not but wonder what one of
our own Pan-American women would have done under

<pb n="86"/>
like circumstances.  But then, of course, they have not
been trained by stern necessity to cope with the
emergencies and dangers of savage primeval life.</p>
<p>Along the bank we had just quitted, a score of lions
paced to and fro, growling menacingly.  We could not
return, and we struck out for the opposite shore.  I am
a strong swimmer, and had no doubt as to my ability
to cross the river, but I was not so sure about Victory,
so I swam close behind her, to be ready to give her
assistance should she need it.</p>
<p>She did not, however, reaching the opposite bank as
fresh, apparently, as when she entered the water.
Victory is a wonder.  Each day that we were together
brought new proofs of it.  Nor was it her courage or
vitality only which amazed me.  She had a head on those
shapely shoulders of hers, and dignity!  My, but she
could be regal when she chose!</p>
<p>She told me that the lions were fewer upon this side
of the river, but that there were many wolves, running
in great packs later in the year.  Now they were north
somewhere, and we should have little to fear from them,
though we might meet with a few.</p>
<p>My first concern was to take my weapons apart and
dry them, which was rather difficult in the face of the
fact that every rag about me was drenched.  But finally,
thanks to the sun and much rubbing, I succeeded,
though I had no oil to lubricate them.</p>
<p>We ate some wild berries and roots that Victory
found, and then we set off again down the river,
keeping an eye open for game on one side and the launch
on the other, for I thought that Delcarte, who would be
the natural leader during my absence, might run up the
Thames in search of me.</p>
<p>The balance of that day we sought in vain for game
or for the launch, and when night came we lay down,

<pb n="87"/>
our stomachs empty, to sleep beneath the stars.  We were
entirely unprotected from attack from wild beasts, and
for this reason I remained awake most of the night, on
guard.  But nothing approached us, though I could hear
the lions roaring across the river, and once I thought I
heard the howl of a beast north of us &mdash; it might have
been a wolf.</p>
<p>Altogether, it was a most unpleasant night, and I
determined then that if we were forced to sleep out again
that I should provide some sort of shelter which would
protect us from attack while we slept.</p>
<p>Toward morning I dozed, and the sun was well up
when Victory aroused me by gently shaking my shoulder.</p>
<p>"Antelope!" she whispered in my ear, and, as I
raised my head, she pointed up-river.  Crawling to my
knees, I looked in the direction she indicated, to see a
buck standing upon a little knoll some two hundred
yards from us.  There was good cover between the animal
and me, and so, though I might have hit him at
two hundred yards, I preferred to crawl closer to him
and make sure of the meat we both so craved.</p>
<p>I had covered about fifty yards of the distance, and
the beast was still feeding peacefully, so I thought that
I would make even surer of a hit by going ahead another
fifty yards, when the animal suddenly raised his head
and looked away, up-river.  His whole attitude
proclaimed that he was startled by something beyond him
that I could not see.</p>
<p>Realizing that he might break and run and that I
should then probably miss him entirely, I raised my rifle
to my shoulder.  But even as I did so the animal leaped
into the air, and simultaneously there was a sound of a
shot from beyond the knoll.</p>
<p>For an instant I was dumbfounded.  Had the report

<pb n="88"/>
come from down-river, I should have instantly thought
that one of my own men had fired.  But coming from
up-river it puzzled me considerably.  Who could there
be with firearms in primitive England other than we of
the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>?</p>
<p>Victory was directly behind me, and I motioned for
her to lie down, as I did, behind the bush from which
I had been upon the point of firing at the antelope.  We
could see that the buck was quite dead, and from our
hiding place we waited to discover the identity of his
slayer when the latter should approach and claim his
kill.</p>
<p>We had not long to wait, and when I saw the head
and shoulders of a man appear above the crest of the
knoll, I sprang to my feet, with a heartfelt cry of joy,
for it was Delcarte.</p>
<p>At the sound of my voice, Delcarte half raised his
rifle in readiness for the attack of an enemy, but a
moment later he recognized me, and was coming rapidly
to meet us.  Behind him was Snider.  They both were
astounded to see me upon the north bank of the river,
and much more so at the sight of my companion.</p>
<p>Then I introduced them to Victory, and told them that
she was queen of England.  They thought, at first, that
I was joking.  But when I had recounted my adventures
and they realized that I was in earnest, they believed
me.</p>
<p>They told me that they had followed me inshore when
I had not returned from the hunt, that they had met the
men of the elephant country, and had had a short and
one-sided battle with the fellows.  And that afterward
they had returned to the launch with a prisoner, from
whom they had learned that I had probably been captured
by the men of the lion country.</p>
<p>With the prisoner as a guide they had set off up-river

<pb n="89"/>
in search of me, but had been much delayed by motor
trouble, and had finally camped after dark a half mile
above the spot where Victory and I had spent the night.
They must have passed us in the dark, and why I did
not hear the sound of the propeller I do not know,
unless it passed me at a time when the lions were making
an unusually earsplitting din upon the opposite side.</p>
<p>Taking the antelope with us, we all returned to the
launch, where we found Taylor as delighted to see me
alive again as Delcarte had been.  I cannot say truthfully
that Snider evinced much enthusiasm at my rescue.</p>
<p>Taylor had found the ingredients for chemical fuel, and
the distilling of them had, with the motor trouble,
accounted for their delay in setting out after me.</p>
<p>The prisoner that Delcarte and Snider had taken was
a powerful young fellow from the elephant country.
Notwithstanding the fact that they had all assured him
to the contrary, he still could not believe that we would
not kill him.</p>
<p>He assured us that his name was Thirty-six, and, as
he could not count above ten, I am sure that he had no
conception of the correct meaning of the word, and that
it may have been handed down to him either from the
military number of an ancestor who had served in the
English ranks during the Great War, or that originally
it was the number of some famous regiment with which
a forbear fought.</p>
<p>Now that we were reunited, we held a council to
determine what course we should pursue in the immediate
future.  Snider was still for setting out to sea and
returning to Pan-America, but the better judgment of
Delcarte and Taylor ridiculed the suggestion &mdash; we should
not have lived a fortnight.</p>
<p>To remain in England, constantly menaced by wild
beasts and men equally as wild, seemed about as bad.

<pb n="90"/>
I suggested that we cross the Channel and ascertain if
we could not discover a more enlightened and civilized
people upon the continent.  I was sure that some trace
of the ancient culture and greatness of Europe must
remain.  Germany, probably, would be much as it was
during the twentieth century, for, in common with most
Pan-Americans, I was positive that Germany had been
victorious in the Great War.</p>
<p>Snider demurred at the suggestion.  He said that
it was bad enough to have come this far.  He did not
want to make it worse by going to the continent.  The
outcome of it was that I finally lost my patience, and
told him that from then on he would do what I thought
best &mdash; that I proposed to assume command of the party,
and that they might all consider themselves under my
orders, as much so as though we were still aboard the
<hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> and in Pan-American waters.</p>
<p>Delcarte and Taylor immediately assured me that they
had not for an instant assumed anything different, and
that they were as ready to follow and obey me here as
they would be upon the other side of thirty.</p>
<p>Snider said nothing, but he wore a sullen scowl.  And
I wished then, as I had before, and as I did to a much
greater extent later, that fate had not decreed that he
should have chanced to be a member of the launch's
party upon that memorable day when last we quitted
the <hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi>.</p>
<p>Victory, who was given a voice in our councils, was
all for going to the continent, or anywhere else, in fact,
where she might see new sights and experience new
adventures.</p>
<p>"Afterward we can come back to Grabritin," she
said, "and if Buckingham is not dead and we can catch
him away from his men and kill him, then I can return

<pb n="91"/>
to my people, and we can all live in peace and
happiness."</p>
<p>She spoke of killing Buckingham with no greater
concern than one might evince in the contemplated
destruction of a sheep; yet she was neither cruel nor
vindictive.  In fact, Victory is a very sweet and womanly
woman.  But human life is of small account beyond
thirty &mdash; a legacy from the bloody days when thousands of
men perished in the trenches between the rising and the
setting of a sun, when they laid them lengthwise in
these same trenches and sprinkled dirt over them, when
the Germans corded their corpses like wood and set fire
to them, when women and children and old men were
butchered, and great passenger ships were torpedoed
without warning.</p>
<p>Thirty-six, finally assured that we did not intend
slaying him, was as keen to accompany us as was Victory.</p>
<p>The crossing to the continent was uneventful, its
monotony being relieved, however, by the childish delight
of Victory and Thirty-six in the novel experience of
riding safely upon the bosom of the water, and of being
so far from land.</p>
<p>With the possible exception of Snider, the little party
appeared in the best of spirits, laughing and joking, or
interestedly discussing the possibilities which the future
held for us: what we should find upon the continent,
and whether the inhabitants would be civilized or
barbarian peoples.</p>
<p>Victory asked me to explain the difference between
the two, and when I had tried to do so as clearly as
possible, she broke into a gay little laugh.</p>
<p>"Oh," she cried, "then I am a barbarian!"</p>
<p>I could not but laugh, too, as I admitted that she was,
indeed, a barbarian.  She was not offended, taking the

<pb n="92"/>
matter as a huge joke.  But some time thereafter she sat
in silence, apparently deep in thought.  Finally she
looked up at me, her strong white teeth gleaming behind
her smiling lips.</p>
<p>"Should you take that thing you call 'razor,'" she
said, "and cut the hair from the face of Thirty-six, and
exchange garments with him, you would be the barbarian
and Thirty-six the civilized man.  There is no other
difference between you, except your weapons.  Clothe
you in a wolfskin, give you a knife and a spear, and set
you down in the woods of Grabritin &mdash; of what service
would your civilization be to you?"</p>
<p>Delcarte and Taylor smiled at her reply, but Thirty-six
and Snider laughed uproariously.  I was not surprised at
Thirty-six, but I thought that Snider laughed
louder than the occasion warranted.  As a matter of fact,
Snider, it seemed to me, was taking advantage of every
opportunity, however slight, to show insubordination,
and I determined then that at the first real breach of
discipline I should take action that would remind Snider,
ever after, that I was still his commanding officer.</p>
<p>I could not help but notice that his eyes were much
upon Victory, and I did not like it, for I knew the type
of man he was.  But as it would not be necessary ever
to leave the girl alone with him I felt no apprehension
for her safety.</p>
<p>After the incident of the discussion of barbarians I
thought that Victory's manner toward me changed
perceptibly.  She held aloof from me, and when Snider took
his turn at the wheel, sat beside him, upon the pretext
that she wished to learn how to steer the launch.  I
wondered if she had guessed the man's antipathy for me,
and was seeking his company solely for the purpose of
piquing me.</p>
<p>Snider was, too, taking full advantage of his
opportunity.

<pb n="93"/>
Often he leaned toward the girl to whisper in her
ear, and he laughed much, which was unusual with
Snider.</p>
<p>Of course, it was nothing at all to me; yet, for some
unaccountable reason, the sight of the two of them
sitting there so close to one another and seeming to be
enjoying each other's society to such a degree irritated
me tremendously, and put me in such a bad humor that
I took no pleasure whatsoever in the last few hours of
the crossing.</p>
<p>We aimed to land near the site of ancient Ostend.  But
when we neared the coast we discovered no indication
of any human habitations whatever, let alone a city.
After we had landed, we found the same howling
wilderness about us that we had discovered on the British
Isle.  There was no slightest indication that civilized man
had ever set a foot upon that portion of the continent
of Europe.</p>
<p>Although I had feared as much, since our experience
in England, I could not but own to a feeling of marked
disappointment, and to the gravest fears of the future,
which induced a mental depression that was in no way
dissipated by the continued familiarity between Victory
and Snider.</p>
<p>I was angry with myself that I permitted that matter
to affect me as it had.  I did not wish to admit to myself
that I was angry with this uncultured little savage, that
it made the slightest difference to me what she did or
what she did not do, or that I could so lower myself as
to feel personal enmity towards a common sailor.  And
yet, to be honest, I was doing both.</p>
<p>Finding nothing to detain us about the spot where
Ostend once had stood, we set out up the coast in search
of the mouth of the River Rhine, which I purposed
ascending in search of civilized man.  It was my intention

<pb n="94"/>
to explore the Rhine as far up as the launch would take
us.  If we found no civilization there we would return to
the North Sea, continue up the coast to the Elbe, and
follow that river and the canals of Berlin.  Here, at least,
I was sure that we should find what we sought &mdash; and, if
not, then all Europe had reverted to barbarism.</p>
<p>The weather remained fine, and we made excellent
progress, but everywhere along the Rhine we met with
the same disappointment &mdash; no sign of civilized man, in
fact, no sign of man at all.</p>
<p>I was not enjoying the exploration of modern Europe
as I had anticipated &mdash; I was unhappy.  Victory seemed
changed, too.  I had enjoyed her company at first, but
since the trip across the Channel I had held aloof from
her.</p>
<p>Her chin was in the air most of the time, and yet I
rather think that she regretted her friendliness with
Snider, for I noticed that she avoided him entirely.  He,
on the contrary, emboldened by her former friendliness,
sought every opportunity to be near her.  I should
have liked nothing better than a reasonably good excuse
to punch his head; yet, paradoxically, I was ashamed of
myself for harboring him any ill will.  I realized that
there was something the matter with me, but I did not
know what it was.</p>
<p>Matters remained thus for several days, and we
continued our journey up the Rhine.  At Cologne, I had
hoped to find some reassuring indications, but there
was no Cologne.  And as there had been no other cities
along the river up to that point, the devastation was
infinitely greater than time alone could have wrought.
Great guns, bombs, and mines must have leveled every
building that man had raised, and then nature,
unhindered, had covered the ghastly evidence of human
depravity with her beauteous mantle of verdure.  Splendid

<pb n="95"/>
trees reared their stately tops where splendid cathedrals
once had reared their domes, and sweet wild flowers
blossomed in simple serenity in soil that once was
drenched with human blood.</p>
<p>Nature had reclaimed what man had once stolen from
her and defiled.  A herd of zebras grazed where once
the German kaiser may have reviewed his troops.  An
antelope rested peacefully in a bed of daisies where,
perhaps, two hundred years ago a big gun belched its
terror-laden messages of death, of hate, of destruction
against the works of man and God alike.</p>
<p>We were in need of fresh meat, yet I hesitated to
shatter the quiet and peaceful serenity of the view with
the crack of a rifle and the death of one of those
beautiful creatures before us.  But it had to be done &mdash; we
must eat.  I left the work to Delcarte, however, and in
a moment we had two antelope and the landscape to
ourselves.</p>
<p>After eating, we boarded the launch and continued
up the river.  For two days we passed through a primeval
wilderness.  In the afternoon of the second day we
landed upon the west bank of the river, and, leaving
Snider and Thirty-six to guard Victory and the launch,
Delcarte, Taylor, and I set out after game.</p>
<p>We tramped away from the river for upwards of an
hour before discovering anything, and then only a small
red deer, which Taylor brought down with a neat shot
of two hundred yards.  It was getting too late to proceed
farther, so we rigged a sling, and the two men carried
the deer back toward the launch while I walked a
hundred yards ahead, in the hope of bagging something
further for our larder.</p>
<p>We had covered about half the distance to the river,
when I suddenly came face to face with a man.  He was as
primitive and uncouth in appearance as the Grabritins &mdash;

<pb n="96"/>
a shaggy, unkempt savage, clothed in a shirt of skin
cured with the head on, the latter surmounting his own
head to form a bonnet, and giving to him a most fearful
and ferocious aspect.</p>
<p>The fellow was armed with a long spear and a club,
the latter dangling down his back from a leathern thong
about his neck.  His feet were incased in hide sandals.</p>
<p>At sight of me, he halted for an instant, then turned
and dove into the forest, and, though I called reassuringly
to him in English he did not return nor did I again
see him.</p>
<p>The sight of the wild man raised my hopes once more
that elsewhere we might find men in a higher state of
civilization &mdash; it was the society of civilized man that I
craved &mdash; and so, with a lighter heart, I continued on
toward the river and the launch.</p>
<p>I was still some distance ahead of Delcarte and
Taylor, when I came in sight of the Rhine again.  But I
came to the water's edge before I noticed that anything was
amiss with the party we had left there a few hours before.</p>
<p>My first intimation of disaster was the absence of the
launch from its former moorings.  And then, a moment
later &mdash; I discovered the body of a man lying upon the
bank.  Running toward it, I saw that it was Thirty-six,
and as I stopped and raised the Grabritin's head in my
arms, I heard a faint moan break from his lips.  He was
not dead, but that he was badly injured was all too
evident.</p>
<p>Delcarte and Taylor came up a moment later, and the
three of us worked over the fellow, hoping to revive
him that he might tell us what had happened, and what
had become of the others.  My first thought was
prompted by the sight I had recently had of the savage
native.  The little party had evidently been surprised,

<pb n="97"/>
and in the attack Thirty-six had been wounded and the
others taken prisoners.  The thought was almost like a
physical blow in the face &mdash; it stunned me.  Victory in the
hands of these abysmal brutes!  It was frightful.  I almost
shook poor Thirty-six in my efforts to revive him.</p>
<p>I explained my theory to the others, and then Delcarte
shattered it by a single movement of the hand.  He
drew aside the lion's skin that covered half of the
Grabritin's breast, revealing a neat, round hole in
Thirty-six's chest &mdash; a hole that could have been made by no
other weapon than a rifle.</p>
<p>"Snider!" I exclaimed.  Delcarte nodded.  At about
the same time the eyelids of the wounded man fluttered,
and raised.  He looked up at us, and very slowly the
light of consciousness returned to his eyes.</p>
<p>"What happened, Thirty-six?" I asked him.</p>
<p>He tried to reply, but the effort caused him to cough,
bringing about a hemorrhage of the lungs and again he
fell back exhausted.  For several long minutes he lay as
one dead, then in an almost inaudible whisper he spoke.</p>
<p>"Snider &mdash; "  He paused, tried to speak again, raised
a hand, and pointed down-river.  "They &mdash; went &mdash; back,"
and then he shuddered convulsively and died.</p>
<p>None of us voiced his belief.  But I think they were
all alike: Victory and Snider had stolen the launch, and
deserted us.</p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="7" id="d9"><pb n="98"/>
<p>WE STOOD THERE, GROUPED ABOUT THE
body of the dead Grabritin, looking futilely down the
river to where it made an abrupt curve to the west, a
quarter of a mile below us, and was lost to sight, as
though we expected to see the truant returning to us
with our precious launch &mdash; the thing that meant life or
death to us in this unfriendly, savage world.</p>
<p>I felt, rather than saw, Taylor turn his eyes slowly
toward my profile, and, as mine swung to meet them,
the expression upon his face recalled me to my duty
and responsibility as an officer.</p>
<p>The utter hopelessness that was reflected in his face
must have been the counterpart of what I myself felt,
but in that brief instant I determined to hide my own
misgivings that I might bolster up the courage of the
others.</p>
<p>"We are lost!" was written as plainly upon Taylor's
face as though his features were the printed words upon
an open book.  He was thinking of the launch, and of
the launch alone.  Was I?  I tried to think that I was.
But a greater grief than the loss of the launch could have
engendered in me, filled my heart &mdash; a sullen, gnawing
misery which I tried to deny &mdash; which I refused to admit &mdash;
but which persisted in obsessing me until my heart
rose and filled my throat, and I could not speak when

<pb n="99"/>
I would have uttered words of reassurance to my
companions.</p>
<p>And then rage came to my relief &mdash; rage against the
vile traitor who had deserted three of his fellow
countrymen in so frightful a position.  I tried to feel an
equal rage against the woman, but somehow I could not, and
kept searching for excuses for her &mdash; her youth, her
inexperience, her savagery.</p>
<p>My rising anger swept away my temporary helplessness.
I smiled, and told Taylor not to look so glum.</p>
<p>"We will follow them," I said, "and the chances are
that we shall overtake them.  They will not travel as
rapidly as Snider probably hopes.  He will be forced to
halt for fuel and for food, and the launch must follow
the windings of the river; we can take short cuts while
they are traversing the detour.  I have my map &mdash; thank
God! I always carry it upon my person &mdash; and with that
and the compass we will have an advantage over them."</p>
<p>My words seemed to cheer them both, and they were
for starting off at once in pursuit.  There was no reason
why we should delay, and we set forth down the river.
As we tramped along, we discussed a question that was
uppermost in the mind of each &mdash; what we should do with
Snider when we had captured him, for with the action
of pursuit had come the optimistic conviction that we
should succeed.  As a matter of fact, we had to succeed.
The very thought of remaining in this utter wilderness
for the rest of our lives was impossible.</p>
<p>We arrived at nothing very definite in the matter of
Snider's punishment, since Taylor was for shooting him,
Delcarte insisting that he should be hanged, while I,
although fully conscious of the gravity of his offense,
could not bring myself to give the death penalty.</p>
<p>I fell to wondering what charm Victory had found in
such a man as Snider, and why I insisted upon finding

<pb n="100"/>
excuses for her and trying to defend her indefensible
act.  She was nothing to me.  Aside from the natural
gratitude I felt for her since she had saved my life, I
owed her nothing.  She was a half-naked little savage &mdash;
I, a gentleman, and an officer in the world's greatest
navy.  There could be no close bonds of interest between
us.</p>
<p>This line of reflection I discovered to be as
distressing as the former, but, though I tried to turn my
mind to other things, it persisted in returning to the
vision of an oval face, sun-tanned; of smiling lips,
revealing white and even teeth; of brave eyes that harbored
no shadow of guile; and of a tumbling mass of wavy hair
that crowned the loveliest picture on which my eyes had
ever rested.</p>
<p>Every time this vision presented itself I felt myself
turn cold with rage and hate against Snider.  I could
forgive the launch, but if he had wronged her he should
die &mdash; he should die at my own hands; in this I was
determined.</p>
<p>For two days we followed the river northward, cutting
off where we could, but confined for the most part to
the game trails that paralleled the stream.  One
afternoon, we cut across a narrow neck of land that saved
us many miles, where the river wound to the west and
back again.</p>
<p>Here we decided to halt, for we had had a hard day
of it, and, if the truth were known, I think that we had
all given up hope of overtaking the launch other than
by the merest accident.</p>
<p>We had shot a deer just before our halt, and, as Taylor
and Delcarte were preparing it, I walked down to the
water to fill our canteens.  I had just finished, and was
straightening up, when something floating around a
bend above me caught my eye.  For a moment I could

<pb n="101"/>
not believe the testimony of my own senses.  It was a
boat.</p>
<p>I shouted to Delcarte and Taylor, who came running
to my side.</p>
<p>"The launch!" cried Delcarte; and, indeed, it was
the launch, floating down-river from above us.  Where
had it been?  How had we passed it?  And how were we
to reach it now, should Snider and the girl discover us?</p>
<p>"It's drifting," said Taylor.  "I see no one in it."</p>
<p>I was stripping off my clothes, and Delcarte soon
followed my example.  I told Taylor to remain on shore
with the clothing and rifles.  He might also serve us
better there, since it would give him an opportunity to
take a shot at Snider should the man discover us and
show himself.</p>
<p>With powerful strokes we swam out in the path of
the oncoming launch.  Being a stronger swimmer than
Delcarte, I soon was far in the lead, reaching the center
of the channel just as the launch bore down upon me.
It was drifting broadside on.  I seized the gunwale and
raised myself quickly, so that my chin topped the side.
I expected a blow the moment that I came within the
view of the occupants, but no blow fell.</p>
<p>Snider lay upon his back in the bottom of the boat
alone.  Even before I had clambered in and stooped
above him I knew that he was dead.  Without examining
him further, I ran forward to the control board and
pressed the starting button.  To my relief, the
mechanism responded &mdash; the launch was uninjured.  Coming
about, I picked up Delcarte.  He was astounded at the
sight that met his eyes, and immediately fell to
examining Snider's body for signs of life or an
explanation of the manner in which he met his death.</p>
<p>The fellow had been dead for hours &mdash; he was cold and
still.  But Delcarte's search was not without results, for

<pb n="102"/>
above Snider's heart was a wound, a slit about an inch
in length &mdash; such a slit as a sharp knife would make, and
in the dead fingers of one hand was clutched a strand
of long brown hair &mdash; Victory's hair was brown.</p>
<p>They saw that dead men tell no tales, but Snider told
the story of his end as clearly as though the dead lips
had parted and poured forth the truth.  The beast had
attacked the girl, and she had defended her honor.</p>
<p>We buried Snider beside the Rhine, and no stone
marks his last resting place.  Beasts do not require
headstones.</p>
<p>Then we set out in the launch, turning her nose
upstream.  When I had told Delcarte and Taylor that I
intended searching for the girl, neither had demurred.</p>
<p>"We had her wrong in our thoughts," said Delcarte,
"and the least that we can do in expiation is to find and
rescue her."</p>
<p>We called her name aloud every few minutes as we
motored up the river, but, though we returned all the
way to our former camping place, we did not find her.
I then decided to retrace our journey, letting Taylor
handle the launch, while Delcarte and I, upon opposite
sides of the river, searched for some sign of the spot
where Victory had landed.</p>
<p>We found nothing until we had reached a point a few
miles above the spot where I had first seen the launch
drifting down toward us, and there I discovered the
remnants of a recent camp fire.</p>
<p>That Victory carried flint and steel I was aware, and
that it was she who built the fire I was positive.  But
which way had she gone since she stopped here?</p>
<p>Would she go on down the river, that she might thus
bring herself nearer her own Grabritin, or would she
have sought to search for us upstream, where she had
seen us last?</p>

<pb n="103"/>
<p>I had hailed Taylor, and sent him across the river to
take in Delcarte, that the two might join me and discuss
my discovery and our future plans.</p>
<p>While waiting for them, I stood looking out over the
river, my back toward the woods that stretched away to
the east behind me.  Delcarte was just stepping into the
launch upon the opposite side of the stream, when,
without the least warning, I was violently seized by
both arms and about the waist &mdash; three or four men were
upon me at once; my rifle was snatched from my hands
and my revolver from my belt.</p>
<p>I struggled for an instant, but finding my efforts of
no avail, I ceased them, and turned my head to have a
look at my assailants.  At the same time several others
of them walked around in front of me, and, to my
astonishment, I found myself looking upon uniformed
soldiery, armed with rifles, revolvers, and sabers, but
with faces as black as coal.</p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="8" id="d10"><pb n="104"/>
<p>DELCARTE AND TAYLOR WERE NOW IN
midstream, coming toward us, and I called to them to keep
aloof until I knew whether the intentions of my captors
were friendly or otherwise.  My good men wanted to
come on and annihilate the blacks.  But there were
upward of a hundred of the latter, all well armed, and
so I commanded Delcarte to keep out of harm's way, and
stay where he was till I needed him.</p>
<p>A young officer called and beckoned to them.  But
they refused to come, and so he gave orders that
resulted in my hands being secured at my back, after
which the company marched away, straight toward the
east.</p>
<p>I noticed that the men wore spurs, which seemed
strange to me.  But when, late in the afternoon, we
arrived at their encampment, I discovered that my captors
were cavalrymen.</p>
<p>In the center of a plain stood a log fort, with a
blockhouse at each of its four corners.  As we approached, I
saw a herd of cavalry horses grazing under guard
outside the walls of the post.  They were small, stocky
horses, but the telltale saddle galls proclaimed their
calling.  The flag flying from a tall staff inside the
palisade was one which I had never before seen nor heard
of.</p>
<pb n="105"/>
<p>We marched directly into the compound, where the
company was dismissed, with the exception of a guard
of four privates, who escorted me in the wake of the
young officer.  The latter led us across a small parade
ground, where a battery of light field guns was parked,
and toward a log building, in front of which rose the
flagstaff.</p>
<p>I was escorted within the building into the presence
of an old negro, a fine looking man, with a dignified
and military bearing.  He was a colonel, I was to learn
later, and to him I owe the very humane treatment that
was accorded me while I remained his prisoner.</p>
<p>He listened to the report of his junior, and then turned
to question me, but with no better results than the
former had accomplished.  Then he summoned an orderly,
and gave some instructions.  The soldier saluted, and
left the room, returning in about five minutes with a
hairy old white man &mdash; just such a savage,
primeval-looking fellow as I had discovered in the woods
the day that Snider had disappeared with the launch.</p>
<p>The colonel evidently expected to use the fellow as
interpreter, but when the savage addressed me it was in
a language as foreign to me as was that of the blacks.
At last the old officer gave it up, and, shaking his head,
gave instructions for my removal.</p>
<p>From his office I was led to a guardhouse, in which
I found about fifty half-naked whites, clad in the skins
of wild beasts.  I tried to converse with them, but not
one of them could understand Pan-American, nor could
I make head or tail of their jargon.</p>
<p>For over a month I remained a prisoner there,
working from morning until night at odd jobs about the
headquarters building of the commanding officer.  The
other prisoners worked harder than I did, and I owe my

<pb n="106"/>
better treatment solely to the kindliness and
discrimination of the old colonel.</p>
<p>What had become of Victory, of Delcarte, of Taylor
I could not know; nor did it seem likely that I should
ever learn.  I was most depressed.  But I whiled away my
time in performing the duties given me to the best of
my ability and attempting to learn the language of my
captors.</p>
<p>Who they were or where they came from was a
mystery to me.  That they were the outpost of some
powerful black nation seemed likely, yet where the seat
of that nation lay I could not guess.</p>
<p>They looked upon the whites as their inferiors, and
treated us accordingly.  They had a literature of their
own, and many of the men, even the common soldiers,
were omnivorous readers.  Every two weeks a
dust-covered trooper would trot his jaded mount into the
post and deliver a bulging sack of mail at headquarters.
The next day he would be away again upon a fresh
horse toward the south, carrying the soldiers' letters to
friends in the far off land of mystery from whence they
all had come.</p>
<p>Troops, sometimes mounted and sometimes afoot,
left the post daily for what I assumed to be patrol duty.
I judged the little force of a thousand men were detailed
here to maintain the authority of a distant government
in a conquered country.  Later, I learned that my
surmise was correct, and this was but one of a great chain
of similar posts that dotted the new frontier of the black
nation into whose hands I had fallen.</p>
<p>Slowly I learned their tongue, so that I could
understand what was said before me, and make myself
understood.  I had seen from the first that I was being
treated as a slave &mdash; that all whites that fell into the hands
of the blacks were thus treated.</p>

<pb n="107"/>
<p>Almost daily new prisoners were brought in, and
about three weeks after I was brought in to the post a
troop of cavalry came from the south to relieve one of
the troops stationed there.  There was great jubilation in
the encampment after the arrival of the newcomers, old
friendships were renewed and new ones made.  But the
happiest men were those of the troop that was to be
relieved.</p>
<p>The next morning they started away, and as they were
forced upon the parade ground we prisoners were
marched from our quarters and lined up before them.
A couple of long chains were brought, with rings in the
links every few feet.  At first I could not guess the
purpose of these chains.  But I was soon to learn.</p>
<p>A couple of soldiers snapped the first ring around the
neck of a powerful white slave, and one by one the rest
of us were herded to our places, and the work of
shackling us neck to neck commenced.</p>
<p>The colonel stood watching the procedure.  Presently
his eyes fell upon me, and he spoke to a young officer
at his side.  The latter stepped toward me and motioned
me to follow him.  I did so, and was led back to the
colonel.</p>
<p>By this time I could understand a few words of their
strange language, and when the colonel asked me if I
would prefer to remain at the post as his body servant,
I signified my willingness as emphatically as possible,
for I had seen enough of the brutality of the common
soldiers toward their white slaves to have no desire to
start out upon a march of unknown length, chained by
the neck, and driven on by the great whips that a score
of the soldiers carried to accelerate the speed of their
charges.</p>
<p>About three hundred prisoners who had been housed
in six prisons at the post marched out of the gates that

<pb n="108"/>
morning, toward what fate and what future I could not
guess.  Neither had the poor devils themselves more than
the most vague conception of what lay in store for them,
except that they were going elsewhere to continue in the
slavery that they had known since their capture by their
black conquerors &mdash; a slavery that was to continue until
death released them.</p>
<p>My position was altered at the post.  From working
about the headquarters office, I was transferred to the
colonel's living quarters.  I had greater freedom, and no
longer slept in one of the prisons, but had a little room
to myself off the kitchen of the colonel's log house.</p>
<p>My master was always kind to me, and under him I
rapidly learned the language of my captors, and much
concerning them that had been a mystery to me before.
His name was Abu Belik.  He was a colonel in the
cavalry of Abyssinia, a country of which I do not remember
ever hearing, but which Colonel Belik assured me is the
oldest civilized country in the world.</p>
<p>Colonel Belik was born in Adis Abeba, the capital of
the empire, and until recently had been in command of
the emperor's palace guard.  Jealousy and the ambition
and intrigue of another officer had lost him the favor of
his emperor, and he had been detailed to this frontier
post as a mark of his sovereign's displeasure.</p>
<p>Some fifty years before, the young emperor, Menelek
XIV, was ambitious.  He knew that a great world lay
across the waters far to the north of his capital.  Once
he had crossed the desert and looked out upon the blue
sea that was the northern boundary of his dominions.</p>
<p>There lay another world to conquer.  Menelek busied
himself with the building of a great fleet, though his
people were not a maritime race.  His army crossed into
Europe.  It met with little resistance, and for fifty years

<pb n="109"/>
his soldiers had been pushing his boundaries farther and
farther toward the north.</p>
<p>"The yellow men from the east and north are
contesting our rights here now," said the colonel, "but
we shall win &mdash; we shall conquer the world, carrying
Christianity to all the benighted heathen of Europe, and
Asia
as well."</p>
<p>"You are a Christian people?" I asked.</p>
<p>He looked at me in surprise, nodding his head
affirmatively.</p>
<p>"I am a Christian," I said.  "My people are the most
powerful on earth."</p>
<p>He smiled, and shook his head indulgently, as a
father to a child who sets up his childish judgment
against that of his elders.</p>
<p>Then I set out to prove my point.  I told him of our
cities, of our army, of our great navy.  He came right
back at me asking for figures, and when he was done I
had to admit that only in our navy were we numerically
superior.</p>
<p>Menelek XIV is the undisputed ruler of all the
continent of Africa, of all of ancient Europe except the
British Isles, Scandinavia, and eastern Russia, and has
large possessions and prosperous colonies in what once
were Arabia and Turkey in Asia.</p>
<p>He has a standing army of ten million men, and his
people possess slaves &mdash; white slaves &mdash; to the number of
ten or fifteen million.</p>
<p>Colonel Belik was much surprised, however, upon
his part to learn of the great nation which lay across
the ocean, and when he found that I was a naval officer,
he was inclined to accord me even greater consideration
than formerly.  It was difficult for him to believe my
assertion that there were but few blacks in my country,

<pb n="110"/>
and that these occupied a lower social plane than the
whites.</p>
<p>Just the reverse is true in Colonel Belik's land.  He
considered whites inferior beings, creatures of a lower
order, and assuring me that even the few white freemen
of Abyssinia were never accorded anything approximating
a position of social equality with the blacks.  They
live in the poorer districts of the cities, in little white
colonies, and a black who marries a white is socially
ostracized.</p>
<p>The arms and ammunition of the Abyssinians are
greatly inferior to ours, yet they are tremendously
effective against the ill-armed barbarians of Europe.
Their rifles are of a type similar to the magazine rifles
of twentieth century Pan-America, but carrying only five
cartridges in the magazine, in addition to the one in the
chamber.  They are of extraordinary length, even those
of the cavalry, and are of extreme accuracy.</p>
<p>The Abyssinians themselves are a fine looking race
of black men &mdash; tall, muscular, with fine teeth, and regular
features, which incline distinctly toward Semitic
mold &mdash; I refer to the full-blooded natives of Abyssinia.
They are the patricians &mdash; the aristocracy.  The army is
officered almost exclusively by them.  Among the
soldiery a lower type of negro predominates, with thicker
lips and broader, flatter noses.  These men are
recruited, so the colonel told me, from among the
conquered tribes of Africa.  They are good soldiers &mdash; brave
and loyal.  They can read and write, and they are endowed
with a self-confidence and pride which, from my
readings of the words of ancient African explorers, must
have been wanting in their earliest progenitors.  On the
whole, it is apparent that the black race has thrived far
better in the past two centuries under men of its own

<pb n="111"/>
color than it had under the domination of whites during
all previous history.</p>
<p>I had been a prisoner at the little frontier post for
over a month, when orders came to Colonel Belik to
hasten to the eastern frontier with the major portion of
his command, leaving only one troop to garrison the
fort.  As his body servant, I accompanied him mounted
upon a fiery little Abyssinian pony.</p>
<p>We marched rapidly for ten days through the heart of
the ancient German empire, halting when night found
us in proximity to water.  Often we passed small posts
similar to that at which the colonel's regiment had been
quartered, finding in each instance that only a single
company or troop remained for defence, the balance
having been withdrawn toward the northeast, in the
same direction in which we were moving.</p>
<p>Naturally, the colonel had not confided to me the
nature of his orders.  But the rapidity of our march and the
fact that all available troops were being hastened toward
the northeast assured me that a matter of vital
importance to the dominion of Menelek XIV in that part of
Europe was threatening or had already broken.</p>
<p>I could not believe that a simple rising of the savage
tribes of whites would necessitate the mobilizing of such
a force as we presently met with converging from the
south into our trail.  There were large bodies of cavalry
and infantry, endless streams of artillery wagons and
guns, and countless horse-drawn covered vehicles laden
with camp equipage, munitions, and provisions.</p>
<p>Here, for the first time, I saw camels, great caravans
of them, bearing all sorts of heavy burdens, and miles
upon miles of elephants doing similar service.  It was a
scene of wondrous and barbaric splendor, for the men
and beasts from the south were gaily caparisoned in

<pb n="112"/>
rich colors, in marked contrast to the gray uniformed
forces of the frontier, with which I had been familiar.</p>
<p>The rumor reached us that Menelek himself was
coming, and the pitch of excitement to which this
announcement raised the troops was little short of
miraculous &mdash; at least, to one of my race and nationality
whose rulers for centuries had been but ordinary men, holding
office at the will of the people for a few brief years.</p>
<p>As I witnessed it, I could not but speculate upon the
moral effect upon his troops of a sovereign's presence
in the midst of battle.  All else being equal in war
between the troops of a republic and an empire, could not
this exhilarated mental state, amounting almost to
hysteria on the part of the imperial troops, weigh
heavily against the soldiers of a president?  I wonder.</p>
<p>But if the emperor chanced to be absent?  What then?
Again I wonder.</p>
<p>On the eleventh day we reached our destination &mdash; a
walled frontier city of about twenty thousand.  We
passed some lakes, and crossed some old canals before
entering the gates.  Within, beside the frame buildings,
were many built of ancient brick and well-cut stone.
These, I was told, were of material taken from the ruins
of the ancient city which, once, had stood upon the site
of the present town.</p>
<p>The name of the town, translated from the Abyssinian,
is New Gondar.  It stands, I am convinced, upon
the ruins of ancient Berlin, the one time capital of the
old German empire, but except for the old building
material used in the new town there is no sign of the
former city.</p>
<p>The day after we arrived, the town was gaily decorated
with flags, streamers, gorgeous rugs, and banners, for
the rumor had proved true &mdash; the emperor was coming.</p>

<pb n="113"/>
<p>Colonel Belik had accorded me the greatest liberty,
permitting me to go where I pleased, after my few duties
had been performed.  As a result of his kindness, I
spent much time wandering about New Gondar, talking
with the inhabitants, and exploring the city of black
men.</p>
<p>As I had been given a semi-military uniform which
bore insignia indicating that I was an officer's body
servant, even the blacks treated me with a species of
respect, though I could see by their manner that I was
really as the dirt beneath their feet.  They answered my
questions civilly enough, but they would not enter into
conversation with me.  It was from other slaves that I
learned the gossip of the city.</p>
<p>Troops were pouring in from the west and south, and
pouring out toward the east.  I asked an old slave who
was sweeping the dirt into little piles in the gutters of
the street where the soldiers were going.  He looked at
me in surprise.</p>
<p>"Why, to fight the yellow men, of course," he said.
"They have crossed the border, and are marching
toward New Gondar."</p>
<p>"Who will win?" I asked.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders.  "Who knows?" he said.
"I hope it will be the yellow men, but Menelek is
powerful &mdash; it will take many yellow men to defeat him."</p>
<p>Crowds were gathering along the sidewalks to view
the emperor's entry into the city.  I took my place among
them, although I hate crowds, and I am glad that I did,
for I witnessed such a spectacle of barbaric splendor as
no other Pan-American has ever looked upon.</p>
<p>Down the broad main thoroughfare, which may once
have been the historic Unter den Linden, came a
brilliant cortege.  At the head rode a regiment of
red-coated hussars &mdash; enormous men, black as night.
There were

<pb n="114"/>
troops of riflemen mounted on camels.  The emperor
rode in a golden howdah upon the back of a huge
elephant so covered with rich hangings and embellished
with scintillating gems that scarce more than the beast's
eyes and feet were visible.</p>
<p>Menelek was a rather gross-looking man, well past
middle age, but he carried himself with an air of dignity
befitting one descended in unbroken line from the
Prophet &mdash; as was his claim.</p>
<p>His eyes were bright but crafty, and his features
denoted both sensuality and cruelness.  In his youth he
may have been a rather fine looking black, but when I
saw him his appearance was revolting &mdash; to me, at least.</p>
<p>Following the emperor came regiment after regiment
from the various branches of the service, among them
batteries of field guns mounted on elephants.</p>
<p>In the center of the troops following the imperial
elephant marched a great caravan of slaves.  The old street
sweeper at my elbow told me that these were the gifts
brought in from the far outlying districts by the
commanding officers of the frontier posts.  The majority of
them were women, destined, I was told, for the harems
of the emperor and his favorites.  It made my old
companion clench his fists to see those poor white women
marching past to their horrid fates, and, though I shared
his sentiments, I was as powerless to alter their
destinies as he.</p>
<p>For a week the troops kept pouring in and out of New
Gondar &mdash; in, always, from the south and west, but always
toward the east.  Each new contingent brought its
gifts to the emperor.  From the south they brought rugs
and ornaments and jewels; from the west, slaves; for
the commanding officers of the western frontier posts
had naught else to bring.</p>

<pb n="115"/>
<p>From the number of women they brought, I judged
that they knew the weakness of their imperial master.</p>
<p>And then soldiers commenced coming in from the
east, but not with the gay assurance of those who came
from the south and west &mdash; no, these others came in
covered wagons, blood-soaked and suffering.  They came
at first in little parties of eight or ten, and then they
came in fifties, in hundreds, and one day a thousand
maimed and dying men were carted into New Gondar.</p>
<p>It was then that Menelek XIV became uneasy.  For
fifty years his armies had conquered wherever they had
marched.  At first he had led them in person, lately his
presence within a hundred miles of the battle line had
been sufficient for large engagements &mdash; for minor ones
only the knowledge that they were fighting for the glory
of their sovereign was necessary to win victories.</p>
<p>One morning, New Gondar was awakened by the
booming of cannon.  It was the first intimation that the
townspeople had received that the enemy was forcing
the imperial troops back upon the city.  Dust covered
couriers galloped in from the front.  Fresh troops
hastened from the city, and about noon Menelek rode out
surrounded by his staff.</p>
<p>For three days thereafter we could hear the
cannonading and the spitting of the small arms, for the
battle line was scarce two leagues from New Gondar.  The
city was filled with wounded.  Just outside, soldiers were
engaged in throwing up earthworks.  It was evident to
the least enlightened that Menelek expected further
reverses.</p>
<p>And then the imperial troops fell back upon these
new defenses, or, rather, they were forced back by the
enemy.  Shells commenced to fall within the city.
Menelek returned and took up his headquarters in the stone

<pb n="116"/>
building that was called the palace.  That night came a
lull in the hostilities &mdash; a truce had been arranged.</p>
<p>Colonel Belik summoned me about seven o'clock to
dress him for a function at the palace.  In the midst of
death and defeat the emperor was about to give a great
banquet to his officers.  I was to accompany my master
and wait upon him &mdash; I, Jefferson Turck, lieutenant in the
Pan-American navy!</p>
<p>In the privacy of the colonel's quarters I had become
accustomed to my menial duties, lightened as they were
by the natural kindliness of my master, but the thought
of appearing in public as a common slave revolted every
fine instinct within me.  Yet there was nothing for it but
to obey.</p>
<p>I cannot, even now, bring myself to a narration of
the humiliation which I experienced that night as I stood
behind my black master in silent servility, now pouring
his wine, now cutting up his meats for him, now fanning
him with a large, plumed fan of feathers.</p>
<p>As fond as I had grown of him, I could have thrust a
knife into him, so keenly did I feel the affront that had
been put upon me.  But at last the long banquet was
concluded.  The tables were removed.  The emperor
ascended a dais at one end of the room and seated himself
upon a throne, and the entertainment commenced.  It
was only what ancient history might have led me to
expect &mdash; musicians, dancing girls, jugglers, and the like.</p>
<p>Near midnight, the master of ceremonies announced
that the slave women who had been presented to the
emperor since his arrival in New Gondar would be
exhibited, that the royal host would select such as he
wished, after which he would present the balance of
them to his guests.  Ah, what royal generosity!</p>
<p>A small door at one side of the room opened, and
the poor creatures filed in and were ranged in a long

<pb n="117"/>
line before the throne.  Their backs were toward me.  I
saw only an occasional profile as now and then a bolder
spirit among them turned to survey the apartment and
the gorgeous assemblage of officers in their brilliant
dress uniforms.  They were profiles of young girls, and
pretty, but horror was indelibly stamped upon them all.
I shuddered as I contemplated their sad fate, and turned
my eyes away.</p>
<p>I heard the master of ceremonies command them to
prostrate themselves before the emperor, and the sounds
as they went upon their knees before him, touching their
foreheads to the floor.  Then came the official's voice
again, in sharp and peremptory command.</p>
<p>"Down, slave!" he cried.  "Make obeisance to your
sovereign!"</p>
<p>I looked up, attracted by the tone of the man's voice,
to see a single, straight, slim figure standing erect in
the center of the line of prostrate girls, her arms folded
across her breast and little chin in the air.  Her back was
toward me &mdash; I could not see her face, though I should
like to see the countenance of this savage young lioness,
standing there defiant among that herd of terrified
sheep.</p>
<p>"Down!  Down!" shouted the master of ceremonies,
taking a step toward her and half drawing his sword.</p>
<p>My blood boiled.  To stand there, inactive, while a
negro struck down that brave girl of my own race!
Instinctively I took a forward step to place myself in the
man's path.  But at the same instant Menelek raised his
hand in a gesture that halted the officer.  The emperor
seemed interested, but in no way angered at the girl's
attitude.</p>
<p>"Let us inquire," he said in a smooth, pleasant voice,
"why this young woman refuses to do homage to her

<pb n="118"/>
sovereign," and he put the question himself directly to
her.</p>
<p>She answered him in Abyssinian, but brokenly and
with an accent that betrayed how recently she had
acquired her slight knowledge of the tongue.</p>
<p>"I go on my knees to no one," she said.  "I have no
sovereign.  I myself am sovereign in my own country."</p>
<p>Menelek, at her words, leaned back in his throne and
laughed uproariously.  Following his example, which
seemed always the correct procedure, the assembled
guests vied with one another in an effort to laugh more
noisily than the emperor.</p>
<p>The girl but tilted her chin a bit higher in the air &mdash;
even her back proclaimed her utter contempt for her
captors.  Finally Menelek restored quiet by the simple
expedient of a frown, whereupon each loyal guest
exchanged his mirthful mien for an emulative scowl.</p>
<p>"And who," asked Menelek, "are you, and by what
name is your country called?"</p>
<p>"I am Victory, Queen of Grabritin," replied the girl
so quickly and so unexpectedly that I gasped in
astonishment.</p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="9" id="d11"><pb n="119"/>
<p>VICTORY!  SHE WAS HERE, A SLAVE TO THESE
black conquerors.  Once more I started toward her, but
better judgment held me back &mdash; I could do nothing to
help her other than by stealth.  Could I even accomplish
aught by this means?  I did not know.  It seemed beyond
the pale of possibility, and yet I should try.</p>
<p>"And you will not bend the knee to me?" continued
Menelek, after she had spoken.  Victory shook her head
in a most decided negation.</p>
<p>"You shall be my first choice, then," said the
emperor.  "I like your spirit, for the breaking of it will
add to my pleasure in you, and never fear but that it shall
be broken &mdash; this very night.  Take her to my apartments,"
and he motioned to an officer at his side</p>
<p>I was surprised to see Victory follow the man off in
apparent quiet submission.  I tried to follow, that I might
be near her against some opportunity to speak with her
or assist in her escape.  But, after I had followed them
from the throne room, through several other apartments,
and down a long corridor, I found my further
progress barred by a soldier who stood guard before a
doorway through which the officer conducted Victory.</p>
<p>Almost immediately the officer reappeared and started
back in the direction of the throne room.  I had been
hiding in a doorway after the guard had turned me back,

<pb n="120"/>
having taken refuge there while his back was turned,
and, as the officer approached me, I withdrew into the
room beyond, which was in darkness.  There I remained
for a long time, watching the sentry before the door of
the room in which Victory was a prisoner, and awaiting
some favorable circumstance which would give me entry
to her.</p>
<p>I have not attempted to fully describe my sensations
at the moment I recognized Victory, because, I can
assure you, they were entirely indescribable.  I should
never have imagined that the sight of any human being
could affect me as had this unexpected discovery of
Victory in the same room in which I was, while I had
thought of her for weeks either as dead, or at best
 hundreds of miles to the west, and as irretrievably lost to
me as though she were, in truth, dead.</p>
<p>I was filled with a strange, mad impulse to be near
her.  It was not enough merely to assist her, or protect
her &mdash; I desired to touch her &mdash; to take her in my arms.  I
was astounded at myself.  Another thing puzzled me &mdash;
it was my incomprehensible feeling of elation since I
had again seen her.  With a fate worse than death staring
her in the face, and with the knowledge that I should
probably die defending her within the hour, I was still
happier than I had been for weeks &mdash; and all because I
had seen again for a few brief minutes the figure of a
little heathen maiden.  I couldn't account for it, and it
angered me; I had never before felt any such sensations
in the presence of a woman, and I had made love to
some very beautiful ones in my time.</p>
<p>It seemed ages that I stood in the shadow of that
doorway, in the ill-lit corridor of the palace of Menelek
XIV.  A sickly gas jet cast a sad pallor upon the black
face of the sentry.  The fellow seemed rooted to the

<pb n="121"/>
spot.  Evidently he would never leave, or turn his back
again.</p>
<p>I had been in hiding but a short time when I heard
the sound of distant cannon.  The truce had ended, and
the battle had been resumed.  Very shortly thereafter the
earth shook to the explosion of a shell within the city,
and from time to time thereafter other shells burst at no
great distance from the palace.  The yellow men were
bombarding New Gondar again.</p>
<p>Presently officers and slaves commenced to traverse
the corridor on matters pertaining to their duties, and
then came the emperor, scowling and wrathful.  He was
followed by a few personal attendants, whom he dismissed
at the doorway to his apartments &mdash; the same
doorway through which Victory had been taken.  I
chafed to follow him, but the corridor was filled with
people.  At last they betook themselves to their own
apartments, which lay upon either side of the corridor.</p>
<p>An officer and a slave entered the very room in which
I hid, forcing me to flatten myself to one side in the
darkness until they had passed.  Then the slave made a
light, and I knew that I must find another hiding place.</p>
<p>Stepping boldly into the corridor, I saw that it was
now empty save for the single sentry before the emperor's
door.  He glanced up as I emerged from the room,
the occupants of which had not seen me.  I walked
straight toward the soldier, my mind made up in an
instant.  I tried to simulate an expression of cringing
servility, and I must have succeeded, for I entirely threw
the man off his guard, so that he permitted me to approach
within reach of his rifle before stopping me.
Then it was too late &mdash; for him.</p>
<p>Without a word or a warning, I snatched the piece
from his grasp, and, at the same time struck him a
terrific blow between the eyes with my clenched fist.

<pb n="122"/>
He staggered back in surprise, too dumbfounded even
to cry out, and then I clubbed his rifle and felled him
with a single mighty blow.</p>
<p>A moment later, I had burst into the room beyond.
It was empty!</p>
<p>I gazed about, mad with disappointment.  Two doors
opened from this to other rooms.  I ran to the nearer and
listened.  Yes, voices were coming from beyond and one
was a woman's, level and cold and filled with scorn.
There was no terror in it.  It was Victory's.</p>
<p>I turned the knob and pushed the door inward just in
time to see Menelek seize the girl and drag her toward
the far end of the apartment.  At the same instant there
was a deafening roar just outside the palace &mdash; a shell had
struck much nearer than any of its predecessors.  The
noise of it drowned my rapid rush across the room.</p>
<p>But in her struggles, Victory turned Menelek about
so that he saw me.  She was striking him in the face
with her clenched fist, and now he was choking her.</p>
<p>At sight of me, he gave voice to a roar of anger.f</p>
<p>"What means this, slave?" he cried.  "Out of here!
Out of here!  Quick, before I kill you!"</p>
<p>But for answer I rushed upon him, striking him with
the butt of the rifle.  He staggered back, dropping
Victory to the floor, and then he cried aloud for the
guard, and came at me.  Again and again I struck him; but
his thick skull might have been armor plate, for all the
damage I did it.</p>
<p>He tried to close with me, seizing the rifle, but I was
stronger than he, and, wrenching the weapon from his
grasp, tossed it aside and made for his throat with my
bare hands.  I had not dared fire the weapon for fear that
its report would bring the larger guard stationed at the
farther end of the corridor.</p>
<p>We struggled about the room, striking one another,

<pb n="123"/>
knocking over furniture, and rolling upon the floor.
Menelek was a powerful man, and he was fighting for
his life.  Continually he kept calling for the guard, until
I succeeded in getting a grip upon his throat; but it was
too late.  His cries had been heard, and suddenly the
door burst open, and a score of armed guardsmen
rushed into the apartment.</p>
<p>Victory seized the rifle from the floor and leaped
between me and them.  I had the black emperor upon his
back, and both my hands were at his throat, choking
the life from him.</p>
<p>The rest happened in the fraction of a second.  There
was a rending crash above us, then a deafening explosion
within the chamber.  Smoke and powder fumes
filled the room.  Half stunned, I rose from the lifeless
body of my antagonist just in time to see Victory stagger
to her feet and turn toward me.  Slowly the smoke
cleared to reveal the shattered remnants of the guard.
A shell had fallen through the palace roof and exploded
just in the rear of the detachment of guardsmen who
were coming to the rescue of their emperor.  Why neither
Victory nor I were struck is a miracle.  The room
was a wreck.  A great, jagged hole was torn in the ceiling,
and the wall toward the corridor had been blown
entirely out.</p>
<p>As I rose, Victory had risen, too, and started toward
me.  But when she saw that I was uninjured she stopped,
and stood there in the center of the demolished apartment
looking at me.  Her expression was inscrutable &mdash; I
could not guess whether she was glad to see me, or not.</p>
<p>"Victory!" I cried.  "Thank God that you are safe!"
And I approached her, a greater gladness in my heart
than I had felt since the moment that I knew the
<hi rend="italic">Coldwater</hi> must be swept beyond thirty.</p>

<pb n="124"/>
<p>There was no answering gladness in her eyes.  Instead,
she stamped her little foot in anger.</p>
<p>"Why did it have to be you who saved me!" she
exclaimed.  "I hate you!"</p>
<p>"Hate me?" I asked.  "Why should you hate me,
Victory?  I do not hate you.  I &mdash; I &mdash; "  What was I about
to say?  I was very close to her as a great light broke
over me.  Why had I never realized it before?  The truth
accounted for a great many hitherto inexplicable moods
that had claimed me from time to time since first I had
seen Victory.</p>
<p>"Why should I hate you?" she repeated.  "Because
Snider told me &mdash; he told me that you had promised me
to him, but he did not get me.  I killed him, as I should
like to kill you!"</p>
<p>"Snider lied!" I cried.  And then I seized her and
held her in my arms, and made her listen to me, though
she struggled and fought like a young lioness.  "I love
you, Victory.  You must know that I love you &mdash; that I
have always loved you, and that I never could have made
so base a promise."</p>
<p>She ceased her struggles, just a trifle, but still tried
to push me from her.  "You called me a barbarian!" she
said.</p>
<p>Ah, so that was it!  That still rankled.  I crushed her
to me.</p>
<p>"You could not love a barbarian," she went on, but
she had ceased to struggle.</p>
<p>"But I do love a barbarian, Victory!" I cried, "the
dearest barbarian in the world."</p>
<p>She raised her eyes to mine, and then her smooth,
brown arms encircled my neck and drew my lips down
to hers.</p>
<p>"I love you &mdash; I have loved you always!" she said, and
then she buried her face upon my shoulder and sobbed.

<pb n="125"/>
"I have been so unhappy," she said, "but I could not
die while I thought that you might live."</p>
<p>As we stood there, momentarily forgetful of all else
than our new found happiness, the ferocity of the
bombardment increased until scarce thirty seconds elapsed
between the shells that rained about the palace.</p>
<p>To remain long would be to invite certain death.  We
could not escape the way that we had entered the
apartment, for not only was the corridor now choked with
debris, but beyond the corridor there were doubtless
many members of the emperor's household who would
stop us.</p>
<p>Upon the opposite side of the room was another door,
and toward this I led the way.  It opened into a third
apartment with windows overlooking an inner court.
>From one of these windows I surveyed the courtyard.
Apparently it was empty, and the rooms upon the opposite
side were unlighted.</p>
<p>Assisting Victory to the open, I followed, and together
we crossed the court, discovering upon the opposite side
a number of wide, wooden doors set in the wall of the
palace, with small windows between.  As we stood close
behind one of the doors, listening, a horse within neighed.</p>
<p>"The stables!" I whispered, and, a moment later,
had pushed back a door and entered.  From the city
about us we could hear the din of great commotion, and
quite close the sounds of battle &mdash; the crack of thousands
of rifles, the yells of the soldiers, the hoarse commands
of officers, and the blare of bugles.</p>
<p>The bombardment had ceased as suddenly as it had
commenced.  I judged that the enemy was storming the
city, for the sounds we heard were the sounds of
hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>Within the stables I groped about until I had found
saddles and bridles for two horses.  But afterward, in

<pb n="126"/>
the darkness, I could find but a single mount.  The doors
of the opposite side, leading to the street, were open,
and we could see great multitudes of men, women, and
children fleeing toward the west.  Soldiers, afoot and
mounted, were joining the mad exodus.  Now and then
a camel or an elephant would pass bearing some officer
or dignitary to safety.  It was evident that the city would
fall at any moment &mdash; a fact which was amply proclaimed
by the terror-stricken haste of the fear-mad
mob.</p>
<p>Horse, camel, and elephant trod helpless women and
children beneath their feet.  A common soldier dragged
a general from his mount, and, leaping to the animal's
back, fled down the packed street toward the west.  A
woman seized a gun and brained a court dignitary,
whose horse had trampled her child to death.  Shrieks,
curses, commands, supplications filled the air.  It was a
frightful scene &mdash; one that will be burned upon my memory
forever.</p>
<p>I had saddled and bridled the single horse which had
evidently been overlooked by the royal household in its
flight, and, standing a little back in the shadow of the
stable's interior, Victory and I watched the surging
throng without.</p>
<p>To have entered it would have been to have courted
greater danger than we were already in.  We decided to
wait until the stress of blacks thinned, and for more
than an hour we stood there while the sounds of battle
raged upon the eastern side of the city and the
population flew toward the west.  More and more numerous
became the uniformed soldiers among the fleeing
throng, until, toward the last, the street was packed
with them.  It was no orderly retreat, but a rout,
complete and terrible.</p>
<p>The fighting was steadily approaching us now, until

<pb n="127"/>
the crack of rifles sounded in the very street upon which
we were looking.  And then came a handful of brave
men &mdash; a little rear guard backing slowly toward the west,
working their smoking rifles in feverish haste as they
fired volley after volley at the foe we could not see.</p>
<p>But these were pressed back and back until the first
line of the enemy came opposite our shelter.  They were
men of medium height, with olive complexions and
almond eyes.  In them I recognized the descendants of the
ancient Chinese race.</p>
<p>They were well uniformed and superbly armed, and
they fought bravely and under perfect discipline.  So rapt
was I in the exciting events transpiring in the street that
I did not hear the approach of a body of men from
behind.  It was a party of the conquerors who had
entered the palace and were searching it.</p>
<p>They came upon us so unexpectedly that we were
prisoners before we realized what had happened.  That
night we were held under a strong guard just outside
the eastern wall of the city, and the next morning were
started upon a long march toward the east.</p>
<p>Our captors were not unkind to us, and treated the
women prisoners with respect.  We marched for many
days &mdash; so many that I lost count of them &mdash; and at last we
came to another city &mdash; a Chinese city this time &mdash; which
stands upon the site of ancient Moscow.</p>
<p>It is only a small frontier city, but it is well built and
well kept.  Here a large military force is maintained,
and here also, is a terminus of the railroad that crosses
modern China to the Pacific.</p>
<p>There was every evidence of a high civilization in all
that we saw within the city, which, in connection with
the humane treatment that had been accorded all prisoners
upon the long and tiresome march, encouraged

<pb n="128"/>
me to hope that I might appeal to some high officer
here for the treatment which my rank and birth merited.</p>
<p>We could converse with our captors only through the
medium of interpreters who spoke both Chinese and
Abyssinian.  But there were many of these, and shortly
after we reached the city I persuaded one of them to
carry a verbal message to the officer who had commanded
the troops during the return from New Gondar,
asking that I might be given a hearing by some high
official.</p>
<p>The reply to my request was a summons to appear
before the officer to whom I had addressed my appeal.  A
sergeant came for me along with the interpreter, and I
managed to obtain his permission to let Victory
accompany me &mdash; I had never left her alone with the
prisoners since we had been captured.</p>
<p>To my delight I found that the officer into whose
presence we were conducted spoke Abyssinian fluently.  He
was astounded when I told him that I was a Pan-American.
Unlike all others whom I had spoken with
since my arrival in Europe, he was well acquainted with
ancient history &mdash; was familiar with twentieth century
conditions in Pan-America, and after putting a half
dozen questions to me was satisfied that I spoke the
truth.</p>
<p>When I told him that Victory was Queen of England
he showed little surprise, telling me that in their recent
explorations in ancient Russia they had found many
descendants of the old nobility and royalty.</p>
<p>He immediately set aside a comfortable house for us,
furnished us with servants and with money, and in other
ways showed us every attention and kindness.</p>
<p>He told me that he would telegraph his emperor at
once, and the result was that we were presently commanded

<pb n="129"/>
to repair to Peking and present ourselves before
the ruler.</p>
<p>We made the journey in a comfortable railway
carriage, through a country which, as we traveled farther
toward the east, showed increasing evidence of
prosperity and wealth.</p>
<p>At the imperial court we were received with great
kindness, the emperor being most inquisitive about the
state of modern Pan-America.  He told me that while he
personally deplored the existence of the strict
regulations which had raised a barrier between the east and
the west, he had felt, as had his predecessors, that
recognition of the wishes of the great Pan-American
federation would be most conducive to the continued peace
of the world.</p>
<p>His empire includes all of Asia, and the islands of
the Pacific as far east as 175dW.  The empire of Japan
no longer exists, having been conquered and absorbed
by China over a hundred years ago.  The Philippines are
well administered, and constitute one of the most
progressive colonies of the Chinese empire.</p>
<p>The emperor told me that the building of this great
empire and the spreading of enlightenment among its
diversified and savage peoples had required all the best
efforts of nearly two hundred years.  Upon his accession
to the throne he had found the labor well nigh perfected
and had turned his attention to the reclamation of
Europe.</p>
<p>His ambition is to wrest it from the hands of the
blacks, and then to attempt the work of elevating its
fallen peoples to the high estate from which the Great
War precipitated them.</p>
<p>I asked him who was victorious in that war, and he
shook his head sadly as he replied:</p>
<p>"Pan-America, perhaps, and China, with the blacks

<pb n="130"/>
of Abyssinia," he said.  "Those who did not fight were
the only ones to reap any of the rewards that are
supposed to belong to victory.  The combatants reaped
naught but annihilation.  You have seen &mdash; better than any
man you must realize that there was no victory for any
nation embroiled in that frightful war."</p>
<p>"When did it end?" I asked him.</p>
<p>Again he shook his head.  "It has not ended yet.  There
has never been a formal peace declared in Europe.
After a while there were none left to make peace, and the
rude tribes which sprang from the survivors continued
to fight among themselves because they knew no better
condition of society.  War razed the works of man &mdash; war
and pestilence razed man.  God give that there shall
never be such another war!"</p>
<p>You all know how Porfirio Johnson returned to
Pan-America with John Alvarez in chains; how Alvarez's
trial raised a popular demonstration that the government
could not ignore.  His eloquent appeal &mdash; not for himself,
but for me &mdash; is historic, as are its results.  You know how
a fleet was sent across the Atlantic to search for me,
how the restrictions against crossing thirty to one
hundred seventy-five were removed forever, and how the
officers were brought to Peking, arriving upon the very
day that Victory and I were married at the imperial
court.</p>
<p>My return to Pan-America was very different from
anything I could possibly have imagined a year before.
Instead of being received as a traitor to my country, I
was acclaimed a hero.  It was good to get back again,
good to witness the kindly treatment that was accorded
my dear Victory, and when I learned that Delcarte and
Taylor had been found at the mouth of the Rhine and
were already back in Pan-America my joy was unalloyed.</p>

<pb n="131"/>
<p>And now we are going back, Victory and I, with the
men and the munitions and power to reclaim England
for her queen.  Again I shall cross thirty, but under what
altered conditions!</p>
<p>A new epoch for Europe is inaugurated, with
enlightened China on the east and enlightened Pan-America
on the west &mdash; the two great peace powers whom God
has preserved to regenerate chastened and forgiven
Europe.  I have been through much &mdash; I have suffered much,
but I have won two great laurel wreaths beyond thirty.
One is the opportunity to rescue Europe from barbarism,
the other is a little barbarian, and the greater of
these is &mdash; Victory.</p>
