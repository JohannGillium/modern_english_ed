<head>THE TWENTY-FIRST OF OCTOBER</head>

<pb n="3"/>

<p>IN the matter of general culture and attainments, we
youngsters stood on pretty level ground.  True, it was always
happening that one of us would be singled out at any moment,
freakishly, and without regard to his own preferences, to wrestle
with the inflections of some idiotic language long rightly dead;
while another, from some fancied artistic tendency which always
failed to justify itself, might be told off without warning to
hammer out scales and exercises, and to bedew the senseless keys
with tears of weariness or of revolt.  But in subjects common to
either sex, and held to be

<pb n="4"/>
necessary even for him whose ambition soared no higher than to
crack a whip in a circus-ring&mdash;in geography, for instance,
arithmetic, or the weary doings of kings and queens&mdash;each would
have scorned to excel.  And, indeed, whatever our individual
gifts, a general dogged determination to shirk and to evade kept
us all at much the same dead level,&mdash;a level of ignorance
tempered by insubordination.
</p>
<p>Fortunately there existed a wide range of subjects, of
healthier tone than those already enumerated, in which we were
free to choose for ourselves, and which we would have scorned to
consider education; and in these we freely followed each his own
particular line, often attaining an amount of special knowledge
which struck our ignorant elders as simply uncanny.  For Edward,
the uniforms, accoutrements, colours, and mottoes of the
regiments composing the British Army

<pb n="5"/>
had a special glamour.  In the matter of facings he was simply
faultless; among chevrons, badges, medals, and stars, he moved
familiarly; he even knew the names of most of the colonels in
command; and he would squander sunny hours prone on the lawn,
heedless of challenge from bird or beast, poring over a tattered
Army List.  My own accomplishment was of another character&mdash;took,
as it seemed to me, a wider and a
more untrammelled range.  Dragoons might have swaggered in
Lincoln green, riflemen might have donned sporrans over tartan
trews, without exciting notice or comment from me.  But did you
seek precise information as to the fauna of the American
continent, then you had come to the right shop.  Where and why
the bison "wallowed"; how beaver were to be trapped and wild
turkeys stalked; the grizzly and how to handle him, and the

<pb n="6"/>
pretty pressing ways of the constrictor,&mdash;in fine, the haunts and
the habits of all that burrowed, strutted, roared, or wriggled
between the Atlantic and the Pacific,&mdash;all this knowledge I took
for my province.  By the others my equipment was fully
recognized.  Supposing a book with a bear-hunt in it made its way
into the house, and the atmosphere was electric with excitement;
still, it was necessary that I should first decide whether the
slot had been properly described and properly followed up, ere
the work could be stamped with full approval.  A writer might
have won fame throughout the civilized globe for his trappers and
his realistic backwoods, and all went for nothing.  If his
pemmican were not properly compounded I damned his achievement,
and it was heard no more of.
</p>
<p>Harold was hardly old enough to possess a special subject of
his own.  He had

<pb n="7"/>
his instincts, indeed, and at bird's-nesting they almost amounted
to prophecy.  Where we others only suspected eggs, surmised
possible eggs, hinted doubtfully at eggs in the neighbourhood,
Harold went straight for the right bush, bough, or hole as if he
carried a divining-rod.  But this faculty belonged to the class
of mere gifts, and was not to be ranked with Edward's lore
regarding facings, and mine as to the habits of prairie-dogs,
both gained by painful study and extensive travel in those
"realms of gold," the Army List and Ballantyne.
</p>
<p>Selina's subject, quite unaccountably, happened to be naval
history.  There is no laying down rules as to subjects; you just
possess them&mdash;or rather, they possess you&mdash;and their genesis or
protoplasm is rarely to be tracked down.  Selina had never so
much as seen the sea; but for that matter neither had I

<pb n="8"/>
ever set foot on the American continent, the by-ways of which I
knew so intimately.  And just as I, if set down without warning
in the middle of the Rocky Mountains, would have been perfectly
at home, so Selina, if a genie had dropped her suddenly on
Portsmouth Hard, could have given points to most of its
frequenters.  From the days of Blake down to the death of Nelson
(she never condescended further) Selina had taken spiritual part
in every notable engagement of the British Navy; and even in the
dark days when she had to pick up skirts and flee, chased by an
ungallant De Ruyter or Van Tromp, she was yet cheerful in the
consciousness that ere long she would be gleefully hammering the
fleets of the world, in the glorious times to follow.  When that
golden period arrived, Selina was busy indeed; and, while loving
best to stand where the splinters were flying the thickest.

<pb n="9"/>
she was also a careful and critical student of seamanship and of
man&oelig;uvre.  She knew the order in which the great line-of-battle ships moved into action, the vessels they respectively
engaged, the moment when each let go its anchor, and which of
them had a spring on its cable (while not understanding the
phrase, she carefully noted the fact); and she habitually went
into an engagement on the quarter-deck of the gallant ship that
reserved its fire the longest.
</p>
<p>At the time of Selina's weird seizure I was unfortunately away
from home, on a loathsome visit to an aunt; and my account is
therefore feebly compounded from hearsay.  It was an absence I
never ceased to regret&mdash;scoring it up, with a sense of injury,
against the aunt.  There was a splendid uselessness about the
whole performance that specially appealed to my artistic sense.
That it should have

<pb n="10"/>
been Selina, too, who should break out this way&mdash;Selina, who had
just become a regular subscriber to the "Young Ladies' Journal,"
and who allowed herself to be taken out to strange teas with an
air of resignation palpably assumed&mdash;this was a special joy, and
served to remind me that much of this dreaded convention that was
creeping over us might be, after all, only veneer.  Edward also
was absent, getting licked into shape at school; but to him the
loss was nothing.  With his stern practical bent he wouldn't have
seen any sense in it&mdash;to recall one of his favourite expressions.
To Harold, however, for
whom the gods had always cherished a special tenderness, it was
granted, not only to witness, but also, priestlike, to feed the
sacred fire itself.  And if at the time he paid the penalty
exacted by the sordid unimaginative ones who temporarily rule the
roast, he must ever after, one feels

<pb n="11"/>
sure, have carried inside him some of the white gladness of the
acolyte who, greatly privileged, has been permitted to swing a
censer at the sacring of the very Mass.
</p>
<p>October was mellowing fast, and with it the year itself; full
of tender hints, in woodland and hedgerow, of a course well-nigh
completed.  From all sides that still afternoon you caught the
quick breathing and sob of the runner nearing the goal.
Preoccupied and possessed, Selina had strayed down the garden and
out into the pasture beyond, where, on a bit of rising ground
that dominated the garden on one side and the downs with the old
coach-road on the other, she had cast herself down to chew the
cud of fancy.  There she was presently joined by Harold,
breathless and very full of his latest grievance.
</p>
<p>"I asked him not to," he burst out.  "I said if he'd only
please wait a bit and Edward would be back soon, and it

<pb n="12"/>
couldn't matter to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, and the pig
wouldn't mind, and Edward'd be pleased and everybody'd be happy.
But he just said he was very sorry, but bacon didn't wait for
nobody.  So I told him he was a regular beast, and then I came
away.  And&mdash;and I b'lieve they're doing it now!"
</p>
<p>"Yes, he's a beast," agreed Selina, absently.  She had
forgotten all about the pig-killing.  Harold kicked away a
freshly thrown-up mole-hill, and prodded down the hole with a
stick.  From the direction of Farmer Larkin's demesne came a
long-drawn note of sorrow, a thin cry and appeal, telling that
the stout soul of a black Berkshire pig was already faring down
the stony track to Hades.
</p>
<p>"D'you know what day it is?" said Selina presently, in a low
voice, looking far away before her.
</p>
<p>Harold did not appear to know, nor yet

<pb n="13"/>
to care.  He had laid open his mole-run for a yard or so, and was
still grubbing at it absorbedly.
</p>
<p>"It's Trafalgar Day," went on Selina, trancedly; "Trafalgar
Day&mdash;and nobody cares!"
</p>
<p>Something in her tone told Harold that he was not behaving
quite becomingly.  He didn't exactly know in what manner; still,
he abandoned his mole-hunt for a more courteous attitude of
attention.
</p>
<p>"Over there," resumed Selina&mdash;she was gazing out in the
direction of the old highroad&mdash;"over there the coaches used to go
by.  Uncle Thomas was telling me about it the other day.  And the
people used to watch for 'em coming, to tell the time by, and
p'r'aps to get their parcels.  And one morning&mdash;they wouldn't be
expecting anything different&mdash;one morning, first there would be a
cloud of dust, as usual, and then the coach would come

<pb n="14"/>
racing by, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi> they would know!
For the coach would be dressed in laurel, all laurel from stem to
stern!  And the coachman would be wearing laurel, and the guard
would be wearing laurel; and then they would know, then they
would know!"
</p>
<p>Harold listened in respectful silence.  He would much rather
have been hunting the mole, who must have been a mile away by
this time if he had his wits about him.  But he had all the
natural instincts of a gentleman; of whom it is one of the principal
marks, if not the complete definition, never to show signs
of being bored.
</p>
<p>Selina rose to her feet, and paced the turf restlessly with a
short quarter-deck walk.
</p>
<p>"Why can't we <hi rend="italic">do</hi> something?" she
burst out presently.  <hi rend="italic">"He</hi>&mdash;he did
everything&mdash;why can't we do anything for him?"

<pb n="15"/>
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Who</hi> did everything?" inquired
Harold, meekly.  It was useless wasting further longings on that
mole.  Like the dead, he travelled fast.
</p>
<p>"Why, Nelson, of course," said Selina, shortly, still looking
restlessly around for help or suggestion.
</p>
<p>"But he's&mdash;he's <hi rend="italic">dead</hi>, isn't he?"
asked Harold, slightly puzzled.
</p>
<p>"What's that got to do with it?" retorted his sister, resuming
her caged-lion promenade.
</p>
<p>Harold was somewhat taken aback.  In the case of the pig, for
instance, whose last outcry had now passed into stillness, he had
considered the chapter as finally closed.  Whatever innocent
mirth the holidays might hold in store for Edward, that
particular pig, at least, would not be a contributor.  And now he
was given to understand that the situation had not materially
changed!  He would have to

<pb n="16"/>
revise his ideas, it seemed.  Sitting up on end, he looked
towards the garden for assistance in the task.  Thence, even as
he gazed, a tiny column of smoke rose straight up into the still
air.  The gardener had been sweeping that afternoon, and now, an
unconscious priest, was offering his sacrifice of autumn leaves
to the calm-eyed goddess of changing hues and chill forebodings
who was moving slowly about the land that golden afternoon.
Harold was up and off in a moment, forgetting Nelson, forgetting
the pig, the mole, the Larkin betrayal, and Selina's strange
fever of conscience.  Here was fire, real fire, to play with, and
that was even better than messing with water, or remodelling the
plastic surface of the earth.  Of all the toys the world provides
for right-minded persons, the original elements rank easily the
first.
</p>
<p>But Selina sat on where she was, her

<pb n="17"/>
chin on her fists; and her fancies whirled and drifted, here and
there, in curls and eddies, along with the smoke she was
watching.  As the quick-footed dusk of the short October day
stepped lightly over the garden, little red tongues of fire might
be seen to leap and vanish in the smoke.  Harold, anon staggering
under armfuls of leaves, anon stoking vigorously, was discernible
only at fitful intervals.  It was another sort of smoke that the
inner eye of Selina was looking upon,&mdash;a smoke that hung in
sullen banks round the masts and the hulls of the fighting ships;
a smoke from beneath which came thunder and the crash and the
splinter-rip, the shout of the boarding party, the choking sob of
the gunner stretched by his gun; a smoke from out of which at
last she saw, as through a riven pall, the radiant spirit of the
Victor, crowned with the coronal of a perfect

<pb n="18"/>
death, leap in full assurance up into the ether that Immortals
breathe.  The dusk was glooming towards darkness when she rose
and moved slowly down towards the beckoning fire; something of
the priestess in her stride, something of the devotee in the set
purpose of her eye.
</p>
<p>The leaves were well alight by this time, and Harold had just
added an old furze bush, which flamed and crackled stirringly.
</p>
<p>"Go 'n' get some more sticks," ordered Selina, "and shavings,
'n' chunks of wood, 'n' anything you can find.  Look here&mdash;in the
kitchen-garden there's a pile of old pea-sticks.  Fetch as many
as you can carry, and then go back and bring some more!"
</p>
<p>"But I say,&mdash;" began Harold, amazedly, scarce knowing his
sister, and with a vision of a frenzied gardener, pea-stickless
and threatening retribution.

<pb n="19"/>
</p>
<p>"Go and fetch 'em quick! " shouted Selina, stamping with
impatience.
</p>
<p>Harold ran off at once, true to the stern system of discipline
in which he had been nurtured.  But his eyes were like round O's,
and as he ran he talked fast to himself, in evident disorder of
mind.
</p>
<p>The pea-sticks made a rare blaze, and the fire, no longer
smouldering sullenly, leapt up and began to assume the appearance
of a genuine bonfire.  Harold, awed into silence at first, began
to jump round it with shouts of triumph.  Selina looked on
grimly, with knitted brow; she was not yet fully satisfied.
"Can't you get any more sticks?" she said presently.  "Go and
hunt about.  Get some old hampers and matting and things out of
the tool-house.  Smash up that old cucumber frame Edward shoved
you into, the day we were playing scouts and Mohicans.  Stop a

<pb n="20"/>
bit!  Hooray!  I know.  You come along with me."
</p>
<p>Hard by there was a hot-house, Aunt Eliza's special pride and
joy, and even grimly approved of by the gardener.  At one end, in
an out-house adjoining, the necessary firing was stored; and to
this sacred fuel, of which we were strictly forbidden to touch a
stick, Selina went straight.  Harold followed obediently,
prepared for any crime after that of the pea-sticks, but pinching
himself to see if he were really awake.
</p>
<p>"You bring some coals," said Selina briefly, without any
palaver or pro-and-con discussion.  "Here's a basket.
<hi rend="italic">I'll</hi> manage the faggots!"
</p>
<p>In a very few minutes there was little doubt about its being a
genuine bonfire and no paltry makeshift.  Selina, a M&aelig;nad
now, hatless and tossing disordered locks, all the dross of the
young lady purged

<pb n="21"/>
out of her, stalked around the pyre of her own purloining, or
prodded it with a pea-stick.  And as she prodded she murmured at
intervals, "I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> there was
something we could do!  It isn't much&mdash;but still it's
<hi rend="italic">something!"</hi>
</p>
<p>The gardener had gone home to his tea.  Aunt Eliza had driven
out for hers a long way off, and was not expected back till quite
late; and this far end of the garden was not overlooked by any
windows.  So the Tribute blazed on merrily unchecked.  Villagers
far away, catching sight of the flare, muttered something about
"them young devils at their tricks again," and trudged on beer-wards.  Never a thought of what day it was, never a thought for
Nelson, who preserved their honest pint-pots, to be paid for in
honest pence, and saved them from
<hi rend="italic">litres</hi> and decimal coinage.  Nearer at
hand, frightened rabbits popped up and vanished with a flick of

<pb n="22"/>
white tails; scared birds fluttered among the branches, or sped
across the glade to quieter sleeping-quarters; but never a bird
nor a beast gave a thought to the hero to whom they owed it that
each year their little homes of horsehair, wool, or moss, were
safe stablished 'neath the flap of the British flag; and that
Game Laws, quietly permanent, made <hi rend="italic">la
chasse</hi> a terror only to their betters.  No one seemed to
know, nor to care, nor to sympathise.  In all the ecstasy of her
burnt-offering and sacrifice, Selina stood alone.
</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;not quite alone!  For, as the fire was roaring at its
best, certain stars stepped delicately forth on the surface of
the immensity above, and peered down doubtfully&mdash;with wonder at
first, then with interest, then with recognition, with a start of
glad surprise.  <hi rend="italic">They</hi> at least knew
all about it, <hi rend="italic">they</hi> understood.  Among
<hi rend="italic">them</hi> the Name was a daily

<pb n="23"/>
familiar word; his story was a part of the music to which they
swung, himself was their fellow and their mate and comrade.  So
they peeped, and winked, and peeped again, and called to their
laggard brothers to come quick and see.

<lb/>.   .   .   .   .   .   . <lb/>
</p>

<p>"The best of life is but intoxication;" and Selina, who during
her brief inebriation had lived in an ecstasy as golden as our
drab existence affords, had to experience the inevitable
bitterness of awakening sobriety, when the dying down of the
flames into sullen embers coincided with the frenzied entrance of
Aunt Eliza on the scene.  It was not so much that she was at once
and forever disrated, broke, sent before the mast, and branded as
one on whom no reliance could be placed, even with Edward safe at
school, and myself under the distant vigilance of an aunt; that
her pocket money was stopped

<pb n="24"/>
indefinitely, and her new Church Service, the pride of her last
birthday, removed from her own custody and placed under the
control of a Trust.  She sorrowed rather because she had dragged
poor Harold, against his better judgment, into a most horrible
scrape, and moreover because, when the reaction had fairly set
in, when the exaltation had fizzled away and the young-lady
portion of her had crept timorously back to its wonted lodging,
she could only see herself as a plain fool, unjustified,
undeniable, without a shadow of an excuse or explanation.
</p>
<p>As for Harold, youth and a short memory made his case less
pitiful than it seemed to his more sensitive sister.  True, he
started upstairs to his lonely cot bellowing dismally, before him
a dreary future of pains and penalties, sufficient to last to the
crack of doom.  Outside his door, however, he tumbled over
Augustus

<pb n="25"/>

the cat, and made capture of him; and at once his mourning was
changed into a song of triumph, as he conveyed his prize into
port.  For Augustus, who detested above all things going to bed
with little boys, was ever more knave than fool, and the trapper
who was wily enough to ensnare him had achieved something
notable.  Augustus, when he realized that his fate was sealed,
and his night's lodging settled, wisely made the best of things,
and listened, with a languorous air of complete comprehension, to
the incoherent babble concerning pigs and heroes, moles and
bonfires, which served Harold for a self-sung lullaby.  Yet it
may be doubted whether Augustus was one of those rare fellows who
thoroughly understood.
</p>
<p>But Selina knew no more of this source of consolation than of
the sympathy with which the stars were winking above her; and it
was only after some sad interval of

<pb n="26"/>
time, and on a very moist pillow, that she drifted into that
quaint inconsequent country where you may meet your own pet hero
strolling down the road, and commit what hair-brained oddities
you like, and everybody understands and appreciates.

<p>THOSE memorable days that move in procession, their heads just
out of the mist of years long dead&mdash;the most of them are full-eyed as the dandelion that from dawn to shade has steeped itself
in sunlight.  Here and there in their ranks, however, moves a
forlorn one who is blind&mdash;blind in the sense of the dulled
window-pane on which the pelting raindrops have mingled and run
down, obscuring sunshine and the circling birds, happy fields,
and storied garden; blind with the spatter of a misery uncomprehended,
unanalysed, only felt as something corporeal in its
buffeting effects.

half the trouble of it&mdash;no solid person stood full in view, to be
blamed and to make atonement.  There was only a wretched,
impalpable condition to deal with.  Breakfast was just over; the
sun was summoning us, imperious as a herald with clamour of
trumpet; I ran upstairs to her with a broken bootlace in my hand,
and there she was, crying in a corner, her head in her apron.
Nothing could be got from her but the same dismal succession of
sobs that would not have done, that struck and hurt like a
physical beating; and meanwhile the sun was getting impatient,
and I wanted my bootlace.
</p>
<p>Inquiry below stairs revealed the cause.  Martha's brother was
dead, it seemed&mdash;her sailor brother Billy; drowned in one of
those strange far-off seas it was our dream to navigate one day.
We had known Billy well, and appreciated him.  When an
approaching visit of Billy to


<pb n="31"/>
his sister had been announced, we had counted the days to it.
When his cheery voice was at last heard in the kitchen and we had
descended with shouts, first of all he had to exhibit his
tattooed arms, always a subject for fresh delight and envy and
awe; then he was called upon for tricks, jugglings, and strange,
fearful gymnastics; and lastly came yarns, and more yarns, and
yarns till bedtime.  There had never been any one like Billy in
his own particular sphere; and now he was drowned, they said, and
Martha was miserable, and&mdash;and I couldn't get a new bootlace.
They told me that Billy would never come back any more, and I
stared out of the window at the sun which came back, right
enough, every day, and their news conveyed nothing whatever to
me.  Martha's sorrow hit home a little, but only because the
actual sight and sound of it gave me a dull, bad sort of pain low
down


<pb n="32"/>
inside&mdash;a pain not to be actually located.  Moreover, I was still
wanting my bootlace.
</p>
<p>This was a poor sort of a beginning to a day that, so far as
outside conditions went, had promised so well.  I rigged up a
sort of jurymast of a bootlace with a bit of old string, and
wandered off to look up the girls, conscious of a jar and a
discordance in the scheme of things.  The moment I entered the
schoolroom something in the air seemed to tell me that here, too,
matters were strained and awry.  Selina was staring listlessly
out of the window, one foot curled round her leg.  When I spoke
to her she jerked a shoulder testily, but did not condescend to
the civility of a reply.  Charlotte, absolutely unoccupied,
sprawled in a chair, and there were signs of sniffles about her,
even at that early hour.  It was but a trifling matter that had
caused all this electricity in the atmosphere, and


<pb n="33"/>
the girls' manner of taking it seemed to me most unreasonable.
Within the last few days the time had come round for the despatch
of a hamper to Edward at school.  Only one hamper a term was
permitted him, so its preparation was a sort of blend of revelry
and religious ceremony.  After the main corpus of the thing had
been carefully selected and safely bestowed&mdash;the pots of jam, the
cake, the sausages, and the apples that filled up corners so
nicely&mdash;after the last package had been wedged in, the girls had
deposited their own private and personal offerings on the top.  I
forget their precise nature; anyhow, they were nothing of any
particular practical use to a boy.  But they had involved some
contrivance and labour, some skimping of pocket money, and much
delightful cloud-building as to the effect on their enraptured
recipient.  Well, yesterday


<pb n="34"/>
there had come a terse acknowledgment from Edward, heartily
commending the cakes and the jam, stamping the sausages with the
seal of Smith major's approval, and finally hinting that, fortified
as he now was, nothing more was necessary but a remittance
of five shillings in postage stamps to enable him to face the
world armed against every buffet of fate.  That was all.  Never a
word or a hint of the personal tributes or of his appreciation of
them.  To us&mdash;to Harold and me, that is&mdash;the letter seemed
natural and sensible enough.  After all, provender was the main
thing, and five shillings stood for a complete equipment against
the most unexpected turns of luck.  The presents were very well
in their way&mdash;very nice, and so on&mdash;but life was a serious
matter, and the contest called for cakes and half crowns to carry
it on, not gew-gaws and


<pb n="35"/>
knitted mittens and the like.  The girls, however, in their
obstinate way, persisted in taking their own view of the slight.
Hence it was that I received my second rebuff of the morning.
</p>
<p>Somewhat disheartened, I made my way downstairs and out into
the sunlight, where I found Harold playing conspirators by
himself on the gravel.  He had dug a small hole in the walk and
had laid an imaginary train of powder thereto; and, as he sought
refuge in the laurels from the inevitable explosion, I heard him
murmur:  "`My God!' said the Czar, `my plans are frustrated!'"
It seemed an excellent occasion for being a black puma.  Harold
liked black pumas, on the whole, as well as any animal we were
familiar with.  So I launched myself on him, with the appropriate
howl, rolling him over on the gravel.
</p>
<p>Life may be said to be composed of


<pb n="36"/>
things that come off and things that don't come off.  This thing,
unfortunately, was one of the things that didn't come off.  From
beneath me I heard a shrill cry of, "Oh, it's my sore knee!"  And
Harold wriggled himself free from the puma's clutches, bellowing
dismally.  Now, I honestly didn't know he had a sore knee, and,
what's more, he knew I didn't know he had a sore knee.  According
to boy ethics, therefore, his attitude was wrong, sore knee or
not, and no apology was due from me.  I made half-way advances,
however, suggesting we should lie in ambush by the edge of the
pond and cut off the ducks as they waddled down in simple,
unsuspecting single file; then hunt them as bisons flying
scattered over the vast prairie.  A fascinating pursuit this, and
strictly illicit.  But Harold would none of my overtures, and
retreated to the house wailing with full lungs.


<pb n="37"/>
</p>
<p>Things were getting simply infernal.  I struck out blindly for
the open country; and even as I made for the gate a shrill voice
from a window bade me keep off the flower-beds.  When the gate
had swung to behind me with a vicious click I felt better, and
after ten minutes along the road it began to grow on me that some
radical change was needed, that I was in a blind alley, and that
this intolerable state of things must somehow cease.  All that I
could do I had already done.  As well-meaning a fellow as ever
stepped was pounding along the road that day, with an exceeding
sore heart; one who only wished to live and let live, in touch
with his fellows, and appreciating what joys life had to offer.
What was wanted now was a complete change of environment.  Some
where in the world, I felt sure, justice and sympathy still
resided.  There were places called pampas, for instance, that
sounded


<pb n="38"/>
well.  League upon league of grass, with just an occasional wild
horse, and not a relation within the horizon!  To a bruised
spirit this seemed a sane and a healing sort of existence.  There
were other pleasant corners, again, where you dived for pearls
and stabbed sharks in the stomach with your big knife.  No
relations would be likely to come interfering with you when thus
blissfully occupied.  And yet I did not wish&mdash;just yet&mdash;to have
done with relations entirely.  They should be made to feel their
position first, to see themselves as they really were, and to
wish&mdash;when it was too late&mdash;that they had behaved more properly.
</p>
<p>Of all professions, the army seemed to lend itself the most
thoroughly to the scheme.  You enlisted, you followed the drum,
you marched, fought, and ported arms, under strange skies,
through unrecorded years.  At last, at long last, your


<pb n="39"/>
opportunity would come, when the horrors of war were flickering
through the quiet country-side where you were cradled and bred,
but where the memory of you had long been dim.  Folk would run
together, clamorous, palsied with fear; and among the terror-stricken groups would figure certain aunts.  "What hope is left
us?" they would ask themselves, "save in the clemency of the
General, the mysterious, invincible General, of whom men tell
such romantic tales?"  And the army would march in, and the guns
would rattle and leap along the village street, and, last of all,
you&mdash;you, the General, the fabled hero&mdash;you would enter, on your
coal-black charger, your pale set face seamed by an interesting
sabre-cut.  And then&mdash;but every boy has rehearsed this familiar
piece a score of times.  You are magnanimous, in fine&mdash;that goes
without saying; you have a coal-black horse, and a sabre-cut, and


<pb n="40"/>
you can afford to be very magnanimous.  But all the same you give
them a good talking-to.
</p>
<p>This pleasant conceit simply ravished my soul for some twenty
minutes, and then the old sense of injury began to well up
afresh, and to call for new plasters and soothing syrups.  This
time I took refuge in happy thoughts of the sea.  The sea was my
real sphere, after all.  On the sea, in especial, you could
combine distinction with lawlessness, whereas the army seemed to
be always weighted by a certain plodding submission to
discipline.  To be sure, by all accounts, the life was at first a
rough one.  But just then I wanted to suffer keenly; I wanted to
be a poor devil of a cabin boy, kicked, beaten, and sworn at&mdash;for
a time.  Perhaps some hint, some inkling of my sufferings might
reach their ears.  In due course the sloop or felucca would turn
up&mdash;it always did&mdash;the



<pb n="41"/>
rakish-looking craft, black of hull, low in the water, and
bristling with guns; the jolly Roger flapping overhead, and myself
for sole commander.  By and by, as usually happened, an East
Indiaman would come sailing along full of relations&mdash;not a
necessary relation would be missing.  And the crew should walk
the plank, and the captain should dance from his own yardarm, and
then I would take the passengers in hand&mdash;that miserable group of
well-known figures cowering on the quarter-deck!&mdash;and then&mdash;and
then the same old performance: the air thick with magnanimity.
In all the repertory of heroes, none is more truly magnanimous
than your pirate chief.
</p>
<p>When at last I brought myself back from the future to the
actual present, I found that these delectable visions had helped
me over a longer stretch of road than I had imagined; and I
looked


<pb n="42"/>
around and took my bearings.  To the right of me was a long low
building of grey stone, new, and yet not smugly so; new, and yet
possessing distinction, marked with a character that did not
depend on lichen or on crumbling semi-effacement of moulding and
mullion.  Strangers might have been puzzled to classify it; to
me, an explorer from earliest years, the place was familiar
enough.  Most folk called it "The Settlement"; others, with quite
sufficient conciseness for our neighbourhood, spoke of "them
there fellows up by Halliday's"; others again, with a hint of
derision, named them the "monks."  This last title I supposed to
be intended for satire, and knew to be fatuously wrong.  I was
thoroughly acquainted with monks&mdash;in books&mdash;and well knew the cut
of their long frocks, their shaven polls, and their fascinating
big dogs, with brandy-bottles round their


<pb n="43"/>
necks, incessantly hauling happy travellers out of the snow.  The
only dog at the settlement was an Irish terrier, and the good
fellows who owned him, and were owned by him, in common, wore
clothes of the most nondescript order, and mostly cultivated
side-whiskers.  I had wandered up there one day, searching (as
usual) for something I never found, and had been taken in by them
and treated as friend and comrade.  They had made me free of
their ideal little rooms, full of books and pictures, and clean
of the antimacassar taint; they had shown me their chapel, high,
hushed; and faintly scented, beautiful with a strange new beauty
born both of what it had and what it had not&mdash;that too familiar
dowdiness of common places of worship.  They had also fed me in
their dining-hall, where a long table stood on trestles plain to
view, and all the woodwork was natural, unpainted, healthily


<pb n="44"/>
scrubbed, and redolent of the forest it came from.  I brought
away from that visit, and kept by me for many days, a sense of
cleanness, of the freshness that pricks the senses&mdash;the freshness
of cool spring water; and the large swept spaces of the rooms,
the red tiles, and the oaken settles, suggested a comfort that
had no connexion with padded upholstery.
</p>
<p>On this particular morning I was in much too unsociable a mind
for paying friendly calls.  Still, something in the aspect of the
place harmonised with my humour, and I worked my way round to the
back, where the ground, after affording level enough for a
kitchen-garden, broke steeply away.  Both the word Gothic and the
thing itself were still unknown to me; yet doubtless the
architecture of the place, consistent throughout, accounted for
its sense of comradeship in my hour of disheartenment.  As I
mused there, with


<pb n="45"/>
the low, grey, purposeful-looking building before me, and thought
of my pleasant friends within, and what good times they always
seemed to be having, and how they larked with the Irish terrier,
whose footing was one of a perfect equality, I thought of a
certain look in their faces, as if they had a common purpose and
a business, and were acting under orders thoroughly recognised
and understood.  I remembered, too, something that Martha had
told me, about these same fellows doing "a power o' good," and
other hints I had collected vaguely, of renouncements, rules,
self-denials, and the like.  Thereupon, out of the depths of my
morbid soul swam up a new and fascinating idea; and at once the
career of arms seemed over-acted and stale, and piracy, as a
profession, flat and unprofitable.  This, then, or something like
it, should be my vocation and my revenge.  A


<pb n="46"/>
severer line of business, perhaps, such as I had read of;
something that included black bread and a hair-shirt.  There
should be vows, too&mdash;irrevocable, blood curdling vows; and an
iron grating.  This iron grating was the most necessary feature
of all, for I intended that on the other side of it my relations
should range themselves&mdash;I mentally ran over the catalogue, and
saw that the whole gang was present, all in their proper places&mdash;
a sad-eyed row, combined in tristful appeal.  "We see our error
now," they would say; "we were always dull dogs, slow to catch&mdash;
especially in those akin to us&mdash;the finer qualities of soul!  We
misunderstood you, misappreciated you, and we own up to it.  And
now&mdash;"  "Alas, my dear friends," I would strike in here, waving
towards them an ascetic hand&mdash;one of the emaciated sort, that
lets the light shine through at the fingertips&mdash;


<pb n="47"/>
"Alas, you come too late!  This conduct is fitting and
meritorious on your part, and indeed I always expected it of you,
sooner or later; but the die is cast, and you may go home again
and bewail at your leisure this too tardy repentance of yours.
For me, I am vowed and dedicated, and my relations henceforth are
austerity and holy works.  Once a month, should you wish it, it
shall be your privilege to come and gaze at me through this very
solid grating; but&mdash;"  <hi rend="italic">Whack!</hi>
</p>
<p>A well-aimed clod of garden soil, whizzing just past my ear,
starred on a tree-trunk behind, spattering me with dirt.  The
present came back to me in a flash, and I nimbly took cover
behind the trees, realising that the enemy was up and abroad,
with ambuscades, alarms, and thrilling sallies.  It was the
gardener's boy, I knew well enough; a red proletariat, who hated
me just because I was


<pb n="48"/>
a gentleman.  Hastily picking up a nice sticky clod in one hand,
with the other I delicately projected my hat beyond the shelter
of the tree-trunk.  I had not fought with Red-skins all these
years for nothing.
</p>
<p>As I had expected, another clod, of the first class for size
and stickiness, took my poor hat full in the centre.  Then, Ajax-like, shouting terribly, I issued from shelter and discharged my
ammunition.  Woe then for the gardener's boy, who, unprepared,
skipping in premature triumph, took the clod full in his stomach!
He, the foolish one, witless on whose side the gods were fighting
that day, discharged yet other missiles, wavering and wide of the
mark; for his wind had been taken with the first clod, and he
shot wildly, as one already desperate and in flight.  I got
another clod in at short range; we clinched on the brow of the
hill, and rolled down to the bottom together.  When he


<pb n="49"/>
had shaken himself free and regained his legs, he trotted smartly
off in the direction of his mother's cottage; but over his
shoulder he discharged at me both imprecation and deprecation,
menace mixed up with an under-current of tears.
</p>
<p>But as for me, I made off smartly for the road, my frame
tingling, my head high, with never a backward look at the
Settlement of suggestive aspect, or at my well-planned future
which lay in fragments around it.  Life had its jollities, then;
life was action, contest, victory!  The present was rosy once
more, surprises lurked on every side, and I was beginning to feel
villainously hungry.
</p>
<p>Just as I gained the road a cart came rattling by, and I
rushed for it, caught the chain that hung below, and swung
thrillingly between the dizzy wheels, choked and blinded with
delicious-smelling dust, the world slipping by me like a streaky


<pb n="50"/>
ribbon below, till the driver licked at me with his whip, and I
had to descend to earth again.  Abandoning the beaten track, I
then struck homewards through the fields; not that the way was
very much shorter, but rather because on that route one avoided
the bridge, and had to splash through the stream and get
refreshingly wet.  Bridges were made for narrow folk, for people
with aims and vocations which compelled abandonment of many of
life's highest pleasures.  Truly wise men called on each element
alike to minister to their joy, and while the touch of sun-bathed
air, the fragrance of garden soil, the ductible qualities of mud,
and the spark-whirling rapture of playing with fire, had each
their special charm, they did not overlook the bliss of getting
their feet wet.  As I came forth on the common Harold broke out
of an adjoining copse and ran to meet me, the morning


<pb n="51"/>
rain-clouds all blown away from his face.  He had made a new
squirrel-stick, it seemed.  Made it all himself; melted the lead
and everything!  I examined the instrument critically, and
pronounced it absolutely magnificent.  As we passed in at our
gate the girls were distantly visible, gardening with a zeal in
cheerful contrast to their heartsick lassitude of the morning.
"There's bin another letter come to-day," Harold explained, "and
the hamper got joggled about on the journey, and the presents
worked down into the straw and all over the place.  One of 'em
turned up inside the cold duck.  And that's why they weren't
found at first.  And Edward said, Thanks
<hi rend="italic">awfully!"</hi>
</p>
<p>I did not see Martha again until we were all re-assembled at
tea-time, when she seemed red-eyed and strangely silent, neither
scolding nor finding fault with anything.  Instead, she was very
kind and


<pb n="52"/>
thoughtful with jams and things, feverishly pressing unwonted
delicacies on us, who wanted little pressing enough.  Then
suddenly, when I was busiest, she disappeared; and Charlotte
whispered me presently that she had heard her go to her room and
lock herself in.  This struck me as a funny sort of proceeding.

<p>SHE stood on the other side of the garden fence, and regarded
me gravely as I came down the road.  Then she said, "Hi-o!" and I
responded, "Hullo!" and pulled up somewhat nervously.
</p>
<p>To tell the truth, the encounter was not entirely unexpected
on my part.  The previous Sunday I had seen her in church, and
after service it had transpired who she was, this new-comer, and
what aunt she was staying with.  That morning a volunteer had
been called for, to take a note to the Parsonage, and rather to
my own surprise I had found myself stepping forward with
alacrity, while the others had become suddenly absorbed in
various


<pb n="56"/>
pursuits, or had sneaked unobtrusively out of view.  Certainly I
had not yet formed any deliberate plan of action; yet I suppose I
recollected that the road to the Parsonage led past her aunt's
garden.
</p>
<p>She began the conversation, while I hopped backwards and
forwards over the ditch, feigning a careless ease.
</p>
<p>"Saw you in church on Sunday," she said; "only you looked
different then.  All dressed up, and your hair quite smooth, and
brushed up at the sides, and oh, so shiny!  What do they put on
it to make it shine like that?  Don't you hate having your hair
brushed?" she ran on, without waiting for an answer.  "How your
boots squeaked when you came down the aisle!  When mine squeak, I
walk in all the puddles till they stop.  Think I'll get over the
fence."
</p>
<p>This she proceeded to do in a business


<pb n="57"/>
like way, while, with my hands deep in my pockets, I regarded her
movements with silent interest, as those of some strange new
animal.
</p>
<p>"I've been gardening," she explained, when she had joined me,
"but I didn't like it.  There's so many worms about to-day.  I
hate worms.  Wish they'd keep out of the way when I'm digging."
</p>
<p>"Oh, I like worms when I'm digging," I replied heartily, "seem
to make things more lively, don't they?"
</p>
<p>She reflected.  "Shouldn't mind 'em so much if they were warm
and <hi rend="italic">dry</hi>," she said, "but&mdash;" here she
shivered, and somehow I liked her for it, though if it had been
my own flesh and blood hoots of derision would have instantly
assailed her.
</p>
<p>From worms we passed, naturally enough, to frogs, and thence
to pigs, aunts, gardeners, rocking-horses, and other fellow&mdash;
citizens of our common kingdom.  In


<pb n="58"/>
five minutes we had each other's confidences, and I seemed to
have known her for a lifetime.  Somehow, on the subject of one's
self it was easier to be frank and communicative with her than
with one's female kin.  It must be, I supposed, because she was
less familiar with one's faulty, tattered past.
</p>
<p>"I was watching you as you came along the road," she said
presently, "and you had your head down and your hands in your
pockets, and you weren't throwing stones at anything, or
whistling, or jumping over things; and I thought perhaps you'd
bin scolded, or got a stomach-ache."
</p>
<p>"No," I answered shyly, "it wasn't that.  Fact is, I was&mdash;I
often&mdash;but it's a secret."
</p>
<p>There I made an error in tactics.  That enkindling word set
her dancing round me, half beseeching, half imperious.  "Oh,



<pb n="59"/>
do tell it me!" she cried.  "You must!  I'll never tell anyone
else at all, I vow and declare I won't!"
</p>
<p>Her small frame wriggled with emotion, and with imploring eyes
she jigged impatiently just in front of me.  Her hair was tumbled
bewitchingly on her shoulders, and even the loss of a front
tooth&mdash;a loss incidental to her age&mdash;seemed but to add a piquancy
to her face.
</p>
<p>"You won't care to hear about it," I said, wavering.
"Besides, I can't explain exactly.  I think I won't tell you."
But all the time I knew I should have to.
</p>
<p>"But I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> care," she wailed
plaintively.  "I didn't think you'd be so unkind!"
</p>
<p>This would never do.  That little downward tug at either
corner of the mouth&mdash;I knew the symptom only too well!
</p>
<p>"It's like this," I began stammeringly.  "This bit of road
here&mdash;up as far as that corner&mdash;you know it's a horrid dull bit


<pb n="60"/>
of road.  I'm always having to go up and down it, and I know it
so well, and I'm so sick of it.  So whenever I get to that
corner, I just&mdash;well, I go right off to another place!"
</p>
<p>"What sort of a place?" she asked, looking round her gravely.
</p>
<p>"Of course it's just a place I imagine," I went on hurriedly
and rather shamefacedly: "but it's an awfully nice place&mdash;the
nicest place you ever saw.  And I always go off there in church,
or during joggraphy lessons."
</p>
<p>"I'm sure it's not nicer than my home," she cried
patriotically.  "Oh, you ought to see my home&mdash;it's lovely!
We've got&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"Yes it is, ever so much nicer," I interrupted.  "I mean"&mdash;I
went on apologetically&mdash;"of course I know your home's beautiful
and all that.  But this <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be
nicer, 'cos if you want anything


<pb n="61"/>
at all, you've only <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to want it,
and you can have it!"
</p>
<p>"That sounds jolly," she murmured.  "Tell me more about it,
please.  Tell me how you get there, first."
</p>
<p>"I&mdash;don't&mdash;quite&mdash;know&mdash;exactly," I replied.  "I just go.  But
generally it begins by&mdash;well, you're going up a broad, clear
river in a sort of a boat.  You're not rowing or anything&mdash;you're
just moving along.  And there's beautiful grass meadows on both
sides, and the river's very full, quite up to the level of the
grass.  And you glide along by the edge.  And the people are
haymaking there, and playing games, and walking about; and they
shout to you, and you shout back to them, and they bring you
things to eat out of their baskets, and let you drink out of
their bottles; and some of 'em are the nice people you read about
in books.  And so at last you come to


<pb n="62"/>
the Palace steps&mdash;great broad marble steps, reaching right down
to the water.  And there at the steps you find every sort of boat
you can imagine&mdash;schooners, and punts, and row-boats, and little
men-of-war.  And you have any sort of boating you want to&mdash;
rowing, or sailing, or shoving about in a punt!"
</p>
<p>"I'd go sailing," she said decidedly: "and I'd steer.  No,
<hi rend="italic">you'd</hi> have to steer, and I'd sit
about on the deck.  No, I wouldn't though; I'd row&mdash;at least I'd
make you row, and I'd steer.  And then we'd&mdash;Oh, no!  I'll tell
you what we'd do!  We'd just sit in a punt and dabble!"
</p>
<p>"Of course we'll do just what you like," I said hospitably;
but already I was beginning to feel my liberty of action somewhat
curtailed by this exigent visitor I had so rashly admitted into
my sanctum.
</p>
<p>"I don't think we'd boat at all," she


<pb n="63"/>
finally decided.  "It's always so
<hi rend="italic">wobbly</hi>.  Where do you come to next?"
</p>
<p>"You go up the steps," I continued, "and in at the door, and
the very first place you come to is the Chocolate-room!"
</p>
<p>She brightened up at this, and I heard her murmur with gusto,
"Chocolate-room!"
</p>
<p>"It's got every sort of chocolate you can think of," I went
on: "soft chocolate, with sticky stuff inside, white and pink,
what girls like; and hard shiny chocolate, that cracks when you
bite it, and takes such a nice long time to suck!"
</p>
<p>"I like the soft stuff best," she said: "'cos you can eat such
a lot more of it!"
</p>
<p>This was to me a new aspect of the chocolate question, and I
regarded her with interest and some respect.  With us, chocolate
was none too common a thing, and, whenever we happened to come by


<pb n="64"/>
any, we resorted to the quaintest devices in order to make it
last out.  Still, legends had reached us of children who actually
had, from time to time, as much chocolate as they could possibly
eat; and here, apparently, was one of them.
</p>
<p>"You can have all the creams," I said magnanimously, "and I'll
eat the hard sticks, 'cos I like 'em best."
</p>
<p>"Oh, but you mustn't!" she cried impetuously.  "You must eat
the same as I do!  It isn't nice to want to eat different.  I'll
tell you what&mdash;you must give <hi rend="italic">me</hi> all
the chocolate, and then I'll give
<hi rend="italic">you</hi>&mdash;I'll give you what you ought to have!"
</p>
<p>"Oh, all right," I said, in a subdued sort of way.  It seemed
a little hard to be put under a sentimental restriction like this
in one's own Chocolate-room.
</p>
<p>"In the next room you come to," I proceeded, "there's fizzy
drinks!  There's a marble-slab business all round the room,


<pb n="65"/>
and little silver taps; and you just turn the right tap, and have
any kind of fizzy drink you want."
</p>
<p>"What fizzy drinks are there?" she inquired.
</p>
<p>"Oh, all sorts," I answered hastily, hurrying on.  (She might
restrict my eatables, but I'd be hanged if I was going to have
her meddle with my drinks.)"  Then you go down the corridor, and
at the back of the palace there's a great big park&mdash;the finest
park you ever saw.  And there's ponies to ride on, and carriages
and carts; and a little railway, all complete, engine and guard's
van and all; and you work it yourself, and you can go first-class, or in the van, or on the engine, just whichever you
choose."
</p>
<p>"I'd go on the engine," she murmured dreamily.  "No, I
wouldn't, I'd&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"Then there's all the soldiers," I struck in.  Really the line
had to be drawn some


<pb n="66"/>
where, and I could not have my railway system disorganised and
turned upside down by a mere girl.  "There's any quantity of 'em,
fine big soldiers, and they all belong to me.  And a row of brass
cannons all along the terrace!  And every now and then I give the
order, and they fire off all the guns!"
</p>
<p>"No, they don't," she interrupted hastily.  "I won't have 'em
fire off any guns!  You must tell 'em not to.  I hate guns, and
as soon as they begin firing I shall run right away!"
</p>
<p>"But&mdash;but that's what they're
<hi rend="italic">there</hi> for," I protested, aghast.
</p>
<p>"I don't care," she insisted.  "They mustn't do it.  They can
walk about behind me if they like, and talk to me, and carry
things.  But they mustn't fire off any guns."
</p>
<p>I was sadly conscious by this time that in this brave palace
of mine, wherein I


<pb n="67"/>
was wont to swagger daily, irresponsible and unquestioned, I was
rapidly becoming&mdash;so to speak&mdash;a mere lodger.  The idea of my
fine big soldiers being told off to "carry things"!  I was not
inclined to tell her any more, though there still remained plenty
more to tell.
</p>
<p>"Any other boys there?" she asked presently, in a casual sort
of way.
</p>
<p>"Oh yes," I unguardedly replied.  "Nice chaps, too.  We'll
have great&mdash;"  Then I recollected myself.  "We'll play with them,
of course," I went on.  "But you are going to be
<hi rend="italic">my</hi> friend, aren't you?  And you'll come in
my boat, and we'll travel in the guard's van together, and I'll
stop the soldiers firing off their guns!"
</p>
<p>But she looked mischievously away, and&mdash;do what I would&mdash;I
could not get her to promise.
</p>
<p>Just then the striking of the village clock awoke within me
another clamorous


<pb n="68"/>
timepiece, reminding me of mid-day mutton a good half-mile away,
and of penalties and curtailments attaching to a late appearance.
We took a hurried farewell of each other, and before we parted I
got from her an admission that she might be gardening again that
afternoon, if only the worms would be less aggressive and give
her a chance.
</p>
<p>"Remember," I said as I turned to go, "you mustn't tell
anybody about what I've been telling you!"
</p>
<p>She appeared to hesitate, swinging one leg to and fro while
she regarded me sideways with half-shut eyes.
</p>
<p>"It's a dead secret," I said artfully.  "A secret between us
two, and nobody knows it except ourselves!"
</p>
<p>Then she promised, nodding violently, big-eyed, her mouth
pursed up small.  The delight of revelation, and the bliss of
possessing a secret, run each other


<pb n="69"/>
very close.  But the latter generally wins&mdash;for a time.
</p>
<p>I had passed the mutton stage and was weltering in warm rice
pudding, before I found leisure to pause and take in things
generally; and then a glance in the direction of the window told
me, to my dismay, that it was raining hard.  This was annoying in
every way, for, even if it cleared up later, the worms&mdash;I knew
well from experience&mdash;would be offensively numerous and frisky.
Sulkily I said grace and accompanied the others upstairs to the
schoolroom; where I got out my paint-box and resolved to devote
myself seriously to Art, which of late I had much neglected.
Harold got hold of a sheet of paper and a pencil, retired to a
table in the corner, squared his elbows, and protruded his
tongue.  Literature had always been
<hi rend="italic">his</hi> form of artistic expression.


<pb n="70"/>
</p>
<p>Selina had a fit of the fidgets, bred of the unpromising
weather, and, instead of settling down to something on her own
account, must needs walk round and annoy us artists, intent on
embodying our conceptions of the ideal.  She had been looking
over my shoulder some minutes before I knew of it; or I would
have had a word or two to say upon the subject.
</p>
<p>"I suppose you call that thing a ship," she remarked
contemptuously.  "Who ever heard of a pink ship?  Hoo-hoo!"
</p>
<p>I stifled my wrath, knowing that in order to score properly it
was necessary to keep a cool head.
</p>
<p>"There is a pink ship," I observed with forced calmness,
"lying in the toy-shop window now.  You can go and look at it if
you like.  D'you suppose you know more about ships than the
fellows who make 'em?"


<pb n="71"/>
</p>
<p>Selina, baffled for the moment, returned to the charge
presently.
</p>
<p>"Those are funny things, too," she observed.  "S'pose they're
meant to be trees.  But they're
<hi rend="italic">blue</hi>."
</p>
<p>"They <hi rend="italic">are</hi> trees," I replied with
severity; "and they <hi rend="italic">are</hi> blue.
They've got to be blue, 'cos you stole my gamboge last week, so I
can't mix up any green."
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Didn't</hi> steal your gamboge,"
declared Selina, haughtily, edging away, however, in the
direction of Harold.  "And I wouldn't tell lies, either, if I was
you, about a dirty little bit of gamboge."
</p>
<p>I preserved a discreet silence.  After all, I knew
<hi rend="italic">she</hi> knew she stole my gamboge.
</p>
<p>The moment Harold became conscious of Selina's stealthy
approach, he dropped his pencil and flung himself flat upon the
table, protecting thus his literary efforts from chilling
criticism by the interposed thickness of his person.  From
somewhere


<pb n="72"/>

in his interior proceeded a heart rending compound of squeal and
whistle, as of escaping steam,&mdash;long-drawn, ear piercing,
unvarying in note.
</p>
<p>"I only just want to see," protested Selina, struggling to
uproot his small body from the scrawl it guarded.  But Harold
clung limpet-like to the table edge, and his shrill protest
continued to deafen humanity and to threaten even the serenities
of Olympus.  The time seemed come for a demonstration in force.
Personally I cared little what soul-outpourings of Harold were
pirated by Selina&mdash;she was pretty sure to get hold of them sooner
or later&mdash;and indeed I rather welcomed the diversion as
favourable to the undisturbed pursuit of Art.  But the
clannishness of sex has its unwritten laws.  Boys, as such, are
sufficiently put upon, maltreated, trodden under, as it is.
Should they fail to hang


<pb n="73"/>
together in perilous times, what disasters, what ignominies, may
not be looked for?  Possibly even an extinction of the tribe.  I
dropped my paint brush and sailed shouting into the fray.
</p>
<p>The result for a short space hung dubious.  There is a period
of life when the difference of a year or two in age far outweighs
the minor advantage of sex.  Then the gathers of Selina's frock
came away with a sound like the rattle of distant musketry; and
this calamity it was, rather than mere brute compulsion, that
quelled her indomitable spirit.
</p>
<p>The female tongue is mightier than the sword, as I soon had
good reason to know, when Selina, her riven garment held out at
length, avenged her discomfiture with the Greek-fire of
personalities and abuse.  Every black incident in my short, but
not stainless, career&mdash;every error, every folly, every penalty
ignobly


<pb n="74"/>
suffered&mdash;were paraded before me as in a magic-lantern show.  The
information, however, was not particularly new to me, and the
effect was staled by previous rehearsals.  Besides, a victory
remains a victory, whatever the moral character of the triumphant
general.
</p>
<p>Harold chuckled and crowed as he dropped from the table,
revealing the document over which so many gathers had sighed
their short lives out.  <hi rend="italic">"You</hi> can read
it if you like," he said to me gratefully.  "It's only a Death-letter."
</p>
<p>It had never been possible to say what Harold's particular
amusement of the hour might turn out to be.  One thing only was
certain, that it would be something improbable, unguessable, not
to be foretold.  Who, for instance, in search of relaxation,
would ever dream of choosing the drawing-up of a testamentary
disposition of property?  Yet this was the form


<pb n="75"/>
taken by Harold's latest craze; and in justice this much had to
be said for him, that in the christening of his amusement he had
gone right to the heart of the matter.  The words "will" and
"testament" have various meanings and uses; but about the
signification of "death-letter" there can be no manner of doubt.
I smoothed out the crumpled paper and read.  In actual form it
deviated considerably from that usually adopted by family
solicitors of standing, the only resemblance, indeed, lying in
the absence of punctuation.

</p>

<hi rend="italic">C&oelig;tera desunt</hi>.

</p>
<p>"Why, you're not leaving <hi rend="italic">me</hi>
anything!" exclaimed Selina, indignantly.  "You're a regular mean
little boy, and I'll take back the last birthday present I gave
you!"
</p>
<p>"I don't care," said Harold, repossessing himself of the
document.  "I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> going to leave you
something, but I sha'n't now, 'cos you tried to read my death-letter before I was dead!"
</p>
<p>"Then I'll write a death-letter myself," retorted Selina,
scenting an artistic vengeance: "and I shatn't leave you a single
thing!"  And she went off in search of a pencil.
</p>
<p>The tempest within-doors had kept my attention off the
condition of things without.  But now a glance through the window
told me that the rain had entirely


<pb n="77"/>
ceased, and that everything was bathed instead in a radiant glow
of sunlight, more golden than any gamboge of mine could possibly
depict.  Leaving Selina and Harold to settle their feud by a
mutual disinheritance, I slipped from the room and escaped into
the open air, eager to pick up the loose end of my new friendship
just where I had dropped it that morning.  In the glorious
reaction of the sunshine after the downpour, with its moist warm
smells, bespanglement of greenery, and inspiriting touch of rain-washed air, the parks and palaces of the imagination glowed with
a livelier iris, and their blurred beauties shone out again with
fresh blush and palpitation.  As I sped along to the tryst, again
I accompanied my new comrade along the corridors of my pet palace
into which I had so hastily introduced her; and on reflection I
began to see that it wouldn't work properly.  I had made a


<pb n="78"/>
mistake, and those were not the surroundings in which she was
most fitted to shine.  However, it really did not matter much; I
had other palaces to place at her disposal&mdash;plenty of 'em; and on
a further acquaintance with and knowledge of her tastes, no doubt
I could find something to suit her.
</p>
<p>There was a real Arabian one, for instance, which I visited
but rarely&mdash;only just when I was in the fine Oriental mood for
it; a wonder of silk hangings, fountains of rosewater, pavilions,
and minarets.  Hundreds of silent, well-trained slaves thronged
the stairs and alleys of this establishment, ready to fetch and
carry for her all day, if she wished it; and my brave soldiers
would be spared the indignity.  Also there were processions
through the bazaar at odd moments&mdash;processions with camels,
elephants, and palanquins.  Yes, she was more suited for the
East,


<pb n="79"/>
this imperious young person; and I determined that thither she
should be personally conducted as soon as ever might be.
</p>
<p>I reached the fence and climbed up two bars of it, and leaning
over I looked this way and that for my twin-souled partner of the
morning.  It was not long before I caught sight of her, only a
short distance away.  Her back was towards me and&mdash;well, one can
never foresee exactly how one will find things&mdash;she was talking
to a Boy.
</p>
<p>Of course there are boys and boys, and Lord knows I was never
narrow.  But this was the parson's son from an adjoining village,
a red-headed boy and as common a little beast as ever stepped.
He cultivated ferrets&mdash;his only good point; and it was evidently
through the medium of this art that he was basely supplanting me,
for her head was bent absorbedly over something he carried in his
hands.


<pb n="80"/>
With some trepidation I called out, "Hi!"  But answer there was
none.  Then again I called, "Hi!" but this time with a sickening
sense of failure and of doom.  She replied only by a complex
gesture, decisive in import if not easily described.  A petulant
toss of the head, a jerk of the left shoulder, and a backward
kick of the left foot, all delivered at once&mdash;that was all, and
that was enough.  The red-headed boy never even condescended to
glance my way.  Why, indeed, should he?  I dropped from the fence
without another effort, and took my way homewards along the weary
road.
</p>
<p>Little inclination was left to me, at first, for any solitary
visit to my accustomed palace, the pleasures of which I had so
recently tasted in company; and yet after a minute or two I found
myself, from habit, sneaking off there much as usual.  Presently
I became aware of a certain solace


<pb n="81"/>
and consolation in my newly-recovered independence of action.
Quit of all female whims and fanciful restrictions, I rowed,
sailed, or punted, just as I pleased; in the Chocolate-room I
cracked and nibbled the hard sticks, with a certain contempt for
those who preferred the soft, veneered article; and I mixed and
quaffed countless fizzy drinks without dread of any prohibitionist.
Finally, I swaggered into the park, paraded all my
soldiers on the terrace, and, bidding them take the time from me,
gave the order to fire off all the guns.

<head>THE MAGIC RING</head>


<p>GROWN-UP people really ought to be more careful.  Among
themselves it may seem but a small thing to give their word and
take back their word.  For them there are so many compensations.
Life lies at their feet, a party-coloured india-rubber ball; they
may kick it this way or kick it that, it turns up blue, yellow,
or green, but always coloured and glistenning.  Thus one sees it
happen almost every day, and, with a jest and a laugh, the thing
is over, and the disappointed one turns to fresh pleasure, lying
ready to his hand.  But with those who are below them, whose
little globe is swayed by them, who rush to build star-pointing
alhambras on their most casual word, they really ought to be more
careful.


<pb n="86"/>
</p>
<p>In this case of the circus, for instance, it was not as if we
had led up to the subject.  It was they who began it entirely&mdash;
prompted thereto by the local newspaper.  "What, a circus!" said
they, in their irritating, casual way: "that would be nice to
take the children to.  Wednesday would be a good day.  Suppose we
go on Wednesday.  Oh, and pleats are being worn again, with rows
of deep braid," etc.
</p>
<p>What the others thought I know not; what they said, if they
said anything, I did not comprehend.  For me the house was
bursting, walls seemed to cramp and to stifle, the roof was
jumping and lifting.  Escape was the imperative thing&mdash;to escape
into the open air, to shake off bricks and mortar, and to wander
in the unfrequented places of the earth, the more properly to
take in the passion and the promise of the giddy situation.
</p>
<p>Nature seemed prim and staid that day


<pb n="87"/>
and the globe gave no hint that it was flying round a circus ring
of its own.  Could they really be true, I wondered, all those
bewildering things I had heard tell of circuses?  Did long-tailed
ponies really walk on their hind-legs and fire off pistols?  Was
it humanly possible for clowns to perform one-half of the
bewitching drolleries recorded in history?  And how, oh, how dare
I venture to believe
that, from off the backs of creamy Arab steeds, ladies of more
than earthly beauty discharged themselves through paper hoops?
No, it was not altogether possible, there must have been some
exaggeration.  Still, I would be content with very little, I
would take a low percentage&mdash;a very small proportion of the
circus myth would more than satisfy me.  But again, even
supposing that history were, once in a way, no liar, could it be
that I myself was really fated to look upon this


<pb n="88"/>
thing in the flesh and to live through it, to survive the
rapture?  No, it was altogether too much.  Something was bound to
happen, one of us would develop measles, the world would blow up
with a loud explosion.  I must not dare, I must not presume, to
entertain the smallest hope.  I must endeavour sternly to think
of something else.
</p>
<p>Needless to say, I thought, I dreamed of nothing else, day or
night.  Waking, I walked arm-in-arm with a clown, and cracked a
portentous whip to the brave music of a band.  Sleeping, I
pursued&mdash;perched astride of a coal-black horse&mdash;a princess all
gauze and spangles, who always managed to keep just one
unattainable length ahead.  In the early morning Harold and I,
once fully awake, cross-examined each other as to the
possibilities of this or that circus tradition, and exhausted the
lore long ere the first house


<pb n="89"/>
maid was stirring.  In this state of exaltation we slipped onward
to what promised to be a day of all white days&mdash;which brings me
right back to my text, that grown-up people really ought to be
more careful.
</p>
<p>I had known it could never really be; I had said so to myself
a dozen times.  The vision was too sweetly ethereal for
embodiment.  Yet the pang of the disillusionment was none the
less keen and sickening, and the pain was as that of a corporeal
wound.  It seemed strange and foreboding, when we entered the
breakfast-room, not to find everybody cracking whips, jumping
over chairs, and whooping.  In ecstatic rehearsal of the wild
reality to come.  The situation became grim and pallid indeed,
when I caught the expressions "garden-party" and "my mauve
tulle," and realized that they both referred to that very
afternoon.  And every minute,


<pb n="90"/>
as I sat silent and listened, my heart sank lower and lower,
descending relentlessly like a clock-weight into my boot soles.
</p>
<p>Throughout my agony I never dreamed of resorting to a direct
question, much less a reproach.  Even during the period of joyful
anticipation some fear of breaking the spell had kept me from any
bald circus talk in the presence of them.  But Harold, who was
built in quite another way, so soon as he discerned the drift of
their conversation and heard the knell of all his hopes, filled
the room with wail and clamour of berearement.  The grinning
welkin rang with "Circus!"  "Circus!" shook the window-panes; the
mocking walls re-echoed "Circus!"  Circus he would have, and the
whole circus, and nothing but the circus.  No compromise for him,
no evasions, no fallacious, unsecured promises to pay.  He had


<pb n="91"/>
drawn his cheque on the Bank of Expectation, and it had got to be
cashed then and there; else he would yell, and yell himself into
a fit, and come out of it and yell again.  Yelling should be his
profession, his art, his mission, his career.  He was qualified,
he was resolute, and he was in no hurry to retire from the
business.
</p>
<p>The noisy ones of the world, if they do not always shout
themselves into the imperial purple, are sure at least of
receiving attention.  If they cannot sell everything at their own
price, one thing&mdash;silence&mdash;must, at any cost, be purchased of
them.  Harold accordingly had to be consoled by the employment of
every specious fallacy and base-born trick known to those whose
doom it is to handle children.  For me their hollow cajolery had
no interest, I could pluck no consolation out of their bankrupt
though prodigal pledges I only waited till that hateful,



<pb n="92"/>
well-known "Some other time, dear!" told me that hope was finally
dead.  Then I left the room without any remark.  It made it
worse&mdash;if anything could&mdash;to hear that stale, worn-out old
phrase, still supposed by those dullards to have some efficacy.
</p>
<p>To nature, as usual, I drifted by instinct, and there, out of
the track of humanity, under a friendly hedge-row had my black
hour unseen.  The world was a globe no longer, space was no more
filled with whirling circuses of spheres.  That day the old
beliefs rose up and asserted themselves, and the earth was flat
again&mdash;ditch-riddled, stagnant, and deadly flat.  The undeviating
roads crawled straight and white, elms dressed themselves stiffly
along inflexible hedges, all nature, centrifugal no longer,
sprawled flatly in lines out to its farthest edge, and I felt
just like walking out to that terminus, and dropping


<pb n="93"/>
quietly off.  Then, as I sat there, morosely chewing bits of
stick, the recollection came back to me of certain fascinating
advertisements I had spelled out in the papers&mdash;advertisements of
great and happy men, owning big ships of tonnage running into
four figures, who yet craved, to the extent of public
supplication, for the sympathetic co-operation of youths as
apprentices.  I did not rightly know what apprentices might be,
nor whether I was yet big enough to be styled a youth; but one
thing seemed clear, that, by some such means as this, whatever
the intervening hardships, I could eventually visit all the
circuses of the world&mdash;the circuses of merry France and gaudy
Spain, of Holland and Bohemia, of China and Peru.  Here was a
plan worth thinking out in all its bearings; for something had
presently to be done to end this intolerable state of things.


<pb n="94"/>
</p>
<p>Mid-day, and even feeding-time, passed by gloomily enough,
till a small disturbance occurred which had the effect of
releasing some of the electricity with which the air was charged.
Harold, it should be explained, was of a very different mental
mould, and never brooded, moped, nor ate his heart out over any
disappointment.  One wild outburst&mdash;one dissolution of a minute
into his original elements of air and water, of tears and
outcry&mdash;so much insulted nature claimed.  Then he would pull
himself together, iron out his countenance with a smile, and
adjust himself to the new condition of things.
</p>
<p>If the gods are ever grateful to man for anything, it is when
he is so good as to display a short memory.  The Olympians were
never slow to recognize this quality of Harold's, in which,
indeed, their salvation lay, and on this occasion their gratitude
had taken the practical form of a fine


<pb n="95"/>
fat orange, tough-rinded as oranges of those days were wont to
be.  This he had eviscerated in the good old-fashioned manner, by
biting out a hole in the shoulder, inserting a lump of sugar
therein, and then working it cannily till the whole soul and body
of the orange passed glorified through the sugar into his being.
Thereupon, filled full of orange-juice and iniquity, he conceived
a deadly snare.  Having deftly patted and squeezed the orange-skin till it resumed its original shape, he filled it up with
water, inserted a fresh lump of sugar in the orifice, and,
issuing forth, blandly proffered it to me as I sat moodily in the
doorway dreaming of strange wild circuses under tropic skies.
</p>
<p>Such a stale old dodge as this would hardly have taken me in
at ordinary moments.  But Harold had reckoned rightly upon the
disturbing effect of ill-humour, and had guessed, perhaps, that I
thirsted


<pb n="96"/>
for comfort and consolation, and would not criticise too closely
the source from which they came.  Unthinkingly I grasped the
golden fraud, which collapsed at my touch, and squirted its
contents into my eyes and over my collar, till the nethermost
parts of me were damp with the water that had run down my neck.
In an instant I had Harold down, and, with all the energy of
which I was capable, devoted myself to grinding his head into the
gravel; while he, realizing that the closure was applied, and
that the time for discussion or argument was past, sternly
concentrated his powers on kicking me in the stomach.
</p>
<p>Some people can never allow events to work themselves out
quietly.  At this juncture one of Them swooped down on the scene,
pouring shrill, misplaced abuse on both of us: on me for ill-treating my younger brother, whereas it was distinctly I who was
the injured and the deceived;


<pb n="97"/>
on him for the high offence of assault and battery on a clean
collar&mdash;a collar which I had myself deflowered and defaced,
shortly before, in sheer desperate ill-temper.  Disgusted and
defiant we fled in different directions, rejoining each other
later in the kitchen-garden; and as we strolled along together,
our short feud forgotten, Harold observed, gloomily:  "I should
like to be a cave-man, like Uncle George was tellin' us about:
with a flint hatchet and no clothes, and live in a cave and not
know anybody!"
</p>
<p>"And if anyone came to see us we didn't like," I joined in,
catching on to the points of the idea, "we'd hit him on the head
with the hatchet till he dropped down dead."
</p>
<p>"And then," said Harold, warming up, "we'd drag him into the
cave and <hi rend="italic">skin him!"</hi>
</p>
<p>For a space we gloated silently over the fair scene our
imaginations had conjured


<pb n="98"/>
up.  It was <hi rend="italic">blood</hi> we felt the need of
just then.  We wanted no luxuries, nothing dear-bought nor far-fetched.  Just plain blood, and nothing else, and plenty of it.
</p>
<p>Blood, however, was not to be had.  The time was out of joint,
and we had been born too late.  So we went off to the greenhouse,
crawled into the heating arrangement underneath, and played at
the dark and dirty and unrestricted life of cave-men till we were
heartily sick of it.  Then we emerged once more into historic
times, and went off to the road to look for something living and
sentient to throw stones at.
</p>
<p>Nature, so often a cheerful ally, sometimes sulks and refuses
to play.  When in this mood she passes the word to her
underlings, and all the little people of fur and feather take the hint
and slip home quietly by back streets.  In vain we scouted,
lurked, crept, and ambuscaded.  Everything that usually scurried,
hopped, or


<pb n="99"/>
fluttered&mdash;the small society of the undergrowth&mdash;seemed to have
engagements elsewhere.  The horrid thought that perhaps they had
all gone off to the circus occurred to us simultaneously, and we
humped ourselves up on the fence and felt bad.  Even the sound of
approaching wheels failed to stir any interest in us.  When you
are bent on throwing stones at something, humanity seems
obtrusive and better away.  Then suddenly we both jumped off the
fence together, our faces clearing.  For our educated ear had
told us that the approaching rattle could only proceed from a
dog-cart, and we felt sure it must be the funny man.
</p>
<p>We called him the funny man because he was sad and serious,
and said little, but gazed right into our souls, and made us tell
him just what was on our minds at the time, and then came out
with some magnificently luminous suggestion that cleared


<pb n="100"/>
every cloud away.  What was more he would then go off with us at
once and play the thing right out to its finish, earnestly and
devotedly, putting all other things aside.  So we called him the
funny man, meaning only that he was different from those others
who thought it incumbent on them to play the painful mummer.  The
ideal as opposed to the real man was what we meant, only we were
not acquainted with the phrase.  Those others, with their
laboured jests and clumsy contortions, doubtless flattered
themselves that <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were funny men;
we, who had to sit through and applaud the painful performance,
knew better.
</p>
<p>He pulled up to a walk as soon as he caught sight of us, and
the dog-cart crawled slowly along till it stopped just opposite.
Then he leant his chin on his hand and regarded us long and
soulfully, yet said he never a word; while we jigged up and


<pb n="101"/>
down in the dust, grinning bashfully but with expectation.  For
you never knew exactly what this man might say or do.
</p>
<p>"You look bored," he remarked presently; "thoroughly bored.
Or else&mdash;let me see; you're not married, are you?"
</p>
<p>He asked this in such sad earnestness that we hastened to
assure him we were not married, though we felt he ought to have
known that much; we had been intimate for some time.
</p>
<p>"Then it's only boredom," he said.  "Just satiety and world-weariness.  Well, if you assure me you aren't married you can
climb into this cart and I'll take you for a drive.  I'm bored,
too.  I want to do something dark and dreadful and exciting."
</p>
<p>We clambered in, of course, yapping with delight and treading
all over his toes; and as we set off, Harold demanded of him
imperiously whither he was going.


<pb n="102"/>
</p>
<p>"My wife," he replied, "has ordered me to go and look up the
curate and bring him home to tea.  Does that sound sufficiently
exciting for you?"
</p>
<p>Our faces fell.  The curate of the hour was not a success,
from our point of view.  He was not a funny man, in any sense of
the word.
</p>
<p>"&mdash;but I'm not going to," he added, cheerfully.  "Then I was
to stop at some cottage and ask&mdash;what was it?  There was
<hi rend="italic">nettle-rash</hi> mixed up in it, I'm sure.  But
never mind, I've forgotten, and it doesn't matter.  Look here,
we're three desperate young fellows who stick at nothing.
Suppose we go off to the circus?"
</p>
<p>Of certain supreme moments it is not easy to write.  The
varying shades and currents of emotion may indeed be put into
words by those specially skilled that way; they often are, at
considerable length.


<pb n="103"/>
But the sheer, crude article itself&mdash;the strong, live thing that
leaps up inside you and swells and strangles you, the dizziness
of revulsion that takes the breath like cold water&mdash;who shall
depict this and live?  All I knew was that I would have died then
and there, cheerfully, for the funny man; that I longed for red
Indians to spring out from the hedge on the dog-cart, just to
show what I would do; and that, with all this, I could not find
the least little word to say to him.
</p>
<p>Harold was less taciturn.  With shrill voice, uplifted in
solemn chant, he sang the great spheral circus-song, and the
undying glory of the Ring.  Of its timeless beginning he sang, of
its fashioning by cosmic forces, and of its harmony with the
stellar plan.  Of horses he sang, of their strength, their
swiftness, and their docility as to tricks.  Of clowns again, of
the glory of knavery, and of the eternal


<pb n="104"/>
type that shall endure.  Lastly he sang of Her&mdash;the Woman of the
Ring&mdash;flawless, complete, untrammelled in each subtly curving
limb; earth's highest output, time's noblest expression.  At
least, he doubtless rang?? all these things and more&mdash;he
certainly seemed to; though all that was distinguishable was,
"We're-goin'-to-the-circus!" and then, once more, "We're-goin'-to-the-circus!"&mdash;the sweet rhythmic phrase repeated again and
again.  But indeed I cannot be quite sure, for I heard confusedly,
as in a dream.  Wings of fire sprang from the old mare's
shoulders.  We whirled on our way through purple clouds, and
earth and the rattle of wheels were far away below.
</p>
<p>The dream and the dizziness were still in my head when I found
myself, scarce conscious of intermediate steps, seated actually
in the circus at last, and took in the first sniff of that
intoxicating circus


<pb n="105"/>
smell that will stay by me while this clay endures.  The place
was beset by a hum and a glitter and a mist; suspense brooded
large o'er the blank, mysterious arena.  Strung up to the highest
pitch of expectation, we knew not from what quarter, in what
divine shape, the first surprise would come.
</p>
<p>A thud of unseen hoofs first set us aquiver; then a crash of
cymbals, a jangle of bells, a hoarse applauding roar, and Coralie
was in the midst of us, whirling past 'twixt earth and sky, now
erect, flushed, radiant, now crouched to the flowing mane; swung
and tossed and moulded by the maddening dance-music of the band.
The mighty whip of the count in the frock-coat marked time with
pistol-shots; his war-cry, whooping clear above the music, fired
the blood with a passion for splendid deeds, as Coralie,
laughing, exultant, crashed through the


<pb n="106"/>
paper hoops.  We gripped the red cloth in front of us, and our
souls sped round and round with Coralie, leaping with her, prone
with her, swung by mane or tail with her.  It was not only the
ravishment of her delirious feats, nor her cream coloured horse
of fairy breed, long-tailed, roe-footed, an enchanted prince
surely, if ever there was one!  It was her more than mortal
beauty&mdash;displayed, too, under conditions never vouchsafed to us
before&mdash;that held us spell-bound.  What princess had arms so
dazzlingly white, or went delicately clothed in such pink and
spangles?  Hitherto we had known the outward woman as but a drab
thing, hour-glass shaped, nearly legless, bunched here,
constricted there; slow of movement, and given to deprecating
lusty action of limb.  Here was a revelation!  From henceforth
our imaginations would have to be revised and corrected up to
date.  In one of


<pb n="107"/>
those swift rushes the mind makes in high-strung moments, I saw
myself and Coralie, close enfolded, pacing the world together,
o'er hill and plain, through storied cities, past rows of
applauding relations,&mdash;I in my Sunday knickerbockers, she in her
pink and spangles.
</p>
<p>Summers sicken, flowers fail and die, all beauty but rides
round the ring and out at the portal; even so Coralie passed in
her turn, poised sideways, panting, on her steed; lightly swayed
as a tulip-bloom, bowing on this side and on that as she
disappeared; and with her went my heart and my soul, and all the
light and the glory and the entrancement of the scene.
</p>
<p>Harold woke up with a gasp.  "Wasn't she beautiful?" he said,
in quite a subdued way for him.  I felt a momentary pang.  We had
been friendly rivals before, in many an exploit; but here was
altogether a more serious affair.  Was this, then, to


<pb n="108"/>
be the beginning of strife and coldness, of civil war on the
hearthstone and the sundering of old ties?  Then I recollected
the true position of things, and felt very sorry for Harold; for
it was inexorably written that he would have to give way to me,
since I was the elder.  Rules were not made for nothing, in a
sensibly constructed universe.
</p>
<p>There was little more to wait for, now Coralie had gone; yet I
lingered still, on the chance of her appearing again.  Next
moment the clown tripped up and fell flat, with magnificent
artifice, and at once fresh emotions began to stir.  Love had
endured its little hour, and stern ambition now asserted itself.
Oh, to be a splendid fellow like this, self-contained, ready of
speech, agile beyond conception, braving the forces of society,
his hand against everyone, yet always getting the best of it!
What freshness of humour, what courtesy to dames,


<pb n="109"/>
what triumphant ability to discomfit rivals, frock-coated and
moustached though they might be!  And what a grand, self&mdash;
confident straddle of the legs!  Who could desire a finer career
than to go through life thus gorgeously equipped!  Success was
his key-note, adroitness his panoply, and the mellow music of
laughter his instant reward.  Even Coralie's image wavered and
receded.  I would come back to her in the evening, of course; but
I would be a clown all the working hours of the day.
</p>
<p>The short interval was ended: the band, with long-drawn
chords, sounded a prelude touched with significance; and the
programme, in letters overtopping their fellows, proclaimed
Zephyrine, the Bride of the Desert, in her unequalled bareback
equestrian interlude.  So sated was I already with beauty and
with wit, that I hardly dared hope for a fresh emotion.  Yet her
title was tinged with romance, and


<pb n="110"/>
Coralie's display had aroused in me an interest in her sex which
even herself had failed to satisfy entirely.
</p>
<p>Brayed in by trumpets, Zephyrine swung passionately into the
arena.  With a bound she stood erect, one foot upon each of her
supple, plunging Arabs; and at once I knew that my fate was
sealed, my chapter closed, and the Bride of the Desert was the
one bride for me.  Black was her raiment, great silver stars
shone through it, caught in the dusky twilight of her gauze;
black as her own hair were the two mighty steeds she bestrode.
In a tempest they thundered by, in a whirlwind, a
<hi rend="italic">scirocco</hi> of tan; her cheeks bore the kiss
of an Eastern sun, and the sand-storms of her native desert were
her satellites.  What was Coralie, with her pink silk, her golden
hair and slender limbs, beside this magnificent, full-figured
Cleopatra?  In a twinkling we were scouring the desert&mdash;she and


<pb n="111"/>
I and the two coal-black horses.  Side by side, keeping pace in
our swinging gallop, we distanced the ostrich, we outstrode the
zebra; and, as we went, it seemed the wilderness blossomed like
the rose.

<lb/>.   .   .   .   .   .   . <lb/>
</p>
<p>I know not rightly how we got home that evening.  On the road
there were everywhere strange presences, and the thud of phantom
hoofs encircled us.  In my nose was the pungent circus-smell; the
crack of the whip and the frank laugh of the clown were in my
ears.  The funny man thoughtfully abstained from conversation,
and left our illusion quite alone, sparing us all jarring
criticism and analysis; and he gave me no chance, when he
deposited us at our gate, to get rid of the clumsy expressions of
gratitude I had been laboriously framing.  For the rest of the
evening, distraught and silent, I only heard the march-music of
the band, playing on


<pb n="112"/>
in some corner of my brain.  When at last my head touched the
pillow, in a trice I was with Zephyrine, riding the boundless
Sahara, cheek to cheek, the world well lost; while at times,
through the sand-clouds that encircled us, glimmered the eyes of
Coralie, touched, one fancied, with something of a tender
reproach.

<head>ITS WALLS WERE AS OF JASPER</head>


<p>IN the long winter evenings, when we had the picture-books out
on the floor, and sprawled together over them with elbows deep in
the hearth-rug, the first business to be gone through was the
process of allotment.  All the characters in the pictures had to
be assigned and dealt out among us, according to seniority, as
far as they would go.  When once that had been satisfactorily
completed, the story was allowed to proceed; and thereafter, in
addition to the excitement of the plot, one always possessed a
personal interest in some particular member of the cast, whose
successes or rebuffs one took as so much private gain or loss.
</p>
<p>For Edward this was satisfactory enough.  Claiming his right
of the eldest, he would


<pb n="116"/>
annex the hero in the very frontispiece; and for the rest of the
story his career, if chequered at intervals, was sure of heroic
episodes and a glorious close.  But his juniors, who had to put
up with characters of a clay more mixed&mdash;nay, sometimes with
undiluted villany&mdash;were hard put to it on occasion to defend
their other selves (as it was strict etiquette to do) from
ignominy perhaps only too justly merited.  Edward was indeed a
hopeless grabber.  In the "Buffalo-book," for instance (so named
from the subject of its principal picture, though indeed it dealt
with varied slaughter in every zone), Edward was the stalwart,
bearded figure, with yellow leggings and a powder-horn, who
undauntedly discharged the fatal bullet into the shoulder of the
great bull bison, charging home to within a yard of his muzzle.
To me was allotted the subsidiary character of the friend who had
succeeded in bringing


<pb n="117"/>
down a cow; while Harold had to be content to hold Edward's spare
rifle in the background, with evident signs of uneasiness.
Farther on, again, where the magnificent chamois sprang rigid
into mid-air, Edward, crouched dizzily against the precipice-face, was the sportsman from whose weapon a puff of white smoke
was floating away.  A bare-kneed guide was all that fell to my
share, while poor Harold had to take the boy with the haversack,
or abandon, for this occasion at least, all Alpine ambitions.
</p>
<p>Of course the girls fared badly in this book, and it was not
surprising that they preferred the "Pilgrim's Progress" (for
instance), where women had a fair show, and there was generally
enough of 'em to go round; or a good fairy story, wherein
princesses met with a healthy appreciation.  But indeed we were
all best pleased with a picture wherein the characters just



<pb n="118"/>
fitted us, in number, sex, and qualifications; and this, to us,
stood for artistic merit.
</p>
<p>All the Christmas numbers, in their gilt frames on the
nursery-wall, had been gone through and allotted long ago; and in
these, sooner or later, each one of us got a chance to figure in
some satisfactory and brightly coloured situation.  Few of the
other pictures about the house afforded equal facilities.  They
were generally wanting in figures, and even when these were
present they lacked dramatic interest.  In this picture that I
have to speak about, although the characters had a stupid way of
not doing anything, and apparently not wanting to do anything,
there was at least a sufficiency of them; so in due course they
were allotted, too.
</p>
<p>In itself the picture, which&mdash;in its ebony and tortoise-shell
frame&mdash;hung in a corner of the dining-room, had hitherto
possessed


<pb n="119"/>
no special interest for us, and would probably never have been
dealt with at all but for a revolt of the girls against a
succession of books on sport, in which the illustrator seemed to
have forgotten that there were such things as women in the world.
Selina accordingly made for it one rainy morning, and announced
that she was the lady seated in the centre, whose gown of rich,
flowered brocade fell in such straight, severe lines to her feet,
whose cloak of dark blue was held by a jewelled clasp, and whose
long, fair hair was crowned with a diadem of gold and
pearl.  Well, we had no objection to that; it seemed fair enough,
especially to Edward, who promptly proceeded to "grab" the
armour-man who stood leaning on his shield at the lady's right
hand.  A dainty and delicate armour-man this!  And I confess,
though I knew it was all right and fair and orderly, I felt a
slight pang


<pb n="120"/>
when he passed out of my reach into Edward's possession.  His
armour was just the sort I wanted myself&mdash;scalloped and fluted
and shimmering and spotless; and, though he was but a boy by his
beardless face and golden hair, the shattered spear-shaft in his
grasp proclaimed him a genuine fighter and fresh from some such
agreeable work.  Yes, I grudged Edward the armour-man, and when
he said I could have the fellow on the other side, I hung back
and said I'd think about it.
</p>
<p>This fellow had no armour nor weapons, but wore a plain jerkin
with a leather pouch&mdash;a mere civilian&mdash;and with one hand he
pointed to a wound in his thigh.  I didn't care about him, and
when Harold eagerly put in his claim I gave way and let him have
the man.  The cause of Harold's anxiety only came out later.  It
was the wound he coveted, it seemed.  He



<pb n="121"/>
wanted to have a big, sore wound of his very own, and go about
and show it to people, and excite their envy or win their
respect.  Charlotte was only too pleased to take the child-angel
seated at the lady's feet, grappling with a musical instrument
much too big for her.  Charlotte wanted wings badly, and, next to
those, a guitar or a banjo.  The angel, besides, wore an amber
necklace, which took her fancy immensely.
</p>
<p>This left the picture allotted, with the exception of two or
three more angels, who peeped or perched behind the main figures
with a certain subdued drollery in their faces, as if the thing
had gone on long enough, and it was now time to upset something
or kick up a row of some sort.  We knew these good folk to be
saints and angels, because we had been told they were; otherwise
we should never have guessed it.  Angels, as we


<pb n="122"/>
knew them in our Sunday books, were vapid, colourless,
uninteresting characters, with straight up-and-down sort of
figures, white nightgowns, white wings, and the same straight
yellow hair parted in the middle.  They were serious, even
melancholy; and we had no desire to have any traffic with them.
These bright bejewelled little persons, however, piquant of face
and radiant of feather, were evidently hatched from quite a
different egg, and we felt we might have interests in common with
them.  Short-nosed, shock
headed, with mouths that went up at the corners and with an
evident disregard for all their fine clothes, they would be the
best of good company, we felt sure, if only we could manage to
get at them.  One doubt alone disturbed my mind.  In games
requiring agility, those wings of theirs would give them a
tremendous pull.  Could they be trusted to play fair?  I


<pb n="123"/>
asked Selina, who replied scornfully that angels
<hi rend="italic">always</hi> played fair.  But I went back and
had another look at the brown-faced one peeping over the back of
the lady's chair, and still I had my doubts.
</p>
<p>When Edward went off to school a great deal of adjustment and
re-allotment took place, and all the heroes of illustrated
literature were at my call, did I choose to possess them.  In
this particular case, however, I made no haste to seize upon the
armour-man.  Perhaps it was because I wanted a
<hi rend="italic">fresh</hi> saint of my own, not a stale saint
that Edward had been for so long a time.  Perhaps it was rather
that, ever since I had elected to be saintless, I had got into
the habit of strolling off into the background, and amusing
myself with what I found there.
</p>
<p>A very fascinating background it was, and held a great deal,
though so tiny.  Meadow-land came first, set with flowers,


<pb n="124"/>

blue and red, like gems.  Then a white road ran, with wilful,
uncalled-for loops, up a steep, conical hill, crowned with
towers, bastioned walls, and belfries; and down the road the
little knights came riding, two and two.  The hill on one side
descended to water, tranquil, far-reaching, and blue; and a very
curly ship lay at anchor, with one mast having an odd sort of
crow's-nest at the top of it.
</p>
<p>There was plenty to do in this pleasant land.  The annoying
thing about it was, one could never penetrate beyond a certain
point.  I might wander up that road as often as I liked, I was
bound to be brought up at the gateway, the funny galleried, top-heavy gateway, of the little walled town.  Inside, doubtless,
there were high jinks going on; but the password was denied to
me.  I could get on board a boat and row up as far as the curly
ship, but around the headland I


<pb n="125"/>
might not go.  On the other side, of a surety, the shipping lay
thick.  The merchants walked on the quay, and the sailors sang as
they swung out the corded bales.  But as for me, I must stay down
in the meadow, and imagine it all as best I could.
</p>
<p>Once I broached the subject to Charlotte, and found, to my
surprise, that she had had the same joys and encountered the same
disappointments in this delectable country.  She, too, had walked
up that road and flattened her nose against that portcullis; and
she pointed out something that I had overlooked&mdash;to wit, that if
you rowed off in a boat to the curly ship, and got hold of a
rope, and clambered aboard of her, and swarmed up the mast, and
got into the crow's-nest, you could just see over the headland,
and take in at your ease the life and bustle of the port.  She
proceeded to describe all


<pb n="126"/>
the fun that was going on there, at such length and with so much
particularity that I looked at her suspiciously.  "Why, you talk
as if you'd been in that crow's-nest yourself!" I said.
Charlotte answered nothing, but pursed her mouth up and nodded
violently for some minutes; and I could get nothing more out of
her.  I felt rather hurt.  Evidently she had managed, somehow or
other, to get up into that crow's-nest.  Charlotte had got ahead
of me on this occasion.
</p>
<p>It was necessary, no doubt, that grown-up people should dress
themselves up and go forth to pay calls.  I don't mean that we
saw any sense in the practice.  It would have been so much more
reasonable to stay at home in your old clothes and play.  But we
recognized that these folk had to do many unaccountable things,
and after all it was <hi rend="italic">their</hi> life, and
not ours, and we were not in a position to criticise.


<pb n="127"/>
Besides, they had many habits more objectionable than this one,
which to us generally meant a free and untrammelled afternoon,
wherein to play the devil in our own way.  The case was
different, however, when the press-gang was abroad, when prayers
and excuses were alike disregarded, and we were forced into the
service, like native levies impelled toward the foe less by the
inherent righteousness of the cause than by the indisputable
rifles of their white allies.  This was unpardonable and
altogether detestable.  Still, the thing happened, now and again;
and when it did, there was no arguing about it.  The order was
for the front, and we just had to shut up and march.
</p>
<p>Selina, to be sure, had a sneaking fondness for dressing up
and paying calls, though she pretended to dislike it, just to
keep on the soft side of public opinion.


<pb n="128"/>
So I thought it extremely mean in her to have the earache on that
particular afternoon when Aunt Eliza ordered the pony-carriage
and went on the war-path.  I was ordered also, in the same breath
as the pony-carriage; and, as we eventually trundled off, it
seemed to me that the utter waste of that afternoon, for which I
had planned so much, could never be made up nor atoned for in all
the tremendous stretch of years that still lay before me.
</p>
<p>The house that we were bound for on this occasion was a "big
house;" a generic title applied by us to the class of residence
that had a long carriage-drive through rhododendrons; and a
portico propped by fluted pillars; and a grave butler who bolted
back swing-doors, and came down steps, and pretended to have
entirely forgotten his familiar intercourse with you at less
serious moments; and a big hall,


<pb n="129"/>
where no boots or shoes or upper garments were allowed to lie
about frankly and easily, as with us; and where, finally, people
were apt to sit about dressed up as if they were going on to a
party.
</p>
<p>The lady who received us was effusive to Aunt Eliza and
hollowly gracious to me.  In ten seconds they had their heads
together and were hard at it talking
<hi rend="italic">clothes</hi>.  I was left high and dry on a
straight-backed chair, longing to kick the legs of it, yet not
daring.  For a time I was content to stare; there was lots to
stare at, high and low and around.  Then the inevitable fidgets
came on, and scratching one's legs mitigated slightly, but did
not entirely disperse them.  My two warders were still deep in
clothes; I slipped off my chair and edged cautiously around the
room, exploring, examining, recording.
</p>
<p>Many strange, fine things lay along my


<pb n="130"/>
route&mdash;pictures and gimcracks on the walls, trinkets and globular
old watches and snuff-boxes on the tables; and I took good care
to finger everything within reach thoroughly and conscientiously.
Some articles, in addition, I smelt.  At last in my orbit I
happened on an open door, half concealed by the folds of a
curtain.  I glanced carefully around.  They were still deep in
clothes, both talking together, and I slipped through.
</p>
<p>This was altogether a more sensible sort of room that I had
got into; for the walls were honestly upholstered with books,
though these for the most part glimmered provokingly through the
glass doors of their tall cases.  I read their titles longingly,
breathing on every accessible pane of glass, for I dared not
attempt to open the doors, with the enemy encamped so near.  In
the window, though, on a high sort of desk, there lay, all by
itself, a most


<pb n="131"/>
promising-looking book, gorgeously bound.  I raised the leaves by
one corner, and like scent from a pot-pourri jar there floated
out a brief vision of blues and reds, telling of pictures, and
pictures all highly coloured!  Here was the right sort of thing
at last, and my afternoon would not be entirely wasted.  I
inclined an ear to the door by which I had entered.  Like the
brimming tide of a full-fed river the grand, eternal,
inexhaustible clothes-problem bubbled and eddied and surged
along.  It seemed safe enough.  I slid the book off its desk with
some difficulty, for it was very fine and large, and staggered
with it to the hearthrug&mdash;the only fit and proper place for books
of quality, such as this.
</p>
<p>They were excellent hearthrugs in that house; soft and wide,
with the thickest of pile, and one's knees sank into them most
comfortably.  When I got the book open there was a difficulty at
first in making the


<pb n="132"/>
great stiff pages lie down.  Most fortunately the coal-scuttle
was actually at my elbow, and it was easy to find a flat bit of
coal to lay on the refractory page.  Really, it was just as if
everything had been arranged for me.  This was not such a bad
sort of house after all.
</p>
<p>The beginnings of the thing were gay borders&mdash;scrolls and
strap-work and diapered backgrounds, a maze of colour, with small
misshapen figures clambering cheerily up and down everywhere.
But first I eagerly scanned what text there was in the middle, in
order to get a hint of what it was all about.  Of course I was
not going to waste any time in reading.  A clue, a sign-board, a
finger-post was all I required.  To my dismay and disgust it was
all in a stupid foreign language!  Really, the perversity of some
people made one at times almost despair of the whole race.
However, the pictures remained;


<pb n="133"/>
pictures never lied, never shuffled nor evaded; and as for the
story, I could invent it myself.
</p>
<p>Over the page I went, shifting the bit of coal to a new
position; and, as the scheme of the picture disengaged itself
from out the medley of colour that met my delighted eyes, first
there was a warm sense of familiarity, then a dawning
recognition, and then&mdash;O then! along with blissful certainty came
the imperious need to clasp my stomach with both hands, in order
to repress the shout of rapture that struggled to escape&mdash;it was
my own little city!
</p>
<p>I knew it well enough, I recognized it at once, though I had
never been quite so near it before.  Here was the familiar
gateway, to the left that strange, slender tower with its grim,
square head shot far above the walls; to the right, outside the
town, the hill&mdash;as of old&mdash;broke steeply


<pb n="134"/>
down to the sea.  But to-day everything was bigger and fresher
and clearer, the walls seemed newly hewn, gay carpets were hung
out over them, fair ladies and long-haired children peeped and
crowded on the battlements.  Better still, the portcullis was
up&mdash;I could even catch a glimpse of the sunlit square within&mdash;and
a dainty company was trooping through the gate on horseback, two
and two.  Their horses, in trappings that swept the ground, were
gay as themselves; and <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were the
gayest crew, for dress and bearing, I had ever yet beheld.  It
could mean nothing else but a wedding, I thought, this holiday
attire, this festal and solemn entry; and, wedding or whatever it
was, I meant to be there.  This time I would not be balked by any
grim portcullis; this time I would slip in with the rest of the
crowd, find out just what my little town was like, within those
exasperating


<pb n="135"/>
walls that had so long confronted me, and, moreover, have my
share of the fun that was evidently going on inside.  Confident,
yet breathless with expectation, I turned the page.
</p>
<p>Joy!  At last I was in it, at last I was on the right side of
those provoking walls; and, needless to say, I looked about me
with much curiosity.  A public place, clearly, though not such as
I was used to.  The houses at the back stood on a sort of
colonnade, beneath which the people jostled and crowded.  The
upper stories were all painted with wonderful pictures.  Above
the straight line of the roofs the deep blue of a cloudless sky
stretched from side to side.  Lords and ladies thronged the
foreground, while on a dais in the centre a gallant gentleman,
just alighted off his horse, stooped to the fingers of a girl as
bravely dressed out as Selina's lady between the saints; and


<pb n="136"/>
round about stood venerable personages, robed in the most
variegated clothing.  There were boys, too, in plenty, with tiny
red caps on their thick hair; and their shirts had bunched up and
worked out at the waist, just as my own did so often, after
chasing anybody; and each boy of them wore an odd pair of
stockings, one blue and the other red.  This system of attire
went straight to my heart.  I had tried the same thing so often,
and had met with so much discouragement; and here, at last, was
my justification, painted deliberately in a grown-up book!  I
looked about for my saint-friends&mdash;the armour man and the other
fellow&mdash;but they were not to be seen.  Evidently they were unable
to get off duty, even for a wedding, and still stood on guard in
that green meadow down below.  I was disappointed, too, that not
an angel was visible.  One or two of them, surely, could easily
have


<pb n="137"/>
been spared for an hour, to run up and see the show; and they
would have been thoroughly at home here, in the midst of all the
colour and the movement and the fun.
</p>
<p>But it was time to get on, for clearly the interest was only
just beginning.  Over went the next page, and there we were, the
whole crowd of us, assembled in a noble church.  It was not easy
to make out exactly what was going on; but in the throng I was
delighted to recognize my angels at last, happy and very much at
home.  They had managed to get leave off, evidently, and must
have run up the hill and scampered breathlessly through the gate;
and perhaps they cried a little when they found the square empty,
and thought the fun must be all over.  Two of them had got hold
of a great wax candle apiece, as much as they could stagger
under, and were tittering sideways at each


<pb n="138"/>
other as the grease ran bountifully over their clothes.  A third
had strolled in among the company, and was chatting to a young
gentleman, with whom she appeared to be on the best of terms.
Decidedly, this was the right breed of angel for us.  None of
your sick-bed or night nursery business for them!
</p>
<p>Well, no doubt they were now being married, He and She, just
as always happened.  And then, of course, they were going to live
happily ever after; and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was the
part I wanted to get to.  Story-books were so stupid, always
stopping at the point where they became really nice; but this
picture-story was only in its first chapters, and at last I was
to have a chance of knowing <hi rend="italic">how</hi>
people lived happily ever after.  We would all go home together,
He and She, and the angels, and I; and the armour-man would be
invited to come and stay.  And then the story would really


<pb n="139"/>
begin, at the point where those other ones always left off.  I
turned the page, and found myself free of the dim and splendid
church and once more in the open country.
</p>
<p>This was all right; this was just as it should be.  The sky
was a fleckless blue, the flags danced in the breeze, and our
merry bridal party, with jest and laughter, jogged down to the
water-side.  I was through the town by this time, and out on the
other side of the hill, where I had always wanted to be; and,
sure enough, there was the harbour, all thick with curly ships.
Most of them were piled high with wedding-presents&mdash;bales of
silk, and gold and silver plate, and comfortable-looking bags
suggesting bullion; and the gayest ship of all lay close up to
the carpeted landing-stage.  Already the bride was stepping
daintily down the gangway, her ladies following primly, one by
one; a few minutes more and we should all be


<pb n="140"/>
aboard, the hawsers would splash in the water, the sails would
fill and strain.  From the deck I should see the little walled
town recede and sink and grow dim, while every plunge of our bows
brought us nearer to the happy island&mdash;it was an island we were
bound for, I knew well!  Already I could see the island-people
waving hands on the crowded quay, whence the little houses ran up
the hill to the castle, crowning all with its towers and
battlements.  Once more we should ride together, a merry
procession, clattering up the steep street and through the grim
gateway; and then we should have arrived, then we should all dine
together, then we should have reached home!  And then&mdash;
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Ow! Ow! Ow!</hi>
</p>
<p>Bitter it is to stumble out of an opalescent dream into the
cold daylight; cruel to lose in a second a sea-voyage, an island,
and a castle that was to be practically your


<pb n="141"/>
own; but cruellest and bitterest of all to know, in addition to
your loss, that the fingers of an angry aunt have you tight by
the scruff of your neck.  My beautiful book was gone too&mdash;
ravished from my grasp by the dressy lady, who joined in the
outburst of denunciation as heartily as if she had been a
relative&mdash;and naught was left me but to blubber dismally,
awakened of a sudden to the harshness of real things and the
unnumbered hostilities of the actual world.  I cared little for
their reproaches, their abuse; but I sorrowed heartily for my
lost ship, my vanished island, my uneaten dinner, and for the
knowledge that, if I wanted any angels to play with, I must
henceforth put up with the an&aelig;mic, night-gowned nonentities
that hovered over the bed of the Sunday-school child in the pages
of the <hi rend="italic">Sabbath Improver</hi>.
</p>
<p>I was led ignominiously out of the house, in a pulpy, watery
state, while the butler


<pb n="142"/>
handled his swing doors with a stony, impassive countenance,
intended for the deception of the very elect, though it did not
deceive me.  I knew well enough that next time he was off duty,
and strolled around our way, we should meet in our kitchen as man
to man, and I would punch him and ask him riddles, and he would
teach me tricks with corks and bits of string.  So his
unsympathetic manner did not add to my depression.
</p>
<p>I maintained a diplomatic blubber long after we had been
packed into our pony-carriage and the lodge-gate had clicked
behind us, because it served as a sort of armour-plating against
heckling and argument and abuse, and I was thinking hard and
wanted to be let alone.  And the thoughts that I was thinking
were two.
</p>
<p>First I thought, "I've got ahead of Charlotte
<hi rend="italic">this</hi> time!"
</p>
<p>And next I thought, "When I've grown


<pb n="143"/>
up big, and have money of my own, and a full-sized walking-stick,
I will set out early one morning, and never stop till I get to
that little walled town."  There ought to be no real difficulty
in the task.  It only meant asking here and asking there, and
people were very obliging, and I could describe every stick and
stone of it.
</p>
<p>As for the island which I had never even seen, that was not so
easy.  Yet I felt confident that somehow, at some time, sooner or
later, I was destined to arrive.

<head>A SAGA OF THE SEAS</head>


<p>IT happened one day that some ladies came to call, who were
not at all the sort I was used to.  They suffered from a
grievance, so far as I could gather, and the burden of their
plaint was Man&mdash;Men in general and Man in particular.  (Though
the words were but spoken, I could clearly discern the capital M
in their acid utterance.)
</p>
<p>Of course I was not present officially, so to speak.  Down
below, in my sub-world of chair-legs and hearthrugs and the
undersides of sofas, I was working out my own floor-problems,
while they babbled on far above my head, considering me as but a
chair-leg, or even something lower in the scale.  Yet I was
listening hard all the


<pb n="148"/>

time, with that respectful consideration one gives to all grown-up people's remarks, so long as one knows no better.
</p>
<p>It seemed a serious indictment enough, as they rolled it out.
In tact, considerateness, and right appreciation, as well as in
taste and &aelig;sthetic sensibilities&mdash;we failed at every point,
we breeched and bearded prentice-jobs of Nature; and I began to
feel like collapsing on the carpet from sheer spiritual
an&aelig;mia.  But when one of them, with a swing of her skirt,
prostrated a whole regiment of my brave tin soldiers, and never
apologized nor even offered her aid toward revivifying the
battle-line, I could not help feeling that in tactfulness and
consideration for others she was still a little to seek.  And I
said as much, with some directness of language.
</p>
<p>That was the end of me, from a society point of view.
Rudeness to visitors was the unpardonable sin, and in two seconds


<pb n="149"/>
I had my marching orders, and was sullenly wending my way to the
St. Elelena of the nursery.  As I climbed the stair, my thoughts
reverted somehow to a game we had been playing that very morning.
It was the good old game of Rafts,&mdash;a game that will be played
till all the oceans are dry and all the trees in the world are
felled&mdash;and after.  And we were all crowded together on the
precarious little platform, and Selina occupied every bit as much
room as I did, and Charlotte's legs didn't dangle over any more
than Harold's.  The pitiless sun overhead beat on us all with
tropic impartiality, and the hungry sharks, whose fins scored the
limitless Pacific stretching out on every side, were impelled by
an appetite that made no exceptions as to sex.  When we shared
the ultimate biscuit and circulated the last water-keg, the girls
got an absolute fourth apiece, and neither more nor less; and the


<pb n="150"/>
only partiality shown was entirely in favour of Charlotte, who
was allowed to perceive and to hail the saviour-sail on the
horizon.  And this was only because it was her turn to do so, not
because she happened to be this or that.  Surely, the rules of
the raft were the rules of life, and in what, then, did these
visitor-ladies' grievance consist?
</p>
<p>Puzzled and a little sulky, I pushed open the door of the
deserted nursery, where the raft that had rocked beneath so many
hopes and fears still occupied the ocean-floor.  To the dull eye,
that merely tarries upon the outsides of things, it might have
appeared unromantic and even unraftlike, consisting only as it
did of a round sponge-bath on a bald deal towel-horse placed flat
on the floor.  Even to myself much of the recent raft-glamour
seemed to have departed as I half-mechanically stepped inside and
curled myself up in it for a solitary voyage.  Once


<pb n="151"/>
I was in, however, the old magic and mystery returned in full
flood, when I discovered that the inequalities of the towel-horse
caused the bath to rock, slightly, indeed, but easily and
incessantly.  A few minutes of this delightful motion, and one
was fairly launched.  So those women below didn't want us?  Well,
there were other women, and other places, that did.  And this was
going to be no scrambling raft-affair, but a full-blooded voyage
of the Man, equipped and purposeful, in search of what was his
rightful own.
</p>
<p>Whither should I shape my course, and what sort of vessel
should I charter for the voyage?  The shipping of all England was
mine to pick from, and the far corners of the globe were my
rightful inheritance.  A frigate, of course, seemed the natural
vehicle for a boy of spirit to set out in.  And yet there was
something rather "uppish" in commanding a frigate at the very


<pb n="152"/>
first set-off, and little spread was left for the ambition.
Frigates, too, could always be acquired later by sheer adventure;
and your real hero generally saved up a square-rigged ship for
the final achievement and the rapt return.  No, it was a schooner
that I was aboard of&mdash;a schooner whose masts raked devilishly as
the leaping seas hissed along her low black gunwale.  Many
hairbrained youths started out on a mere cutter; but I was
prudent, and besides I had some inkling of the serious affairs
that were ahead.
</p>
<p>I have said I was already on board; and, indeed, on this
occasion I was too hungry for adventure to linger over what would
have been a special delight at a period of more leisure&mdash;the
dangling about the harbour, the choosing your craft, selecting
your shipmates, stowing your cargo, and fitting up your private
cabin with everything you might want to put your hand on


<pb n="153"/>
in any emergency whatever.  I could not wait for that.  Out
beyond soundings the big seas were racing westward and calling
me, albatrosses hovered motionless, expectant of a comrade, and a
thousand islands held each of them a fresh adventure, stored up,
hidden away, awaiting production, expressly saved for me.  We
were humming, close-hauled, down the Channel, spray in the eyes
and the shrouds thrilling musically, in much less time than the
average man would have taken to transfer his Gladstone bag and
his rugs from the train to a sheltered place on the promenade-deck of the tame daily steamer.
</p>
<p>So long as we were in pilotage I stuck manfully to the wheel.
The undertaking was mine, and with it all its responsibilities,
and there was some tricky steering to be done as we sped by
headland and bay, ere we breasted the great seas outside and the


<pb n="154"/>
land fell away behind us.  But as soon as the Atlantic had opened
out I began to feel that it would be rather nice to take tea by
myself in my own cabin, and it therefore became necessary to
invent a comrade or two, to take their turn at the wheel.
</p>
<p>This was easy enough.  A friend or two of my own age, from
among the boys I knew; a friend or two from characters in the
books I knew; and a friend or two from No-man's-land, where every
fellow's a born sailor; and the crew was complete.  I addressed
them on the poop, divided them into watches, gave instructions I
should be summoned on the first sign of pirates, whales, or
Frenchmen, and retired below to a well-earned spell of
relaxation.
</p>
<p>That was the right sort of cabin that I stepped into, shutting
the door behind me with a click.  Of course, fire-arms were the
first thing I looked for, and there they


<pb n="155"/>
were, sure enough, in their racks, dozens of 'em&mdash;double-barrelled guns, and repeating-rifles, and long pistols, and shiny
plated revolvers.  I rang up the steward and ordered tea, with
scones, and jam in its native pots&mdash;none of your finicking
shallow glass dishes; and, when properly streaked with jam, and
blown out with tea, I went through the armoury, clicked the
rifles and revolvers, tested the edges of the cutlasses with my
thumb, and filled the cartridge-belts chock-full.  Everything was
there, and of the best quality, just as if I had spent a whole
fortnight knocking about Plymouth and ordering things.  Clearly,
if this cruise came to grief, it would not be for want of
equipment.
</p>
<p>Just as I was beginning on the lockers and the drawers, the
watch reported icebergs on both bows&mdash;and, what was more to the
point, coveys of Polar bears on the icebergs.  I grasped a rifle
or two, and


<pb n="156"/>
hastened on deck.  The spectacle was indeed magnificent&mdash;it
generally is, with icebergs on both bows, and these were
exceptionally enormous icebergs.  But I hadn't come there to
paint Academy pictures, so the captain's gig was in the water and
manned almost ere the boatswain's whistle had ceased sounding,
and we were pulling hard for the Polar bears&mdash;myself and the
rifles in the stern-sheets.
</p>
<p>I have rarely enjoyed better shooting than I got during that
afternoon's tramp over the icebergs.  Perhaps I was in specially
good form; perhaps the bears "rose" well.  Anyhow, the bag was a
portentous one.  In later days, on reading of the growing
scarcity of Polar bears, my conscience has pricked me; but that
afternoon I experienced no compunction.  Nevertheless, when the
huge pile of skins had been hoisted on board, and a stiff grog
had been served out to the crew of


<pb n="157"/>
the captain's gig, I ordered the schooner's head to be set due
south.  For icebergs were played out, for the moment, and it was
getting to be time for something more tropical.
</p>
<p>Tropical was a mild expression of what was to come, as was
shortly proved.  It was about three bells in the next day's
forenoon watch when the look-out man first sighted the pirate
brigantine.  I disliked the looks of her from the first, and,
after piping all hands to quarters, had the brass carronade on
the fore-deck crammed with grape to the muzzle.
</p>
<p>This proved a wise precaution.  For the flagitious pirate
craft, having crept up to us under the colours of the Swiss
Republic, a state with which we were just then on the best
possible terms, suddenly shook out the skull-and-cross-bones at
her masthead, and let fly with round-shot at close quarters,
knocking into pieces several of


<pb n="158"/>
my crew, who could ill be spared.  The sight of their
disconnected limbs aroused my ire to its utmost height, and I let
them have the contents of the brass carronade, with ghastly
effect.  Next moment the hulls of the two ships were grinding
together, the cold steel flashed from its scabbard, and the death-grapple had begun.
</p>
<p>In spite of the deadly work of my grape-gorged carronade, our
foe still outnumbered us, I reckoned, by three to one.  Honour
forbade my fixing it at a lower figure&mdash;this was the minimum rate
at which one dared to do business with pirates.  They were stark
veterans, too, every man seamed with ancient sabre-cuts, whereas
my crew had many of them hardly attained the maturity which is
the gift of ten long summers&mdash;and the whole thing was so sudden
that I had no time to invent a reinforcement of riper years.  It
was not surprising, therefore, that my dauntless


<pb n="159"/>
boarding-party, axe in hand and cutlass between teeth, fought
their way to the pirates' deck only to be repulsed again and yet
again, and that our planks were soon slippery with our own
ungrudged and inexhaustible blood.  At this critical point in the
conflict, the bo'sun, grasping me by the arm, drew my attention
to a magnificent British man-of-war, just hove to in the offing,
while the signalman, his glass at his eye, reported that she was
inquiring whether we wanted any assistance or preferred to go
through with the little job ourselves.
</p>
<p>This veiled attempt to share our laurels with us, courteously
as it was worded, put me on my mettle.  Wiping the blood out of
my eyes, I ordered the signalman to reply instantly, with the
half-dozen or so of flags that he had at his disposal, that much
as we appreciated the valour of the regular service, and the
delicacy of spirit


<pb n="160"/>
that animated its commanders, still this was an orthodox case of
the young gentleman-adventurer <hi rend="italic">versus</hi>
the unshaved pirate, and Her Majesty's Marine had nothing to do
but to form the usual admiring and applauding background.  Then,
rallying round me the remnant of my faithful crew, I selected a
fresh cutlass (I had worn out three already) and plunged once
more into the pleasing carnage.
</p>
<p>The result was not long doubtful.  Indeed, I could not allow
it to be, as I was already getting somewhat bored with the pirate
business, and was wanting to get on to something more southern
and sensuous.  All serious resistance came to an end as soon as I
had reached the quarter-deck and cut down the pirate chief&mdash;a
fine black-bearded fellow in his way, but hardly up to date in
his parry-and-thrust business.  Those whom our cutlasses had
spared were marched out along their own plank, in the


<pb n="161"/>
approved old fashion; and in time the scuppers relieved the decks
of the blood that made traffic temporarily impossible.  And all
the time the British-man-of-war admired and applauded in the
offing.
</p>
<p>As soon as we had got through with the necessary throat-cutting and swabbing-up all hands set to work to discover
treasure; and soon the deck shone bravely with ingots and Mexican
dollars and church plate.  There were ropes of pearls, too, and
big stacks of <hi rend="italic">nougat;</hi> and rubies, and
gold watches, and Turkish Delight in tubs.  But I left these
trifles to my crew, and continued the search alone.  For by this
time I had determined that there should be a Princess on board,
carried off to be sold in captivity to the bold bad Moors, and
now with beating heart awaiting her rescue by me, the Perseus of
her dreams.
</p>
<p>I came upon her at last in the big state-cabin in the stern;
and she wore a holland


<pb n="162"/>

pinafore over her Princess-clothes, and she had brown wavy hair,
hanging down her back, just like&mdash;well, never mind, she had brown
wavy hair.  When gentle-folk meet, courtesies pass; and I will
not weary other people with relating all the compliments and
counter-compliments that we exchanged, all in the most approved
manner.  Occasions like this, when tongues wagged smoothly and
speech flowed free, were always especially pleasing to me, who am
naturally inclined to be tongue-tied with women.  But at last
ceremony was over, and we sat on the table and swung our legs and
agreed to be fast friends.  And I showed her my latest knife&mdash;
one-bladed, horn-handled, terrific, hung round my neck with
string; and she showed me the chiefest treasures the ship
contained, hidden away in a most private and particular locker&mdash;a
musical box with a glass top that let you see the works, and a
railway


<pb n="163"/>

train with real lines and a real tunnel, and a tin iron-clad that
followed a magnet, and was ever so much handier in many respects
than the real full-sized thing that still lay and applauded in
the offing.
</p>
<p>There was high feasting that night in my cabin.  We invited
the captain of the man-of-war&mdash;one could hardly do less, it
seemed to me&mdash;and the Princess took one end of the table and I
took the other, and the captain was very kind and nice, and told
us fairy-stories, and asked us both to come and stay with him
next Christmas, and promised we should have some hunting, on real
ponies.  When he left I gave him some ingots and things, and saw
him into his boat; and then I went round the ship and addressed
the crew in several set speeches, which moved them deeply, and
with my own hands loaded up the carronade with grape-shot till it
ran over at the mouth.  This done, I retired into the cabin


<pb n="164"/>
with the Princess, and locked the door.  And first we started the
musical box, taking turns to wind it up; and then we made toffee
in the cabin-stove; and then we ran the train round and round the
room, and through and through the tunnel; and lastly we swam the
tin ironclad in the bath, with the soap-dish for a pirate.
</p>
<p>Next morning the air was rich with spices, porpoises rolled
and gambolled round the bows, and the South Sea Islands lay full
in view (they were the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> South Sea
Islands, of course&mdash;not the badly furnished journeymen-islands
that are to be perceived on the map).  As for the pirate
brigantine and the man-of-war, I don't really know what became of
them.  They had played their part very well, for the time, but I
wasn't going to bother to account for them, so I just let them
evaporate quietly.  The islands provided plenty of fresh
occupation.  For here were little bays of silvery


<pb n="165"/>
sand, dotted with land-crabs; groves of palm-trees wherein
monkeys frisked and pelted each other with cocoanuts; and caves,
and sites for stockades, and hidden treasures significantly
indicated by skulls, in riotous plenty; while birds and beasts of
every colour and all latitudes made pleasing noises which excited
the sporting instinct.
</p>
<p>The islands lay conveniently close together, which
necessitated careful steering as we threaded the devious and
intricate channels that separated them.  Of course no one else
could be trusted at the wheel, so it is not surprising that for
some time I quite forgot that there was such a thing as a
Princess on board.  This is too much the masculine way, whenever
there's any real business doing.  However, I remembered her as
soon as the anchor was dropped, and I went below and consoled
her, and we had breakfast together, and she was allowed


<pb n="166"/>
to "pour out," which quite made up for everything.  When
breakfast was over we ordered out the captain's gig, and rowed
all about the islands, and paddled, and explored, and hunted
bisons and beetles and butterflies, and found everything we
wanted.  And I gave her pink shells and tortoises and great milky
pearls and little green lizards; and she gave me guinea-pigs, and
coral to make into waistcoat-buttons, and tame sea-otters, and a
real pirate's powder-horn.  It was a prolific day and a long-lasting one, and weary were we with all our hunting and our
getting and our gathering, when at last we clambered into the
captain's gig and rowed back to a late tea.
</p>
<p>The following day my conscience rose up and accused me.  This
was not what I had come out to do.  These triflings with pearls
and parrakeets, these <hi rend="italic">al fresco</hi>
luncheons off yams and bananas&mdash;there


<pb n="167"/>
was no "making of history" about them, I resolved that without
further dallying I would turn to and capture the French frigate,
according to the original programme.  So we upped anchor with the
morning tide, and set all sail for San Salvador.
</p>
<p>Of course I had no idea where San Salvador really was.  I
haven't now, for that matter.  But it seemed a right-sounding
sort of name for a place that was to have a bay that was to hold
a French frigate that was to be cut out; so, as I said, we sailed
for San Salvador, and made the bay about eight bells that
evening, and saw the topmasts of the frigate over the headland
that sheltered her.  And forthwith there was summoned a Council
of War.
</p>
<p>It is a very serious matter, a Council of War.  We had not
held one hitherto, pirates and truck of that sort not calling for
such solemn treatment.  But in an affair


<pb n="168"/>
that might almost be called international, it seemed well to
proceed gravely and by regular steps.  So we met in my cabin&mdash;the
Princess, and the bo'sun, and a boy from the real-life lot, and a
man from among the book-men, and a fellow from No-man's-land, and
myself in the chair.
</p>
<p>The bo'sun had taken part in so many cuttings-out during his
past career that practically he did all the talking, and was the
Council of War himself.  It was to be an affair of boats, he
explained.  A boat's-crew would be told off to cut the cables,
and two boats'-crews to climb stealthily on board and overpower
the sleeping Frenchmen, and two more boats'crews to haul the
doomed vessel out of the bay.  This made rather a demand on my
limited resources as to crews; but I was prepared to stretch a
point in a case like this, and I speedily brought my numbers up
to the requisite efficiency.


<pb n="169"/>
</p>
<p>The night was both moonless and star-less&mdash;I had arranged all
that&mdash;when the boats pushed off from the side of our vessel, and
made their way toward the ship that, unfortunately for itself,
had been singled out by Fate to carry me home in triumph.  I was
in excellent spirits, and, indeed, as I stepped over the side, a
lawless idea crossed my mind, of discovering another Princess on
board the frigate&mdash;a French one this time; I had heard that that
sort was rather nice.  But I abandoned the notion at once,
recollecting that the heroes of all history had always been noted
for their unswerving constancy.
</p>
<p>The French captain was snug in bed when I clambered in through
his cabin window and held a naked cutlass to his throat.
Naturally he was surprised and considerably alarmed, till I
discharged one of my set speeches at him, pointing out that my
men already had his crew


<pb n="170"/>
under hatchways, that his vessel was even then being towed out of
harbour, and that, on his accepting the situation with a good
grace, his person and private property would be treated with all
the respect due to the representative of a great nation for which
I entertained feelings of the profoundest admiration and regard
and all that sort of thing.  It was a beautiful speech.  The
Frenchman at once presented me with his parole, in the usual way,
and, in a reply of some power and pathos, only begged that I
would retire a moment while he put on his trousers.  This I
gracefully consented to do, and the incident ended.
</p>
<p>Two of my boats were sunk by the fire from the forts on the
shore, and several brave fellows were severely wounded in the
hand-to-hand struggle with the French crew for the possession of
the frigate.  But the bo'sun's admirable strategy, and


<pb n="171"/>
my own reckless gallantry in securing the French captain at the
outset, had the fortunate result of keeping down the death-rate.
It was all for the sake of the Princess that I had arranged so
comparatively tame a victory.  For myself, I rather liked a fair
amount of blood-letting, red-hot shot, and flying splinters.  But
when you have girls about the place, they have got to be
considered to a certain extent.
</p>
<p>There was another supper-party that night, in my cabin, as
soon as we had got well out to sea; and the French captain, who
was the guest of the evening, was in the greatest possible form.
We became sworn friends, and exchanged invitations to come and
stay at each other's homes, and really it was quite difficult to
induce him to take his leave.  But at last he and his crew were
bundled into their boats; and after I had pressed some pirate bullion


<pb n="172"/>
upon them&mdash;delicately, of course, but in a pleasant manner
that admitted of no denial&mdash;the gallant fellows quite broke down,
and we parted, our bosoms heaving with a full sense of each
other's magnanimity and good-fellowship.
</p>
<p>The next day, which was nearly all taken up with shifting our
quarters into the new frigate, so honourably and easily acquired,
was a very pleasant one, as everyone who has gone up in the world
and moved into a larger house will readily understand.  At last I
had grim, black guns all along each side, instead of a rotten
brass carronade; at last I had a square-rigged ship, with real
yards, and a proper quarter-deck.  In fact, now that I had soared
as high as could be hoped in a single voyage, it seemed about
time to go home and cut a dash and show off a bit.  The worst of
this ocean-theatre was, it held no proper audience.  It was


<pb n="173"/>
hard, of course, to relinquish all the adventures that still lay
untouched in these Southern seas.  Whaling, for instance, had not
yet been entered upon; the joys of exploration, and strange
inland cities innocent of the white man, still awaited me; and
the book of wrecks and rescues was not yet even opened.  But I
had achieved a frigate and a Princess, and that was not so bad
for a beginning, and more than enough to show off with before
those dull unadventurous folk who continued on their mill-horse
round at home.
</p>
<p>The voyage home was a record one, so far as mere speed was
concerned, and all adventures were scornfully left behind, as we
rattled along, for other adventurers who had still their laurels
to win.  Hardly later than the noon of next day we dropped anchor
in Plymouth Sound, and heard the intoxicating clamour of bells,
the roar of artillery, and the hoarse cheers


<pb n="174"/>
of an excited populace surging down to the quays, that told us we
were being appreciated at something like our true merits.  The
Lord Mayor was waiting there to receive us, and with him several
Admirals of the Fleet, as we walked down the lane of pushing,
enthusiastic Devonians, the Princess and I, and our war-worn,
weather-beaten, spoil-laden crew.  Everybody was very nice about
the French frigate, and the pirate booty, and the scars still
fresh on our young limbs; yet I think what I liked best of all
was, that they all pronounced the Princess to be a duck, and a
peerless, brown-haired darling, and a true mate for a hero, and
of the right Princess-breed.
</p>
<p>The air was thick with invitations and with the smell of civic
banquets in a forward stage; but I sternly waved all festivities
aside.  The coaches-and-four I had ordered immediately on
arriving were


<pb n="175"/>
blocking the whole of the High Street; the champing of bits and
the pawing of gravel summoned us to take our seats and be off, to
where the real performance awaited us, compared with which all
this was but an interlude.  I placed the Princess in the most
highly gilded coach of the lot, and mounted to my place at her
side; and the rest of the crew scrambled on board of the others
as best they might.  The whips cracked and the crowd scattered
and cheered as we broke into a gallop for home.  The noisy bells
burst into a farewell peal&mdash;
</p>
<p>Yes, that was undoubtedly the usual bell for school-room tea.
And high time too, I thought, as I tumbled out of the bath, which
was beginning to feel very hard to the projecting portions of my
frame-work.  As I trotted downstairs, hungrier even than usual,
farewells floated up from the front door, and I heard the


<pb n="176"/>
departing voices of our angular elderly visitors as they made
their way down the walk.  Man was still catching it, apparently&mdash;
Man was getting it hot.  And much Man cared!  The seas were his,
and their islands; he had his frigates for the taking, his
pirates and their hoards for an unregarded cutlass-stroke or two;
and there were Princesses in plenty waiting for him somewhere&mdash;
Princesses of the right sort.

<head>THE RELUCTANT DRAGON</head>


<p>FOOTPRINTS in the snow have been unfailing provokers of
sentiment ever since snow was first a white wonder in this drab-coloured world of ours.  In a poetry-book presented to one of us
by an aunt, there was a poem by one Wordsworth in which they
stood out strongly&mdash;with a picture all to themselves, too&mdash;but we
didn't think very highly either of the poem or the sentiment.
Footprints in the sand, now, were quite another matter, and we
grasped Crusoe's attitude of mind much more easily than
Wordsworth's.  Excitement and mystery, curiosity and suspense&mdash;
these were the only sentiments that tracks, whether in sand or in
snow, were able to arouse in us.
</p>

<pb n="180"/>

<p>We had awakened early that winter morning, puzzled at first by
the added light that filled the room.  Then, when the truth at
last fully dawned on us and we knew that snow-balling was no
longer a wistful dream, but a solid certainty waiting for us
outside, it was a mere brute fight for the necessary clothes, and
the lacing of boots seemed a clumsy invention, and the buttoning
of coats an unduly tedious form of fastening, with all that snow
going to waste at our very door.
</p>
<p>When dinner-time came we had to be dragged in by the scruff of
our necks.  The short armistice over, the combat was resumed; but
presently Charlotte and I, a little weary of contests and of
missiles that ran shudderingly down inside one's clothes, forsook
the trampled battle-field of the lawn and went exploring the
blank virgin spaces of the white world that lay beyond.  It
stretched away unbroken on


<pb n="181"/>
every side of us, this mysterious soft garment under which our
familiar world had so suddenly hidden itself.  Faint imprints
showed where a casual bird had alighted, but of other traffic
there was next to no sign; which made these strange tracks all
the more puzzling.
</p>
<p>We came across them first at the corner of the shrubbery, and
pored over them long, our hands on our knees.  Experienced
trappers that we knew ourselves to be, it was annoying to be
brought up suddenly by a beast we could not at once identify.
</p>
<p>"Don't you know?" said Charlotte, rather scornfully.  "Thought
you knew all the beasts that ever was."
</p>
<p>This put me on my mettle, and I hastily rattled off a string
of animal names embracing both the arctic and the tropic zones,
but without much real confidence.
</p>
<p>"No," said Charlotte, on consideration;


<pb n="182"/>
"they won't any of 'em quite do.  Seems like something
<hi rend="italic">lizardy</hi>.  Did you say a iguanodon?  Might
be that, p'raps.  But that's not British, and we want a real
British beast.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> think it's a
dragon!"
</p>
<p>"'T isn't half big enough," I objected.
</p>
<p>"Well, all dragons must be small to begin with," said
Charlotte: "like everything else.  P'raps this is a little dragon
who's got lost.  A little dragon would be rather nice to have.
He might scratch and spit, but he couldn't
<hi rend="italic">do</hi> anything really.  Let's track him down!"
</p>
<p>So we set off into the wide snow-clad world, hand in hand, our
hearts big with expectation,&mdash;complacently confident that by a
few smudgy traces in the snow we were in a fair way to capture a
half-grown specimen of a fabulous beast.
</p>
<p>We ran the monster across the paddock and along the hedge of
the next field, and then he took to the road like any tame
civilized


<pb n="183"/>
tax-payer.  Here his tracks became blended with and lost among
more ordinary footprints, but imagination and a fixed idea will
do a great deal, and we were sure we knew the direction a dragon
would naturally take.  The traces, too, kept reappearing at
intervals&mdash;at least Charlotte maintained they did, and as it was
<hi rend="italic">her</hi> dragon I left the following of
the slot to her and trotted along peacefully, feeling that it was
an expedition anyhow and something was sure to come out of it.
</p>
<p>Charlotte took me across another field or two, and through a
copse, and into a fresh road; and I began to feel sure it was
only her confounded pride that made her go on pretending to see
dragon-tracks instead of owning she was entirely at fault, like a
reasonable person.  At last she dragged me excitedly through a
gap in a hedge of an obviously private character; the waste, open
world of field and hedge-row


<pb n="184"/>
disappeared, and we found ourselves in a garden, well-kept,
secluded, most un-dragon-haunted in appearance.  Once inside, I
knew where we were.  This was the garden of my friend the circus-man, though I had never approached it before by a lawless gap,
from this unfamiliar side.  And here was the circus-man himself,
placidly smoking a pipe as he strolled up and down the walks.  I
stepped up to him and asked him politely if he had lately seen a
Beast.
</p>
<p>"May I inquire," he said, with all civility, "what particular
sort of a Beast you may happen to be looking for?"
</p>
<p>"It's a <hi rend="italic">lizardy</hi> sort of Beast," I
explained.  "Charlotte says it's a dragon, but she doesn't really
know much about beasts."
</p>
<p>The circus-man looked round about him slowly.  "I don't
<hi rend="italic">think</hi>," he said, "that I've seen a dragon
in these parts recently.  But if I come across one I'll know it
be


<pb n="185"/>
longs to you, and I'll have him taken round to you at once."
</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," said Charlotte, "but don't
<hi rend="italic">trouble</hi> about it, please, 'cos p'raps it
isn't a dragon after all.  Only I thought I saw his little
footprints in the snow, and we followed 'em up, and they seemed
to lead right in here, but maybe it's all a mistake, and thank
you all the same."
</p>
<p>"Oh, no trouble at all," said the circus-man, cheerfully.  "I
should be only too pleased.  But of course, as you say, it
<hi rend="italic">may</hi> be a mistake.  And it's getting dark,
and he seems to have got away for the present, whatever he is.
You'd better come in and have some tea.  I'm quite alone, and
we'll make a roaring fire, and I've got the biggest Book of
Beasts you ever saw.  It's got every beast in the world, and all
of 'em coloured; and we'll try and find
<hi rend="italic">your</hi> beast in it!"


<pb n="186"/>
</p>
<p>We were always ready for tea at any time, and especially when
combined with beasts.  There was marmalade, too, and apricot-jam,
brought in expressly for us; and afterwards the beast-book was
spread out, and, as the man had truly said, it contained every
sort of beast that had ever been in the world.
</p>
<p>The striking of six o'clock set the more prudent Charlotte
nudging me, and we recalled ourselves with an effort from Beast&mdash;
land, and reluctantly stood up to go.
</p>
<p>"Here, I'm coming along with you," said the circus-man.  "I
want another pipe, and a walk'll do me good.  You needn't talk to
me unless you like."
</p>
<p>Our spirits rose to their wonted level again.  The way had
seemed so long, the outside world so dark and eerie, after the
bright warm room and the highly-coloured beast-book.  But a walk
with a real Man&mdash;why, that was a treat in itself!  We set


<pb n="187"/>
off briskly, the Man in the middle.  I looked up at him and
wondered whether I should ever live to smoke a big pipe with that
careless sort of majesty!  But Charlotte, whose young mind was
not set on tobacco as a possible goal, made herself heard from
the other side.
</p>
<p>"Now, then," she said, "tell us a story, please, won't you?"
</p>
<p>The Man sighed heavily and looked about him.  "I knew it," he
groaned.  "I <hi rend="italic">knew</hi> I should have to
tell a story.  Oh, why did I leave my pleasant fireside?  Well, I
<hi rend="italic">will</hi> tell you a story.  Only let me
think a minute."
</p>
<p>So he thought a minute, and then he told us this story.

</p>
<p>Long ago&mdash;might have been hundreds of years ago&mdash;in a cottage
half-way between this village and yonder shoulder of the Downs up
there, a shepherd lived


<pb n="188"/>
with his wife and their little son.  Now the shepherd spent his
days&mdash;and at certain times of the year his nights too&mdash;up on the
wide ocean-bosom of the Downs, with only the sun and the stars
and the sheep for company, and the friendly chattering world of
men and women far out of sight and hearing.  But his little son,
when he wasn't helping his father, and often when he was as well,
spent much of his time buried in big volumes that he borrowed
from the affable gentry and interested parsons of the country
round about.  And his parents were very fond of him, and rather
proud of him too, though they didn't let on in his hearing, so he
was left to go his own way and read as much as he liked; and
instead of frequently getting a cuff on the side of the head, as
might very well have happened to him, he was treated more or less
as an equal by his parents, who sensibly thought it a very fair
division of labour that they


<pb n="189"/>
should supply the practical knowledge, and he the book-learning.
They knew that book-learning often came in useful at a pinch, in
spite of what their neighbours said.  What the Boy chiefly
dabbled in was natural history and fairy-tales, and he just took
them as they came, in a sandwichy sort of way, without making any
distinctions; and really his course of reading strikes one as
rather sensible.
</p>
<p>One evening the shepherd, who for some nights past had been
disturbed and preoccupied, and off his usual mental balance, came
home all of a tremble, and, sitting down at the table where his
wife and son were peacefully employed, she with her seam, he in
following out the adventures of the Giant with no Heart in his
Body, exclaimed with much agitation:
</p>
<p>"It's all up with me, Maria!  Never no more can I go up on
them there Downs, was it ever so!"


<pb n="190"/>
</p>
<p>"Now don't you take on like that," said his wife, who was a
<hi rend="italic">very</hi> sensible woman: "but tell us all
about it first, whatever it is as has given you this shake-up,
and then me and you and the son here, between us, we ought to be
able to get to the bottom of it!"
</p>
<p>"It began some nights ago," said the shepherd.  "You know that
cave up there&mdash;I never liked it, somehow, and the sheep never
liked it neither, and when sheep don't like a thing there's
generally some reason for it.  Well, for some time past there's
been faint noises coming from that cave&mdash;noises like heavy
sighings, with grunts mixed up in them; and sometimes a snoring,
far away down&mdash;<hi rend="italic">real</hi> snoring, yet somehow
not <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> snoring, like you and me
o'nights, you know!"
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"I</hi> know," remarked the Boy,
quietly.
</p>
<p>"Of course I was terrible frightened," the shepherd went on;
"yet somehow I



<pb n="191"/>
couldn't keep away.  So this very evening, before I come down, I
took a cast round by the cave, quietly.  And there&mdash;O Lord! there
I saw him at last, as plain as I see you!"
</p>
<p>"Saw <hi rend="italic">who?"</hi> said his wife,
beginning to share in her husband's nervous terror.
</p>
<p>"Why <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, I'm a telling you!" said
the shepherd.  "He was sticking half-way out of the cave, and
seemed to be enjoying of the cool of the evening in a poetical
sort of way.  He was as big as four cart-horses, and all covered
with shiny scales&mdash;deep-blue scales at the top of him, shading
off to a tender sort o' green below.  As he breathed, there was
that sort of flicker over his nostrils that you see over our
chalk roads on a baking windless day in summer.  He had his chin
on his paws, and I should say he was meditating about things.
Oh, yes, a peaceable sort o' beast enough, and not ramping or
carrying


<pb n="192"/>
on or doing anything but what was quite right and proper.  I
admit all that.  And yet, what am I to do?
<hi rend="italic">Scales</hi>, you know, and claws, and a tail for
certain, though I didn't see that end of him&mdash;I ain't
<hi rend="italic">used</hi> to 'em, and I don't
<hi rend="italic">hold</hi> with 'em, and that's a fact!"
</p>
<p>The Boy, who had apparently been absorbed in his book during
his father's recital, now closed the volume, yawned, clasped his
hands behind his head, and said sleepily:
</p>
<p>"It's all right, father.  Don't you worry.  It's only a
dragon."
</p>
<p>"Only a dragon?" cried his father.  "What do you mean, sitting
there, you and your dragons?  <hi rend="italic">Only</hi> a
dragon indeed!  And what do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> know
about it?"
</p>
<p>"'Cos it <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, and 'cos I
<hi rend="italic">do</hi> know," replied the Boy, quietly.  "Look
here, father, you know we've each of us got our line.
<hi rend="italic">You</hi>


<pb n="193"/>
know about sheep, and weather, and things;
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> know about dragons.  I always said, you
know, that that cave up there was a dragon-cave.  I always said
it must have belonged to a dragon some time, and ought to belong
to a dragon now, if rules count for anything.  Well, now you tell
me it <hi rend="italic">has</hi> got a dragon, and so
<hi rend="italic">that's</hi> all right.  I'm not half as much
surprised as when you told me it
<hi rend="italic">hadn't</hi> got a dragon.  Rules always come
right if you wait quietly.  Now, please, just leave this all to
me.  And I'll stroll up to-morrow morning&mdash;no, in the morning I
can't, I've got a whole heap of things to do&mdash;well, perhaps in
the evening, if I'm quite free, I'll go up and have a talk to
him, and you'll find it'll be all right.  Only, please, don't you
go worrying round there without me.  You don't understand 'em a
bit, and they're very sensitive, you know!"
</p>
<p>"He's quite right, father," said the sensible


<pb n="194"/>
mother.  "As he says, dragons is his line and not ours.  He's
wonderful knowing about book-beasts, as every one allows.  And to
tell the truth, I'm not half happy in my own mind, thinking of
that poor animal lying alone up there, without a bit o' hot
supper or anyone to change the news with; and maybe we'll be able
to do something for him; and if he ain't quite respectable our
Boy'll find it out quick enough.  He's got a pleasant sort o' way
with him that makes everybody tell him everything."
</p>
<p>Next day, after he'd had his tea, the Boy strolled up the
chalky track that led to the summit of the Downs; and there, sure
enough, he found the dragon, stretched lazily on the sward in
front of his cave.  The view from that point was a magnificent
one.  To the right and left, the bare and billowy leagues of
Downs; in front, the vale, with its clustered homesteads, its


<pb n="195"/>
threads of white roads running through orchards and well-tilled
acreage, and, far away, a hint of grey old cities on the horizon.
A cool breeze played over the surface of the grass and the silver
shoulder of a large moon was showing above distant junipers.  No
wonder the dragon seemed in a peaceful and contented mood;
indeed, as the Boy approached he could hear the beast purring
with a happy regularity.  "Well, we live and learn!" he said to
himself.  "None of my books ever told me that dragons purred!"
</p>
<p>"Hullo, dragon!" said the Boy, quietly, when he had got up to
him.
</p>
<p>The dragon, on hearing the approaching footsteps, made the
beginning of a courteous effort to rise.  But when he saw it was
a Boy, he set his eyebrows severely.
</p>
<p>"Now don't you hit me," he said; "or



<pb n="196"/>
bung stones, or squirt water, or anything.  I won't have it, I
tell you!"
</p>
<p>"Not goin' to hit you," said the Boy wearily, dropping on the
grass beside the beast: "and don't, for goodness' sake, keep on
saying `Don't;' I hear so much of it, and it's monotonous, and
makes me tired.  I've simply looked in to ask you how you were
and all that sort of thing; but if I'm in the way I can easily
clear out.  I've lots of friends, and no one can say I'm in the
habit of shoving myself in where I'm not wanted!"
</p>
<p>"No, no, don't go off in a huff," said the dragon, hastily;
"fact is,&mdash;I'm as happy up here as the day's long; never without
an occupation, dear fellow, never without an occupation!  And
yet, between ourselves, it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a
trifle dull at times."
</p>
<p>The Boy bit off a stalk of grass and chewed it.  "Going to
make a long stay here?" he asked, politely.



<pb n="197"/>
</p>
<p>"Can't hardly say at present," replied the dragon.  "It seems
a nice place enough&mdash;but I've only been here a short time, and
one must look about and reflect and consider before settling
down.  It's rather a serious thing, settling down.  Besides&mdash;now
I'm going to tell you something!  You'd never guess it if you
tried ever so!&mdash;fact is, I'm such a confoundedly lazy beggar!"
</p>
<p>"You surprise me," said the Boy, civilly.
</p>
<p>"It's the sad truth," the dragon went on, settling down
between his paws and evidently delighted to have found a listener
at last: "and I fancy that's really how I came to be here.  You
see all the other fellows were so active and
<hi rend="italic">earnest</hi> and all that sort of thing&mdash;always
rampaging, and skirmishing, and scouring the desert sands, and
pacing the margin of the sea, and chasing knights all over the
place, and devouring damsels, and going


<pb n="198"/>
on generally&mdash;whereas I liked to get my meals regular and then to
prop my back against a bit of rock and snooze a bit, and wake up
and think of things going on and how they kept going on just the
same, you know!  So when it happened I got fairly caught."
</p>
<p>"When <hi rend="italic">what</hi> happened, please?"
asked the Boy.
</p>
<p>"That's just what I don't precisely know," said the dragon.
"I suppose the earth sneezed, or shook itself, or the bottom
dropped out of something.  Anyhow there was a shake and a roar
and a general stramash, and I found myself miles away underground
and wedged in as tight as tight.  Well, thank goodness, my wants
are few, and at any rate I had peace and quietness and wasn't
always being asked to come along and
<hi rend="italic">do</hi> something.  And I've got such an active
mind&mdash;always occupied, I assure you!  But time went on,



<pb n="199"/>
and there was a certain sameness about the life, and at last I
began to think it would be fun to work my way upstairs and see
what you other fellows were doing.  So I scratched and burrowed,
and worked this way and that way and at last I came out through
this cave here.  And I like the country, and the view, and the
people&mdash;what I've seen of 'em&mdash;and on the whole I feel inclined
to settle down here."
</p>
<p>"What's your mind always occupied about?" asked the Boy.
"That's what I want to know."
</p>
<p>The dragon coloured slightly and looked away.  Presently he
said bashfully:
</p>
<p>"Did you ever&mdash;just for fun&mdash;try to make up poetry&mdash;verses,
you know?"
</p>
<p>"'Course I have," said the Boy.  "Heaps of it.  And some of
it's quite good, I feel sure, only there's no one here cares
about it.  Mother's very kind and all that, when I read it to
her, and so's father for that


<pb n="200"/>
matter.  But somehow they don't seem to&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"Exactly," cried the dragon; "my own case exactly.  They don't
seem to, and you can't argue with 'em about it.  Now you've got
culture, you have, I could tell it on you at once, and I should
just like your candid opinion about some little things I threw
off lightly, when I was down there.  I'm awfully pleased to have
met you, and I'm hoping the other neighbours will be equally
agreeable.  There was a very nice old gentleman up here only last
night, but he didn't seem to want to intrude."
</p>
<p>"That was my father," said the boy, "and he
<hi rend="italic">is</hi> a nice old gentleman, and I'll introduce
you some day if you like."
</p>
<p>"Can't you two come up here and dine or something to-morrow?"
asked the dragon eagerly.  "Only, of course, if you've got
nothing better to do," he added politely.


<pb n="201"/>
</p>
<p>"Thanks awfully," said the Boy, "but we don't go out anywhere
without my mother, and, to tell you the truth, I'm afraid she
mightn't quite approve of you.  You see there's no getting over
the hard fact that you're a dragon, is there?  And when you talk
of settling down, and the neighbours, and so on, I can't help
feeling that you don't quite realize your position.  You're an
enemy of the human race, you see!"
</p>
<p>"Haven't got an enemy in the world," said the dragon,
cheerfully.  Too lazy to make 'em, to begin with.  And if I
<hi rend="italic">do</hi> read other fellows my poetry, I'm always
ready to listen to theirs!"
</p>
<p>"Oh, dear!" cried the boy, "I wish you'd try and grasp the
situation properly.  When the other people find you out, they'll
come after you with spears and swords and all sorts of things.
You'll have to be exterminated, according to their


<pb n="202"/>
way of looking at it!  You're a scourge, and a pest, and a
baneful monster!"
</p>
<p>"Not a word of truth in it," said the dragon, wagging his head
solemnly.  "Character'll bear the strictest investigation.  And
now, there's a little sonnet-thing I was working on when you
appeared on the scene&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"Oh, if you <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> be sensible,"
cried the Boy, getting up, "I'm going off home.  No, I can't stop
for sonnets; my mother's sitting up.  I'll look you up to-morrow,
sometime or other, and do for goodness' sake try and realize that
you're a pestilential scourge, or you'll find yourself in a most
awful fix.  Good-night!"
</p>
<p>The Boy found it an easy matter to set the mind of his
parents' at ease about his new friend.  They had always left that
branch to him, and they took his word without a murmur.  The
shepherd was formally introduced and many compliments and


<pb n="203"/>
kind inquiries were exchanged.  His wife, however, though
expressing her willingness to do anything she could&mdash;to mend
things, or set the cave to rights, or cook a little something
when the dragon had been poring over sonnets and forgotten his
meals, as male things <hi rend="italic">will</hi> do, could
not be brought to recognize him formally.  The fact that he was a
dragon and "they didn't know who he was" seemed to count for
everything with her.  She made no objection, however, to her
little son spending his evenings with the dragon quietly, so long
as he was home by nine o'clock: and many a pleasant night they
had, sitting on the sward, while the dragon told stories of old,
old times, when dragons were quite plentiful and the world was a
livelier place than it is now, and life was full of thrills and
jumps and surprises.
</p>
<p>What the Boy had feared, however, soon came to pass.  The most
modest and retiring


<pb n="204"/>
dragon in the world, if he's as big
as four cart-horses and covered with blue scales, cannot keep
altogether out of the public view.  And so in the village tavern
of nights the fact that a real live dragon sat brooding in the
cave on the Downs was naturally a subject for talk.  Though the
villagers were extremely frightened, they were rather proud as
well.  It was a distinction to have a dragon of your own, and it
was felt to be a feather in the cap of the village.  Still, all
were agreed that this sort of thing couldn't be allowed to go on.
The dreadful beast must be exterminated, the country-side must be
freed from this pest, this terror, this destroying scourge.  The
fact that not even a hen roost was the worse for the dragon's
arrival wasn't allowed to have anything to do with it.  He was a
dragon, and he couldn't deny it, and if he didn't choose to
behave as such that was his own lookout.  But in


<pb n="205"/>
spite of much valiant talk no hero was found willing to take
sword and spear and free the suffering village and win deathless
fame; and each night's heated discussion always ended in nothing.
Meanwhile the dragon, a happy Bohemian, lolled on the turf,
enjoyed the sunsets, told antediluvian anecdotes to the Boy, and
polished his old verses while meditating on fresh ones.
</p>
<p>One day the Boy, on walking in to the village, found
everything wearing a festal appearance which was not to be
accounted for in the calendar.  Carpets and gay-coloured stuffs
were hung out of the windows, the church-bells clamoured noisily,
the little street was flower-strewn, and the whole population
jostled each other along either side of it, chattering, shoving,
and ordering each other to stand back.  The Boy saw a friend of
his own age in the crowd and hailed him.


<pb n="206"/>
</p>
<p>"What's up?" he cried.  "Is it the players, or bears, or a
circus, or what?"
</p>
<p>"It's all right," his friend hailed back.  "He's a-coming."
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">"Who's</hi> a-coming?" demanded the
Boy, thrusting into the throng.
</p>
<p>"Why, St. George, of course," replied his friend.  "He's heard
tell of our dragon, and he's comin' on purpose to slay the deadly
beast, and free us from his horrid yoke.  O my! won't there be a
jolly fight!"
</p>
<p>Here was news indeed!  The Boy felt that he ought to make
quite sure for himself, and he wriggled himself in between the
legs of his good-natured elders, abusing them all the time for
their unmannerly habit of shoving.  Once in the front rank, he
breathlessly awaited the arrival.
</p>
<p>Presently from the far-away end of the line came the sound of
cheering.


<pb n="207"/>

Next, the measured tramp of a great war-horse made his heart beat
quicker, and then he found himself cheering with the rest, as,
amidst welcoming shouts, shrill cries of women, uplifting of
babies and waving of handkerchiefs, St. George paced slowly up
the street.  The Boy's heart stood still and he breathed with
sobs, the beauty and the grace of the hero were so far beyond
anything he had yet seen.  His fluted armour was inlaid with
gold, his plumed helmet hung at his saddle-bow, and his thick
fair hair framed a face gracious and gentle beyond expression
till you caught the sternness in his eyes.  He drew rein in front
of the little inn, and the villagers crowded round with greetings
and thanks and voluble statements of their wrongs and grievances
and oppressions.  The Boy heard the grave gentle voice of the
Saint, assuring them that all would be well now,



<pb n="208"/>
and that he would stand by them and see them righted and free
them from their foe; then he dismounted and passed through the
doorway and the crowd poured in after him.  But the Boy made off
up the hill as fast as he could lay his legs to the ground.
</p>
<p>"It's all up, dragon!" he shouted as soon as he was within
sight of the beast.  "He's coming!  He's here now!  You'll have
to pull yourself together and <hi rend="italic">do</hi>
something at last!"
</p>
<p>The dragon was licking his scales and rubbing them with a bit
of house-flannel the Boy's mother had lent him, till he shone
like a great turquoise.
</p>
<p>"Don't be <hi rend="italic">violent</hi>, Boy," he said
without looking round.  "Sit down and get your breath, and try
and remember that the noun governs the verb, and then perhaps
you'll be good enough to tell me
<hi rend="italic">who's</hi> coming?"


<pb n="209"/>
</p>
<p>"That's right, take it coolly," said the Boy.  "Hope you'll be
half as cool when I've got through with my news.  It's only St.
George who's coming, that's all; he rode into the village half-an-hour ago.  Of course you can lick him&mdash;a great big fellow like
you!  But I thought I'd warn you, 'cos he's sure to be round
early, and he's got the longest, wickedest-looking spear you ever
did see!"  And the Boy got up and began to jump round in sheer
delight at the prospect of the battle.
</p>
<p>"O deary, deary me," moaned the dragon; "this is too awful.  I
won't see him, and that's flat.  I don't want to know the fellow
at all.  I'm sure he's not nice.  You must tell him to go away at
once, please.  Say he can write if he likes, but I can't give him
an interview.  I'm not seeing anybody at present."
</p>
<p>"Now dragon, dragon," said the Boy



<pb n="210"/>
imploringly, "don't be perverse and wrongheaded.  You've
<hi rend="italic">got</hi> to fight him some time or other, you
know, 'cos he's St. George and you're the dragon.  Better get it
over, and then we can go on with the sonnets.  And you ought to
consider other people a little, too.  If it's been dull up here
for you, think how dull it's been for me!"
</p>
<p>"My dear little man," said the dragon solemnly, "just
understand, once for all, that I can't fight and I won't fight.
I've never fought in my life, and I'm not going to begin now,
just to give you a Roman holiday.  In old days I always let the
other fellows&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">earnest</hi> fellows&mdash;
do all the fighting, and no doubt that's why I have the pleasure
of being here now."
</p>
<p>"But if you don't fight he'll cut your head off!" gasped the
Boy, miserable at the prospect of losing both his fight and his
friend.


<pb n="211"/>
</p>
<p>"Oh, I think not," said the dragon in his lazy way.  "You'll
be able to arrange something.  I've every confidence in you,
you're such a <hi rend="italic">manager</hi>.  Just run
down, there's a dear chap, and make it all right.  I leave it
entirely to you."
</p>
<p>The Boy made his way back to the village in a state of great
despondency.  First of all, there wasn't going to be any fight;
next, his dear and honoured friend the dragon hadn't shown up in
quite such a heroic light as he would have liked; and lastly,
whether the dragon was a hero at heart or not, it made no
difference, for St. George would most undoubtedly cut his head
off.  "Arrange things indeed!" he said bitterly to himself.  "The
dragon treats the whole affair as if it was an invitation to tea
and croquet."
</p>
<p>The villagers were straggling homewards as he passed up the
street, all of


<pb n="212"/>
them in the highest spirits, and gleefully discussing the
splendid fight that was in store.  The Boy pursued his way to the
inn, and passed into the principal chamber, where St. George now
sat alone, musing over the chances of the fight, and the sad
stories of rapine and of wrong that had so lately been poured
into his sympathetic ears.
</p>
<p>"May I come in, St. George?" said the Boy politely, as he
paused at the door.  "I want to talk to you about this little
matter of the dragon, if you're not tired of it by this time."
</p>
<p>"Yes, come in, Boy," said the Saint kindly.  "Another tale of
misery and wrong, I fear me.  Is it a kind parent, then, of whom
the tyrant has bereft you?  Or some tender sister or brother?
Well, it shall soon be avenged."
</p>
<p>"Nothing of the sort," said the Boy.  "There's a
misunderstanding somewhere,


<pb n="213"/>

and I want to put it right.  The fact is, this is a
<hi rend="italic">good</hi> dragon."
</p>
<p>"Exactly," said St. George, smiling pleasantly, "I quite
understand.  A good <hi rend="italic">dragon</hi>.  Believe
me, I do not in the least regret that he is an adversary worthy
of my steel, and no feeble specimen of his noxious tribe."
</p>
<p>"But he's <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a noxious tribe,"
cried the Boy distressedly.  "Oh dear, oh dear, how
<hi rend="italic">stupid</hi> men are when they get an idea into
their heads!  I tell you he's a <hi rend="italic">good</hi>
dragon, and a friend of mine, and tells me the most beautiful
stories you ever heard, all about old times and when he was
little.  And he's been so kind to mother, and mother'd do
anything for him.  And father likes him too, though father
doesn't hold with art and poetry much, and always falls asleep
when the dragon starts talking about
<hi rend="italic">style</hi>.  But the fact is, nobody can help
liking him when once they know


<pb n="214"/>
him.  He's so engaging and so trustful, and as simple as a
child!"
</p>
<p>"Sit down, and draw your chair up," said St. George.  "I like
a fellow who sticks up for his friends, and I'm sure the dragon
has his good points, if he's got a friend like you.  But that's
not the question.  All this evening I've been listening, with
grief and anguish unspeakable, to tales of murder, theft, and
wrong; rather too highly coloured, perhaps, not always quite
convincing, but forming in the main a most serious roll of crime.
History teaches us that the greatest rascals often possess all
the domestic virtues; and I fear that your cultivated friend, in
spite of the qualities which have won (and rightly) your regard,
has got to be speedily exterminated."
</p>
<p>"Oh, you've been taking in all the yarns those fellows have
been telling you," said the Boy impatiently.  "Why,


<pb n="215"/>
our villagers are the biggest story-tellers in all the country
round.  It's a known fact.  You're a stranger in these parts, or
else you'd have heard it already.  All they want is a
<hi rend="italic">fight</hi>.  They're the most awful beggars for
getting up fights&mdash;it's meat and drink to them.  Dogs, bulls,
dragons&mdash;anything so long as it's a fight.  Why, they've got a
poor innocent badger in the stable behind here, at this moment.
They were going to have some fun with him to-day, but they're
saving him up now till <hi rend="italic">your</hi> little
affair's over.  And I've no doubt they've been telling you what a
hero you were, and how you were bound to win, in the cause of
right and justice, and so on; but let me tell you, I came down
the street just now, and they were betting six to four on the
dragon freely!"
</p>
<p>"Six to four on the dragon!" murmured St. George sadly,
resting his cheek


<pb n="216"/>
on his hand.  "This is an evil world, and sometimes I begin to
think that all the wickedness in it is not entirely bottled up
inside the dragons.  And yet&mdash;may not this wily beast have misled
you as to his real character, in order that your good report of
him may serve as a cloak for his evil deeds?  Nay, may there not
be, at this very moment, some hapless Princess immured within
yonder gloomy cavern?"
</p>
<p>The moment he had spoken, St. George was sorry for what he had
said, the Boy looked so genuinely distressed.
</p>
<p>"I assure you, St. George," he said earnestly, "there's
nothing of the sort in the cave at all.  The dragon's a real
gentleman, every inch of him, and I may say that no one would be
more shocked and grieved than he would, at hearing you talk in
that&mdash;that <hi rend="italic">loose</hi> way about matters on
which he has very strong views!"
</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps I've been over-credulous,"


<pb n="217"/>
said St. George.  "Perhaps I've misjudged the animal.  But what
are we to do?  Here are the dragon and I, almost face to face,
each supposed to be thirsting for each other's blood.  I don't
see any way out of it, exactly.  What do you suggest?  Can't you
arrange things, somehow?"
</p>
<p>"That's just what the dragon said," replied the Boy, rather
nettled.  "Really, the way you two seem to leave everything to
me&mdash;I suppose you couldn't be persuaded to go away quietly, could
you?"
</p>
<p>"Impossible, I fear," said the Saint.  "Quite against the
rules.  <hi rend="italic">You</hi> know that as well as I
do."
</p>
<p>"Well, then, look here," said the Boy, "it's early yet&mdash;would
you mind strolling up with me and seeing the dragon and talking
it over?  It's not far, and any friend of mine will be most
welcome."
</p>
<p>"Well, it's <hi rend="italic">irreguler</hi>," said St.
George,



<pb n="218"/>
rising, "but really it seems about the most sensible thing to do.
You're taking a lot of trouble on your friend's account," he
added, good-naturedly, as they passed out through the door
together.  "But cheer up!  Perhaps there won't have to be any
fight after all."
</p>
<p>"Oh, but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> hope there will,
though!" replied the little fellow, wistfully.

</p>
<p>"I've brought a friend to see you, dragon," said the Boy,
rather loud.
</p>
<p>The dragon woke up with a start.  "I was just&mdash;er&mdash;thinking
about things," he said in his simple way.  "Very pleased to make
your acquaintance, sir.  Charming weather we're having!"
</p>
<p>"This is St George," said the Boy, shortly.  "St. George, let
me introduce you to the dragon.  We've come up to talk things
over quietly, dragon, and now for goodness' sake do let us have a
little



<pb n="219"/>
straight common-sense, and come to some practical business-like
arrangement, for I'm sick of views and theories of life and
personal tendencies, and all that sort of thing.  I may perhaps
add that my mother's sitting up."
</p>
<p>"So glad to meet you, St. George," began the dragon rather
nervously, "because you've been a great traveller, I hear, and
I've always been rather a stay-at-home.  But I can show you many
antiquities, many interesting features of our country-side, if
you're stopping here any time&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"I think," said St. George, in his frank, pleasant way, "that
we'd really better take the advice of our young friend here, and
try to come to some understanding, on a business footing, about
this little affair of ours.  Now don't you think that after all
the simplest plan would be just to fight it out, according to the
rules, and let the



<pb n="220"/>
best man win?  They're betting on you, I may tell you, down in
the village, but I don't mind that!"
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, dragon," said the
Boy, delightedly; "it'll save such a lot of bother!"
</p>
<p>"My young friend, you shut up," said the dragon severely.
"Believe me, St. George," he went on, "there's nobody in the
world I'd sooner oblige than you and this young gentleman here.
But the whole thing's nonsense, and conventionality, and popular
thick-headedness.  There's absolutely nothing to fight about,
from beginning to end.  And anyhow I'm not going to, so that
settles it!"
</p>
<p>"But supposing I make you?" said St. George, rather nettled.
</p>
<p>"You can't," said the dragon, triumphantly.  "I should only go
into my cave and retire for a time down the hole I came up.
You'd soon get heartily sick of sitting



<pb n="221"/>
outside and waiting for me to come out and fight you.  And as
soon as you'd really gone away, why, I'd come up again gaily, for
I tell you frankly, I like this place, and I'm going to stay
here!"
</p>
<p>St. George gazed for a while on the fair landscape around
them.  "But this would be a beautiful place for a fight," he
began again persuasively.  "These great bare rolling Downs for
the arena,&mdash;and me in my golden armour showing up against your
big blue scaly coils!  Think what a picture it would make!"
</p>
<p>"Now you're trying to get at me through my artistic
sensibilities," said the dragon.  "But it won't work.  Not but
what it would make a very pretty picture, as you say," he added,
wavering a little.
</p>
<p>"We seem to be getting rather nearer to
<hi rend="italic">business</hi>," put in the Boy.  "You must see,
dragon, that there's got to be a fight



<pb n="222"/>
of some sort, 'cos you can't want to have to go down that dirty
old hole again and stop there till goodness knows when."
</p>
<p>"It might be arranged," said St. George, thoughtfully.  "I
<hi rend="italic">must</hi> spear you somewhere, of course,
but I'm not bound to hurt you very much.  There's such a lot of
you that there must be a few <hi rend="italic">spare</hi>
places somewhere.  Here, for instance, just behind your foreleg.
It couldn't hurt you much, just here!"
</p>
<p>"Now you're tickling, George," said the dragon, coyly.  "No,
that place won't do at all.  Even if it didn't hurt,&mdash;and I'm
sure it would, awfully,&mdash;it would make me laugh, and that would
spoil everything."
</p>
<p>"Let's try somewhere else, then," said St. George, patiently.
"Under your neck, for instance,&mdash;all these folds of thick skin,&mdash;
if I speared you here you'd never even know I'd done it!"
</p>
<p>"Yes, but are you sure you can hit



<pb n="223"/>
off the right place?" asked the dragon, anxiously.
</p>
<p>"Of course I am," said St. George, with confidence.  "You
leave that to me!"
</p>
<p>"It's just because I've <hi rend="italic">got</hi> to
leave it to you that I'm asking," replied the dragon, rather
testily.  "No doubt you would deeply regret any error you might
make in the hurry of the moment; but you wouldn't regret it half
as much as I should!  However, I suppose we've got to trust
somebody, as we go through life, and your plan seems, on the
whole, as good a one as any."
</p>
<p>"Look here, dragon," interrupted the Boy, a little jealous on
behalf of his friend, who seemed to be getting all the worst of
the bargain: "I don't quite see where
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> come in!  There's to be a fight, apparently,
and you're to be licked; and what I want to know is, what
are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> going to get out of it?"



<pb n="224"/>
</p>
<p>"St. George," said the dragon, "Just tell him, please,&mdash;what
will happen after I'm vanquished in the deadly combat?"
</p>
<p>"Well, according to the rules I suppose I shall lead you in
triumph down to the market-place or whatever answers to it," said
St. George.
</p>
<p>"Precisely," said the dragon.  "And then&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"And then there'll be shoutings and speeches and things,"
continued St. George.  "And I shall explain that you're
converted, and see the error of your ways, and so on."
</p>
<p>"Quite so," said the dragon.  "And then&mdash;?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, and then&mdash;" said St. George, "why, and then there will be
the usual banquet, I suppose."
</p>
<p>"Exactly," said the dragon; "and that's where
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> come in.  Look here," he continued,
addressing the Boy, "I'm bored



<pb n="225"/>
to death up here, and no one really appreciates me.  I'm going
into Society, I am, through the kindly aid of our friend here,
who's taking such a lot of trouble on my account; and you'll find
I've got all the qualities to endear me to people who entertain!
So now that's all settled, and if you don't mind&mdash;I'm an old-fashioned fellow&mdash;don't want to turn you out, but&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"Remember, you'll have to do your proper share of the
fighting, dragon!" said St. George, as he took the hint and rose
to go; "I mean ramping, and breathing fire, and so on!"
</p>
<p>"I can <hi rend="italic">ramp</hi> all right," replied
the dragon, confidently; "as to breathing fire, it's surprising
how easily one gets out of practice, but I'll do the best I can.
Goodnight!"
</p>
<p>They had descended the hill and were almost back in the
village again, when St. George stopped short, "
<hi rend="italic">Knew</hi> I had



<pb n="226"/>
forgotten something," he said.  "There ought to be a Princess.
Terror-stricken and chained to a rock, and all that sort of
thing.  Boy, can't you arrange a Princess?"
</p>
<p>The Boy was in the middle of a tremendous yawn.  "I'm tired to
death," he wailed, "and I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi>
arrange a Princess, or anything more, at this time of night.  And
my mother's sitting up, and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> stop
asking me to arrange more things till tomorrow!"

</p>
<p>Next morning the people began streaming up to the Downs at
quite an early hour, in their Sunday clothes and carrying baskets
with bottle-necks sticking out of them, every one intent on
securing good places for the combat.  This was not exactly a
simple matter, for of course it was quite possible that the
dragon might win, and in that case even those who had put



<pb n="227"/>
their money on him felt they could hardly expect him to deal with
his backers on a different footing to the rest.  Places were
chosen, therefore, with circumspection and with a view to a
speedy retreat in case of emergency; and the front rank was
mostly composed of boys who had escaped from parental control and
now sprawled and rolled about on the grass, regardless of the
shrill threats and warnings discharged at them by their anxious
mothers behind.
</p>
<p>The Boy had secured a good front place, well up towards the
cave, and was feeling as anxious as a stage-manager on a first
night.  Could the dragon be depended upon?  He might change his
mind and vote the whole performance rot; or else, seeing that the
affair had been so hastily planned, without even a rehearsal, he
might be too nervous to show up.  The Boy looked narrowly at the
cave, but it showed no sign of life or occupation.



<pb n="228"/>
Could the dragon have made a moon-light flitting?
</p>
<p>The higher portions of the ground were now black with
sightseers, and presently a sound of cheering and a waving of
handkerchiefs told that something was visible to them which the
Boy, far up towards the dragon-end of the line as he was, could
not yet see.  A minute more and St. George's red plumes topped
the hill, as the Saint rode slowly forth on the great level space
which stretched up to the grim mouth of the cave.  Very gallant
and beautiful he looked, on his tall war-horse, his golden armour
glancing in the sun, his great spear held erect, the little white
pennon, crimson-crossed, fluttering at its point.  He drew rein
and remained motionless.  The lines of spectators began to give
back a little, nervously; and even the boys in front stopped
pulling hair and cuffing each other, and leaned forward
expectant.



<pb n="229"/>
</p>
<p>"Now then, dragon!" muttered the Boy impatiently, fidgeting
where he sat.  He need not have distressed himself, had he only
known.  The dramatic possibilities of the thing had tickled the
dragon immensely, and he had been up from an early hour,
preparing for his first public appearance with as much heartiness
as if the years had run backwards, and he had been again a little
dragonlet, playing with his sisters on the floor of their
mother's cave, at the game of saints-and-dragons, in which the
dragon was bound to win.
</p>
<p>A low muttering, mingled with snorts, now made itself heard;
rising to a bellowing roar that seemed to fill the plain.  Then a
cloud of smoke obscured the mouth of the cave, and out of the
midst of it the dragon himself, shining, sea-blue, magnificent,
pranced splendidly forth; and everybody said, "Oo-oo-oo!" as if
he had been a mighty rocket!  His scales were



<pb n="230"/>
glittering, his long spiky tail lashed his sides, his claws tore
up the turf and sent it flying high over his back, and smoke and
fire incessantly jetted from his angry nostrils.  "Oh, well done,
dragon!" cried the Boy, excitedly.  "Didn't think he had it in
him!" he added to himself.
</p>
<p>St. George lowered his spear, bent his head, dug his heels
into his horse's sides, and came thundering over the turf.  The
dragon charged with a roar and a squeal,&mdash;a great blue whirling
combination of coils and snorts and clashing jaws and spikes and
fire.
</p>
<p>"Missed!" yelled the crowd.  There was a moment's entanglement
of golden armour and blue-green coils, and spiky tail, and then
the great horse, tearing at his bit, carried the Saint, his spear
swung high in the air, almost up to the mouth of the cave.
</p>
<p>The dragon sat down and barked viciously,



<pb n="231"/>
while St. George with difficulty pulled his horse round into
position.
</p>
<p>"End of Round One!" thought the Boy.  "How well they managed
it!  But I hope the Saint won't get excited.  I can trust the
dragon all right.  What a regular play-actor the fellow is!"
</p>
<p>St. George had at last prevailed on his horse to stand steady,
and was looking round him as he wiped his brow.  Catching sight
of the Boy, he smiled and nodded, and held up three fingers for
an instant.
</p>
<p>"It seems to be all planned out," said the Boy to himself.
"Round Three is to be the finishing one, evidently.  Wish it
could have lasted a bit longer.  Whatever's that old fool of a
dragon up to now?"
</p>
<p>The dragon was employing the interval in giving a ramping-performance for the benefit of the crowd.  Ramping, it should be
explained, consists in running round



<pb n="232"/>
and round in a wide circle, and sending waves and ripples of
movement along the whole length of your spine, from your pointed
ears right down to the spike at the end of your long tail.  When
you are covered with blue scales, the effect is particularly
pleasing; and the Boy recollected the dragon's recently expressed
wish to become a social success.
</p>
<p>St. George now gathered up his reins and began to move
forward, dropping the point of his spear and settling himself
firmly in the saddle.
</p>
<p>"Time!" yelled everybody excitedly; and the dragon, leaving
off his ramping, sat up on end, and began to leap from one side
to the other with huge ungainly bounds, whooping like a Red
Indian.  This naturally disconcerted the horse, who swerved
violently, the Saint only just saving himself by the mane; and as
they shot past the dragon delivered a vicious snap


<pb n="233"/>
at the horse's tail which sent the poor beast careering madly far
over the Downs, so that the language of the Saint, who had lost a
stirrup, was fortunately inaudible to the general assemblage.
</p>
<p>Round Two evoked audible evidence of friendly feeling towards
the dragon.  The spectators were not slow to appreciate a
combatant who could hold his own so well and clearly wanted to
show good sport, and many encouraging remarks reached the ears of
our friend as he strutted to and fro, his chest thrust out and
his tail in the air, hugely enjoying his new popularity.
</p>
<p>St. George had dismounted and was tightening his girths, and
telling his horse, with quite an Oriental flow of imagery,
exactly what he thought of him, and his relations, and his
conduct on the present occasion; so the Boy made his way down to
the Saint's end of the line, and held his spear for him.



<pb n="234"/>
</p>
<p>"It's been a jolly fight, St. George!" he said with a sigh.
"Can't you let it last a bit longer?"
</p>
<p>"Well, I think I'd better not," replied the Saint.  "The fact
is, your simple-minded old friend's getting conceited, now
they've begun cheering him, and he'll forget all about the
arrangement and take to playing the fool, and there's no telling
where he would stop.  I'll just finish him off this round."
</p>
<p>He swung himself into the saddle and took his spear from the
Boy.  "Now don't you be afraid," he added kindly.  "I've marked
my spot exactly, and <hi rend="italic">he's</hi> sure to
give me all the assistance in his power, because he knows it's
his only chance of being asked to the banquet!"
</p>
<p>St. George now shortened his spear, bringing the butt well up
under his arm; and, instead of galloping as before, trotted
smartly towards the dragon, who crouched



<pb n="235"/>
at his approach, flicking his tail till it cracked in the air
like a great cart-whip.  The Saint wheeled as he neared his
opponent and circled warily round him, keeping his eye on the spare
place; while the dragon, adopting similar tactics, paced with
caution round the same circle, occasionally feinting with his
head.  So the two sparred for an opening, while the spectators
maintained a breathless silence.
</p>
<p>Though the round lasted for some minutes, the end was so swift
that all the Boy saw was a lightning movement of the Saint's arm,
and then a whirl and a confusion of spines, claws, tail, and
flying bits of turf.  The dust cleared away, the spectators
whooped and ran in cheering, and the Boy made out that the dragon
was down, pinned to the earth by the spear, while St. George had
dismounted, and stood astride of him.
</p>
<p>It all seemed so genuine that the Boy



<pb n="236"/>
ran in breathlessly, hoping the dear old dragon wasn't really
hurt.  As he approached, the dragon lifted one large eyelid,
winked solemnly, and collapsed again.  He was held fast to earth
by the neck, but the Saint had hit him in the spare place agreed
upon, and it didn't even seem to tickle.
</p>
<p>"Bain't you goin' to cut 'is 'ed orf, master?" asked one of
the applauding crowd.  He had backed the dragon, and naturally
felt a trifle sore.
</p>
<p>"Well, not <hi rend="italic">to-day</hi>, I think,"
replied St. George, pleasantly.  "You see, that can be done at
<hi rend="italic">any</hi> time.  There's no hurry at all.
I think we'll all go down to the village first, and have some
refreshment, and then I'll give him a good talking-to, and you'll
find he'll be a very different dragon!"
</p>
<p>At that magic word <hi rend="italic">refreshment</hi>
the whole crowd formed up in procession



<pb n="237"/>
and silently awaited the signal to start.  The time for talking
and cheering and betting was past, the hour for action had
arrived.  St. George, hauling on his spear with both hands,
released the dragon, who rose and shook himself and ran his eye
over his spikes and scales and things, to see that they were all
in order.  Then the Saint mounted and led off the procession, the
dragon following meekly in the company of the Boy, while the
thirsty spectators kept at a respectful interval behind.
</p>
<p>There were great doings when they got down to the village
again, and had formed up in front of the inn.  After refreshment
St. George made a speech, in which he informed his audience that
he had removed their direful scourge, at a great deal of trouble
and inconvenience to him-self, and now they weren't to go about
grumbling and fancying they'd got grievances,


<pb n="238"/>
because they hadn't.  And they shouldn't be so fond of fights,
because next time they might have to do the fighting themselves,
which would not be the same thing at all.  And there was a
certain badger in the inn stables which had got to be released at
once, and he'd come and see it done himself.  Then he told them
that the dragon had been thinking over things, and saw that there
were two sides to every question, and he wasn't going to do it
any more, and if they were good perhaps he'd stay and settle down
there.  So they must make friends, and not be prejudiced and go
about fancying they knew everything there was to be known,
because they didn't, not by a long way.  And he warned them
against the sin of romancing, and making up stories and fancying
other people would believe them just because they were plausible
and highly-coloured.  Then he sat down,



<pb n="239"/>
amidst much repentant cheering, and the dragon nudged the Boy in
the ribs and whispered that he couldn't have done it better
himself.  Then every one went off to get ready for the banquet.
</p>
<p>Banquets are always pleasant things, consisting mostly, as
they do, of eating and drinking; but the specially nice thing
about a banquet is, that it comes when something's over, and
there's nothing more to worry about, and to-morrow seems a long
way off.  St George was happy because there had been a fight and
he hadn't had to kill anybody; for he didn't really like killing,
though he generally had to do it.  The dragon was happy because
there had been a fight, and so far from being hurt in it he had
won popularity and a sure footing in society.  The Boy was happy
because there had been a fight, and in spite of it all his two
friends were on the best of



<pb n="240"/>
terms.  And all the others were happy because there had been a
fight, and&mdash;well, they didn't require any other reasons for their
happiness.  The dragon exerted himself to say the right thing to
everybody, and proved the life and soul of the evening; while the
Saint and the Boy, as they looked on, felt that they were only
assisting at a feast of which the honour and the glory were
entirely the dragon's.  But they didn't mind that, being good
fellows, and the dragon was not in the least proud or forgetful.
On the contrary, every ten minutes or so he leant over towards
the Boy and said impressively:  "Look here! you
<hi rend="italic">will</hi> see me home afterwards, won't you?"
And the Boy always nodded, though he had promised his mother not
to be out late.
</p>
<p>At last the banquet was over, the guests had dropped away with
many good-nights and congratulations and invitations,



<pb n="241"/>
and the dragon, who had seen the last of them off the premises,
emerged into the street followed by the Boy, wiped his brow,
sighed, sat down in the road and gazed at the stars.  "Jolly
night it's been!" he murmured.  "Jolly stars!  Jolly little place
this!  Think I shall just stop here.  Don't feel like climbing up
any beastly hill.  Boy's promised to see me home.  Boy had better
do it then!  No responsibility on my part.  Responsibility all
Boy's!"  And his chin sank on his broad chest and he slumbered
peacefully.
</p>
<p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">get</hi> up, dragon," cried the
Boy, piteously.  "You <hi rend="italic">know</hi> my
mother's sitting up, and I'm so tired, and you made me promise to
see you home, and I never knew what it meant or I wouldn't have
done it!"  And the Boy sat down in the road by the side of the
sleeping dragon, and cried.
</p>
<p>The door behind them opened, a stream



<pb n="242"/>
of light illumined the road, and St. George, who had come out for
a stroll in the cool night-air, caught sight of the two figures
sitting there&mdash;the great motionless dragon and the tearful little
Boy.
</p>
<p>"What's the matter, Boy?" he inquired kindly, stepping to his
side.
</p>
<p>"Oh, it's this great lumbering <hi rend="italic">pig</hi>
of a dragon!" sobbed the Boy.  "First he makes me promise to see
him home, and then he says I'd better do it, and goes to sleep!
Might as well try to see a <hi rend="italic">haystack</hi>
home!  And I'm so tired, and mother's&mdash;" here he broke down
again.
</p>
<p>"Now don't take on," said St. George.  "I'll stand by you, and
we'll <hi rend="italic">both</hi> see him home.  Wake up,
dragon!" he said sharply, shaking the beast by the elbow.
</p>
<p>The dragon looked up sleepily.  "What a night, George!" he
murmured; "what a&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"Now look here, dragon," said the Saint,



<pb n="243"/>
firmly.  "Here's this little fellow waiting to see you home, and
you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> he ought to have been in bed
these two hours, and what his mother'll say
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't know, and anybody but a selfish pig
would have <hi rend="italic">made</hi> him go to bed long
ago&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"And he <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> go to bed!" cried
the dragon, starting up.  "Poor little chap, only fancy his being
up at this hour!  It's a shame, that's what it is, and I don't
think, St. George, you've been very considerate&mdash;but come along
at once, and don't let us have any more arguing or shilly-shallying.  You give me hold of your hand, Boy&mdash;thank you,
George, an arm up the hill is just what I wanted!"
</p>
<p>So they set off up the hill arm-in-arm, the Saint, the Dragon,
and the Boy.  The lights in the little village began to go out;
but there were stars, and a late moon, as they climbed to the
Downs together.  And, as they turned the last corner and
disappeared


<pb n="244"/>
from view, snatches of an old song were borne back on the night-breeze.  I can't be certain which of them was singing, but I
<hi rend="italic">think</hi> it was the Dragon!

</p>
<p>"Here we are at your gate," said the man, abruptly, laying his
hand on it.  "Good-night.  Cut along in sharp, or you'll catch
it!"
</p>
<p>Could it really be our own gate?  Yes, there it was, sure
enough, with the familiar marks on its bottom bar made by our
feet when we swung on it.
</p>
<p>"Oh, but wait a minute!" cried Charlotte.  "I want to know a
heap of things.  Did the dragon really settle down?  And did&mdash;"
</p>
<p>"There isn't any more of that story," said the man, kindly but
firmly.  "At least, not to-night.  Now be off!  Good-bye!"
</p>
<p>"Wonder if it's all true?" said Charlotte, as we hurried up
the path.  "Sounded dreadfully like nonsense, in parts!"



<pb n="245"/>
</p>
<p>"P'raps its true for all that," I replied encouragingly.
</p>
<p>Charlotte bolted in like a rabbit, out of the cold and the
dark; but I lingered a moment in the still, frosty air, for a
backward glance at the silent white world without, ere I changed
it for the land of firelight and cushions and laughter.  It was
the day for choir-practice, and carol-time was at hand, and a
belated member was passing homewards down the road, singing as he
went:&mdash;
</p>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>"Then St. George: ee made rev'rence: in the stable so dim,</l>
<l>Oo vanquished the dragon: so fearful and grim.</l>
<l>So-o grim: and so-o fierce: that now may we say</l>
<l>All peaceful is our wakin': on Chri-istmas Day!"</l>
</lg>

<p>The singer receded, the carol died away.  But I wondered, with
my hand on the door-latch, whether that was the song, or
something like it, that the dragon sang as he toddled contentedly
up the hill.

<head>A DEPARTURE</head>


<p>IT is a very fine thing to be a real Prince.  There are points
about a Pirate Chief, and to succeed to the Captaincy of a Robber
Band is a truly magnificent thing.  But to be an Heir has also
about it something extremely captivating.  Not only a long-lost
heir&mdash;an heir of the melodrama, strutting into your hitherto
unsuspected kingdom at just the right moment, loaded up with the
consciousness of unguessed merit and of rights so long
feloniously withheld&mdash;but even to be a common humdrum domestic
heir is a profession to which few would refuse to be apprenticed.
To step from leading-strings and restrictions and one glass of
port after dinner, into property and liberty and due
appreciation,



<pb n="250"/>
saved up, polished and varnished, dusted and laid in lavender,
all expressly for you&mdash;why, even the Princedom and the Robber
Captaincy, when their anxieties and responsibilities are
considered, have hardly more to offer.  And so it will continue
to be a problem, to the youth in whom ambition struggles with a
certain sensuous appreciation of life's side-dishes, whether the
career he is called upon to select out of the glittering knick-knacks that strew the counter had better be that of an heir or an
engine-driver.
</p>
<p>In the case of eldest sons, this problem has a way of solving
itself.  In childhood, however, the actual heirship is apt to
work on the principle of the "Borough-English" of our happier
ancestors, and in most cases of inheritance it is the youngest
that succeeds.  Where the "res" is "angusta," and the weekly
books are simply a series of stiff hurdles at each of which in
succession


<pb n="251"/>
the paternal legs falter with growing suspicion of their powers
to clear the flight, it is in the affair of
<hi rend="italic">clothes</hi> that the right of succession tells,
and "the hard heir strides about the land" in trousers long ago
framed for fraternal limbs&mdash;<hi rend="italic">frondes novas et
non sua poma</hi>.  A bitter thing indeed!  Of those pretty
silken threads that knit humanity together, high and low, past
and present, none is tougher, more pervading, or more iridescent,
than the honest, simple pleasure of new clothes.  It tugs at the
man as it tugs at the woman; the smirk of the well-fitted prince
is no different from the smirk of the Sunday-clad peasant; and
the veins of the elders tingle with the same thrill that sets
their fresh-frocked grandchildren skipping.  Never trust people
who pretend that they have no joy in their new clothes.
</p>
<p>Let not our souls be wrung, however, at contemplation of the
luckless urchin cut



<pb n="252"/>
off by parental penury from the rapture of new clothes.  Just as
the heroes of his dreams are his immediate seniors, so his
heroes' clothes share the glamour, and the reversion of them
carries a high privilege&mdash;a special thing not sold by Swears and
Wells.  The sword of Galahad&mdash;and of many another hero&mdash;arrived
on the scene already hoary with history, and the boy rather
prefers his trousers to be legendary, famous, haloed by his
hero's renown&mdash;even though the nap may have altogether vanished
in the process.
</p>
<p>But, putting clothes aside, there are other matters in which
this reversed heirship comes into play.  Take the case of Toys.
It is hardly right or fitting&mdash;and in this the child quite
acquiesces&mdash;that as he approaches the reverend period of nine or
say ten years, he should still be the unabashed and proclaimed
possessor of a hoop and a Noah's Ark.  The child



<pb n="253"/>
will quite see the reasonableness of this, and, the goal of his
ambition being now a catapult, a pistol, or even a sword-stick,
will be satisfied that the titular ownership should lapse to his
juniors, so far below him in their kilted or petticoated incompetence.
After all, the things are still there, and if relapses
of spirit occur, on wet afternoons, one can still (nominally)
borrow them and be happy on the floor as of old, without the
reproach of being a habitual baby toy-caresser.  Also one can
pretend it's being done to amuse the younger ones.
</p>
<p>None of us, therefore, grumbled when in the natural course of
things the nominal ownership of the toys slipped down to Harold,
and from him in turn devolved upon Charlotte.  The toys were
still there; they always had been there and always would be
there, and when the nursery door was fast shut there were no
Kings or



<pb n="254"/>
Queens or First Estates in that small Republic on the floor.
Charlotte, to be sure, chin-tilted, at last an owner of real
estate, might patronize a little at times; but it was tacitly
understood that her "title " was only a drawing-room one.
</p>
<p>Why does a coming bereavement project no thin faint voice, no
shadow of its woe, to warn its happy, heedless victims?  Why
cannot Olympians ever think it worth while to give some hint of
the thunderbolts they are silently forging?  And why, oh, why did
it never enter any of our thick heads that the day would come
when even Charlotte would be considered too matronly for toys?
One's so-called education is hammered into one with rulers and
with canes.  Each fresh grammar or musical instrument, each new
historical period or quaint arithmetical rule, is impressed on
one by some painful physical prelude.  Why does Time, the biggest
Schoolmaster,



<pb n="255"/>
alone neglect premonitory raps, at each stage of his curriculum,
on our knuckles or our heads?
</p>
<p>Uncle Thomas was at the bottom of it.  This was not the first
mine he had exploded under our bows.  In his favourite pursuit of
fads he had passed in turn from Psychical Research to the White
Rose and thence to a Children's Hospital, and we were being daily
inundated with leaflets headed by a woodcut depicting Little
Annie (of Poplar) sitting up in her little white cot, surrounded
by the toys of the nice, kind, rich children.  The idea caught on
with the Olympians, always open to sentiment of a treacly,
woodcut order; and accordingly Charlotte, on entering one day
dishevelled and panting, having been pursued by yelling Redskins
up to the very threshold of our peaceful home, was curtly
informed that her French lessons would begin on Monday, that she
was



<pb n="256"/>
henceforth to cease all pretence of being a trapper or a Redskin
on utterly inadequate grounds, and moreover that the whole of her
toys were at that moment being finally packed up in a box, for
despatch to London, to gladden the lives and bring light into the
eyes of London waifs and Poplar Annies.
</p>
<p>Naturally enough, perhaps, we others received no official
intimation of this grave cession of territory.  We were not
supposed to be interested.  Harold had long ago been promoted to a
knife&mdash;a recognized, birthday knife.  As for me, it was known
that I was already given over, heart and soul, to lawless
abandoned catapults&mdash;catapults which were confiscated weekly for
reasons of international complications, but with which Edward
kept me steadily supplied, his school having a fine old tradition
for excellence in their manufacture.  Therefore no one was
supposed to be



<pb n="257"/>
really affected but Charlotte, and even she had already reached
Miss Yonge, and should therefore have been more interested in
prolific curates and harrowing deathbeds.
</p>
<p>Nothwithstanding, we all felt indignant, betrayed, and sullen
to the verge of mutiny.  Though for long we had affected to despise
them, these toys, yet they had grown up with us, shared our
joys and our sorrows, seen us at our worst, and become part of
the accepted scheme of existence.  As we gazed at untenanted
shelves and empty, hatefully tidy corners, perhaps for the first
time for long we began to do them a tardy justice.
</p>
<p>There was old Leotard, for instance.  Somehow he had come to
be sadly neglected of late years&mdash;and yet how exactly he always
responded to certain moods!  He was an acrobat, this Leotard, who
lived in a glass-fronted box.  His loose



<pb n="258"/>
jointed limbs were cardboard, cardboard his slender trunk; and
his hands eternally grasped the bar of a trapeze.  You turned the
box round swiftly five or six times; the wonderful unsolved
machinery worked, and Leotard swung and leapt, backwards,
forwards, now astride the bar, now flying free; iron-jointed,
supple-sinewed, unceasingly novel in his invention of new,
unguessable attitudes; while above, below, and around him, a
richly-dressed audience, painted in skilful perspective of
stalls, boxes, dress-circle, and gallery, watched the thrilling
performance with a stolidity which seemed to mark them out as
made in Germany.  Hardly versatile enough, perhaps, this Leotard;
unsympathetic, not a companion for all hours; nor would you have
chosen him to take to bed with you.  And yet, within his own
limits, how fresh, how engrossing, how resourceful and inventive!
Well, he was gone, it seemed&mdash;



<pb n="259"/>
merely gone.  Never specially cherished while he tarried with us,
he had yet contrived to build himself a particular niche of his
own.  Sunrise and sunset, and the dinner-bell, and the sudden
rainbow, and lessons, and Leotard, and the moon through the
nursery windows&mdash;they were all part of the great order of things,
and the displacement of any one item seemed to disorganize the
whole machinery.  The immediate point was, not that the world
would continue to go round as of old, but that Leotard wouldn't.
</p>
<p>Yonder corner, now swept and garnished, had been the stall
wherein the spotty horse, at the close of each laborious day, was
accustomed to doze peacefully the long night through.  In days of
old each of us in turn had been jerked thrillingly round the room
on his precarious back, had dug our heels into his unyielding
sides, and had scratched our hands on the



<pb n="260"/>
tin tacks that secured his mane to his stiffly-curving neck.
Later, with increasing stature, we came to overlook his merits as
a beast of burden; but how frankly, how good-naturedly, he had
recognized the new conditions, and adapted himself to them without
a murmur!  When the military spirit was abroad, who so ready
to be a squadron of cavalry, a horde of Cossacks, or artillery
pounding into position?  He had even served with honour as a gun-boat, during a period when naval strategy was the only theme; and
no false equine pride ever hindered him from taking the part of a
roaring locomotive, earth-shaking, clangorous, annihilating time
and space.  Really it was no longer clear how life, with its
manifold emergencies, was to be carried on at all without a
fellow like the spotty horse, ready to step in at critical
moments and take up just the part required of him.
</p>
<p>In moments of mental depression, nothing



<pb n="261"/>
is quite so consoling as the honest smell of a painted animal;
and mechanically I turned towards the shelf that had been so long
the Ararat of our weather-beaten Ark.  The shelf was empty, the
Ark had cast off moorings and sailed away to Poplar, and had
taken with it its haunting smell, as well as that pleasant sense
of disorder that the best conducted Ark is always able to impart.
The sliding roof had rarely been known to close entirely.  There
was always a pair of giraffe-legs sticking out, or an elephant-trunk, taking from the stiffness of its outline, and reminding us
that our motley crowd of friends inside were uncomfortably
cramped for room and only too ready to leap in a cascade on the
floor and browse and gallop, flutter and bellow and neigh, and be
their natural selves again.  I think that none of us ever really
thought very much of Ham and Shem and Japhet.  They were only
there



<pb n="262"/>
because they were in the story, but nobody really wanted them.
The Ark was built for the animals, of course&mdash;animals with tails,
and trunks, and horns, and at least three legs apiece, though
some unfortunates had been unable to retain even that number.
And in the animals were of course included the birds&mdash;the dove,
for instance, grey with black wings, and the red-crested
woodpecker&mdash;or was it a hoo-poe?&mdash;and the insects, for there was
a dear beetle, about the same size as the dove, that held its own
with any of the mammalia.
</p>
<p>Of the doll-department Charlotte had naturally been sole chief
for a long time; if the staff were not in their places to-day, it
was not I who had any official right to take notice.  And yet one
may have been member of a Club for many a year without ever
exactly understanding the use and object of the other members,
until one



<pb n="263"/>
enters, some Christmas day or other holiday, and, surveying the
deserted armchairs, the untenanted sofas, the barren hat-pegs,
realizes, with depression, that those other fellows had their
allotted functions, after all.  Where was old Jerry?  Where were
Eugenie, Rosa, Sophy, Esmeralda?  We had long drifted apart, it
was true, we spoke but rarely; perhaps, absorbed in new
ambitions, new achievements, I had even come to look down on
these conservative, unprogressive members who were so clearly
content to remain simply what they were.  And now that their
corners were unfilled, their chairs unoccupied&mdash;well, my eyes
were opened and I wanted 'em back!
</p>
<p>However, it was no business of mine.  If grievances were the
question, I hadn't a leg to stand upon.  Though my catapults were
officially confiscated, I knew the drawer in which they were
incarcerated,


<pb n="264"/>
and where the key of it was hidden, and I could make life a
burden, if I chose, to every living thing within a square-mile
radius, so long as the catapult was restored to its drawer in due
and decent time.  But I wondered how the others were taking it.
The edict hit them more severely.  They should have my moral
countenance at any rate, if not more, in any protest or
countermine they might be planning.  And, indeed, something
seemed possible, from the dogged, sullen air with which the two
of them had trotted off in the direction of the raspberry-canes.
Certain spots always had their insensible attraction for certain
moods.  In love, one sought the orchard.  Weary of discipline,
sick of convention, impassioned for the road, the mining camp,
the land across the border, one made for the big meadow.
Mutinous, sulky, charged with plots and conspiracies,


<pb n="265"/>
one always got behind the shelter of the raspberry-canes.

<lb/>.   .   .   .   .   .   . <lb/>
</p>
<p>"You can come too if you like," said Harold, in a subdued sort
of way, as soon as he was aware that I was sitting up in bed
watching him.  "We didn't think you'd care, 'cos you've got to
catapults.  But we're goin' to do what we've settled to do, so
it's no good sayin' we hadn't ought and that sort of thing, 'cos
we're goin' to!"
</p>
<p>The day had passed in an ominous peacefulness.  Charlotte and
Harold had kept out of my way, as well as out of everybody
else's, in a purposeful manner that ought to have bred suspicion.
In the evening we had read books, or fitfully drawn ships and
battles on fly-leaves, apart, in separate corners, void of
conversation or criticism, oppressed by the lowering tidiness of
the universe, till bedtime



<pb n="266"/>
came, and disrobement, and prayers even more mechanical than
usual, and lastly bed itself without so much as a giraffe under
the pillow.  Harold had grunted himself between the sheets with
an ostentatious pretence of overpowering fatigue; but I noticed
that he pulled his pillow forward and propped his head against
the brass bars of his crib, and, as I was acquainted with most of
his tricks and subterfuges, it was easy for me to gather that a
painful wakefulness was his aim that night.
</p>
<p>I had dozed off, however, and Harold was out and on his feet,
poking under the bed for his shoes, when I sat up and grimly
regarded him.  Just as he said I could come if I liked, Charlotte
slipped in, her face rigid and set.  And then it was borne in
upon me that I was not on in this scene.  These youngsters had
planned it all out, the piece was their own,



<pb n="267"/>
and the mounting, and the cast.  My sceptre had fallen, my rule
had ceased.  In this magic hour of the summer night laws went for
nothing, codes were cancelled, and those who were most in touch
with the moonlight and the warm June spirit and the topsy-turvydom that reigns when the clock strikes ten, were the true
lords and lawmakers.
</p>
<p>Humbly, almost timidly, I followed without a protest in the
wake of these two remorseless, purposeful young persons, who were
marching straight for the schoolroom.  Here in the moonlight the
grim big box stood visible&mdash;the box in which so large a portion
of our past and our personality lay entombed, cold, swathed in
paper, awaiting the carrier of the morning who should speed them
forth to the strange, cold, distant Children's Hospital, where
their little failings would all be misunderstood and no one would


<pb n="268"/>
make allowances.  A dreamy spectator, I stood idly by while
Harold propped up the lid and the two plunged in their arms and
probed and felt and grappled.
</p>
<p>"Here's Rosa," said Harold, suddenly.  "I know the feel of her
hair.  Will you have Rosa out?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, give me Rosa!" cried Charlotte with a sort of gasp.  And
when Rosa had been dragged forth, quite unmoved apparently,
placid as ever in her moonfaced contemplation of this comedy-world with its ups and downs, Charlotte retired with her to the
window-seat, and there in the moonlight the two exchanged their
private confidences, leaving Harold to his exploration alone.
</p>
<p>"Here's something with sharp corners," said Harold, presently.
"Must be Leotard, I think.  Better let
<hi rend="italic">him</hi> go."
</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, we can't save Leotard," assented Charlotte, limply.



<pb n="269"/>
</p>
<p>Poor old Leotard!  I said nothing, of course; I was not on in
this piece.  But, surely, had Leotard heard and rightly
understood all that was going on above him, he must have sent up
one feeble, strangled cry, one faint appeal to be rescued from
unfamiliar little Annies and retained for an audience certain to
appreciate and never unduly critical.
</p>
<p>"Now I've got to the Noah's Ark," panted Harold, still groping
blindly.
</p>
<p>"Try and shove the lid back a bit," said Charlotte, "and pull
out a dove or a zebra or a giraffe if there's one handy."
</p>
<p>Harold toiled on with grunts and contortions, and presently
produced in triumph a small grey elephant and a large beetle with
a red stomach.
</p>
<p>"They're jammed in too tight," he complained.  "Can't get any
more out.  But as I came up I'm sure I felt Potiphar!"  And down
he dived again.
</p>

<pb n="270"/>

<p>Potiphar was a finely modelled bull with a
<hi rend="italic">suede</hi>  "skin, rough and comfortable and
warm in bed.  He was my own special joy and pride, and I thrilled
with honest emotion when Potiphar emerged to light once more,
stout-necked and stalwart as ever.
</p>
<p>"That'll have to do," said Charlotte, getting up.  "We dursn't
take any more, 'cos we'll be found out if we do.  Make the box
all right, and bring 'em along."
</p>
<p>Harold rammed down the wads of paper and twists of straw he
had disturbed, replaced the lid squarely and innocently, and
picked up his small salvage; and we sneaked off for the window
most generally in use for prison-breakings and nocturnal
escapades.  A few seconds later and we were hurrying silently in
single file along the dark edge of the lawn.
</p>
<p>Oh, the riot, the clamour, the crowding chorus, of all silent
things that spoke by scent and colour and budding thrust and



<pb n="271"/>
foison, that moonlit night of June!  Under the laurel-shade all
was still ghostly enough, brigand-haunted, crackling, whispering
of night and all its possibilities of terror.  But the open
garden, when once we were in it&mdash;how it turned a glad new face to
welcome us, glad as of old when the sunlight raked and searched
it, new with the unfamiliar night-aspect that yet welcomed us as
guests to a hall where the horns blew up to a new, strange
banquet!  Was this the same grass, could these be the same familiar
flower-beds, alleys, clumps of verdure, patches of sward?  At
least this full white light that was flooding them was new, and
accounted for all.  It was Moonlight Land, and Past-Ten-o'clock
Land, and we were in it and of it, and all its other denizens
fully understood, and, tongue-free and awakened at last,
responded and comprehended and knew.  The other two, doubtless,
hurrying forward full of their mission, noted



<pb n="272"/>
little of all this.  I, who was only a super, had leisure to take
it all in, and, though the language and the message of the land
were not all clear to me then, long afterwards I remembered and
understood.
</p>
<p>Under the farthest hedge, at the loose end of things, where
the outer world began with the paddock, there was darkness once
again&mdash;not the blackness that crouched so solidly under the
crowding laurels, but a duskiness hung from far-spread arms of
high-standing elms.  There, where the small grave made a darker
spot on the grey, I overtook them, only just in time to see Rosa
laid stiffly out, her cherry cheeks pale in the moonlight, but
her brave smile triumphant and undaunted as ever.  It was a tiny
grave and a shallow one, to hold so very much.  Rosa once in,
Potiphar, who had hitherto stood erect, stout-necked, through so
many days and such various weather, must needs bow



<pb n="273"/>
his head and lie down meekly on his side.  The elephant and the
beetle, equal now in a silent land where a vertebra and a red
circulation counted for nothing, had to snuggle down where best
they might, only a little less crowded than in their native Ark.
</p>
<p>The earth was shovelled in and stamped down, and I was glad
that no orisons were said and no speechifying took place.  The
whole thing was natural and right and self-explanatory, and
needed no justifying or interpreting to our audience of stars and
flowers.  The connexion was not entirely broken now&mdash;one link
remained between us and them.  The Noah's Ark, with its cargo of
sad-faced emigrants, might be hull down on the horizon, but two
of its passengers had missed the boat and would henceforth be
always near us; and, as we played above them, an elephant would
understand, and a beetle



<pb n="274"/>
would hear, and crawl again in spirit along a familiar floor.
Henceforth the spotty horse would scour along far-distant plains
and know the homesickness of alien stables; but Potiphar, though
never again would he paw the arena when bull-fights were on the
bill, was spared maltreatment by town-bred strangers, quite
capable of mistaking him for a cow.  Jerry and Esmeralda might
shed their limbs and their stuffing, by slow or swift degrees, in
uttermost parts and unguessed corners of the globe; but Rosa's
book was finally closed, and no worse fate awaited her than
natural dissolution almost within touch and hail of familiar
faces and objects that had been friendly to her since first she
opened her eyes on a world where she had never been treated as a
stranger.
</p>
<p>As we turned to go, the man in the moon, tangled in elm-boughs, caught my eye for a moment, and I thought that never had



<pb n="275"/>
he looked so friendly.  He was going to see after them, it was
evident; for he was always there, more or less, and it was no
trouble to him at all, and he would tell them how things were
still going, up here, and throw in a story or two of his own
whenever they seemed a trifle dull.  It made the going away
rather easier, to know one had left somebody behind on the spot;
a good fellow, too, cheery, comforting, with a fund of anecdote;
a man in whom one had every confidence.
