<head>THE APPLES OF HESPERIDES, KANSAS
<lb/><lb/>JOHN OSKISON</head>

<p>A COOL, racing wind brought to their ears the sound of the
locomotive's whistle.  It came to them across ten miles of level
prairie, a thin, faint blast.  It was the supper call to the graders and
track-layers who were pushing the newest railroad across the short
grass country of southwestern Kansas.  Darkness was closing down
over the wide plain.

</p><p>Mrs. Marvin met her son at the gate of the feed-lot, held it
open as he rode in, and followed him to the door of the tiny stable.
Dick dismounted, hauled the saddle from his horse, rubbed the
sweat marks from its back, and turned it loose to roll luxuriously in
the dust.

</p><p>"Well, mother," the young man smiled and put his arm across
her shoulders, "I found out there's plenty of water left for the cattle
in Plum Creek.  There's one hole I don't think'll ever go dry."

</p><p>"Whereabouts is it, Dick?"

</p><p>"Just where the railroad's going to cross&mdash;I reckon maybe
they're aiming to put in a water tank there."  Dick went to feed his
horse, and Mrs. Marvin returned to the cabin to fix the supper table.

</p><p>Five years before, when the boy was a hollow-chested youth of
eighteen, they had come from Chicago to the high plains&mdash;Richard's
doctor had sent them.  In that time, the flush had died out of the
young man's cheeks and he had padded with solid flesh a
consumptive's gaunt frame.

</p><p>"Dick is getting well, praise the Lord!"  It was Mrs. Marvin's
daily prayer of thankfulness.  Three years ago, she had first uttered
it, exultantly&mdash;and then she had planned to go back to Chicago.  But
now the plan was vague, easy for her to put aside.  The spell of the
wide plain was upon her; she had become a pioneer mother.  Dick's
little herd of cattle and her own uncertain patch of garden had
become important enterprises.
</p>

<pb n="392"/>

<p>But as she grew more contented, Dick complained oftener of
monotony.  "No!" he denied, when his mother asked him if it was
Chicago he pined for.  "It ain't a city I want&mdash;maybe it's just people
and stir.  I'd like to know myself what makes me restless."  It was
manhood crowding youth in the lusty frame of twenty-three; Mrs.
Marvin could have told Dick that, but it would have seemed vague
to him.

</p><p>Beside a window which let in the soft after-sunset light&mdash;a
window which rattled all day under the assault of the steady wind&mdash;
the two ate their supper.  For a time, the wind died, and the peace of
the prairies fell upon them.

</p><p>From a tin pie-plate, Dick lifted a quarter of a fresh-baked pie
made of dried apples.  He held it in his two hands and measured
with his eyes on the crisp, firm crust the boundaries of his first bite.

</p><p>"Dick, won't you ever learn to eat pie like a white man?"

</p><p>"Gee, mother, I never could insult one of your pies by
introducing it to a little old three-tined fork!"  They both laughed,
and Dick's strong teeth closed upon the pie.  He finished the quarter,
and hesitated.

</p><p>"One more piece, Dick!"

</p><p>"Oh, sho!  I'll see my grandmother if I do&mdash;I'll be dodging
apples all night long.  Say, mother, isn't this the time of year when
they're picking them back yonder?  Seems to me about now you can
get 'em fresh and juicy from the stands in Chicago."

</p><p>"October&mdash;yes.  In New York State, they're lying in windrows
between the trees."

</p><p>"Smooth and juicy, eh, mother?"

</p><p>"Yes&mdash;red and yellow, and you can smell 'em half a mile
away!"

</p><p>"And they feed 'em to the pigs, sometimes, don't they,
mother?"

</p><p>"They used to, when I was a girl&mdash;people didn't seem to care
very much for apples."

</p><p>"Gee!"  Dick rose and went outside, whistling an unquiet little
tune.  Mrs. Marvin cleared away the dishes, washed them, and, with
a shawl across her shoulders, came out to join

<pb n="393"/>

her son on the tiny south porch.
A young moon was making luminous the
west, and far away somewhere in its track a coyote barked.  Dick
smoked, and his mother sat very quietly with her hands folded in
her lap.

</p><p>"How's the grub holding out, mother?" Dick asked after a time.

</p><p>"We're all right for ten days."

</p><p>"Bacon, flour, rice, potatoes, sugar, coffee&mdash;and dried fruit?"

</p><p>"Yes&mdash;oh, Dick, why did you bring it into my mind again!
Seems to me I just <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have a fresh apple to eat."

</p><p>"Now that you mention it, mother, it sure does sound good.
Say, I wonder if a fellow couldn't get some over at the railroad?"

</p><p>"Can you get away, Dick?  I believe I'd rather have a bushel of
good juicy apples right now than anything else I can think of."

</p><p>"I'll ride over to-morrow, mother . . .  Come inside now, it's
getting cold out here."  The wind had risen again to a steady blast.

</p><p>"Isn't it lovely, Dick!"  Before she went in, Mrs. Marvin stood
at the edge of the narrow porch to let the starshine and the faint
moonlight beat upon her face.

</p><p>"I wish there were trees out there," Dick answered irrelevantly.

</p><p>Next day, Dick Marvin rode to the railroad, a grain bag tied
around his saddle horn.  He rode past the construction camp, and
stopped for a time to watch men with stout plows farrow the raw
prairie; he joked with other men who, with wheeled scrapers, were
piling the dirt in ridges, and shouted greetings to the track-layers
who were putting down on the packed earth-ridge black, creosoted
cross-ties and spiking new rails; he
rode close to the dingy work-train, where the
locomotive's stack was sending up lazy puffs of
smoke, and a thin blue ribbon from the cook car's stovepipe rose
into the clear air.  Whistling cheerfully, Dick rode on.  A mile
beyond the end of the line, the newest town rose out of the prairie&mdash;a
switch, a station shack, a group of tents where the construction gang
slept,

<pb n="394"/>

and a combined store and eating-house.  This last
was the biggest thing in town, its dashboard front standing up
fifteen feet from the road and spreading twelve feet on either side of
the wide doorway.  Across the top of this fa&ccedil;ade was painted
the sign:

<lb/><lb/>"MARLOW'S GENERAL STORE AND GEM RESTAURANT."
<lb/><lb/>

Behind it stretched sixty feet of barn-like interior.  Sagging and
unpainted board shelves stretched down both sides for forty feet,
then gave way, on one side, to a lunch counter.  Back from the
counter were two tables, each seating ten.  The kitchen was a
corner, boarded off from the big room by partitions which reached
for but never quite attained the ceiling.  Marbled oil-cloth covered
the lunch counter, but on the two tables were
fringed and red-and-white checkered cloths, with a glass
jar of wooden toothpicks
occupying the mathematical centre of each.

</p><p>It was mid-morning when Dick Marvin dropped the reins of
his horse's bridle in front of Marlow's and went inside.

</p><p>A girl&mdash;buxom, yellow-haired, blue-eyed&mdash;had watched him
from her post inside one of the big windows.  She was Marlow's
assistant, from Kansas City; he had brought her from a department
store where she had grown weary of using her eyes on the pale
young hunters of the streets.  She was twenty-six, ripe and
sophisticated; and she had no doubt whatever of her motive for
coming.  It was certainly not for the ten dollars a week which
Marlow offered&mdash;and might be able to pay.  For the first time, in the
two weeks she had watched by Marlow's front window, she thrilled
at the sight of a man riding; Dick sat his horse with joyous grace.
She smoothed her skirt over her hips, put her hands up to be sure of
the fluff in her hair, and turned to the shelves.

</p><p>"Howdy!" greeted Dick.  She turned suddenly from the work at
which her fingers had been busy.  Plainly, she was startled&mdash;in the
planned moment of recovery, she could size him up at close range.

</p><p>"He'll more than do!" was her verdict.  She saw a strong,
young, brown face, white, even teeth, and a powerful body which
was carried with elastic ease.
</p>

<pb n="395"/>

<p>"You ought to knock on a lady's door before you come in!"

</p><p>"I'm after apples," announced Dick; her blonde beauty struck
upon him with a pleasant shock.

</p><p>"Pippins, or jest plain Ben Davises?"  The girl laughed,
showing her own strong, white teeth.  She lifted her eyes to Dick's,
and the rounded, creamy-white throat rising above a plain, collarless
waist struck on his senses like a blow in the face from a man's hand.
In the past five years, he had forgotten the girl's type.  The women
of the ranches were high-collared, long-sleeved, and self-effacing.

</p><p>"Oh!"  Dick recovered, "I'm open to argument.  Which kind do
you recommend?"

</p><p>"Honest, stranger," she answered demurely, "there ain't an
apple in town."

</p><p>"Gee!  I haven't tasted a fresh apple for so long I expect I
wouldn't know how to bite into one."  They both laughed.

</p><p>"Marlow went in to Delos yesterday, and he's
coming back to-day&mdash;maybe he'll have sense enough to bring back some apples."

</p><p>"When does the train from Delos get in?"

</p><p>"It ain't got any schedule&mdash;'most any time from one to five."

</p><p>"You reckon if I rode on to Cyprus I could get any?"

</p><p>"I'm sure I don't know."  She turned her back and raised her
half-bared arms to the shelves again.  They were
round and creamy-white, dimpled at the elbows.

</p><p>"How far do you call it to Cyprus?"  She finished her task of
putting a row of canned goods in perfect alignment before she
turned and answered:

</p><p>"About half as far as it is to Athens.  Would you like to ask me
anything else?"

</p><p>"Yes&mdash;two more questions.  Where's that smile of yours gone?
and who names the towns on this road?"

</p><p>Question one was answered instantly, in a flood of color which
rose to the girl's cheeks and a burst of laughter a little too loud.

</p><p>"I sh'd say they've hired the man that names the Pullman cars."
Dick moved aside a plug tobacco slicer to make room

<pb n="396"/>

for himself on the rough board counter.  Seated comfortably, he went
on:

</p><p>"Now, take this town.  Who in the world ever thought
Hesperides was the proper name for it?"  Dick accented the first
syllable of the name, and divided it after the r.

</p><p>"Well, why not, Mr. Man?"

</p><p>"My name is Marvin&mdash;Richard Marvin, or Dick generally&mdash;if
you ever want to use it."

</p><p>"Thanks; I might.  I'm Clara Cullom."

</p><p>"What's the name of that town the other side of Athens?"

</p><p>"Geronimo.  Marlow told me it was named by an old Indian
trader."

</p><p>"Some sense in that name.  But Hesperides&mdash;"  Dick laughed.

</p><p>"Most people call it Hesper and let it go at that."

</p><p>Until twelve o'clock, Dick Marvin kept his seat on the counter.
Three horsemen, and one rancher with his wife, in a rattling wagon,
came to buy&mdash;staples for nailing up wire fences, canned goods,
flour, blue overalls, dried peaches, sugar, bananas, cheese, crackers,
molasses, and striped stick candy.  Clara Cullom served them
swiftly, courteously, with never a softening of the serene contour of
her face.  It was her acknowledgment to Dick Marvin that to-day
was his.  And to-morrow?  The blood was racing through his veins,
scattering his self-control as the wind outside
drove the tumble-weed pell-mell across the plain.

</p><p>At twelve a negro woman came out of the partitioned kitchen
to ring a big hand-bell.  From the steps of a side door, she shook the
bell violently, then hurried back.  In five minutes, one table was
surrounded by hungry men; at the other, the ranchman and his wife
were eating fried chicken and conversing stiffly with the station
agent.  A negro man, some half-grown boys, and a grader from the
construction camp occupied the stools before the lunch counter.

</p><p>Dick was about to slide from his seat on the counter and go to
join the three at the table, when he felt the girl's hand on his arm.
She leaned close and said:

</p><p>"They'll all be finished eatin' and gone in half an hour, and
then I'll have <hi rend="italic">my</hi> dinner."  Dick rose.

</p>
<pb n="397"/>

<p>
"I reckon I'll go out and see if I can't rustle some feed for my
horse&mdash;be sure you save some of that fried chicken for me."

</p><p>"Mammy Thomas'll look after <hi rend="italic">us</hi> all right, Mr. Marvin.
Half an hour&mdash;don't be any longer."  Dazzling, and utterly
confidential was the smile which ushered him out.  To kill time,
Dick rode to the construction camp, where the hungry crew sat in
irregular groups about the cook car, and where the mules, released
for an hour from the work of dragging the loaded scrapers up hill
and outracing them as they came clattering down, empty, jerked
feed-bags from side to side in rhythm with their round, well-sheared
tails.  Every mouth, of mules and men, was busy with food.  A
great, out-of-doors hunger was being satisfied.  With a boiled
potato, peeled and buttered, poised on his fork, the foreman invited
Dick to dismount and eat.

</p><p>"Git you a plate from the cook car and go to it, friend."

</p><p>"It looks good, all right, but I got a date to eat up at the store at
half past twelve," Dick refused.  "You boys are sure pushing things
along out here."

</p><p>"Uh-huh," agreed the foreman thickly, as he swallowed the
potato, "our boss gits paid by the mile."

</p><p>"Are you aiming to put in a water tank at Plum Creek?"

</p><p>"Well, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> ain't aimin' to do the work, but I guess a tank
will go up there just the same.  I did hear some talk, though, about
puttin' in a pumpin' plant at the creek an' forcin' the water back to
Hesper'&mdash;that would save a stop, you see."  The foreman took up a
quarter of an apple pie and stopped the conversation.  His mother's
affectionate protest, "Will you never learn to eat pie like a white
man!" came to Dick's mind as he watched the foreman shove the pie
into his face until his thumbs and forefingers struck his teeth.
"Well, so long!"  He turned his horse and galloped back to
Marlow's.

</p><p>Mammy Thomas spread a fresh white tablecloth for the two;
the fried chicken she served them was sizzling hot; the round, light
biscuits were fresh from the oven; the baked potatoes broke mealy
and turned to delicate gold at the touch of the fresh butter; fresh and
fragrant was the coffee.  After the chicken, an omelet&mdash;light as sea
foam and deliciously flavored.

<pb n="398"/>

And with the second cup of coffee came the apple pie.  Dick
broke out enthusiastically at sight of it:

</p><p>"Excuse me, Miss Cullom, but I simply can't&mdash;"  An instinct
made him stop, and, instead of repeating the familiar tribute
beloved of his mother, he finished inadequately, "I sure can't help
admiring such a cook as you've got here."  He ate the pie with the
help of the conventional fork, patiently.  Clara Cullom ate joyously,
with the appreciative discrimination of the clear-skinned, eupeptic
human animal.

</p><p>"I wish <hi rend="italic">I</hi> could cook like Mammy," she said.  "If you
got a good appetite and ain't afraid of gettin' fat, I don't know many
things that gives you more pleasure than eating.  But I've et some
fierce meals in my time.  Never again, though, if I can help it; and if
I was a good cook I'd come pretty close to guaranteeing good eating
the rest of the way."

</p><p>The first effect of this confession on Dick Marvin was
depressing, but after pondering it a minute he laughed and recalled
the ironical old rhyme:
</p>

<lg type="stanza">
<l rend="indent">"Sugar and spice</l>
<l rend="indent">And all that's nice&mdash;</l>
<l rend="indent">That's what little girls are made of."</l>
</lg>

<p>"This one is, anyway," he reflected, smiling.  Firm flesh, built
of solid food, exercise and sound sleep&mdash;that's what this blonde girl
was made of.  It was a new thought to Dick, and one which held
allurement.  He could picture her meeting the physical strains which
men habitually endure&mdash;the all-day rides on a round-up, the
unbroken twenty-four hour labors of wrecking crews repairing a
wash-out&mdash;and recovering normally after a good meal and twelve
hours of sleep.  The blood in her full lips and under the skin of her
rounded cheeks ran rich and red.

</p><p>Mammy Thomas, with many an "Excuse me, Honey,"
mumbled into the ears of both, cleared the table, put back the white
and red checkered cloth, moved the jar of toothpicks conveniently
near, and returned to the kitchen.

</p><p>"Have a toothpick!"  They both spoke at once, and their hands
moved toward the jar at the same time.  Neither hand

<pb n="399"/>

reached its destination; instead, with a swift, eager clutch, the firm
white hand met the brown.  After what seemed a lifetime of
exquisite thrill, Dick heard the girl saying, a bit shakily, "A
toothbrush suits me better."  White hand and brown clung joyously
&mdash;the girl spoke again.

</p><p>"Don't tell me, Dick, you keep your teeth clean with chewin'
tobacco!"  He shook his head.  "Seems to me," she went on, "every
unmarried man in this county buys chewin' tobacco just for that
purpose."

</p><p>For a long time the two sat, their hands locked across the
corner of the table.  From talk, they dropped to whispers, and then
to that most eloquent language of new lovers&mdash;the straight eye to eye
messages which none of us have ever learned to put into words.  In
the boarded-off kitchen, Mammy's dish-washing clatter died out,
and the insistent g-r-r-r! of the coffee-grinding machine began.
Mammy Thomas, at any rate, knew that time was passing and that
supper would have to be prepared and served.

</p><p>Up from the construction camp, the work train came backing.
At the station, it stopped, and the conductor walked hurriedly across
to the store.  The girl saw him before he entered, and, with a last
pressure of Dick's hand and a swift brushing of his hair with her
lips, went forward to wait upon him.

</p><p>"Howdy, Miss Cullom," the conductor greeted her, then
exclaimed, "My soul; you're lookin' fine!"

</p><p>"It's because I'm happy&mdash;my grandfather's just died and left me
a farm."  He laughed.

</p><p>"Gimme somethin' good to eat&mdash;we got to pull right out to
Delos without waitin' fer supper."

</p><p>"Taking the work train in?"

</p><p>"No, only the engine and caboose&mdash;Joe and Henry are cuttin'
off now on the switch."

</p><p>"I got a notion to ride in with you," she offered, and glanced
back toward Dick, who was still sitting at the table.

</p><p>"Sure!  Why not," urged the conductor.  "Don't <hi rend="italic">he</hi> want
to go to Delos for anythin'?"  The conductor grinned and jerked his
thumb toward Dick.
</p>
<pb n="400"/>

<p>"Yes; he wants some fresh apples."  The girl laughed her full,
rich laugh.

</p><p>"Well, we'll be startin' in ten minutes&mdash;I'll be back for that
canned stuff."  As he went out, Dick came up to the front of the
store, vaulted the counter, and put his hands on the girl's shoulders.
There rose in her cheeks a crimson tide, and over her blue eyes
dropped a misty veil of desire.

</p><p>"Oh, Dick!" she breathed, standing quietly.

</p><p>"Didn't that man say he was pulling out for Delos in ten
minutes?" he demanded.

</p><p>"Yes," her eyes dropped.  "Dick, what do you mean?"

</p><p>"Will he take <hi rend="italic">us?"</hi>  The question was whispered
fiercely.

</p><p>"Oh, what are you saying!  Why, I don't know you, don't&mdash;"

</p><p>"Good God! you know enough, girl&mdash;I want you!"  He shook
her savagely, and she put her hands timidly up to his face.  "We're
going on that train&mdash;do you want to take anything, pack anything?"

</p><p>"No&mdash;yes, I must get a hat, and&mdash;but, Dick, what do you mean?"

</p><p>"Mean?  I can't mean more than one thing.  You're going to
marry me as soon after we get to Delos as we can rout a preacher
out of bed.  Now, you get what you need, and we'll hike for that
caboose... Oh, girl!" his young boy's voice softened, "this is
love&mdash;you have put a big fire into me, the kind I thought
I'd never feel... When do you reckon we get to Delos?"

</p><p>"I don't know, Dick," the girl answered quietly, and slid her
hands under Dick's coat-collar and about his neck.  She drew him
close and kissed his sun-browned cheek.

</p><p>"Dick, you're my kind,&mdash;big brown lover!"  She whispered it
fiercely.

</p><p>Coming back for the food, the conductor gave ample warning
with his loud whistling; he was met by a rebuke:

</p><p>"Scotty, you didn't tell me what you wanted&mdash;now, you just
collect whatever it is off the shelves, while I go pack a valise.  I'm
going with you; and, oh! this is Mr. Marvin; Mr. Marvin, shake
hands with Mr. Scott.  Say, Scotty, Mr. Marvin says

<pb n="401"/>

he's going to Delos, too, so you pick out enough for all of us."  She went
back to see Mammy Thomas, and as she came out of the kitchen the
negro woman protested:

</p><p>"Honey, that's a mighty nice man, and I sorter hates to see you
make a fool out o' him."

</p><p>"Mammy, here's God's truth," the girl cried passionately, "I'd
marry that man if I could.  But you know the trouble I'd get into if I
did&mdash;Jake would sure find it out; damn him, why won't he ever get a
divorce!"

</p><p>Across the forty miles of level plain, as the sun slid down the
clear blue of the West, turned it to grey, and, after sinking behind
the even rim of the prairie, to a dancing, violent pink, the engine
raced with its tender in front.  The caboose was attached to the
cowcatcher&mdash;the effect was like that of a terrier hauling frenziedly at
a rabbit he had just dragged from its hole.  Scott went to ride with
Joe, the engineer, and Henry, the fireman, taking food for the three
with him.

</p><p>Under one of the little square windows of the rocking caboose,
Dick Marvin sat on the rough-cushioned bench which ran the length
of the car.  Clara Cullom crowded close to him, and the two
watched daytime turn to nighttime and all the light fade from the
prairies.  At Athens, they went on a switch, and the mixed train out
from Delos passed them.  Clara saw Marlow, dusty and occupied
with the Sunday issue of a Denver newspaper, sitting on what had
been the sunny side of the one passenger coach the train carried.
"Stupid!  Just like him," she muttered.  There were two
closed box-cars in the train&mdash;as they were flung past, an odor pungent and
exquisite came into the caboose.

</p><p>"There's your apples, Dick&mdash;want to get off and follow 'em
back?"  The girl laughed happily, and, twisting her head, offered her
red lips for the man's kiss.

</p><p>"Oh, apples," Dick babbled, "I believe you're right.  But I'm
holding right to the best pippin a man ever tasted."

</p><p>"Holding tight is just what you're doing, Dick, lover; you're
killing me, you bear&mdash;but I like it," she giggled.

</p><p>An hour before the engine and caboose crept over the
temporary wooden trestle-bridge across the wide, dry river and

<pb n="402"/>

stopped at the station, lights had appeared to draw the eye to
the spots of denser black where the scattered ranch houses dotted
the level plain.  For Dick, that two hours' flight, holding in his arms
the throbbing, responsive form of the girl, became a literal, deep
intoxication.  They got down from the caboose dazedly.  Clara was
carrying a roughly-tied parcel&mdash;their untouched share of the supper.
She showed it to Dick and laughed.

</p><p>"Ain't we the sillies!"

</p><p>"Ain't we!"  Dick rubbed his hand across his eyes.  "Say, let's
ask Scott about a preacher."  But the conductor had disappeared,
and the engine was clattering away to the yards.  Before them stood
the pretentious Harvard-brick hotel and eating house which had
been built for the convenience of the great transcontinental road's
patrons.  In the centre of a tiny plaza, between the tracks and the
hotel, a fountain played, and a patch of vivid green grass was
bordered by flaming salvia.

</p><p>"Ain't that lovely!" sighed Clara, pressing close to Dick.  "Say,
Dick, lover, I'm hungry!"

</p><p>"Why, sure&mdash;so am I&mdash;you poor thing!  Come on in and let's eat.
I reckon we can get that preacher after supper."

</p><p>At the door, a young Indian boy, in uniform, took the satchel
from Dick and led the way to a desk.

</p><p>"Yes, we'll want a room," the girl answered the clerk's
query&mdash;"away from the tracks&mdash;my husband can't sleep on the noisy side."

</p><p>Dick signed the register, breathing, "it will soon be true,
anyway," when he wrote, "and wife."

</p><p>They ate supper at a tiny table screened by palms, laid with
smooth, rich linen and heavy silver, and lighted by a mellow,
shaded electric candle.  Noiseless and perfect service, excellent
food, cooked to please the finicky palates of jaded transcontinental
travellers, a feeling of long-established intimacy between them
made the meal a dream-feast to Dick.

</p><p>"Did you notice the little balcony off our room, Dick&mdash;we'll sit
out there while you smoke.  There's a lovely moon!"

</p><p>"But&mdash;"  Dick was finding it hard to remember the preacher.

</p><p>"Let me pick out a cigar for you, big man.  I'll bet I know

<pb n="403"/>

the kind you like."  She chose three, with discrimination, and
Dick paid half a dollar for them.

</p><p>Out on the balcony, with the young moon shining on their
faces, with the lights and noise of Delos pleasantly remote, and with
the girl in his arms, the cobweb chains of enchantment held them
motionless for a long time.  Dick flipped his half-smoked cigar over
the railing and buried his face in the girl's thick, yellow hair, orris-scented.  After a while, a waitress, free for the evening, passed
under the balcony on her way to the town&mdash;she sang as she went,
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l part="N">"Darling, I am growing old&mdash;"
</l>
</lg>
<p>
Dick heard, laughed, and set the girl down from his knee.

</p><p>
"Come on, girl&mdash;my goodness!  I'd sure hate to wake a preacher
out of sound sleep.  Cover up that wonderful gold hair of yours with
a hat and follow little Richard."  He turned to go back into the room.

</p><p>But Clara was at the door ahead of him, barring his way.  To
stop him, she put up her arms and locked them about his neck; Dick
saw that she was weeping&mdash;her tears moistened his cheek while she
whispered, vehemently, in his ear:

</p><p>"Dick, we can't!  Oh!  I had ought to have told you&mdash;I'm sorry,
now, I didn't.  Don't leave me!  Don't leave me!"

</p><p>"Why, sure I won't leave you, Gold-Hair!  What's your
trouble?"

</p><p>"We can't be married, Dick&mdash;I've got a man somewhere."

</p><p>"You're married already!"  Dick's hands dropped to his sides,
but the girl clung close to him and wept, wetting his cheek with her
tears.  "Good God!"  For a long time she clung, saying nothing,
weeping hysterically.  "Why&mdash;why"  Dick spoke again with an
effort&mdash;"stop crying, girl&mdash;it hurts me."  His fingers came up to
caress the thick, yellow hair.  Clara released her grip, turned to put
her white, plump forearms against the door-jamb as a cushion for
her forehead, and began to speak brokenly, through her tears:

</p><p>"Yes, go and leave me, Dick&mdash;it's best&mdash;Oh, my God&mdash;I was just
a kid when I married Jake&mdash;I didn't know what I wanted, and he was
a big brute&mdash;but you don't know&mdash;and I

<pb n="404"/>

thought&mdash;Oh! my God, I don't know <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I thought&mdash;  But,
Dick, you made me
crazy&mdash;I did want you; and I still want you&mdash;more than anything in
Christ's world&mdash;  Leave me, Dick!"  The man did not stir, and Clara
knew that she had won.  She became quiet, a figure of sorrow in the
pale moonlight.  Dick came up and turned her to face him.

</p><p>"Gold-Hair, you're mine!  Don't you cry any more&mdash;I'm going
to telephone that young Indian bell-hop to bring up some ice water."
He crushed her in a fierce embrace, laughed, and went into the
room.

</p><p></p><p>
Two hundred miles to the east, in a fat, drowsy town of eastern
Kansas, Jake Thompson, competent mechanic, was at work in the
railroad repair shops.  A hustling, spectacled foreman came into the
shops, stopping for a moment at this bench and that.  He came and
touched Jake's elbow.

</p><p>"You get ready to go out with me to Delos on number four&mdash;we
got a pumping plant to install on that branch road, and I need good,
sober men.  You can go all right, can't you?  Got a wife and kids,
eh?"

</p><p>"Free as air," said Jake, and turned back to his work.  That
night, as the pump-erecting crew in the chair car were speeding to
Delos, two of Jake's friends gossiped:

</p><p>"Say," inquired one, "what you reckon Jake'll do when he sees
Clara and that young ranger at Delos?"  For more than a week, the
man's friends had known that Jake's yellow-haired wife was living
in Delos with a man from the short-grass country&mdash;it was common
gossip among the train-men on the division, and it flowed into the
repair shops as naturally as Hertzian waves agitate the
antenn&aelig; of a wireless station.

</p><p>"Huh!  I bet you he knows already."

</p><p>"Jake ain't no man fer a gun-play."

</p><p>"Over that woman of his!  You're sure right about that."

</p><p>"She was in a store at Kay See when Jake got her&mdash;and back
she went when Jake dropped her.  Say, the store girls is sure the
stuff!  How many men you reckon she's throwed her spell over since
Jake quit her?"  The conversation trailed off

<pb n="405"/>  into a region
of vague, murky surmises.  Four seats ahead, Jake slept peacefully.

</p><p>In ten days, Dick's bank account at Dodge had suffered&mdash;and
Clara's wardrobe was richer by every bit of feminine gear which had
taken her fancy.  She was proud of her clothes,
vain of her full-blown beauty.  And Dick, uniformed for the
streets from Delos's
biggest store, was a man she could parade proudly.  Early in the
morning, just before number four, from the east, pulled in, they had
acquired the habit of coming down to breakfast&mdash;Clara liked to show
herself, fresh-bathed and spotless of dress, among the jaded women
from the sleeping cars.

</p><p>Jake Thompson had finished his lunch-counter breakfast of
ham and eggs, wheat cakes, syrup, and coffee.  He was sitting on the
edge of the hotel porch, chewing a toothpick and waiting for the
mixed train out to Hesperides.  Clara led Dick plump into him
before she knew anyone was sitting there.

</p><p>"Hello, Clara!" Jake greeted her without embarrassment.  She
turned as if to go back, then stopped, flustered and uncertain.  Dick
had stopped, and was watching the man chew his toothpick
unhurriedly.

</p><p>"Who's&mdash;" Dick began pleasantly, and old habit conquered
Clara.

</p><p>"Jake," she stammered, "shake hands with Mr. Marvin.  Mr.
Marvin, Mr. Thompson."

</p><p>"I don't reckon I'll shake hands with him, Clara," Jake
observed quietly, "I'm kind of particular about who I touch."  His
words cut her, like a lash across the face.

</p><p>"Say, you big boob!" Clara broke out, "don't you make any
passes like that around here; Dick, here, is the kind of a man to
whirl you round his head and beat your brains out against
the door-jamb for talk like that.  What the hell you doin'
round here, anyway!
I thought I'd seen the last of you."  Clara was caught up in a
whirlwind of reproaches, hysterical curses, and angry sobs.
Passengers strolling back to the Pullman from the dining-room
stopped to stare frankly.  "Gee!" exclaimed one youth delightedly,
"it's real old meelo-drammer, straight from Third Avenue."
</p>
<p>A grin froze on Dick's face, then settled into faint grey


<pb n="406"/>  lines which spelled nothing suggesting humor.  Something
that tore and throbbed crept under his skin, rising from spine to
scalp, damming the blood-currents and paralyzing thought and
speech.  Clara's curses, her frenzy of anger, the whole grotesquely
coarse outburst seemed a sudden, horrible illusion.  He drew his
hand across his eyes to drive away the vision, but it persisted.  After
what seemed a long time, he was astonished to feel Clara's hand on
his arm, to hear her angry voice close to his ear saying:
     "
</p><p>Kill the &mdash;, Dick!  He's laughing at me."  Dick shook
himself and turned his grey, set face to the girl.

</p><p>"Didn't you hear Mr. Thompson say he was particular about
people?  Maybe he wouldn't like me to touch him&mdash;I couldn't blame
him."  The exquisite humor of Dick's speech, born out of a
stiffening agony of self-reproach, was lost on Clara.  She screamed
an epithet at the two men, and ran into the hotel.

</p><p>"Gee!" muttered the youth from the Pullman, "wouldn't that
curl your hair!"  He referred particularly to the word which Clara
had flung into the faces of the two men.

</p><p>After a little while, Dick addressed the man sitting on the edge
of the porch, still chewing evenly at the toothpick:

</p><p>"Maybe you and I'd better have a talk."  He spoke mildly,
courteously.

</p><p>"Go ahead, I'm listenin'&mdash;only make it short, fer I got to catch a
train out to Hesper' in a few minutes."

</p><p>"Oh!"  Dick took off his hat and wiped the sweat from his
forehead.  "'Hesper'&mdash;you mean Hesperides?"

</p><p>"Uh-huh," the man agreed.

</p><p>"I&mdash;I came from out that way."  It was as if he had been asleep
a long time and the waking was difficult.  The world he had left was
coming back into being.

</p><p>"That country any good?" queried the man perfunctorily.

</p><p>"How's that?"  Dick was recalling it better, now.  "I live ten
miles south-west of Hesperides, and I rode my horse in to get a sack
of apples for my mother."  He paused and searched his mind again.
"Say, <hi rend="italic">I'm</hi> going out on that train, too&mdash;you wait for me."
</p>
<pb n="407"/>

<p>"They ain't no law agin it that I know of," was the man's stolid
comment.

</p><p>Clara came downstairs and out of the door, a bag in either
hand.  She put down the bags&mdash;shining new and bulging&mdash;and came
up close to Dick.  Her cheeks were aflame with anger, and she
spoke rapidly, with brutal scorn, utterly unmindful of the curious
passengers:

</p><p>"Say, you good little boy!  I'm through with you&mdash;and damn
glad of it.  You've made me tired, see! and I won't stand for it.  A
boob and a mammy's boy!  Ain't there no <hi rend="italic">men</hi> left in the
world?"

</p><p>Watch in hand, the conductor of number four began calling,
"All aboard!"  His hand was lifted as a signal to his engineer.

</p><p>"Wait!" screamed Clara, and ran toward the train.  A negro
porter took her bags, and the last of her that Dick saw, as he stared
dazedly, was the flutter of a violet silk petticoat as Clara flung
herself up the steps of a Pullman.


</p><p>The mixed train to Hesperides was coming to a stop, and Jake
Thompson was tacking on a moral to the story of his courtship and
marriage:

</p><p>"Clara's wild an' full of life&mdash;maybe sober, steady-goin' men
<hi rend="italic">do</hi> make her tired, like she said.  I reckon she don't belong in
this slow, dog-trottin' age&mdash;anyway, such as you an' me can't hold
her.  Lord!  I done got over rampin' an' prayin' on account o' her;
maybe, some day, though, she'll git tired of whoopin' it up, an' want
to come back an' say, 'Jake, I'm through.'  Then I'll give
her a home&mdash;damn me, if I don't!

</p><p>"You ride straight home to that good mother o' yours, Dick
Marvin, an' forget all about this last ten days.  I'll be workin' over
here&mdash;Plum Creek crossin', they tell me it is&mdash;for a month, maybe.
Be glad to see you any day."  They shook hands, and Dick went
across to Marlow's.

</p><p>As he entered the long store, a pungent, pleasant odor came to
his nostrils.  Marlow came forward, smiling.

</p><p>"Going out to the ranch to-day, Mr. Marvin?"

</p><p>"Yes."
</p>
<pb n="408"/>

<p>"Your mother was in the day after you left, and I told her you
were called to Kansas City suddenly . . . I been keeping your horse
for you in my stable&mdash;he's kind of frisky by now."

</p><p>"Say&mdash;"  Dick sniffed, and smiled gratefully at the
store-keeper&mdash; "sack me up a bushel of those apples, will you, Mr.
Marlow."

</p><p>"You spoke just in time&mdash;I never did see such a call for apples!
Every ranch in three counties sent in for some of that two carloads I
brought in.  Surprised <hi rend="italic">me</hi>&mdash;I thought I'd got enough in to last
all winter."

</p><p>"People get awful hungry for such things out here."

</p><p>"I reckon that's so&mdash;they work up an awful, what you might call
an unnatural, taste for something that's fresh and kind o' sweet and
sour, too."

</p><p>"That's right&mdash;you ought to make a good thing out of apples
here, Mr. Marlow . . .  Well, I'll be riding&mdash;you can hand up that sack
when I come round."

</p><p>Dick's horse bucked and plunged, thrilling its rider with the joy
of violent motion.  At the front door of the store, Marlow gingerly
hoisted the apples to the saddle.

</p><p>"For your mother, Mr. Marvin, with my compliments."  Dick
slackened the rein, and in three minutes he and his horse had
become a bobbing speck to the short-sighted vision of the
contemplative Marlow.
