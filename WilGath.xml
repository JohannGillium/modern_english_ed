<p>Most of dialogue is in dialect. E.g., the final "g" is nearly 
always replaced in dialogue with "'."  There are many "phonetic" 
spellings: "mebbe" for "maybe," "s'pose," for "suppose," "hev" for 
"have," "lor'," for "lord," etc. Nicknames, e.g. "'Relia," are 
interchanged with given names, e.g. "Aurelia."</p>

<p> 
A DAMP air was blowing up, and the frogs were beginning to peep.  
The sun was setting in a low red sky.  On both sides of the road 
were rich green meadows intersected by little canal-like brooks.  
Beyond the meadows on the west was a distant stretch of pine woods, 
that showed dark against the clear sky.  Aurelia Flower was going 
along the road toward her home, with a great sheaf of leaves and 
flowers in her arms.  There were the rosy spikes of hardhack; the 
great white corymbs of thoroughwort, and the long blue racemes of 
lobelia.  Then there were great bunches of the odorous tansy and 
pennyroyal in with the rest. 
</p><p>Aurelia was a tall, strongly built woman: she was not much 
over thirty, but she looked older.  Her complexion had a hard red 
tinge from exposure to sun and wind, and showed seams as 
unreservedly as granite.  Her face was thin, and her cheek-bones 
high.  She had a profusion of auburn hair, showing in a loose 
slipping coil, beneath her limp black straw hat.  Her dress, as a 
matter of fashion, was execrable; in point of harmony with her 
immediate surroundings, very well, though she had not thought of it 
in that way.  There was a green under-skirt, and a brown over-skirt 
and basque of an obsolete cut.  She had worn it for a good many 
years just so, and never thought of altering it.  It did not seem 
to occur to her that though her name was Flower, she was not really 
a flower in regard to apparel, and had not its right of 
unchangeableness in the spring.  When the trees hung out their 
catkins, she flaunted her poor old greens and browns under them, 
rejoicing, and never dreamed but what they looked all right.  As 
far as dress went, Aurelia was a happy woman.  She went along the 
road to-night at a good pace, her armful of leaves and blossoms 
nodding; her spare muscular limbs bore her along easily.  She had 
been over a good many miles since noon, but she never thought of 
being tired. 
</p><p>Presently she came in sight of her home, a square unpainted 
building, black with age.  It stood back a little from the road on 
a gentle slope.  There were three great maple trees in front of the 
house; their branches rustled against the roof.  On the left was a 
small garden; some tall poles thickly twined with hops were 
prominent in it. 
</p><p>Aurelia went round to the side door of the house with her 
armful of green things.  The door opened directly into the great 
kitchen.  One on entering would have started back as one would on 
seeing unexpected company in a room.  The walls were as green as a 
lady's bower with bunches and festoons of all sorts of New 
<pb n="788"/>  England herbs.  There they hung, their brave 
blossoms turning gray and black, giving out strange half-pleasant, 
half-disgusting odors.  Aurelia took them in like her native air.  
"It's good to get home," murmured she to herself, for there was no 
one else; she lived alone. 
</p><p>She took off her hat and disposed of her burden; then she 
got herself some supper.  She did not build a fire in the cooking 
stove, for she never drank tea in warm weather.  Instead, she had 
a tumbler of root-beer which she had made herself.  She set it out 
on one end of her kitchen table with a slice of coarse bread and a 
saucer of cold beans.  She sat down to it and ate with a good 
appetite.  She looked better with her hat off.  Her forehead was an 
important part of her face; it was white and womanly, and her 
reddish hair lay round it in pretty curves; then her brown eyes, 
under very strongly arched brows, showed to better advantage.  
Taken by herself, and not compared with other women, Aurelia was 
not so bad-looking; but she never was taken by herself in that way, 
and nobody had ever given her any credit for comeliness.  It would 
have been like looking at a jack-in-the-pulpit and losing all the 
impression that had ever been made on one by roses and hyacinths, 
and seeing absolutely nothing else but that one flower's fine green 
and brown lines; it is doubtful if it would be done. 
</p><p>She had finished her supper, and was sorting her fresh 
herbs, when the door opened and a woman walked in.  She had no 
bonnet on her head; she was a neighbor, and this was an 
unceremonious little country place. 
</p><p>"Good evenin', 'Relia," said she.  There was an important 
look on her plain face, as if there was more to follow. 
</p><p>"Good evenin', Mis' Atwood.  Take a chair." 
</p><p>"Been herbin' again?" 
</p><p>"Yes; I went out a little while this afternoon." 
</p><p>"Where'd you go?&mdash;upon Green Mountain?" 
</p><p>"No; I went over to White's Woods.  There were some kinds 
there I wanted." 
</p><p>"You don't say so!  That's a matter of six miles, ain't it?  
Ain't you tired?" 
</p><p>"Lor', no," said Aurelia.  "I reckon I'm pretty strong, or 
mebbe the smell of the herbs keeps me up;" and she laughed. 
</p><p>So did the other.  "Sure enough&mdash;well, mebbe it does.  I 
never thought of that.  But it seems like a pretty long tramp to 
me, though my bein' so fleshy may make a difference.  I could have 
walked it easier once." 
</p><p>"I shouldn't wonder if it did make a difference.  I ain't 
got much flesh to carry round to tire me out." 
</p><p>"You're always pretty well, too, ain't you, 'Relia?" 
</p><p>"Lor', yes; I never knew what 'twas to be sick.  How's your 
folks, Mis' Atwood?  Is Viny any better than she was?" 
</p><p>"I don't know as she is, much.  She feels pretty poorly most 
of the time.  I guess I'll hev you fix some more of that root-beer 
for her.  I thought that seemed to liven her up a little." 
</p><p>"I've got a jug of it all made, down-cellar, and you can 
take it when you go home, if you want to." 
</p><p>"So I will, if you've got it.  I was in hopes you might hev 
it." 
</p><p>The important look had not vanished from Mrs. Atwood's face, 
but she was not the woman to tell important news in a hurry, and 
have the gusto of it so soon over.  She was one of the natures who 
always dispose of bread before pie.  Now she came to it, however. 
</p><p>"I heard some news to-night, 'Relia," said she. 
</p><p>Aurelia picked out another spray of hardhack.  "What was 
it?" </p><p>"Thomas Rankin's dead." 
</p><p>Aurelia clutched the hardhack mechanically.  "You don't mean 
it, Mis' Atwood!  When did he die?  I hadn't heard he was sick." 
</p><p>"He wasn't, long.  Had a kind of a fit this noon, and died 
right off.  The doctor&mdash;they sent for Dr. Smith from Alden&mdash;called 
it sun-stroke.  You know 'twas awful hot, and he'd been out in the 
field to work all the mornin'.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> think 'twas heart trouble; 
it's in the Rankin family; his father died of it.  Doctors don't 
know everything." 
</p><p>"Well, it's a dreadful thing," said Aurelia.  "I can't 
realize it.  There he's left four little children, and it ain't 
more'n a year since Mis' Rankin died.  It <hi rend="italic">ain't</hi> a year, is 
it?" </p><p>"It ain't a year into a month and sixteen days," said 
Mrs. Atwood, solemnly.  "Viny and I was countin' of it up just 
before I come in here." 
</p><p>"Well, I guess 'tisn't, come to think of it.  I couldn't 
have told exactly.  The <pb n="789"/>  oldest of those 
children ain't more than eight, is she?" 
</p><p>"Ethelind is eight, coming next month; Viny and I was 
reckinin' it up.  Then Edith is six, and Isadore is five, and 
Myrtie ain't but two, poor little thing." 
</p><p>"What do you s'pose will be done with 'em?" 
</p><p>"I don't know.  Viny an' me was talking of it over, and got 
it settled that <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sister, Mis' Loomis, over to Alden, 
would <hi rend="italic">hev</hi> to hev 'em.  It'll be considerable for her, too, 
for she's got two of her own, and I don't s'pose Sam Loomis has got 
much.  But I don't see what else can be done.  Of course strangers 
ain't goin' to take children when there is folks." 
</p><p>"Wouldn't <hi rend="italic">his</hi> mother take 'em?" 
</p><p>"What, old-lady Sears?  Lor', no.  You know she was dreadful 
put out 'bout Thomas marryin' where he did, and declared he 
shouldn't hev a cent of her money.  It was all her second 
husband's, anyway.  John Rankin wasn't worth anything.  She won't 
do anything for 'em.  She's livin' in great style down near the 
city, they say.  Got a nice house, and keeps help.  She might hev 
'em just as well as not, but she won't.  She's a hard woman to get 
along with, anyhow.  She nagged both her husbands to death, an' 
Thomas never had no peace at home.  Guess that was one reason why 
he was in such a hurry to get married.  Mis' Rankin was a good-tempered soul, if she wasn't quite so drivin' as some." 
</p><p>"I do feel dreadfully to think of those children," said 
Aurelia. 
</p><p>"'Tis hard; but we must try an' believe it will be ruled for 
the best.  I s'pose I must go, for I left Viny all alone." 
</p><p>"Well, if you must, I'll get that root-beer for you, Mis' 
Atwood.  I shall keep thinking 'bout those children all night." 
</p><p>A week or two after that, Mrs. Atwood had some more news; 
but she didn't go to Aurelia with it, for Aurelia was the very sub-essence of it herself.  She unfolded it gingerly to her daughter 
Lavinia&mdash;a pale, peaked young woman, who looked as if it would take 
more than Aurelia's root-beer to make her robust.  Aurelia had 
taken the youngest Rankin child for her own, and Mrs. Atwood had 
just heard of it. 
</p><p>"It's true," said she; "I see her with it myself.  Old-lady 
Sears never so much as sent a letter, let alone not coming to the 
funeral, and Mis' Loomis was glad enough to get rid of it." 
</p><p>Viny drank in the story as if it had been so much nourishing 
jelly.  Her too narrow life was killing her as much as anything 
else. 
</p><p>Meanwhile Aurelia had the child, and was actively happy, for 
the first time in her life, to her own <hi rend="italic">naive</hi> astonishment, 
for she had never known that she was not so before.  She had 
naturally strong affections, of an outward rather than an inward 
tendency.  She was capable of much enjoyment from pure living, but 
she had never had anything to be so very fond of.  She could only 
remember her father as a gloomy, hard-working man, who never 
noticed her much.  He had a melancholy temperament, which resulted 
in a tragical end when Aurelia was a mere child.  When she thought 
of him, the same horror which she had when they brought him home 
from the river crept over her now.  They had never known certainly 
just how Martin Flower had come to die; but folks never spoke of 
him to Aurelia and her mother, and the two never talked of him 
together.  They knew that everybody said Martin Flower had drowned 
himself; they felt shame and a Puritan shrinking from the sin. 
</p><p>Aurelia's mother had been a hard, silent woman before; she 
grew more hard and silent afterward.  She worked hard, and taught 
Aurelia to.  Their work was peculiar; they hardly knew themselves 
how they had happened to drift into it; it had seemed to creep in 
with other work, till finally it usurped it altogether.  At first, 
after her husband's death, Mrs. Flower had tried millinery; she had 
learned the trade in her youth.  But she made no headway then in 
sewing rose-buds and dainty bows on to bonnets; it did not suit 
with tragedy.  The bonnets seemed infected with her own mood; the 
bows lay flat with stern resolve, and the rose-buds stood up 
fiercely; she did not please her customers, even among those 
uncritical country folk, and they dropped off.  She had always made 
excellent root-beer, and had had quite a reputation in the 
neighborhood for it.  How it happened she could not tell, but she 
found herself selling it; then she made hop yeast, and sold that.  
Then she was a woman of a fertile brain, and another project 
suggested itself to her. 
</p><p>She and Aurelia ransacked the woods thereabouts for 
medicinal herbs, and disposed of them to druggists in a neighboring 
town.  They had a garden of some <pb n="790"/>  sorts too&mdash;the 
different mints, thyme, lavender, coriander, rosemary, and others.  
It was an unusual business for two women to engage in, but it 
increased, and they prospered according to their small ideas.  But 
Mrs. Flower grew more and more bitter with success.  What regrets 
and longing that her husband could have lived and shared it, and 
been spared his final agony, she had in her heart, nobody but the 
poor woman herself knew; she never spoke of them.  She died when 
Aurelia was twenty, and a woman far beyond her years.  She mourned 
for her mother, but although she never knew it, her warmest love 
had not been called out.  It had been barely possible.  Mrs. Flower 
had not been a lovable mother; she had rarely spoken to Aurelia but 
with cold censure for the last few years.  People whispered that it 
was a happy release for the poor girl when her mother died; they 
had begun to think she was growing like her husband, and perhaps 
was not "just right." 
</p><p>Aurelia went on with the business with calm equanimity, and 
made even profits every year.  They were small, but more than 
enough for her to live on, and she paid the last dollar of the 
mortgage which had so fretted her father, and owned the old house 
clear.  She led a peaceful, innocent life, with her green herbs for 
companions; she associated little with the people around, except in 
a business way.  They came to see her, but she rarely entered their 
houses.  Every room in her house was festooned with herbs; she knew 
every kind that grew in the New England woods, and hunted them out 
in their season and brought them home; she was a simple sweet soul, 
with none of the morbid melancholy of her parents about her.  She 
loved her work, and the green-wood things were to her as friends, 
and the healing qualities of sarsaparilla and thoroughwort, and the 
sweetness of thyme and lavender, seemed to have entered into her 
nature, till she almost could talk with them in that way.  She had 
never thought of being unhappy; but now she wondered at herself 
over this child.  It was a darling of a child; as dainty and 
winsome a girl baby as ever was.  Her poor young mother had had a 
fondness for romantic names, which she had bestowed, as the only 
heritage within her power, on all her children.  This one was 
Myrtilla&mdash;Myrtie for short.  The little thing clung to Aurelia from 
the first, and Aurelia found that she had another way of loving 
besides the way in which she loved lavender and thoroughwort.  The 
comfort she took with the child through the next winter was 
unspeakable.  The herbs were banished from the south room, which 
was turned into a nursery, and a warm carpet was put on the floor, 
that the baby might not take cold.  She learned to cook for the 
baby&mdash;her own diet had been chiefly vegetarian.  She became a 
charming nursing mother.  People wondered. "It does beat all how 
handy 'Relia is with that baby," Mrs. Atwood told Viny. 
</p><p>Aurelia took even more comfort with the little thing when 
spring came, and she could take her out with her; then she bought 
a little straw carriage, and the two went after herbs together.  
Home they would come in the tender spring twilight, the baby asleep 
in her carriage, with a great sheaf of flowers beside her, and 
Aurelia with another over her shoulder. 
</p><p>She felt all through that summer as if she was too happy to 
last.  Once she said so to one of the neighbors.  "I feel as if it 
wa'n't right for me to be so perfectly happy," said she.  "I feel 
some days as if I was walkin' an' walkin' an' walkin' through a 
garden of sweet-smellin' herbs, an' nothin' else; an' as for 
Myrtie, she's a bundle of myrtle an' camphor out of King Solomon's 
garden.  I'm so afraid it can't last." 
</p><p>Happiness had seemed to awake in Aurelia a taint of her 
father's foreboding melancholy.  But she apparently had no reason 
for it until early fall.  Then returning with Myrtie one night from 
a trip to the woods, she found an old lady seated on her door-step, 
grimly waiting for her.  She was an old woman and tremulous, but 
still undaunted and unshaken as to her spirit.  Her tall, shrunken 
form was loaded with silk and jet.  She stood up as Aurelia 
approached wondering, and her dim old eyes peered at her 
aggressively through fine gold spectacles, which lent an additional 
glare to them. 
</p><p>"I suppose you are Miss Flower?" began the old lady, with no 
prefatory parley. 
</p><p>"Yes," said Aurelia, trembling. 
</p><p>"Well, my name's Mrs. Matthew Sears, an' I've come for my 
grandchild there." 
</p><p>Aurelia turned very white.  She let her herbs slide to the 
ground.  "I&mdash;hardly understand&mdash;I guess," faltered she.  "Can't you 
let me keep her?" <pb n="791"/>  
</p><p>"Well, I guess I won't have one of my grandchildren brought 
up by an old yarb-woman&mdash;not if I know it!" 
</p><p>The old lady sniffed.  Aurelia stood looking at her.  She 
felt as if she had fallen down from heaven, and the hard reality of 
the earth had jarred the voice out of her.  Then the old lady made 
a step toward the carriage, and caught up Myrtie in her trembling 
arms.  The child screamed with fright.  She had been asleep.  She 
turned her little frightened face toward Aurelia, and held out her 
arms, and cried, "Mamma! mamma! mamma!" in a perfect frenzy of 
terror.  The old lady tried to hush her in vain.  Aurelia found her 
voice then.  "You'd better let me take her and give her her 
supper," she said, "and when she is asleep again I will bring her 
over to you." 
</p><p>"Well," said the old lady, doubtfully.  She was glad to get 
the frantic little thing out of her arms, though. 
</p><p>Aurelia held her close and hushed her, and she subsided into 
occasional convulsive sobs, and furtive frightened glances at her 
grandmother. 
</p><p>"I s'pose you are stopping at the hotel," said Aurelia. 
</p><p>"Yes, I am," said the old lady, stoutly.  "You kin bring her 
over as soon as she's asleep."  Then she marched off with uncertain 
majesty. 
</p><p>Some women would have argued the case longer, but Aurelia 
felt that there was simply no use in it.  The old lady was the 
child's grandmother: if she wanted her, she saw no way but to give 
her up.  She never thought of pleading, she was so convinced of the 
old lady's determination. 
</p><p>She carried Myrtie into the house, gave her her supper, 
washed her, and dressed her in her little best dress.  Then she 
took her up in her lap and tried to explain to her childish mind 
the change that was to be made in her life.  She told her she was 
going to live with her grandmother, and she must be a good little 
girl, and love her, and do just as she told her to.  Myrtie sobbed 
with unreasoning grief, and clung to Aurelia; but she wholly failed 
to take the full meaning of it all in. 
</p><p>She was still fretful and bewildered by her rude awakening 
from her nap.  Presently she fell asleep again, and Aurelia laid 
her down while she got together her little wardrobe.  There was a 
hop pillow in a little linen case, which Myrtie had always slept 
on; she packed that up with the other things. 
</p><p>Then she rolled the little sleeping girl up in a blanket, 
laid her in her carriage, and went over to the hotel.  It was not 
much of a hotel&mdash;merely an ordinary two-story house, where two or 
three spare rooms were ample accommodation for the few straggling 
guests who came to this little rural place.  It was only a few 
steps from Aurelia's house.  The old lady had the chamber of honor, 
a large square room on the first floor, opening directly on to the 
piazza.  In spite of all Aurelia's care, Myrtie woke up and began 
to dry when she was carried in.  She had to go off and leave her 
screaming piteously after her.  Out on the piazza, she uttered the 
first complaint, almost, of her life, to the hostess, Mrs. Simonds, 
who had followed her there. 
</p><p>"Don't feel bad, 'Relia," said the woman, who was almost 
crying herself.  "I know it's awful hard, when you was taking so 
much comfort.  We all feel for you." 
</p><p>Aurelia looked straight ahead.  She had the bundle of little 
clothes and the hop pillow in her arms; the old lady had said, in 
a way that would have been funny if it had not been for the poor 
heart that listened, that she didn't want any yarb pillows, nor any 
clothes scented with yarbs nuther. 
</p><p>"I don't mean to be wicked," said Aurelia, "but I can't help 
thinking that Providence ought to provide for women.  I wish Myrtie 
was <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>." 
</p><p>The other woman wiped her eyes at the hungry way in which 
she said "mine." 
</p><p>"Well, I can't do anything; but I'm sorry for you, if that's 
all.  You'd make enough sight better mother for Myrtie than that 
cross old woman.  I don't b'lieve she more'n half wants her, only 
she's <hi rend="italic">sot</hi>.  She doesn't care anything about having the other 
children; she's going to leave them with Mis' Loomis; but she says 
her grandchildren ain't going to be living with strangers, an' she 
ought to hev been consulted.  After all you've done for the child, 
to treat you as she has to-night, she's the most ungrateful&mdash;  I 
know one thing; I'd charge her for Myrtie's board&mdash;a good price, 
too." 
</p><p>"Oh, I don't want anything of that sort," said poor Aurelia 
dejectedly, listening to her darling's sobs.  "You go in an' try to 
hush her, Mis' Simonds.  Oh!" 
</p><p>"So I will! her grandmother can't do <pb n="792"/>  
anything with her, poor little thing!  I've got some peppermints.  
I do believe she's spankin' her&mdash;the&mdash;" 
</p><p>Aurelia did not run in with Mrs. Simonds; she listened 
outside till the pitiful cries hushed a little; then she went 
desolately home. 
</p><p>She sat down in the kitchen, with the little clothes in her 
lap.  She did not think of going to bed; she did not cry of moan to 
herself; she just sat there still.  It was not very late when she 
came home&mdash;between eight and nine.  In about half an hour, perhaps, 
she heard a sound outside that made her heart leap&mdash;a little voice, 
crying pitifully, and saying, between the sobs, "Mamma! mamma!" 
</p><p>Aurelia made one spring to the door.  There was the tiny 
creature in her little night gown, shaking all over with cold and 
sobs. 
</p><p>Aurelia caught her up, and all her calm was over.  "Oh, you 
darling! you darling! you darling!" she cried, covering her little 
cold body all over with kisses.  "You sha'n't leave me&mdash;you 
sha'n't'! you sha'n't!  Little sweetheart&mdash;all I've got in the 
world.  I guess they sha'n't take you away when you don't want to 
go.  Did you cry, and mamma go off and leave you?  Did they whip 
you?  They never shall again&mdash;never! never!  There, there, blessed, 
don't cry; mamma'll get you all warm, and you shall go to sleep on 
your own little pillow.  Oh, you darling! darling! darling!" 
</p><p>Aurelia busied herself about the child, rubbing the little 
numb limbs, and getting some milk heated.  She never asked how she 
came to get away; she never thought of anything except that she had 
her.  She stopped every other minute to kiss her and croon to her; 
she laughed and cried.  Now she gave way to her feelings; she was 
almost beside herself.  She had the child all warm and fed and 
comforted by the kitchen fire, when she heard steps outside, and 
she knew at once what was coming, and a fierce resolve sprang up in 
her heart: they should not have that child again to-night.  She 
cast a hurried glance around; there was hardly a second's time.  In 
the corner of the kitchen was a great heap of herbs which she had 
taken down from the walls where they had been drying; the next day 
she had intended to pack them and send them off.  She caught up 
Myrtie and covered her with them.  "Lie still, darling!" she 
whispered.  "Don't make a bit of noise, or your grandmother will 
get you again."  Myrtie crouched under them, trembling. 
</p><p>Then the door opened; Mr. Simonds stood there with a 
lantern.  "That little girl's run away," he began&mdash;"slipped out 
while the old lady was out of the room a minute.  Beats all how 
such a little thing knew enough.  She's here, ain't she?" 
</p><p>"No," said Aurelia, "she ain't." 
</p><p>"You don't mean it?" 
</p><p>"Yes." 
</p><p>"Ain't you seen her, though?" 
</p><p>"No." 
</p><p>Mr. Simonds, who was fat and placid, began to look grave.  
"Then, all there is about it, we've got to have a hunt," said he.  
"'Twon't do to have that little tot out in her night-gown long.  We 
hadn't a thought but that she was here.  Must have lost her way." 
</p><p>Aurelia watched him stride down the yard.  Then she ran 
after him.  "Mr. Simonds!"  He turned.  "I told you a lie.  
Myrtie's in the corner of the kitchen under a heap of herbs." 
</p><p>"Why, what on earth&mdash;" 
</p><p>"I wanted to keep her so to-night."  Aurelia burst right out 
in loud sobs. 
</p><p>"There, 'Relia!  It's a confounded shame.  You shall keep 
her.  I'll make it all right with the old lady somehow.  I reckon, 
as long as the child's safe, she'll be glad to get rid of her to-night.  She wouldn't have slept much.  Go right into the house, 
'Relia, and don't worry." 
</p><p>Aurelia obeyed.  She hung over the little creature all 
right, asleep in her little crib.  She watched her every breath.  
She never thought of sleeping herself&mdash;her last night with Myrtie.  
The seconds were so many grains of gold dust.  Her heart failed her 
when day broke.  She washed and dressed Myrtie at the usual time, 
and gave her her breakfast.  Then she sat down with her and waited.  
The child's sorrow was soon forgotten, and she played about as 
usual.  Aurelia watched her despairingly.  She began to wonder at 
length why they did not come for her.  It grew later and later.  
She would not carry her back herself, she was resolved on that. 
</p><p>It was ten o'clock before any one came; then it was Mrs. 
Simonds.  She had a strange look on her face. 
</p><p>"'Relia," she said, standing in the door and looking at her 
and Myrtie, "you 'ain't heard what's happened to our house this 
morning', hev you?" <pb n="793"/>  
</p><p>"No," said Aurelia, awed. 
</p><p>"Old Mis' Sears is dead.  Had her third shock: she's had two 
in the last three years.  She was took soon after Mr. Simonds got 
home.  We got a doctor right off, but she died 'bout an hour ago." 
</p><p>"Oh," said Aurelia, "I've been a wicked woman." 
</p><p>"No you ain't, Aurelia; don't you go to feeling so.  There's 
no call for the living to be unjust to themselves because folks are 
dead.  You did the best you could.  An' now you're glad you can 
keep the child; you can't help it.  I thought of it myself the 
first thing." 
</p><p>"Oh, I was such a wicked woman to think of it myself," said 
Aurelia.  "If I could only have done something for the poor old 
soul!  Why didn't you call me?" 
</p><p>"I told Mr. Simonds I wouldn't; you'd had enough." 
</p><p>There was one thing, however, which Aurelia found to do&mdash;a 
simple and touching thing, though it probably meant more to her 
than to most of those who knew of it. 
</p><p>On the day of the funeral the poor old woman's grave was 
found lined with fragrant herbs from Aurelia's garden&mdash;thyme and 
lavender and rosemary.  She had cried when she picked them, because 
she could not help being glad, and they were all she could give for 
atonement.</p>
