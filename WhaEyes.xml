<p> 
WE had been put in the mood for ghosts, that evening, after an 
excellent dinner at our old friend Culwin's, by a tale of Fred 
Murchard's&mdash;the narrative of a strange personal visitation. 
</p><p>Seen through the haze of our cigars, and by the drowsy gleam 
of a coal fire, Culwin's library, with its oak walls and dark old 
bindings, made a good setting for such evocations; and ghostly 
experiences at first hand being, after Murchard's brilliant 
opening, the only kind acceptable to us, we proceeded to take stock 
of our group and tax each member for a contribution.  There were 
eight of us, and seven contrived, in a manner more or less 
adequate, to fulfil the condition imposed.  It surprised us all to 
find that we could muster such a show of supernatural impressions, 
for none of us, excepting Murchard himself and young Phil Frenham&mdash; 
whose story was the slightest of the lot&mdash;had the habit of sending 
our souls into the invisible.  So that, on the whole, we had every 
reason to be proud of our seven "exhibits," and none of us would 
have dreamed of expecting an eighth from our host. 
</p><p>Our old friend, Mr. Andrew Culwin, who had sat back in his 
arm-chair, listening and blinking through the smoke circles with 
the cheerful tolerance of a wise old idol, was not the kind of man 
likely to be favoured with such contacts, though he had imagination 
enough to enjoy, without envying, the superior privileges of his 
guests.  By age and by education he belonged to the stout 
Positivist tradition, and his habit of thought had been formed in 
the days of the epic struggle between physics and metaphysics.  But 
he had been, then and always, essentially a spectator, a humorous 
detached observer of the immense muddled variety show of life, 
slipping out of his seat now and then for a brief dip into the 
convivialities at the back of the house, but never, as far as one 
knew, showing the least desire to jump on the stage and do a 
"turn." 
</p><p>Among his contemporaries there lingered a vague tradition of 
his having, at a remote period, and in a romantic clime, been 
wounded in a duel; but this legend no more tallied with what we 
younger men knew of his character than my mother's assertion that 
he had once been "a charming little man with nice eyes" 
corresponded to any possible reconstitution of his dry thwarted 
physiognomy. 
</p><p>"He never can have looked like anything but a bundle of 
sticks," Murchard had once said of him.  "Or a phosphorescent log, 
rather," some one else amended; and we recognized the happiness of 
this description of his small squat trunk, with the red blink of 
the eyes in a face like mottled bark.  He had always been possessed 
of a leisure which he had nursed and protected, instead of 
squandering it in vain activities.  His carefully guarded hours had 
been devoted to the cultivation of a fine intelligence and a few 
judiciously chosen habits; and none of the disturbances common to 
human experience seemed to have crossed his sky.  Nevertheless, his 
dispassionate survey of the universe had not raised his opinion of 
that costly experiment, and his study of the human race seemed to 
have resulted in the conclusion that all men were superfluous, and 
women necessary only because some one had to do the cooking.  On 
the importance of this point his convictions were absolute, and 
gastronomy was the only science which he revered as dogma.  It must 
be owned that his little dinners were a strong argument in favour 
of this view, besides being a reason&mdash;though not the main one&mdash;for 
the fidelity of his friends. 
</p><p>Mentally he exercised a hospitality less seductive but no less 
stimulating.  His mind was like a forum, or some open meeting-place
<pb n="672"/>  for the exchange of ideas: somewhat cold and 
draughty, but light, spacious and orderly&mdash;a kind of academic grove 
from which all the leaves had fallen.  In this privileged area a 
dozen of us were wont to stretch our muscles and expand our lungs; 
and, as if to prolong as much as possible the tradition of what we 
felt to be a vanishing institution, one or two neophytes were now 
and then added to our band. 
</p><p>Young Phil Frenham was the last, and the most interesting, of 
these recruits, and a good example of Murchard's somewhat morbid 
assertion that our old friend "liked 'em juicy."  It was indeed a 
fact that Culwin, for all his mental dryness, specially tasted the 
lyric qualities in youth.  As he was far too good an Epicurean to 
nip the flowers of soul which he gathered for his garden, his 
friendship was not a disintegrating influence: on the contrary, it 
forced the young idea to robuster bloom.  And in Phil Frenham he 
had a fine subject for experimentation.  The boy was really 
intelligent, and the soundness of his nature was like the pure 
paste under a delicate glaze.  Culwin had fished him out of a thick 
fog of family dulness, and pulled him up to a peak in Darien; and 
the adventure hadn't hurt him a bit.  Indeed, the skill with which 
Culwin had contrived to stimulate his curiosities without robbing 
them of their young bloom of awe seemed to me a sufficient answer 
to Murchard's ogreish metaphor.  There was nothing hectic in 
Frenham's efflorescence, and his old friend had not laid even a 
finger-tip on the sacred stupidities.  One wanted no better proof 
of that than the fact that Frenham still reverenced them in Culwin. 
</p><p>"There's a side of him you fellows don't see.  <hi rend="italic"> I</hi> believe 
that story about the duel!" he declared; and it was of the very 
essence of this belief that it should impel him&mdash;just as our little 
party was dispersing&mdash;to turn back to our host with the absurd 
demand: "And now you've got to tell us about <hi rend="italic"> your</hi> ghost!" 
</p><p>The outer door had closed on Murchard and the others; only 
Frenham and I remained; and the vigilant servant who presided over 
Culwin's destinies, having brought a fresh supply of soda-water, 
had been laconically ordered to bed. 
</p><p>Culwin's sociability was a night-blooming flower, and we knew 
that he expected the nucleus of his group to tighten around him 
after midnight.  But Frenham's appeal seemed to disconcert him 
comically, and he rose from the chair in which he had just reseated 
himself after his farewells in the hall. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">" My</hi> ghost?  Do you suppose I'm fool enough to go to the 
expense of keeping one of my own, when there are so many charming 
ones in my friends' closets?&mdash;Take another cigar," he said, 
revolving toward me with a laugh. 
</p><p>Frenham laughed too, pulling up his slender height before the 
chimney-piece as he turned to face his short bristling friend. 
</p><p>"Oh," he said, "you'd never be content to share if you met one 
you really liked." 
</p><p>Culwin had dropped back into his armchair, his shock head 
embedded in its habitual hollow, his little eyes glimmering over a 
fresh cigar. 
</p><p>"Liked&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> liked?</hi>  Good Lord!" he growled. 
</p><p>"Ah, you <hi rend="italic"> have</hi>, then!"  Frenham pounced on him in the same 
instant, with a sidewise glance of victory at me; but Culwin 
cowered gnomelike among his cushions, dissembling himself in a 
protective cloud of smoke. 
</p><p>"What's the use of denying it?  You've seen everything, so of 
course you've seen a ghost!" his young friend persisted, talking 
intrepidly into the cloud.  "Or, if you haven't seen one, it's only 
because you've seen two!" 
</p><p>The form of the challenge seemed to strike our host.  He shot 
his head out of the mist with a queer tortoise-like motion he 
sometimes had, and blinked approvingly at Frenham. 
</p><p>"Yes," he suddenly flung at us on a shrill jerk of laughter; 
"it's only because I've seen two!" 
</p><p>The words were so unexpected that they dropped down and down 
into a fathomless silence, while we continued to stare at each 
other over Culwin's head, and Culwin stared at his ghosts.  At 
length Frenham, without speaking, threw himself into the chair on 
the other side of the hearth, and leaned forward with his listening 
smile . . .

<p>"OH, of course they're not show ghosts&mdash;a collector wouldn't 
think anything of them . . .  Don't let me raise your hopes . . . 
their one merit is their numerical <pb n="673"/>  strength: the 
exceptional fact of their being <hi rend="italic">two</hi>.  But, as against this, I'm 
bound to admit that at any moment I could probably have exorcised 
them both by asking my doctor for a prescription, or my oculist for 
a pair of spectacles.  Only, as I never could make up my mind 
whether to go to the doctor or the oculist&mdash;whether I was afflicted 
by an optical or a digestive delusion&mdash;I left them to pursue their 
interesting double life, though at times they made mine exceedingly 
comfortable . . . 
</p><p>"Yes&mdash;uncomfortable; and you know how I hate to be 
uncomfortable!  But it was part of my stupid pride, when the thing 
began, not to admit that I could be disturbed by the trifling 
matter of seeing two&mdash; 
</p><p>"And then I'd no reason, really, to suppose I was ill.  As far 
as I knew I was simply bored&mdash;horribly bored.  But it was part of 
my boredom&mdash;I remember&mdash;that I was feeling so uncommonly well, and 
didn't know how on earth to work off my surplus energy.  I had come 
back from a long journey&mdash;down in South America and Mexico&mdash;and had 
settled down for the winter near New York, with an old aunt who had 
known Washington Irving and corresponded with N. P. Willis.  She 
lived, not far from Irvington, in a damp Gothic villa, overhung by 
Norway spruces, and looking exactly like a memorial emblem done in 
hair.  Her personal appearance was in keeping with this image, and 
her own hair&mdash;of which there was little left&mdash;might have been 
sacrificed to the manufacture of the emblem. 
</p><p>"I had just reached the end of an agitated year, with 
considerable arrears to make up in money and emotion; and 
theoretically it seemed as though my aunt's mild hospitality would 
be as beneficial to my nerves as to my purse.  But the deuce of it 
was that as soon as I felt myself safe and sheltered my energy 
began to revive; and how was I to work it off inside of a memorial 
emblem?  I had, at that time, the agreeable illusion that sustained 
intellectual effort could engage a man's whole activity; and I 
decided to write a great book&mdash;I forget about what.  My aunt, 
impressed by my plan, gave up to me her Gothic library, filled with 
classics in black cloth and daguerrotypes of faded celebrities; and 
I sat down at my desk to make myself a place among their number.  
And to facilitate my task she lent me a cousin to copy my 
manuscript. 
</p><p>"The cousin was a nice girl, and I had an idea that a nice 
girl was just what I needed to restore my faith in human nature, 
and principally in myself.  She was neither beautiful nor 
intelligent&mdash;poor Alice Nowell!&mdash;but it interested me to see any 
woman content to be so uninteresting, and I wanted to find out the 
secret of her content.  In doing this I handled it rather rashly, 
and put it out of joint&mdash;oh, just for a moment!  There's no fatuity 
in telling you this, for the poor girl had never seen any one but 
cousins . . . 
</p><p>"Well, I was sorry for what I'd done, of course, and 
confoundedly bothered as to how I should put it straight.  She was 
staying in the house, and one evening, after my aunt had gone to 
bed, she came down to the library to fetch a book she'd mislaid, 
like any artless heroine on the shelves behind us.  She was pink-nosed and flustered, and it suddenly occurred to me that her hair, 
though it was fairly thick and pretty, would look exactly like my 
aunt's when she grew older.  I was glad I had noticed this, for it 
made it easier for me to do what was right; and when I had found 
the book she hadn't lost I told her I was leaving for Europe that 
week. 
</p><p>"Europe was terribly far off in those days, and Alice knew at 
once what I meant.  She didn't take it in the least as I'd 
expected&mdash;it would have been easier if she had.  She held her book 
very tight, and turned away a moment to wind up the lamp on my 
desk&mdash;it had a ground glass shade with vine leaves, and glass drops 
around the edge, I remember.  Then she came back, held out her 
hand, and said: 'Good-bye.'  And as she said it she looked straight 
at me and kissed me.  I had never felt anything as fresh and shy 
and brave as her kiss.  It was worse than any reproach, and it made 
me ashamed to deserve a reproach from her.  I said to myself: 'I'll 
marry her, and when my aunt dies she'll leave us this house, and 
I'll sit here at the desk and go on with my book; and Alice will 
sit over there with her embroidery and look at me as she's looking 
now.  And life will go on like that for any number of years.'  The 
prospect frightened me a little, but at the time it didn't frighten 
<pb n="674"/>  me as much as doing anything to hurt her; and ten minutes 
later she had my seal ring on my finger, and my promise that when 
I went abroad she should go with me. 
</p><p>"You'll wonder why I'm enlarging on this familiar incident.  
It's because the evening on which it took place was the very 
evening on which I first saw the queer sight I've spoken of.  Being 
at that time an ardent believer in a necessary sequence between 
cause and effect I naturally tried to trace some kind of link 
between what had just happened to me in my aunt's library, and what 
was to happen a few hours later on the same night; and so the 
coincidence between the two events always remained in my mind. 
</p><p>"I went up to bed with rather a heavy heart, for I was bowed 
under the weight of the first good action I had ever consciously 
committed; and young as I was, I saw the gravity of my situation.  
Don't imagine from this that I had hitherto been an instrument of 
destruction.  I had been merely a harmless young man, who had 
followed his bent and declined all collaboration with Providence.  
Now I had suddenly undertaken to promote the moral order of the 
world, and I felt a good deal like the trustful spectator who has 
given his gold watch to the conjurer, and doesn't know in what 
shape he'll get it back when the trick is over . . .  Still, a glow 
of self-righteousness tempered my fears, and I said to myself as I 
undressed that when I'd got used to being good it probably wouldn't 
make me as nervous as it did at the start.  And by the time I was 
in bed, and had blown out my candle, I felt that I really <hi rend="italic">was</hi> 
getting used to it, and that, as far as I'd got, it was not unlike 
sinking down into one of my aunt's very softest wool mattresses. 
</p><p>"I closed my eyes on this image, and when I opened them it 
must have been a good deal later, for my room had grown cold, and 
the night was intensely still.  I was waked suddenly by the feeling 
we all know&mdash;the feeling that there was something near me that 
hadn't been there when I fell asleep.  I sat up and strained my 
eyes into the darkness.  The room was pitch black, and at first I 
saw nothing; but gradually a vague glimmer at the foot of the bed 
turned into two eyes staring back at me.  I couldn't see the face 
attached to them&mdash;on account of the darkness, I imagined&mdash;but as I 
looked the eyes grew more and more distinct: they gave out a light 
of their own. 
</p><p>"The sensation of being thus gazed at was far from pleasant, 
and you might suppose that my first impulse would have been to jump 
out of bed and hurl myself on the invisible figure attached to the 
eyes.  But it wasn't&mdash;my impulse was simply to lie still . . . I 
can't say whether this was due to an immediate sense of the uncanny 
nature of the apparition&mdash;to the certainty that if I did jump out 
of bed I should hurl myself on nothing&mdash;or merely to the benumbing 
effect of the eyes themselves.  They were the very worst eyes I've 
ever seen: a man's eyes&mdash;but what a man!  My first thought was that 
he must be frightfully old.  The orbits were sunk, and the thick 
red-lined lids hung over the eyeballs like blinds of which the 
cords are broken.  One lid drooped a little lower than the other, 
with the effect of a crooked leer; and between these pulpy folds of 
flesh, with their scant bristle of lashes, the eyes themselves, 
small glassy disks with an agate-like rim about the pupils, looked 
like sea-pebbles in the grip of a starfish. 
</p><p>"But the age of the eyes was not the most unpleasant thing 
about them.  What turned me sick was their expression of vicious 
security.  I don't know how else to describe the fact that they 
seemed to belong to a man who had done a lot of harm in his life, 
but had always kept just inside the danger lines.  They were not 
the eyes of a coward, but of some one much too clever to take 
risks; and my gorge rose at their look of base astuteness.  Yet 
even that wasn't the worst; for as we continued to scan each other 
I saw in them a tinge of faint derision, and felt myself to be its 
object. 
</p><p>"At that I was seized by an impulse of rage that jerked me out 
of bed and pitched me straight on the unseen figure at its foot.  
But of course there wasn't any figure there, and my fists struck at 
emptiness.  Ashamed and cold, I groped about for a match and lit 
the candles.  The room looked just as usual&mdash;as I had known it 
would; and I crawled back to bed, and blew out the lights. 
</p><p>"As soon as the room was dark again the eyes reappeared; and 
I now applied myself to explaining them on scientific principles.  
At first I thought the illusion might <pb n="675"/>  have been caused by 
the glow of the last embers in the chimney; but the fire-place was 
on the other side of my bed, and so placed that the fire could not 
possibly be reflected in my toilet glass, which was the only mirror 
in the room.  Then it occurred to me that I might have been tricked 
by the reflection of the embers in some polished bit of wood or 
metal; and though I couldn't discover any object of the sort in my 
line of vision, I got up again, groped my way to the hearth, and 
covered what was left of the fire.  But as soon as I was back in 
bed the eyes were back at its foot. 
</p><p>"They were an hallucination, then: that was plain.  But the 
fact that they were not due to any external dupery didn't make them 
a bit pleasanter to see.  For if they were a projection of my inner 
consciousness, what the deuce was the matter with that organ?  I 
had gone deeply enough into the mystery of morbid pathological 
states to picture the conditions under which an exploring mind 
might lay itself open to such a midnight admonition; but I couldn't 
fit it to my present case.  I had never felt more normal, mentally 
and physically; and the only unusual fact in my situation&mdash;that of 
having assured the happiness of an amiable girl&mdash;did not seem of a 
kind to summon unclean spirits about my pillow.  But there were the 
eyes still looking at me . . . 
</p><p>"I shut mine, and tried to evoke a vision of Alice Nowell's.  
They were not remarkable eyes, but they were as wholesome as fresh 
water, and if she had had more imagination&mdash;or longer lashes&mdash;their 
expression might have been interesting.  As it was, they did not 
prove very efficacious, and in a few moments I perceived that they 
had mysteriously changed into the eyes at the foot of the bed.  It 
exasperated me more to feel these glaring at me through my shut 
lids than to see them, and I opened my eyes again and looked 
straight into their hateful stare . . . 
</p><p>"And so it went on all night.  I can't tell you what that 
night was, nor how long it lasted.  Have you ever lain in bed, 
hopelessly wide awake, and tried to keep your eyes shut, knowing 
that if you opened 'em you'd see something you dreaded and loathed?  
It sounds easy, but it's devilish hard.  Those eyes hung there and 
drew me.  I had the <hi rend="italic"> vertige de l'abime</hi>, and their red lids were 
the edge of my abyss. . . .  I had known nervous hours before: 
hours when I'd felt the wind of danger in my neck; but never this 
kind of strain.  It wasn't that the eyes were so awful; they hadn't 
the majesty of the powers of darkness.  But they had&mdash;how shall I 
say?&mdash;a physical effect that was the equivalent of a bad smell: 
their look left a smear like a snail's.  And I didn't see what 
business they had with me, anyhow&mdash;and I stared and stared, trying 
to find out . . . 
</p><p>"I don't know what effect they were trying to produce; but the 
effect they <hi rend="italic"> did</hi> produce was that of making me pack my 
portmanteau and bolt to town early the next morning.  I left a note 
for my aunt, explaining that I was ill and had gone to see my 
doctor; and as a matter of fact I did feel uncommonly ill&mdash;the 
night seemed to have pumped all the blood out of me.  But when I 
reached town I didn't go to the doctor's.  I went to a friend's 
rooms, and threw myself on a bed, and slept for ten heavenly hours.  
When I woke it was the middle of the night, and I turned cold at 
the thought of what might be waiting for me.  I sat up, shaking, 
and stared into the darkness; but there wasn't a break in its 
blessed surface, and when I saw that the eyes were not there I 
dropped back into another long sleep. 
</p><p>"I had left no word for Alice when I fled, because I meant to 
go back the next morning.  But the next morning I was too exhausted 
to stir.  As the day went on the exhaustion increased, instead of 
wearing off like the lassitude left by an ordinary night of 
insomnia: the effect of the eyes seemed to be cumulative, and the 
thought of seeing them again grew intolerable.  For two days I 
struggled with my dread; but on the third evening I pulled myself 
together and decided to go back the next morning.  I felt a good 
deal happier as soon as I'd decided, for I knew that my abrupt 
disappearance, and the strangeness of my not writing, must have 
been very painful for poor Alice.  That night I went to bed with an 
easy mind, and fell asleep at once; but in the middle of the night 
I woke, and there were the eyes . . . 
</p><p>"Well, I simply couldn't face them; and instead of going back 
to my aunt's I bundled a few things into a trunk and jumped onto 
the first steamer for England.  I was <pb n="676"/>  so dead tired when I 
got on board that I crawled straight into my berth, and slept most 
of the way over; and I can't tell you the bliss it was to wake from 
those long stretches of dreamless sleep and look fearlessly into 
the darkness, <hi rend="italic"> knowing</hi> that I shouldn't see the eyes . . . 
</p><p>"I stayed abroad for a year, and then I stayed for another; 
and during that time I never had a glimpse of them.  That was 
enough reason for prolonging my stay if I'd been on a desert 
island.  Another was, of course, that I had perfectly come to see, 
on the voyage over, the folly, complete impossibility, of my 
marrying Alice Nowell.  The fact that I had been so slow in making 
this discovery annoyed me, and made me want to avoid explanations.  
The bliss of escaping at one stroke from the eyes, and from this 
other embarrassment, gave my freedom an extraordinary zest; and the 
longer I savoured it the better I liked its taste. 
</p><p>"The eyes had burned such a hole in my consciousness that for 
a long time I went on puzzling over the nature of the apparition, 
and wondering nervously if it would ever come back.  But as time 
passed I lost this dread, and retained only the precision of the 
image.  Then that faded in its turn. 
</p><p>"The second year found me settled in Rome, where I was 
planning, I believe, to write another great book&mdash;a definitive work 
on Etruscan influences in Italian art.  At any rate, I'd found some 
pretext of the kind for taking a sunny apartment in the Piazza di 
Spagna and dabbling about indefinitely in the Forum; and there, one 
morning, a charming youth came to me.  As he stood there in the 
warm light, slender and smooth and hyacinthine, he might have 
stepped from a ruined altar&mdash;one to Antinous, say&mdash;but he'd come 
instead from New York, with a letter (of all people) from Alice 
Nowell.  The letter&mdash;the first I'd had from her since our break&mdash; 
was simply a line introducing her young cousin, Gilbert Noyes, and 
appealing to me to befriend him.  It appeared, poor lad, that he 
'had talent,' and 'wanted to write'; and, an obdurate family having 
insisted that his calligraphy should take the form of double entry, 
Alice had intervened to win him six months' respite, during which 
he was to travel on a meagre pittance, and somehow prove his 
ultimate ability to increase it by his pen.  The quaint conditions 
of the test struck me first: it seemed about as conclusive as a 
mediaeval 'ordeal.'  Then I was touched by her having sent him to 
me.  I had always wanted to do her some service, to justify myself 
in my own eyes rather than hers; and here was a beautiful 
embodiment of my chance. 
</p><p>"Well, I imagine it's safe to lay down the general principle 
that predestined geniuses don't, as a rule, appear before one in 
the spring sunshine of the Forum looking like one of its banished 
gods.  At any rate, poor Noyes wasn't a predestined genius.  But he 
<hi rend="italic"> was</hi> beautiful to see, and charming as a comrade too.  It was 
only when he began to talk literature that my heart failed me.  I 
knew all the symptoms so well&mdash;the things he had 'in him,' and the 
things outside him that impinged!  There's the real test, after 
all.  It was always&mdash;punctually, inevitably, with the 
inexorableness of a mechanical law&mdash;it was <hi rend="italic"> always</hi> the wrong 
thing that struck him.  I grew to find a certain grim fascination 
in deciding in advance exactly which wrong thing he'd select; and 
I acquired an astonishing skill at the game . . . 
</p><p>"The worst of it was that his <hi rend="italic"> betise</hi> wasn't of the too 
obvious sort.  Ladies who met him at picnics thought him 
intellectual; and even at dinners he passed for clever.  I, who had 
him under the microscope, fancied now and then that he might 
develop some kind of a slim talent, something that he could make 
'do' and be happy on; and wasn't that, after all, what I was 
concerned with?  He was so charming&mdash;he continued to be so 
charming&mdash;that he called forth all my charity in support of this 
argument; and for the first few months I really believed there was 
a chance for him . . . 
</p><p>"Those months were delightful.  Noyes was constantly with me, 
and the more I saw of him the better I liked him.  His stupidity 
was a natural grace&mdash;it was as beautiful, really, as his eye-lashes.  And he was so gay, so affectionate, and so happy with me, 
that telling him the truth would have been about as pleasant as 
slitting the throat of some artless animal.  At first I used to 
wonder what had put into that radiant head the detestable delusion 
that it held a brain.  Then I began to see that it was simply 
protective mimicry&mdash;an instinctive ruse to get away from family 
life <pb n="677"/>  and an office desk.  Not that Gilbert didn't&mdash;dear 
lad!&mdash;believe in himself.  There wasn't a trace of hypocrisy in his 
composition.  He was sure that his 'call' was irresistible, while 
to me it was the saving grace of his situation that it <hi rend="italic"> wasn't</hi>, 
and that a little money, a little leisure, a little pleasure would 
have turned him into an inoffensive idler.  Unluckily, however, 
there was no hope of money, and with the grim alternative of the 
office desk before him he couldn't postpone his attempt at 
literature.  The stuff he turned out was deplorable, and I see now 
that I knew it from the first.  Still, the absurdity of deciding a 
man's whole future on a first trial seemed to justify me in 
withholding my verdict, and perhaps even in encouraging him a 
little, on the ground that the human plant generally needs warmth 
to flower. 
</p><p>"At any rate, I proceeded on that principle, and carried it to 
the point of getting his term of probation extended.  When I left 
Rome he went with me, and we idled away a delicious summer between 
Capri and Venice.  I said to myself: 'If he has anything in him, it 
will come out now; and it <hi rend="italic"> did</hi>.  He was never more enchanting 
and enchanted.  There were moments of our pilgrimage when beauty 
born of murmuring sound seemed actually to pass into his face&mdash;but 
only to issue forth in a shallow flood of the palest ink . . . 
</p><p>"Well the time came to turn off the tap; and I knew there was 
no hand but mine to do it.  We were back in Rome, and I had taken 
him to stay with me, not wanting him to be alone in his dismal <hi rend="italic">
pension</hi> when he had to face the necessity of renouncing his 
ambition.  I hadn't, of course, relied solely on my own judgment in 
deciding to advise him to drop literature.  I had sent his stuff to 
various people&mdash;editors and critics&mdash;and they had always sent it 
back with the same chilling lack of comment.  Really there was 
nothing on earth to say about it&mdash; 
</p><p>"I confess I never felt more shabbily than I did on the day 
when I decided to have it out with Gilbert.  It was well enough to 
tell myself that it was my duty to knock the poor boy's hopes into 
splinters&mdash;but I'd like to know what act of gratuitous cruelty 
hasn't been justified on that plea?  I've always shrunk from 
usurping the functions of Providence, and when I have to exercise 
them I decidedly prefer that it shouldn't be on an errand of 
destruction.  Besides, in the last issue, who was I to decide, even 
after a year's trial, if poor Gilbert had it in him or not? 
</p><p>"The more I looked at the part I'd resolved to play, the less 
I liked it; and I liked it still less when Gilbert sat opposite me, 
with his head thrown back in the lamplight, just as Phil's is now 
. . . I'd been going over his last manuscript, and he knew it, and 
he knew that his future hung on my verdict&mdash;we'd tacitly agreed to 
that.  The manuscript lay between us, on my table&mdash;a novel, his 
first novel, if you please!&mdash;and he reached over and laid his hand 
on it, and looked up at me with all his life in the look. 
</p><p>"I stood up and cleared my throat, trying to keep my eyes away 
from his face and on the manuscript. 
</p><p>"'The fact is, my dear Gilbert,' I began&mdash; 
</p><p>"I saw him turn pale, but he was up and facing me in an 
instant. 
</p><p>"'Oh, look here, don't take on so, my dear fellow!  I'm not so 
awfully cut up as all that!'  His hands were on my shoulders, and 
he was laughing down on me from his full height, with a kind of 
mortally-stricken gaiety that drove the knife into my side. 
</p><p>"He was too beautifully brave for me to keep up any humbug 
about my duty.  And it came over me suddenly how I should hurt 
others in hurting him: myself first, since sending him home meant 
losing him; but more particularly poor Alice Nowell, to whom I had 
so uneasily longed to prove my good faith and my immense desire to 
serve her.  It really seemed like failing her twice to fail 
Gilbert&mdash; 
</p><p>"But my intuition was like one of those lightning flashes that 
encircle the whole horizon, and in the same instant I saw what I 
might be letting myself in for if I didn't tell the truth.  I said 
to myself: 'I shall have him for life'&mdash;and I'd never yet seen any 
one, man or woman, whom I was quite sure of wanting on those terms.  
Well, this impulse of egotism decided me.  I was ashamed of it, and 
to get away from it I took a leap that landed me straight in 
Gilbert's arms. 
</p><p>"'The thing's all right, and you're all wrong!' I shouted up 
at him; and as he hugged me, and I laughed and shook in his 
incredulous clutch, I had for a minute <pb n="678"/>  the sense of self-complacency that is supposed to attend the footsteps of the just.  
Hang it all, making people happy <hi rend="italic"> has</hi> its charms&mdash; 
</p><p>"Gilbert, of course, was for celebrating his emancipation in 
some spectacular manner; but I sent him away alone to explode his 
emotions, and went to bed to sleep off mine.  As I undressed I 
began to wonder what their after-taste would be&mdash;so many of the 
finest don't keep!  Still, I wasn't sorry, and I meant to empty the 
bottle, even if it <hi rend="italic"> did</hi> turn a trifle flat. 
</p><p>"After I got into bed I lay for a long time smiling at the 
memory of his eyes&mdash;his blissful eyes. . .  Then I fell asleep, and 
when I woke the room was deathly cold, and I sat up with a jerk&mdash; 
and there were <hi rend="italic"> the other eyes</hi> . . . 
</p><p>"It was three years since I'd seen them, but I'd thought of 
them so often that I fancied they could never take me unawares 
again.  Now, with their red sneer on me, I knew that I had never 
really believed they would come back, and that I was as defenceless 
as ever against them . . .  As before, it was the insane 
irrelevance of their coming that made it so horrible.  What the 
deuce were they after, to leap out at me at such a time?  I had 
lived more or less carelessly in the years since I'd seen them, 
though my worst indiscretions were not dark enough to invite the 
searchings of their infernal glare; but at this particular moment 
I was really in what might have been called a state of grace; and 
I can't tell you how the fact added to their horror . . . 
</p><p>"But it's not enough to say they were as bad as before: they 
were worse.  Worse by just so much as I'd learned of life in the 
interval; by all the damnable implications my wider experience read 
into them.  I saw now what I hadn't seen before: that they were 
eyes which had grown hideous gradually, which had built up their 
baseness coral-wise, bit by bit, out of a series of small 
turpitudes slowly accumulated through the industrious years.  Yes&mdash; 
it came to me that what made them so bad was that they'd grown bad 
so slowly . . . 
</p><p>"There they hung in the darkness, their swollen lids dropped 
across the little watery bulbs rolling loose in the orbits, and the 
puff of fat flesh making a muddy shadow underneath&mdash;and as their 
filmy stare moved with my movements, there came over me a sense of 
their tacit complicity, of a deep hidden understanding between us 
that was worse than the first shock of their strangeness.  Not that 
I understood them; but that they made it so clear that some day I 
should . . .  Yes, that was the worst part of it, decidedly; and it 
was the feeling that became stronger each time they came back to me 
. . . 
</p><p>"For they got into the damnable habit of coming back.  They 
reminded me of vampires with a taste for young flesh, they seemed 
so to gloat over the taste of a good conscience.  Every night for 
a month they came to claim their morsel of mine: since I'd made 
Gilbert happy they simply wouldn't loosen their fangs.  The 
coincidence almost made me hate him, poor lad, fortuitous as I felt 
it to be.  I puzzled over it a good deal, but couldn't find any 
hint of an explanation except in the chance of his association with 
Alice Nowell.  But then the eyes had let up on me the moment I had 
abandoned her, so they could hardly be the emissaries of a woman 
scorned, even if one could have pictured poor Alice charging such 
spirits to avenge her.  That set me thinking, and I began to wonder 
if they would let up on me if I abandoned Gilbert.  The temptation 
was insidious, and I had to stiffen myself against it; but really, 
dear boy! he was too charming to be sacrificed to such demons.  And 
so, after all, I never found out what they wanted . . ."

<p>THE fire crumbled, sending up a flash which threw into relief 
the narrator's gnarled red face under its grey-black stubble.  
Pressed into the hollow of the dark leather armchair, it stood out 
an instant like an intaglio of yellowish red-veined stone, with 
spots of enamel for the eyes; then the fire sank and in the shaded 
lamp-light it became once more a dim Rembrandtish blur. 
</p><p>Phil Frenham, sitting in a low chair on the opposite side of 
the hearth, one long arm propped on the table behind him, one hand 
supporting his thrown-back head, and his eyes steadily fixed on his 
old friend's face, had not moved since the tale began.  He 
continued to maintain his silent immobility after Culwin had ceased 
to speak, and it was I who, with a vague sense of<pb n="679"/> 
disappointment at the sudden drop of the story, finally asked: 
"But how long did you keep on seeing them?" 
</p><p>Culwin, so sunk into his chair that he seemed like a heap of 
his own empty clothes, stirred a little, as if in surprise at my 
question.  He appeared to have half-forgotten what he had been 
telling us. 
</p><p>"How long?  Oh, off and on all that winter.  It was infernal.  
I never got used to them.  I grew really ill." 
</p><p>Frenham shifted his attitude silently, and as he did so his 
elbow struck against a small mirror in a bronze frame standing on 
the table behind him.  He turned and changed its angle slightly; 
then he resumed his former attitude, his dark head thrown back on 
his lifted palm, his eyes intent on Culwin's face.  Something in 
his stare embarrassed me, and as if to divert attention from it I 
pressed on with another question: 
</p><p>"And you never tried sacrificing Noyes?" 
</p><p>"Oh, no.  The fact is I didn't have to.  He did it for me, 
poor infatuated boy!" 
</p><p>"Did it for you?  How do you mean?" 
</p><p>"He wore me out&mdash;wore everybody out.  He kept on pouring out 
his lamentable twaddle, and hawking it up and down the place till 
he became a thing of terror.  I tried to wean him from writing&mdash;oh, 
ever so gently, you understand, by throwing him with agreeable 
people, giving him a chance to make himself felt, to come to a 
sense of what he <hi rend="italic"> really</hi> had to give.  I'd foreseen this 
solution from the beginning&mdash;felt sure that, once the first ardour 
of authorship was quenched, he'd drop into his place as a charming 
parasitic thing, the kind of chronic Cherubino for whom, in old 
societies, there's always a seat at table, and a shelter behind the 
ladies' skirts.  I saw him take his place as 'the poet': the poet 
who doesn't write.  One knows the type in every drawing-room.  
Living in that way doesn't cost much&mdash;I'd worked it all out in my 
mind, and felt sure that, with a little help, he could manage it 
for the next few years; and meanwhile he'd be sure to marry.  I saw 
him married to a widow, rather older, with a good cook and a well-run house.  And I actually had my eye on the widow . . .  Meanwhile 
I did everything to facilitate the transition&mdash;lent him money to 
ease his conscience, introduced him to pretty women to make him 
forget his vows.  But nothing would do him: he had but one idea in 
his beautiful obstinate head.  He wanted the laurel and not the 
rose, and he kept on repeating Gautier's axiom, and battering and 
filing at his limp prose till he'd spread it out over Lord knows 
how many thousand sloppy pages.  Now and then he would send a 
pailful to a publisher, and of course it would always come back. 
</p><p>"At first it didn't matter&mdash;he thought he was 'misunderstood.'  
He took the attitudes of genius, and whenever an opus came home he 
wrote another to keep it company.  Then he had a reaction of 
despair, and accused me of deceiving him, and Lord knows what.  I 
got angry at that, and told him it was he who had deceived himself.  
He'd come to me determined to write, and I'd done my best to help 
him.  That was the extent of my offence, and I'd done it for his 
cousin's sake, not his. 
</p><p>"That seemed to strike home, and he didn't answer for a 
minute.  Then he said: 'My time's up and my money's up.  What do 
you think I'd better do?' 
</p><p>"'I think you'd better not be an ass,' I said. 
</p><p>"He turned red, and asked: 'What do you mean by being an ass?' 
</p><p>"I took a letter from my desk and held it out to him. 
</p><p>"'I mean refusing this offer of Mrs. Ellinger's: to be her 
secretary at a salary of five thousand dollars.  There may be a lot 
more in it than that.' 
</p><p>"He flung out his hand with a violence that struck the letter 
from mine.  'Oh, I know well enough what's in it!' he said, scarlet 
to the roots of his hair. 
</p><p>"'And what's your answer, if you know?' I asked. 
</p><p>"He made none at the minute, but turned away slowly to the 
door.  There, with his hand on the threshold, he stopped to ask, 
almost under his breath: 'Then you really think my stuff's no 
good?' 
</p><p>"I was tired and exasperated, and I laughed.  I don't defend 
my laugh&mdash;it was in wretched taste.  But I must plead in 
extenuation that the boy was a fool, and that I'd done my best for 
him&mdash;I really had. 
</p><p>"He went out of the room, shutting the door quietly after him.  
That afternoon I left for Frascati, where I'd promised to spend the 
Sunday with some friends.  I was glad to escape from Gilbert, and 
by the same token, as I learned that night, I had <pb n="680"/>  also 
escaped from the eyes.  I dropped into the same lethargic sleep 
that had come to me before when their visitations ceased; and when 
I woke the next morning, in my peaceful painted room above the 
ilexes, I felt the utter weariness and deep relief that always 
followed on that repairing slumber.  I put in two blessed nights at 
Frascati, and when I got back to my rooms in Rome I found that 
Gilbert had gone . . .  Oh, nothing tragic had happened&mdash;the 
episode never rose to <hi rend="italic"> that</hi>.  He'd simply packed his manuscripts 
and left for America&mdash;for his family and the Wall Street desk.  He 
left a decent little note to tell me of his decision, and behaved 
altogether, in the circumstances, as little like a fool as it's 
possible for a fool to behave . . ."

<p>CULWIN paused again, and again Frenham sat motionless, the 
dusky contour of his young head reflected in the mirror at his 
back. 
</p><p>"And what became of Noyes afterward?" I finally asked, still 
disquieted by a sense of incompleteness, by the need of some 
connecting thread between the parallel lines of the tale. 
</p><p>Culwin twitched his shoulders.  "Oh, nothing became of him&mdash; 
because he became nothing.  There could be no question of 
'becoming' about it.  He vegetated in an office, I believe, and 
finally got a clerkship in a consulate, and married drearily in 
China.  I saw him once in Hong Kong, years afterward.  He was fat 
and hadn't shaved.  I was told he drank.  He didn't recognize me." 
</p><p>"And the eyes?" I asked, after another pause which Frenham's 
continued silence made oppressive. 
</p><p>Culwin, stroking his chin, blinked at me meditatively through 
the shadows.  "I never saw them after my last talk with Gilbert.  
Put two and two together if you can.  For my part, I haven't found 
the link." 
</p><p>He rose stiffly, his hands in his pockets, and walked over to 
the table on which reviving drinks had been set out. 
</p><p>"You must be parched after this dry tale.  Here, help 
yourself, my dear fellow.  Here, Phil&mdash;"  He turned back to the 
hearth. 
</p><p>Frenham still sat in his low chair, making no response to his 
host's hospitable summons.  But as Culwin advanced toward him, 
their eyes met in a long look; after which, to my intense surprise, 
the young man, turning suddenly in his seat, flung his arms across 
the table, and dropped his face upon them. 
</p><p>Culwin, at the unexpected gesture, stopped short, a flush on 
his face. 
</p><p>"Phil&mdash;what the deuce?  Why, have the eyes scared <hi rend="italic"> you?</hi>  My 
dear boy&mdash;my dear fellow&mdash;I never had such a tribute to my literary 
ability, never!" 
</p><p>He broke into a chuckle at the thought, and halted on the 
hearth-rug, his hands still in his pockets, gazing down in honest 
perplexity at the youth's bowed head.  Then, as Frenham still made 
no answer, he moved a step or two nearer. 
</p><p>"Cheer up, my dear Phil!  It's years since I've seen them&mdash; 
apparently I've done nothing lately bad enough to call them out of 
chaos.  Unless my present evocation of them has made <hi rend="italic"> you</hi> see 
them; which would be their worst stroke yet!" 
</p><p>His bantering appeal quivered off into an uneasy laugh, and he 
moved still nearer, bending over Frenham, and laying his gouty 
hands on the lad's shoulders. 
</p><p>"Phil, my dear boy, really&mdash;what's the matter?  Why don't you 
answer?  <hi rend="italic"> Have</hi> you seen the eyes?" 
</p><p>Frenham's face was still pressed against his arms, and from 
where I stood behind Culwin I saw the latter, as if under the 
rebuff of this unaccountable attitude, draw back slowly from his 
friend.  As he did so, the light of the lamp on the table fell full 
on his perplexed congested face, and I caught its sudden reflection 
in the mirror behind Frenham's head. 
</p><p>Culwin saw the reflection also.  He paused, his face level 
with the mirror, as if scarcely recognizing the countenance in it 
as his own.  But as he looked his expression gradually changed, and 
for an appreciable space of time he and the image in the glass 
confronted each other with a glare of slowly gathering hate.  Then 
Culwin let go of Frenham's shoulders, and drew back a step, 
covering his eyes with his hands . . . 
</p><p>Frenham, his face still hidden, did not stir.
