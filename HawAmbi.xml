<head>THE AMBITIOUS GUEST</head>

<p>ONE September night a family had gathered round their hearth, and
piled it high with the driftwood of mountain streams, the dry cones of
the pine, and the splintered ruins of great trees that had come
crashing down the precipice. Up the chimney roared the fire, and
brightened the room with its broad blaze. The faces of the father and
mother had a sober gladness; the children laughed; the eldest daughter
was the image of Happiness at seventeen; and the aged grandmother, who
sat knitting in the warmest place, was the image of Happiness grown
old. They had found the ``herb, heart's-ease,'' in the bleakest spot
of all New England. This family were situated in the Notch of the
White Hills, where the wind was sharp throughout the year, and
pitilessly cold in the winter,&mdash;giving their cottage all its fresh
inclemency before it descended on the valley of the Saco.  They dwelt
in a cold spot and a dangerous one; for a mountain towered above their
heads, so steep, that the stones would often rumble down its sides and
startle them at midnight.

</p><p>The daughter had just uttered some simple jest that filled them
all with mirth, when the wind came through the Notch and seemed to
pause before their cottage&mdash;rattling the door, with a sound of wailing
and lamentation, before it passed into the valley. For a moment it
saddened them, though there was nothing unusual in the tones. But the
family were glad again when they perceived that the latch was lifted
by some traveller, whose footsteps had been unheard amid the dreary
blast which heralded his approach, and wailed as he was entering, and
went moaning away from the door.

</p><p>Though they dwelt in such a solitude, these people held daily
converse with the world. The romantic pass of the Notch is a great
artery, through which the life-blood of internal commerce is
continually throbbing between Maine, on one side, and the Green
Mountains and the shores of the St. Lawrence, on the other. The
stage-coach always drew up before the door of the cottage. The
wayfarer, with no companion but his staff, paused here to exchange a
word, that the sense of loneliness might not utterly overcome him ere
he could pass through the cleft of the mountain, or reach the first
house in the valley. And here the teamster, on his way to Portland
market, would put up for the night; and, if a bachelor, might sit an
hour beyond the usual bedtime, and steal a kiss from the mountain maid
at parting. It was one of those primitive taverns where the traveller
pays only for food and lodging, but meets with a homely kindness beyond

   <pb n="991"/>

all price. When the footsteps were heard, therefore, between the outer
door and the inner one, the whole family rose up, grandmother, children
and all, as if about to welcome some one who belonged to them, and
whose fate was linked with theirs.

</p><p>The door was opened by a young man. His face at first wore the
melancholy expression, almost despondency, of one who travels a wild
and bleak road, at nightfall and alone, but soon brightened up when he
saw the kindly warmth of his reception. He felt his heart spring
forward to meet them all, from the old woman, who wiped a chair with
her apron, to the little child that held out its arms to him. One
glance and smile placed the stranger on a footing of innocent
familiarity with the eldest daughter.

</p><p>``Ah, this fire is the right thing!'' cried he; ``especially
when there is such a pleasant circle round it. I am quite benumbed;
for the Notch is just like the pipe of a great pair of bellows; it has
blown a terrible blast in my face all the way from Bartlett.''

</p><p>``Then you are going towards Vermont?'' said the master of the
house, as he helped to take a light knapsack off the young man's
shoulders.

</p><p>``Yes; to Burlington, and far enough beyond,'' replied he.  ``I
meant to have been at Ethan Crawford's to-night; but a pedestrian
lingers along such a road as this. It is no matter; for, when I saw
this good fire, and all your cheerful faces, I felt as if you had
kindled it on purpose for me, and were waiting my arrival. So I shall
sit down among you, and make myself at home.''

</p><p>The frank-hearted stranger had just drawn his chair to the fire
when something like a heavy footstep was heard without, rushing down
the steep side of the mountain, as with long and rapid strides, and
taking such a leap in passing the cottage as to strike the opposite
precipice.  The family held their breath, because they knew the sound,
and their guest held his by instinct.

</p><p>``The old mountain has thrown a stone at us, for fear we should
forget him,'' said the landlord, recovering himself. ``He sometimes
nods his head and threatens to come down; but we are old neighbors,
and agree together pretty well upon the whole. Besides we have a sure
place of refuge hard by if he should be coming in good earnest.''

</p><p>Let us now suppose the stranger to have finished his supper of
bear's meat; and, by his natural felicity of manner, to have placed
himself on a footing of kindness with the whole family, so that they
talked as freely together as if he belonged to their mountain brood.
He was of a proud, yet gentle spirit&mdash;haughty and reserved among the
rich and great; but ever ready to stoop his head to the lowly cottage
door, and be like a brother or a son at the poor man's fireside. In
the household of the Notch he found warmth and simplicity of feeling,
the pervading intelligence of New England, and a poetry of native
growth, which they had gathered when they little thought of it from
the mountain peaks and chasms, and at the very threshold of their
romantic and dangerous abode. He had travelled far and alone; his
whole life, indeed, had been a solitary path; for, with the lofty
caution of his nature, he had kept himself apart from those who

   <pb n="992"/>

might otherwise have been his companions. The family, too, though so
kind and hospitable, had that consciousness of unity among themselves,
and separation from the world at large, which, in every domestic
circle, should still keep a holy place where no stranger may intrude.
But this evening a prophetic sympathy impelled the refined and educated
youth to pour out his heart before the simple mountaineers, and
constrained them to answer him with the same free confidence. And thus
it should have been. Is not the kindred of a common fate a closer tie
than that of birth?

</p><p>The secret of the young man's character was a high and
abstracted ambition. He could have borne to live an undistinguished
life, but not to be forgotten in the grave. Yearning desire had been
transformed to hope; and hope, long cherished, had become like
certainty, that, obscurely as he journeyed now, a glory was to beam on
all his pathway,&mdash;though not, perhaps, while he was treading it. But
when posterity should gaze back into the gloom of what was now the
present, they would trace the brightness of his footsteps, brightening
as meaner glories faded, and confess that a gifted one had passed from
his cradle to his tomb with none to recognize him.

</p><p>``As yet,'' cried the stranger&mdash;his cheek glowing and his eye
flashing with enthusiasm&mdash;``as yet, I have done nothing. Were I to
vanish from the earth to-morrow, none would know so much of me as you:
that a nameless youth came up at nightfall from the valley of the Saco,
and opened his heart to you in the evening, and passed through the
Notch by sunrise, and was seen no more. Not a soul would ask, `Who was
he?  Whither did the wanderer go?' But I cannot die till I have
achieved my destiny. Then, let Death come! I shall have built my
monument!''

</p><p>There was a continual flow of natural emotion, gushing forth
amid abstracted reverie, which enabled the family to understand this
young man's sentiments, though so foreign from their own. With quick
sensibility of the ludicrous, he blushed at the ardor into which he
had been betrayed.

</p><p>``You laugh at me,'' said he, taking the eldest daughter's
hand, and laughing himself. ``You think my ambition as nonsensical as
if I were to freeze myself to death on the top of Mount Washington,
only that people might spy at me from the country round about. And,
truly, that would be a noble pedestal for a man's statue!''

</p><p>``It is better to sit here by this fire,'' answered the girl,
blushing, ``and be comfortable and contented, though nobody thinks
about us.''

</p><p>``I suppose,'' said her father, after a fit of musing, ``there
is something natural in what the young man says; and if my mind had
been turned that way, I might have felt just the same. It is strange,
wife, how his talk has set my head running on things that are pretty
certain never to come to pass.''

</p><p>``Perhaps they may,'' observed the wife. ``Is the man thinking
what he will do when he is a widower?''

</p><p>``No, no!'' cried he, repelling the idea with reproachful
kindness.  ``When I think of your death, Esther, I think of mine, too.
But I was

   <pb n="993"/>

wishing we had a good farm in Bartlett, or Bethlehem, or Littleton, or
some other township round the White Mountains; but not where they
could tumble on our heads. I should want to stand well with my
neighbors and be called Squire, and sent to General Court for a term
or two; for a plain, honest man may do as much good there as a lawyer.
And when I should be grown quite an old man, and you an old woman, so
as not to be long apart, I might die happy enough in my bed, and leave
you all crying around me. A slate gravestone would suit me as well as a
marble one&mdash;with just my name and age, and a verse of a hymn, and
something to let people know that I lived an honest man and died a
Christian.''

</p><p>``There now!'' exclaimed the stranger; ``it is our nature to
desire a monument, be it slate or marble, or a pillar of granite, or a
glorious memory in the universal heart of man.''

</p><p>``We're in a strange way, to-night,'' said the wife, with tears
in her eyes. ``They say it's a sign of something, when folks' minds go
a wandering so. Hark to the children!''

</p><p>They listened accordingly. The younger children had been put to
bed in another room, but with an open door between, so that they could
be heard talking busily among themselves. One and all seemed to have
caught the infection from the fireside circle, and were outvying each
other in wild wishes, and childish projects of what they would do when
they came to be men and women. At length a little boy, instead of
addressing his brothers and sisters, called out to his mother.

</p><p>``I'll tell you what I wish, mother,'' cried he. ``I want you
and father and grandma'm, and all of us, and the stranger too, to
start right away, and go and take a drink out of the basin of the
Flume!''

</p><p>Nobody could help laughing at the child's notion of leaving a
warm bed, and dragging them from a cheerful fire, to visit the basin of
the Flume,&mdash;a brook, which tumbles over the precipice, deep within the
Notch. The boy had hardly spoken when a wagon rattled along the road,
and stopped a moment before the door. It appeared to contain two or
three men, who were cheering their hearts with the rough chorus of a
song, which resounded, in broken notes, between the cliffs, while the
singers hesitated whether to continue their journey or put up here for
the night.''

</p><p>``Father,'' said the girl, ``they are calling you by name.''

</p><p>But the good man doubted whether they had really called him, and
was unwilling to show himself too solicitous of gain by inviting
people to patronize his house. He therefore did not hurry to the door;
and the lash being soon applied, the travellers plunged into the
Notch, still singing and laughing, though their music and mirth came
back drearily from the heart of the mountain.

</p><p>``There, mother!'' cried the boy, again. ``They'd have given us
a ride to the Flume.''

</p><p>Again they laughed at the child's pertinacious fancy for a
night ramble.  But it happened that a light cloud passed over the
daughter's spirit; she

   <pb n="994"/>

looked gravely into the fire, and drew a breath that was almost a sigh.
It forced its way, in spite of a little struggle to repress it.  Then
starting and blushing, she looked quickly round the circle, as if they
had caught a glimpse into her bosom. The stranger asked what she had
been thinking of.

</p><p>``Nothing,'' answered she, with a downcast smile. ``Only I felt
lonesome just then.''

</p><p>``Oh, I have always had a gift of feeling what is in other
people's hearts,'' said he, half seriously. ``Shall I tell the secrets
of yours? For I know what to think when a young girl shivers by a warm
hearth, and complains of lonesomeness at her mother's side. Shall I
put these feelings into words?''

</p><p>``They would not be a girl's feelings any longer if they could
be put into words,'' replied the mountain nymph, laughing, but avoiding
his eye.

</p><p>All this was said apart. Perhaps a germ of love was springing
in their hearts, so pure that it might blossom in Paradise, since it
could not be matured on earth; for women worship such gentle dignity
as his; and the proud, contemplative, yet kindly soul is oftenest
captivated by simplicity like hers. But while they spoke softly, and
he was watching the happy sadness, the lightsome shadows, the shy
yearnings of a maiden's nature, the wind through the Notch took a
deeper and drearier sound. It seemed, as the fanciful stranger said,
like the choral strain of the spirits of the blast, who in old Indian
times had their dwelling among these mountains, and made their heights
and recesses a sacred region. There was a wail along the road, as if a
funeral were passing. To chase away the gloom, the family threw pine
branches on their fire, till the dry leaves crackled and the flame
arose, discovering once again a scene of peace and humble happiness.
The light hovered about them fondly, and caressed them all.  There
were the little faces of the children, peeping from their bed apart
and here the father's frame of strength, the mother's subdued and
careful mien, the high-browed youth, the budding girl, and the good old
grandam, still knitting in the warmest place. The aged woman looked up
from her task, and, with fingers ever busy, was the next to speak.

</p><p>``Old folks have their notions,'' said she, ``as well as young
ones. You've been wishing and planning; and letting your heads run on
one thing and another, till you've set my mind a wandering too. Now
what should an old woman wish for, when she can go but a step or two
before she comes to her grave? Children, it will haunt me night and
day till I tell you.''

</p><p>``What is it, mother?'' cried the husband and wife at once.

</p><p>Then the old woman, with an air of mystery which drew the circle
closer round the fire, informed them that she had provided her
grave-clothes some years before,&mdash;a nice linen shroud, a cap with a
muslin ruff, and everything of a finer sort than she had worn since
her wedding day.  But this evening an old superstition had strangely
recurred to her.  It used to be said, in her younger days, that if
anything were amiss with a corpse, if only the ruff were not smooth,
or the cap did not set right, the corpse

   <pb n="995"/>

in the coffin and beneath the clods would strive to put up its cold
hands and arrange it. The bare thought made her nervous.

</p><p>``Don't talk so, grandmother!'' said the girl, shuddering.

</p><p>``Now,''&mdash;continued the old woman, with singular earnestness,
yet smiling strangely at her own folly,&mdash;``I want one of you, my
children&mdash; when your mother is dressed and in the coffin&mdash;I want one
of you to hold a looking-glass over my face. Who knows but I may take
a glimpse at myself, and see whether all 's right?''

</p><p>``Old and young, we dream of graves and monuments,'' murmured
the stranger youth. ``I wonder how mariners feel when the ship is
sinking, and they, unknown and undistinguished, are to be buried
together in the ocean&mdash;that wide and nameless sepulchre?''

</p><p>For a moment, the old woman's ghastly conception so engrossed
the minds of her hearers that a sound abroad in the night, rising like
the roar of a blast, had grown broad, deep, and terrible, before the
fated group were conscious of it. The house and all within it
trembled; the foundations of the earth seemed to be shaken, as if this
awful sound were the peal of the last trump. Young and old exchanged
one wild glance, and remained an instant, pale, affrighted, without
utterance, or power to move.  Then the same shriek burst
simultaneously from all their lips.

</p><p>``The Slide! The Slide!''

</p><p>The simplest words must intimate, but not portray, the
unutterable horror of the catastrophe. The victims rushed from their
cottage, and sought refuge in what they deemed a safer spot&mdash;where, in
contemplation of such an emergency, a sort of barrier had been reared.
Alas! they had quitted their security, and fled right into the pathway
of destruction.  Down came the whole side of the mountain, in a
cataract of ruin.  Just before it reached the house, the stream broke
into two branches&mdash;shivered not a window there, but overwhelmed the
whole vicinity, blocked up the road, and annihilated everything in its
dreadful course. Long ere the thunder of the great Slide had ceased to
roar among the mountains, the mortal agony had been endured, and the
victims were at peace. Their bodies were never found.

</p><p>The next morning, the light smoke was seen stealing from the
cottage chimney up the mountain side. Within, the fire was yet
smouldering on the hearth, and the chairs in a circle round it, as if
the inhabitants had but gone forth to view the devastation of the
Slide, and would shortly return, to thank Heaven for their miraculous
escape. All had left separate tokens, by which those who had known the
family were made to shed a tear for each. Who has not heard their
name? The story has been told far and wide, and will forever be a
legend of these mountains.  Poets have sung their fate.

</p><p>There were circumstances which led some to suppose that a
stranger had been received into the cottage on this awful night, and
had shared the catastrophe of all its inmates. Others denied that
there were sufficient grounds for such a conjecture. Woe for the
high-souled youth, with his dream of Earthly Immortality! His name and
person utterly unknown;

   <pb n="996"/>

his history, his way of life, his plans, a mystery never to be
solved, his
death and his existence equally a doubt! Whose was the agony of
that
death moment?</p>
