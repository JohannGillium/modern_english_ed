<head>ENDICOTT AND THE RED CROSS</head>

<p>AT noon of on autumnal day, more than two centuries ago, the
English
colors were displayed by the standard-bearer of the Salem
trainband,
which had mustered for martial exercise under the orders of John
Endicott. It was a period when the religious exiles were accustomed
often
to buckle on their armor, and practise the handling of their
weapons of
war. Since the first settlement of New England, its prospects had
never
been so dismal. The dissensions between Charles the First and his
subjects
were then, and for several years afterwards, confined to the floor
of
Parliament. The measures of the King and ministry were rendered
more
tyrannically violent by an opposition, which had not yet acquired
sufficient confidence in its own strength to resist royal injustice
with the
sword. The bigoted and haughty primate, Laud, Archbishop of
Canterbury, controlled the religious affairs of the realm, and was
consequently
invested with powers which might have wrought the utter ruin of the
two
Puritan colonies, Plymouth and Massachusetts. There is evidence on
record that our forefathers perceived their danger, but were
resolved that
their infant country should not fall without a struggle, even
beneath the
giant strength of the King's right arm.
</p><p>Such was the aspect of the times when the folds of the
English banner, with the Red Cross in its field, were flung out
over a company
of
Puritans. Their leader, the famous Endicott, was a man of stern and
resolute countenance, the effect of which was heightened by a
grizzled
beard that swept the upper portion of his breastplate. This piece
of
armor was so highly polished that the whole surrounding scene had
its
image in the glittering steel. The central object in the mirrored
picture
was an edifice of humble architecture with neither steeple nor bell
to
proclaim it&mdash;what nevertheless it was&mdash;the house of prayer. A token
of
the perils of the wilderness was seen in the grim head of a wolf,
which
had just been slain within the precincts of the town, and according
to
the regular mode of claiming the bounty, was nailed on the porch of
the
meeting-house. The blood was still plashing on the doorstep. There
happened to be visible, at the same noontide hour, so many other
characteristics of the times and manners of the Puritans, that we
must
endeavor
to represent them in a sketch, though far less vividly than they
were reflected in the polished breastplate of John Endicott.
</p><p>In close vicinity to the sacred edifice appeared that
important engine
of Puritanic authority, the whipping-post&mdash;with the soil around it
well
   <pb n="1015"/>
trodden by the feet of evil doers, who had there been disciplined.
At one
corner of the meeting-house was the pillory, and at the other the
stocks;
and, by a singular good fortune for our sketch, the head of an
Episcopalian
and suspected Catholic was grotesquely incased in the former
machine
while a fellow-criminal, who had boisterously quaffed a health to
the king,
was confined by the legs in the latter. Side by side, on the
meeting-house
steps, stood a male and a female figure. The man was a tall, lean,
haggard
personification of fanaticism, bearing on his breast this label,&mdash;A
WANTON GOSPELLER,&mdash;which betokened that he had dared to give
interpretations of Holy Writ unsanctioned by the infallible
judgment of
the civil and religious rulers. His aspect showed no lack of zeal
to maintain his heterodoxies, even at the stake. The woman wore a
cleft
stick on
her tongue, in appropriate retribution for having wagged that
unruly
member against the elders of the church; and her countenance and
gestures gave much cause to apprehend that, the moment the stick
should be
removed, a repetition of the offence would demand new ingenuity in
chastising it.
</p><p>The above-mentioned individuals had been sentenced to
undergo their
various modes of ignominy, for the space of one hour at noonday.
But
among the crowd were several whose punishment would be life-long;
some, whose ears had been cropped, like those of puppy dogs;
others,
whose cheeks had been branded with the initials of their
misdemeanors;
one, with his nostrils slit and seared; and another, with a halter
about
his neck, which he was forbidden ever to take off, or to conceal
beneath
his garments. Methinks he must have been grievously tempted to
affix
the other end of the rope to some convenient beam or bough. There
was
likewise a young woman, with no mean share of beauty, whose doom
it was to wear the letter A on the breast of her gown, in the eyes
of all the
world and her own children. And even her own children knew what
that
initial signified. Sporting with her infamy, the lost and desperate
creature had embroidered the fatal token in scarlet cloth, with
golden
thread and the nicest art of needlework; so that the capital A
might have
been thought to mean Admirable, or anything rather than Adulteress.
</p><p>Let not the reader argue, from any of these evidences of
iniquity, that
the times of the Puritans were more vicious than our own, when, as
we
pass along the very street of this sketch, we discern no badge of
infamy
on man or woman. It was the policy of our ancestors to search out
even
the most secret sins, and expose them to shame, without fear or
favor, in
the broadest light of the noonday sun. Were such the custom now,
perchance we might find materials for a no less piquant sketch than
the
above.
</p><p>Except the malefactors whom we have described, and the
diseased or
infirm persons, the whole male population of the town, between
sixteen
years and sixty, were seen in the ranks of the trainband. A few
stately
savages, in all the pomp and dignity of the primeval Indian, stood
gazing
at the spectacle. Their flint-headed arrows were but childish
weapons
compared with the matchlocks of the Puritans, and would have
rattled
   <pb n="1016"/>
harmlessly against the steel caps and hammered iron breastplates
which
inclosed each soldier in an individual fortress. The valiant John
Endicott
glanced with an eye of pride at his sturdy followers, and prepared
to renew the martial toils of the day.
</p><p>``Come, my stout hearts!'' quoth he, drawing his sword.
``Let us show
these poor heathen that we can handle our weapons like men of
might.
Well for them, if they put us not to prove it in earnest!''
</p><p>The iron-breasted company straightened their line, and each
man drew
the heavy butt of his matchlock close to his left foot, thus
awaiting the
orders of the captain. But, as Endicott glanced right and left
along the
front, he discovered a personage at some little distance with whom
it behooved him to hold a parley. It was an elderly gentleman,
wearing
a black
cloak and band, and a high-crowned hat, beneath which was a velvet
skull-cap, the whole being the garb of a Puritan minister. This
reverend
person bore a staff which seemed to have been recently cut in the
forest,
and his shoes were bemired as if he had been travelling on foot
through
the swamps of the wilderness. His aspect was perfectly that of a
pilgrim,
heightened also by an apostolic dignity. Just as Endicott perceived
him
he laid aside his staff, and stooped to drink at a bubbling
fountain which
gushed into the sunshine about a score of yards from the corner of
the
meeting-house. But, ere the good man drank, he turned his face
heavenward in thankfulness, and then, holding back his gray beard
with
one
hand, he scooped up his simple draught in the hollow of the other.
</p><p>``What, ho! good Mr. Williams,'' shouted Endicott. ``You are
welcome
back again to our town of peace. How does our worthy Governor
Winthrop? And what news from Boston?''
</p><p>``The Governor hath his health, worshipful Sir,'' answered
Roger Williams, now resuming his staff, and drawing near. ``And for
the
news, here
is a letter, which, knowing I was to travel hitherward to-day, his
Excellency committed to my charge. Belike it contains tidings of
much
import;
for a ship arrived yesterday from England.''
</p><p>Mr. Williams, the minister of Salem and of course known to
all the
spectators, had now reached the spot where Endicott was standing
under
the banner of his company, and put the Governor's epistle into his
hand.
The broad seal was impressed with Winthrop's coat of arms. Endicott
hastily unclosed the letter and began to read, while, as his eye
passed
down the page, a wrathful change came over his manly countenance.
The
blood glowed through it, till it seemed to be kindling with an
internal
heat, nor was it unnatural to suppose that his breastplate would
likewise
become red-hot with the angry fire of the bosom which it covered.
Arriving at the conclusion, he shook the letter fiercely in his
hand, so
that it
rustled as loud as the flag above his head.
</p><p>``Black tidings these, Mr. Williams,'' said he; ``blacker
never came to
New England. Doubtless you know their purport?''
</p><p>``Yea, truly,'' replied Roger Williams; ``for the Governor
consulted,
respecting this matter, with my brethren in the ministry at Boston;
and
my opinion was likewise asked. And his Excellency entreats you by
me,
   <pb n="1017"/>
that the news be not suddenly noised abroad, lest the people be
stirred
up unto some outbreak, and thereby give the King and the Archbishop
a
handle against us.''
</p><p>``The Governor is a wise man&mdash;a wise man, and a meek and
moderate,''
said Endicott, setting his teeth grimly. ``Nevertheless, I must do
according
to my own best judgment. There is neither man, woman, nor child in
New
England, but has a concern as dear as life in these tidings; and if
John
Endicott's voice be loud enough, man, woman, and child shall hear
them.
Soldiers, wheel into a hollow square! Ho, good people! Here are
news for
one and all of you.''
</p><p>The soldiers closed in around their captain; and he and
Roger Williams stood together under the banner of the Red Cross;
while the
women
and the aged men pressed forward, and the mothers held up their
children
to look Endicott in the face. A few taps of the drum gave signal
for silence and attention.
</p><p>``Fellow-soldiers&mdash;fellow-exiles,'' began Endicott, speaking
under
strong excitement, yet powerfully restraining it, ``wherefore did
ye leave
your native country? Wherefore, I say, have we left the green and
fertile
fields, the cottages, or, perchance, the old gray halls, where we
were born
and bred, the churchyards where our forefathers lie buried?
Wherefore
have we come hither to set up our own tombstones in a wilderness?
A
howling wilderness it is! The wolf and the bear meet us within
halloo of
our dwellings. The savage lieth in wait for us in the dismal shadow
of the
woods. The stubborn roots of the trees break our ploughshares, when
we
would till the earth. Our children cry for bread, and we must dig
in the
sands of the sea-shore to satisfy them. Wherefore, I say again,
have we
sought this country of a rugged soil and wintry sky? Was it not for
the
enjoyment of our civil rights? Was it not for liberty to worship
God according to our conscience?''
</p><p>``Call you this liberty of conscience?'' interrupted a voice
on the steps
of the meeting-house.
</p><p>It was the Wanton Gospeller. A sad and quiet smile flitted
across the
mild visage of Roger Williams. But Endicott, in the excitement of
the
moment, shook his sword wrathfully at the culprit&mdash;an ominous
gesture
from a man like him.
</p><p>``What hast thou to do with conscience, thou knave?'' cried
he. ``I said
liberty to worship God, not license to profane and ridicule him.
Break not
in upon my speech, or I will lay thee neck and heels till this time
tomorrow! Hearken to me, friends, nor heed that accursed
rhapsodist. As
I was
saying, we have sacrificed all things, and have come to a land
whereof
the old world hath scarcely heard, that we might make a new world
unto
ourselves, and painfully seek a path from hence to heaven. But what
think
ye now? This son of a Scotch tyrant&mdash;this grandson of a Papistical
and
adulterous Scotch woman, whose death proved that a golden crown
doth
not always save an anointed head from the block''&mdash;
</p><p>``Nay, brother, nay,'' interposed Mr. Williams; ``thy words
are not
meet for a secret chamber, far less for a public street.''
   <pb n="1018"/>
</p><p>``Hold thy peace, Roger Williams!'' answered Endicott,
imperiously.
``My spirit is wiser than thine for the business now in hand. I
tell ye,
fellow-exiles, that Charles of England, and Laud, our bitterest
persecutor,
arch-priest of Canterbury, are resolute to pursue us even hither.
They are
taking counsel, saith this letter, to send over a governor-general,
in whose
breast shall be deposited all the law and equity of the land. They
are
minded, also, to establish the idolatrous forms of English
Episcopacy; so
that, when Laud shall kiss the Pope's toe, as cardinal of Rome, he
may
deliver New England, bound hand and foot, into the power of his
master!''
</p><p>A deep groan from the auditors,&mdash;a sound of wrath, as well
as fear and
sorrow,&mdash;responded to this intelligence.
</p><p>``Look ye to it, brethren,'' resumed Endicott, with
increasing energy.
``If this king and this arch-prelate have their will, we shall
briefly behold
a cross on the spire of this tabernacle which we have builded, and
a high
altar within its walls, with wax tapers burning round it at
noonday. We
shall hear the sacring bell, and the voices of the Romish priests
saying the
mass. But think ye, Christian men, that these abominations may be
suffered without a sword drawn? without a shot fired? without blood
spilt,
yea, on the very stairs of the pulpit? No,&mdash;be ye strong of hand
and stout
of heart! Here we stand on our own soil, which we have bought with
our
goods, which we have won with our swords, which we have cleared
with
our axes, which we have tilled with the sweat of our brows, which
we
have sanctified with our prayers to the God that brought us hither!
Who
shall enslave us here? What have we to do with this mitred
prelate,&mdash;with
this crowned king? What have we to do with England?''
</p><p>Endicott gazed round at the excited countenances of the
people, now
full of his own spirit, and then turned suddenly to the
standard-bearer,
who stood close behind him.
</p><p>``Officer, lower your banner!'' said he.
</p><p>The officer obeyed; and, brandishing his sword, Endicott
thrust it
through the cloth, and, with his left hand, rent the Red Cross
completely
out of the banner. He then waved the tattered ensign above his
head.
</p><p>``Sacrilegious wretch!'' cried the high-churchman in the
pillory, unable longer to restrain himself, ``thou hast rejected
the symbol of
our holy
religion!''
</p><p>``Treason, treason!'' roared the royalist in the stocks.
``He hath defaced the King's banner!''
</p><p>``Before God and man, I will avouch the deed,'' answered
Endicott.
``Beat a flourish, drummer!&mdash;shout, soldiers and people!&mdash;in honor
of
the ensign of New England. Neither Pope nor Tyrant hath part in it
now!''
</p><p>With a cry of triumph, the people gave their sanction to one
of the
boldest exploits which our history records. And forever honored be
the
name of Endicott! We look back through the mist of ages, and
recognize
in the rending of the Red Cross from New England's banner the first
omen of that deliverance which our fathers consummated after the
bones
of the stern Puritan had lain more than a century in the dust.</p>
