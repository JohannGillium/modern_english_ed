<head>Sights from my Window -Alice.</head>
<lg type="poem"><l>
I sit beside my window,</l><l>
And see the crowds go by,</l><l>
With joy on every countenance,</l><l>
And hope in every eye,</l><l>
And hear their blended voices,</l><l>
In many a shout and song,</l><l>
Borne by the spring's soft breezes</l><l>
Through all the streets along.</l>
</lg><lg type="poem"><l>
And peering through a lattice</l><l>
Of a humble cottage near,</l><l>
I see a face of beauty, Adown which glides a tear,-</l><l>
A rose amid her tresses</l><l>
Tells that she would be gay,</l><l>
But a thought of some deep sorrow</l><l>
Drives every smile away.</l></lg><lg type="poem"><l>

She whom I see there weeping,</l><l>
Few save myself do know,-</l><l>
A flower in blooming blighted</l><l>
By blasts of keenest wo.</l><l>
She has a soul so gentle,</l><l>
That as a harp it seems,</l><l>
Which the light airs wake to music</l><l>
Like that we hear in dreams.</l></lg><lg type="poem"><l>

A common fate is that poor girl's,</l><l>
which many yet must share,-</l><l>
In the crowd how little know they</l><l>
What griefs its members bear!</l><l>
One year ago a radiance</l><l>
Like sunlight round her played,</l><l>
Heart felt, eyes spoke of gladness,-</l><l>
She was not then betrayed.</l></lg><lg type="poem"><l>

There was one of gentle manners,</l><l>
Who e'er met her with a smile,</l><l>
And a voice so full of kindness,</l><l>
That she could not deem it guile,</l><l>
And her trusting heart she gave him,-</l><l>
She could give to him no more,-</l><l>
Oh! daughter of the poor man,</l><l>
Soon thy dream of bliss was o'er!</l></lg><lg type="poem"><l>

'T were vain to tell the story</l><l>
Of fear, hope, and joyous passion;</l><l>
She forgot her father's station,</l><l>
He forsook the halls of fashion;</l><l>
She loved him well-he knew it,-</l><l>
'T was a pleasing interlude,</l><l>
Fitting to enjoy more keenly</l><l>
Scenes the poor might ne'er intrude.</l></lg><lg type="poem"><l>

Hark! the sound of music swelling!-</l><l>
Now the crowd are rushing by,</l><l>
Horses prancing, banners flying,</l><l>
Shouts ascending to the sky:-</l><l>
There's a sea of life beneath me,</l><l>
And his form is there,-</l><l>
For his fearful sin who spurns him?</l><l>
On his brow what sign of care?</l></lg><lg type="poem"><l>

I see her now-she trembles-</l><l>
There is phrensy in her eye;</l><l>
Her blanched lip is quivering;</l><l>
There is no good angel nigh;-</l><l>
She falls,-the deep-toned bugle</l><l>
Breaks on the quiet air;</l><l>
Look to the calm blue heaven-</l><l>
That sound-her soul-are there!</l></lg><lg type="poem"><l>

In the cavalcade she saw him,</l><l>
In his plumes and armor drest,</l><l>
And more closely to her bosom</l><l>
His treasured gifts she prest;</l><l>
Her eye met his-'t was finished-</l><l>
Not a word my tongue was spoken;</l><l>
A cold glance-a look of passion-</l><l>
And her heart was broken!</l></lg><lg type="poem"><l>

How common are such histories,</l><l>
In the cottage and the hall;</l><l>
From prison bars how many eyes</l><l>
Look on life's carnival!</l><l>
The joys we seek are phantoms</l><l>
That fade ere closed the hand</l><l>
In the dark reached forth to grasp them,</l><l>
But the brain receives their brand.</l></lg>
