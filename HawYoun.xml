<head>YOUNG GOODMAN BROWN</head>

<p>YOUNG Goodman Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salem
village; but put his head back, after crossing the threshold, to
exchange a
parting kiss with his young wife. And Faith, as the wife was aptly
named,
thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the wind play
with the
pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman Brown.
</p><p>``Dearest heart,'' whispered she, softly and rather sadly,
when her lips
were close to his ear, ``prithee put off your journey until sunrise
and sleep
in your own bed to-night. A lone woman is troubled with such dreams
and
such thoughts that she's afeard of herself sometimes. Pray tarry
with me
this night, dear husband, of all nights in the year.''
</p><p>``My love and my Faith,'' replied young Goodman Brown, ``of
all nights
in the year, this one night must I tarry away from thee. My
journey, as
thou callest it, forth and back again, must needs be done 'twixt
now and
sunrise. What, my sweet, pretty wife, dost thou doubt me already,
and
we but three months married?''
</p><p>``Then God bless you!'' said Faith, with the pink ribbons;
``and may
you find all well when you come back.''
</p><p>``Amen!'' cried Goodman Brown. ``Say thy prayers, dear
Faith, and go
to bed at dusk, and no harm will come to thee.''
</p><p>So they parted; and the young man pursued his way until,
being about
to turn the corner by the meeting-house, he looked back and saw the
head
of Faith still peeping after him with a melancholy air, in spite of
her pink
ribbons.
</p><p>``Poor little Faith!'' thought he, for his heart smote him.
``What a
wretch am I to leave her on such an errand! She talks of dreams,
too. Methought as she spoke there was trouble in her face, as if a
dream
had
warned her what work is to be done tonight. But no, no; 't would
kill her
to think it. Well, she's a blessed angel on earth; and after this
one night
I'll cling to her skirts and follow her to heaven.''
</p><p>With this excellent resolve for the future, Goodman Brown
felt himself
justified in making more haste on his present evil purpose. He had
taken a
   <pb n="1034"/>
dreary road, darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest,
which barely stood aside to let the narrow path creep through, and
closed
immediately behind. It was all as lonely as could be; and there is
this
peculiarity in
such a solitude, that the traveller knows not who may be concealed
by the
innumerable trunks and the thick boughs overhead; so that with
lonely
footsteps he may yet be passing through an unseen multitude.
</p><p>``There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree,'' said
Goodman
Brown to himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added,
``What if the devil himself should be at my very elbow!''
</p><p>His head being turned back, he passed a crook of the road,
and, looking
forward again, beheld the figure of a man, in grave and decent
attire,
seated at the foot of an old tree. He arose at Goodman Brown's
approach
and walked onward side by side with him.
</p><p>``You are late, Goodman Brown,'' said he. ``The clock of the
Old South
was striking as I came through Boston, and that is full fifteen
minutes
agone.''
</p><p>``Faith kept me back a while,'' replied the young man, with
a tremor in
his voice, caused by the sudden appearance of his companion, though
not
wholly unexpected.
</p><p>It was now deep dusk in the forest, and deepest in that part
of it where
these two were journeying. As nearly as could be discerned, the
second
traveller was about fifty years old, apparently in the same rank of
life as
Goodman Brown, and bearing a considerable resemblance to him,
though
perhaps more in expression than features. Still they might have
been taken for father and son. And yet, though the elder person was
as
simply clad
as the younger, and as simple in manner too, he had an
indescribable air
of one who knew the world, and who would not have felt abashed at
the
governor's dinner table or in King William's court, were it
possible that
his affairs should call him thither. But the only thing about him
that could
be fixed upon as remarkable was his staff, which bore the likeness
of a
great black snake, so curiously wrought that it might almost be
seen to
twist and wriggle itself like a living serpent. This, of course,
must have
been an ocular deception, assisted by the uncertain light.
</p><p>``Come, Goodman Brown,'' cried his fellow-traveller, ``this
is a dull pace
for the beginning of a journey. Take my staff, if you are so soon
weary.''
</p><p>``Friend,'' said the other, exchanging his slow pace for a
full stop, ``having kept covenant by meeting thee here, it is my
purpose now to
return
whence I came. I have scruples touching the matter thou wot'st
of.''
</p><p>``Sayest thou so?'' replied he of the serpent, smiling
apart. ``Let us walk
on, nevertheless, reasoning as we go; and if I convince thee not
thou shalt
turn back. We are but a little way in the forest yet.''
</p><p>``Too far! too far!'' exclaimed the goodman, unconsciously
resuming
his walk. ``My father never went into the woods on such an errand,
nor
his father before him. We have been a race of honest men and good
Christians since the days of the martyrs; and shall I be the first
of
the name of
Brown that ever took this path and kept''&mdash;
</p><p>``Such company, thou wouldst say,'' observed the elder
person, interpreting
   <pb n="1035"/>
his pause. ``Well said, Goodman Brown! I have been as well
acquainted with your family as with ever a one among the Puritans;
and
that's no trifle to say. I helped your grandfather, the constable,
when he
lashed the Quaker woman so smartly through the streets of Salem;
and it
was I that brought your father a pitch-pine knot, kindled at my own
hearth, to set fire to an Indian village, in King Philip's war.
They were
my good friends, both; and many a pleasant walk have we had along
this
path, and returned merrily after midnight. I would fain be friends
with
you for their sake.''
</p><p>``If it be as thou sayest,'' replied Goodman Brown, ``I
marvel they never spoke of these matters; or, verily, I marvel not,
seeing that
the least
rumor of the sort would have driven them from New England. We are
a
people of prayer, and good works to boot, and abide no such
wickedness.''
</p><p>``Wickedness or not,'' said the traveller with the twisted
staff, ``I have a
very general acquaintance here in New England. The deacons of many
a
church have drunk the communion wine with me; the selectmen of
divers
towns make me their chairman; and a majority of the Great and
General
Court are firm supporters of my interest. The governor and I,
too&mdash;But
these are state secrets.''
</p><p>``Can this be so?'' cried Goodman Brown, with a stare of
amazement at
his undisturbed companion. ``Howbeit, I have nothing to do with the
governor and council; they have their own ways, and are no rule for
a
simple
husbandman like me. But, were I to go on with thee, how should I
meet
the eye of that good old man, our minister, at Salem village? Oh,
his voice
would make me tremble both Sabbath day and lecture day.''
</p><p>Thus far the elder traveller had listened with due gravity;
but now
burst into a fit of irrepressible mirth, shaking himself so
violently that his
snake-like staff actually seemed to wriggle in sympathy.
</p><p>``Ha! ha! ha!'' shouted he again and again; then composing
himself,
``Well, go on, Goodman Brown, go on; but, prithee, don't kill me
with
laughing.''
</p><p>``Well, then, to end the matter at once,'' said Goodman
Brown, considerably nettled, ``there is my wife, Faith. It would
break her dear
little
heart; and I'd rather break my own.''
</p><p>``Nay, if that be the case,'' answered the other, ``e'en go
thy ways,
Goodman Brown. I would not for twenty old women like the one
hobbling
before us that Faith should come to any harm.''
</p><p>As he spoke he pointed his staff at a female figure on the
path, in whom
Goodman Brown recognized a very pious and exemplary dame, who had
taught him his catechism in youth, and was still his moral and
spiritual
adviser, jointly with the minister and Deacon Gookin.
</p><p>``A marvel, truly, that Goody Cloyse should be so far in the
wilderness
at nightfall,'' said he. ``But with your leave, friend, I shall
take a cut
through the woods until we have left this Christian woman behind.
Being
a stranger to you, she might ask whom I was consorting with and
whither
I was going.''
   <pb n="1036"/>
</p><p>``Be it so,'' said his fellow-traveller. ``Betake you to the
woods, and let
me keep the path.''
</p><p>Accordingly the young man turned aside, but took care to
watch his
companion, who advanced softly along the road until he had come
within
a staff's length of the old dame. She, meanwhile, was making the
best of
her way, with singular speed for so aged a woman, and mumbling some
indistinct words&mdash;a prayer, doubtless&mdash;as she went. The traveller
put
forth
his staff and touched her withered neck with what seemed the
serpent's
tail.
</p><p>``The devil!'' screamed the pious old lady.
</p><p>``Then Goody Cloyse knows her old friend?'' observed the
traveller,
confronting her and leaning on his writhing stick.
</p><p>``Ah, forsooth, and is it your worship indeed?'' cried the
good dame.
``Yea, truly is it, and in the very image of my old gossip, Goodman
Brown,
the grandfather of the silly fellow that now is. But&mdash;would your
worship
believe it?&mdash;my broomstick hath strangely disappeared, stolen, as
I suspect, by that unhanged witch, Goody Cory, and that, too, when
I was
all
anointed with the juice of smallage, and cinquefoil, and wolf's
bane''&mdash;
</p><p>``Mingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new-born babe,''
said the
shape of old Goodman Brown.
</p><p>``Ah, your worship knows the recipe,'' cried the old lady,
cackling
aloud. ``So, as I was saying, being all ready for the meeting, and
no horse
to ride on, I made up my mind to foot it; for they tell me there is
a nice
young man to be taken into communion to-night. But now your good
worship will lend me your arm, and we shall be there in a
twinkling.
</p><p>``That can hardly be,'' answered her friend. ``I may not
spare you my
arm, Goody Cloyse; but here is my staff, if you will.''
</p><p>So saying, he threw it down at her feet, where, perhaps, it
assumed life,
being one of the rods which its owner had formerly lent to the
Egyptian
magi. Of this fact, however, Goodman Brown could not take
cognizance.
He had cast up his eyes in astonishment, and, looking down again,
beheld
neither Goody Cloyse nor the serpentine staff, but his
fellow-traveller
alone, who waited for him as calmly as if nothing had happened.
</p><p>``That old woman taught me my catechism,'' said the young
man; and
there was a world of meaning in this simple comment.
</p><p>They continued to walk onward, while the elder traveller
exhorted his
companion to make good speed and persevere in the path, discoursing
so
aptly that his arguments seemed rather to spring up in the bosom of
his
auditor than to be suggested by himself. As they went, he plucked
a
branch of maple to serve for a walking stick, and began to strip it
of the
twigs and little boughs, which were wet with evening dew. The
moment
his fingers touched them they became strangely withered and dried
up as
with a week's sunshine. Thus the pair proceeded, at a good free
pace,
until suddenly, in a gloomy hollow of the road, Goodman Brown sat
himself down on the stump of a tree and refused to go any farther.
</p><p>``Friend,'' said he, stubbornly, ``my mind is made up. Not
another step
will I budge on this errand. What if a wretched old woman do choose
to
   <pb n="1037"/>
go to the devil when I thought she was going to heaven: is that any
reason
why I should quit my dear Faith and go after her?''
</p><p>``You will think better of this by and by,'' said his
acquaintance, composedly. ``Sit here and rest yourself a while; and
when you feel
like moving again, there is my staff to help you along.''
</p><p>Without more words, he threw his companion the maple stick,
and was
as speedily out of sight as if he had vanished into the deepening
gloom.
The young man sat a few moments by the roadside, applauding himself
greatly, and thinking with how clear a conscience he should meet
the
minister in his morning walk, nor shrink from the eye of good old
Deacon
Gookin. And what calm sleep would be his that very night, which was
to
have been spent so wickedly, but so purely and sweetly now, in the
arms
of Faith! Amidst these pleasant and praiseworthy meditations,
Goodman Brown heard the tramp of horses along the road, and deemed
it
advisable to conceal himself within the verge of the forest,
conscious of the
guilty purpose that had brought him thither, though now so happily
turned from it.
</p><p>On came the hoof tramps and the voices of the riders, two
grave old
voices, conversing soberly as they drew near. These mingled sounds
appeared to pass along the road, within a few yards of the young
man's hiding-place; but, owing doubtless to the depth of the gloom
at that
particular spot, neither the travellers nor their steeds were
visible.
Though their
figures brushed the small boughs by the wayside, it could not be
seen that
they intercepted, even for a moment, the faint gleam from the strip
of
bright sky athwart which they must have passed. Goodman Brown
alternately crouched and stood on tiptoe, pulling aside the
branches and
thrusting forth his head as far as he durst without discerning so
much as a
shadow. It vexed him the more, because he could have sworn, were
such a
thing possible, that he recognized the voices of the minister and
Deacon
Gookin, jogging along quietly, as they were wont to do, when bound
to
some ordination or ecclesiastical council. While yet within
hearing, one of
the riders stopped to pluck a switch.
</p><p>``Of the two, reverend sir,'' said the voice like the
deacon's, ``I had
rather miss an ordination dinner than to-night's meeting. They tell
me
that some of our community are to be here from Falmouth and beyond,
and others from Connecticut and Rhode Island, besides several of
the
Indian powwows, who, after their fashion, know almost as much
deviltry
as the best of us. Moreover, there is a goodly young woman to be
taken
into communion.''
</p><p>``Mighty well, Deacon Gookin!'' replied the solemn old tones
of the
minister. ``Spur up, or we shall be late. Nothing can be done, you
know,
until I get on the ground.''
</p><p>The hoofs clattered again; and the voices, talking so
strangely in the
empty air, passed on through the forest, where no church had ever
been
gathered or solitary Christian prayed. Whither, then, could these
holy
men be journeying so deep into the heathen wilderness? Young
Goodman
Brown caught hold of a tree for support, being ready to sink down
on the
   <pb n="1038"/>
ground, faint and overburdened with the heavy sickness of his
heart. He
looked up to the sky, doubting whether there really was a heaven
above
him. Yet there was the blue arch, and the stars brightening in it.
</p><p>``With heaven above and Faith below, I will yet stand firm
against the
devil!'' cried Goodman Brown.
</p><p>While he still gazed upward into the deep arch of the
firmament and
had lifted his hands to pray, a cloud, though no wind was stirring,
hurried across the zenith and hid the brightening stars. The blue
sky
was still
visible, except directly overhead, where this black mass of cloud
was
sweeping swiftly northward. Aloft in the air, as if from the depths
of the
cloud, came a confused and doubtful sound of voices. Once the
listener
fancied that he could distinguish the accents of towns-people of
his own,
men and women, both pious and ungodly, many of whom he had met at
the communion table, and had seen others rioting at the tavern. The
next
moment, so indistinct were the sounds, he doubted whether he had
heard
aught but the murmur of the old forest, whispering without a wind.
Then
came a stronger swell of those familiar tones, heard daily in the
sunshine
at Salem village, but never until now from a cloud of night There
was one
voice of a young woman, uttering lamentations, yet with an
uncertain sorrow, and entreating for some favor, which, perhaps, it
would grieve
her to
obtain; and all the unseen multitude, both saints and sinners,
seemed to
encourage her onward.
</p><p>``Faith!'' shouted Goodman Brown, in a voice of agony and
desperation; and the echoes of the forest mocked him, crying,
``Faith!
Faith!'' as
if bewildered wretches were seeking her all through the wilderness.
</p><p>The cry of grief, rage, and terror was yet piercing the
night, when the
unhappy husband held his breath for a response. There was a scream,
drowned immediately in a louder murmur of voices, fading into
far-off
laughter, as the dark cloud swept away, leaving the clear and
silent sky
above Goodman Brown. But something fluttered lightly down through
the
air and caught on the branch of a tree. The young man seized it,
and beheld a pink ribbon.
</p><p>``My Faith is gone!'' cried he, after one stupefied moment.
``There is
no good on earth; and sin is but a name. Come, devil; for to thee
is this
world given.''
</p><p>And, maddened with despair, so that he laughed loud and
long, did
Goodman Brown grasp his staff and set forth again, at such a rate
that he
seemed to fly along the forest path rather than to walk or run. The
road
grew wilder and drearier and more faintly traced, and vanished at
length,
leaving him in the heart of the dark wilderness, still rushing
onward with
the instinct that guides mortal man to evil. The whole forest was
peopled
with frightful sounds&mdash;the creaking of the trees, the howling of
wild
beasts, and the yell of Indians; while sometimes the wind tolled
like a
distant church bell, and sometimes gave a broad roar around the
traveller,
as if all Nature were laughing him to scorn. But he was himself the
chief
horror of the scene, and shrank not from its other horrors.
</p><p>``Ha! ha! ha!'' roared Goodman Brown when the wind laughed
at him.
   <pb n="1039"/>
</p><p>``Let us hear which will laugh loudest. Think not to
frighten me with your
deviltry. Come witch, come wizard, come Indian powwow, come devil
himself, and here comes Goodman Brown. You may as well fear him as
he
fear you.''
</p><p>In truth, all through the haunted forest there could be
nothing more
frightful than the figure of Goodman Brown. On he flew among the
black
pines, brandishing his staff with frenzied gestures, now giving
vent to an
inspiration of horrid blasphemy, and now shouting forth such
laughter as
set all the echoes of the forest laughing like demons around him.
The fiend
in his own shape is less hideous than when he rages in the breast
of man.
Thus sped the demoniac on his course, until, quivering among the
trees,
he saw a red light before him, as when the felled trunks and
branches of
a clearing have been set on fire, and throw up their lurid blaze
against the
sky, at the hour of midnight. He paused, in a lull of the tempest
that had
driven him onward, and heard the swell of what seemed a hymn,
rolling
solemnly from a distance with the weight of many voices. He knew
the
tune; it was a familiar one in the choir of the village
meeting-house. The
verse died heavily away, and was lengthened by a chorus, not of
human
voices, but of all the sounds of the benighted wilderness pealing
in awful
harmony together. Goodman Brown cried out, and his cry was lost to
his
own ear by its unison with the cry of the desert.
</p><p>In the interval of silence he stole forward until the light
glared full
upon his eyes. At one extremity of an open space, hemmed in by the
dark
wall of the forest, arose a rock, bearing some rude, natural
resemblance
either to an alter or a pulpit, and surrounded by four blazing
pines, their
tops aflame, their stems untouched, like candles at an evening
meeting.
The mass of foliage that had overgrown the summit of the rock was
all on
fire, blazing high into the night and fitfully illuminating the
whole field.
Each pendent twig and leafy festoon was in a blaze. As the red
light arose
and fell, a numerous congregation alternately shone forth, then
disappeared in shadow, and again grew, as it were, out of the
darkness,
peopling the heart of the solitary woods at once.
</p><p>``A grave and dark-clad company,'' quoth Goodman Brown.
</p><p>In truth they were such. Among them, quivering to and fro
between
gloom and splendor, appeared faces that would be seen next day at
the
council board of the province, and others which, Sabbath after
Sabbath,
looked devoutly heavenward, and benignantly over the crowded pews,
from the holiest pulpits in the land. Some affirm that the lady of
the governor was there. At least there were high dames well known
to her,
and
wives of honored husbands, and widows, a great multitude, and
ancient
maidens, all of excellent repute, and fair young girls, who
trembled lest
their mothers should espy them. Either the sudden gleams of light
flashing over the obscure field bedazzled Goodman Brown, or he
recognized a
score of the church members of Salem village famous for their
especial
sanctity. Good old Deacon Gookin had arrived, and waited at the
skirts
of that venerable saint, his revered pastor. But, irreverently
consorting
with these grave, reputable, and pious people, these elders of the
church,
   <pb n="1040"/>
these chaste dames and dewy virgins, there were men of dissolute
lives
and women of spotted fame, wretches given over to all mean and
filthy
vice, and suspected even of horrid crimes. It was strange to see
that the
good shrank not from the wicked, nor were the sinners abashed by
the
saints. Scattered also among their pale-faced enemies were the
Indian
priests, or powwows, who had often scared their native forest with
more
hideous incantations than any known to English witchcraft.
</p><p>``But where is Faith?'' thought Goodman Brown; and, as hope
came
into his heart, he trembled.
</p><p>Another verse of the hymn arose, a slow and mournful strain,
such as
the pious love, but joined to words which expressed all that our
nature
can conceive of sin, and darkly hinted at far more. Unfathomable to
mere mortals is the lore of fiends. Verse after verse was sung; and
still
the chorus of the desert swelled between like the deepest tone of
a mighty
organ; and with the final peal of that dreadful anthem there came
a
sound, as if the roaring wind, the rushing streams, the howling
beasts,
and every other voice of the unconcerted wilderness were mingling
and
according with the voice of guilty man in homage to the prince of
all.
The four blazing pines threw up a loftier flame, and obscurely
discovered shapes and visages of horror on the smoke wreaths above
the
impious
assembly. At the same moment the fire on the rock shot redly forth
and
formed a glowing arch above its base, where now appeared a figure.
With reverence be it spoken, the figure bore no slight similitude,
both in
garb and manner, to some grave divine of the New England churches.
</p><p>``Bring forth the converts!'' cried a voice that echoed
through the field
and rolled into the forest.
</p><p>At the word, Goodman Brown stepped forth from the shadow of
the
trees and approached the congregation, with whom he felt a loathful
brotherhood by the sympathy of all that was wicked in his heart. He
could have well-nigh sworn that the shape of his own dead father
beckoned him to advance, looking downward from a smoke wreath,
while a
woman, with dim features of despair, threw out her hand to warn him
back. Was it his mother? But he had no power to retreat one step,
nor to
resist, even in thought, when the minister and good old Deacon
Gookin
seized his arms and led him to the blazing rock. Thither came also
the
slender form of a veiled female, led between Goody Cloyse, that
pious
teacher of the catechism, and Martha Carrier, who had received the
devil's promise to be queen of hell. A rampant hag was she. And
there
stood the proselytes beneath the canopy of fire.
</p><p>``Welcome, my children,'' said the dark figure, ``to the
communion of
your race. Ye have found thus young your nature and your destiny.
My
children, look behind you!''
</p><p>They turned; and flashing forth, as it were, in a sheet of
flame, the
fiend worshippers were seen; the smile of welcome gleamed darkly on
every visage.
</p><p>``There,'' resumed the sable form, ``are all whom ye have
reverenced
from youth. Ye deemed them holier than yourselves, and shrank from
   <pb n="1041"/>
your own sin, contrasting it with their lives of righteousness and
prayerful aspirations heavenward. Yet here are they all in my
worshipping
assembly. This night it shall be granted you to know their secret
deeds:
how hoary-bearded elders of the church have whispered wanton words
to the young maids of their households; how many a woman, eager for
widows' weeds, has given her husband a drink at bedtime and let him
sleep his last sleep in her bosom; how beardless youths have made
haste
to inherit their fathers' wealth; and how fair damsels&mdash;blush not,
sweet
ones&mdash;have dug little graves in the garden, and bidden me, the sole
guest
to an infant's funeral. By the sympathy of your human hearts for
sin
ye shall scent out all the places&mdash;whether in church, bedchamber,
street,
field, or forest&mdash;where crime has been committed, and shall exult
to
behold the whole earth one stain of guilt, one mighty blood spot.
Far
more than this. It shall be yours to penetrate, in every bosom, the
deep
mystery of sin, the fountain of all wicked arts, and which
inexhaustibly
supplies more evil impulses than human power&mdash;than my power at its
utmost&mdash;can make manifest in deeds. And now, my children, look upon
each other.''
</p><p>They did so; and, by the blaze of the hell-kindled torches,
the wretched
man beheld his Faith, and the wife her husband, trembling before
that
unhallowed altar.
</p><p>``Lo, there ye stand, my children,'' said the figure, in a
deep and solemn tone, almost sad with its despairing awfulness, as
if his once
angelic
nature could yet mourn for our miserable race. ``Depending upon one
another's hearts, ye had still hoped that virtue were not all a
dream. Now
are ye undeceived. Evil is the nature of mankind. Evil must be your
only
happiness. Welcome again, my children, to the communion of your
race.''
</p><p>``Welcome,'' repeated the fiend worshippers, in one cry of
despair
and triumph.
</p><p>And there they stood, the only pair, as it seemed, who were
yet hesitating on the verge of wickedness in this dark world. A
basin was
hollowed, naturally, in the rock. Did it contain water, reddened by
the lurid
light? or was it blood? or, perchance, a liquid flame? Herein did
the
shape of evil dip his hand and prepare to lay the mark of baptism
upon
their foreheads, that they might be partakers of the mystery of
sin, more
conscious of the secret guilt of others, both in deed and thought,
than
they could now be of their own. The husband cast one look at his
pale
wife, and Faith at him. What polluted wretches would the next
glance
show them to each other, shuddering alike at what they disclosed
and
what they saw!
</p><p>``Faith! Faith!'' cried the husband, ``look up to heaven,
and resist the
wicked one.''
</p><p>Whether Faith obeyed he knew not. Hardly had he spoken when
he
found himself amid calm night and solitude, listening to a roar of
the
wind which died heavily away through the forest. He staggered
against
the rock, and felt it chill and damp; while a hanging twig, that
had been
all on fire, besprinkled his cheek with the coldest dew.

</p><p>The next morning young Goodman Brown came slowly into the
street
of Salem village, staring around him like a bewildered man. The
good
old minister was taking a walk along the graveyard to get an
appetite
for breakfast and meditate his sermon, and bestowed a blessing, as
he
passed, on Goodman Brown. He shrank from the venerable saint as if
to
avoid an anathema. Old Deacon Gookin was at domestic worship, and
the holy words of his prayer were heard through the open window.
``What God doth the wizard pray to?'' quoth Goodman Brown. Goody
Cloyse, that excellent old Christian, stood in the early sunshine
at her
own lattice, catechizing a little girl who had brought her a pint
of morning's milk. Goodman Brown snatched away the child as from
the grasp
of the fiend himself. Turning the corner by the meeting-house, he
spied
the head of Faith, with the pink ribbons, gazing anxiously forth,
and
bursting into such joy at sight of him that she skipped along the
street
and almost kissed her husband before the whole village. But Goodman
Brown looked sternly and sadly into her face, and passed on without
a
greeting.
</p><p>Had Goodman Brown fallen asleep in the forest and only
dreamed a
wild dream of a witch-meeting?
</p><p>Be it so if you will; but, alas! it was a dream of evil omen
for young
Goodman Brown. A stern, a sad, a darkly meditative, a distrustful,
if
not a desperate man did he become from the night of that fearful
dream.
On the Sabbath day, when the congregation were singing a holy
psalm,
he could not listen because an anthem of sin rushed loudly upon his
ear
and drowned all the blessed strain. When the minister spoke from
the
pulpit with power and fervid eloquence, and, with his hand on the
open Bible, of the sacred truths of our religion, and of saint-like
lives
and triumphant deaths, and of future bliss or misery unutterable,
then
did Goodman Brown turn pale, dreading lest the roof should thunder
down upon the gray blasphemer and his hearers. Often, waking
suddenly at midnight, he shrank from the bosom of Faith; and at
morning
or
eventide, when the family knelt down at prayer, he scowled and
muttered to himself, and gazed sternly at his wife, and turned
away.
And
when he had lived long, and was borne to his grave a hoary corpse,
followed by Faith, an aged woman, and children and grandchildren,
a
goodly procession, besides neighbors not a few, they carved no
hopeful
verse upon his tombstone, for his dying hour was gloom.</p>
