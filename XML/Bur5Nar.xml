<head>FROM &ldquo;MORE WONDERS OF THE INVISIBLE
WORLD,&rdquo; BY ROBERT CALEF, 1700</head>

<pb n="291"/>

<div2 type="introduction" id="d4">
<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Of</hi> Robert Calef almost nothing is known
except what can be learned from his book. There has even been doubt as to
whether, of the two Robert Calefs known to us in Boston at this time, the writer
was the father or the son. In 1692, the time of the Salem witchcraft, the father's
age was 44, the son's 18.<ref target="n149">[149]</ref> It is unlikely that anybody would have thought of the
son but for a note copied into one of the memorandum-books of Dr. Jeremy
Belknap (1744-1798).<ref target="n150">[150]</ref> This note, of unknown source reads: &ldquo;Robert
Calef, author of `More Wonders of the Invisible World,' printed at London in
1700, was a native of England; a young man of good sense, and free from
superstition; a merchant in Boston. He was furnished with materials for his work
by Mr. Brattle, of Cambridge; and his brother, of Boston; and other gentlemen,
who were opposed to the Salem proceedings. &mdash; E. P.&rdquo; The writer
speaks as if with knowledge; and that so sound a historian as Dr. Belknap should
have copied the note speaks for its worth. Able scholars have by it been led to
ascribe the book to the younger Robert; but more careful study seems to show the
objections insuperable. The author never adds &ldquo;Jr.&rdquo; to his name,
as a son would have done, and as seems to have been the younger Robert's
custom.<ref target="n151">[151]</ref> He never pleads youth, even

<pb n="292"/>




when most apologetic; and, what weighs more, his indignant foes, seeking all
ways to discredit him, never hint at such a thing. His matter and style have in
them nothing of boyishness; and once, in words suggestive of a migrant and a
man of years, he speaks (p. 297, below) of &ldquo;sound Reason, which is what
I have been long seeking for in this Country in vain.&rdquo; Most serious of all,
his handwriting seems that found in documents clearly the elder Calef's, and is
that of a mature and even by 1700 that of an aging man; while that of the
younger Robert was in 1719-1722 still firm and flexible &mdash; and notably
different.<ref target="n152">[152]</ref></p>


<p>Robert Calef the elder came to America at some time before 1688. He was
a cloth-merchant, and doubtless a maker as







<pb n="293"/>




well as a seller of cloths.<ref target="n153">[153]</ref> Of his eight children the eldest was, in 1692, a
physician in Ipswich. What led to the writing of <hi rend="italic">More
Wonders</hi> he has himself told us in his book. It remains only to testify to
the care and exactness which all comparison of his work with the records seems
to show, and to remark that to a student of the literature of witchcraft it is evident
that his reading is larger than he cares to parade. Though he clearly belonged to
the popular party, this is as likely to be a result as a cause &mdash; it is probably
neither &mdash; of his feeling on the subject of the witch superstition; and that he
had else any grievance against the Mathers or their colleagues there is no reason
to think.</p>


<p>His book, though completed in 1697, was not printed till 1700, and then
in London. In June, 1698, Cotton Mather records in his diary that &ldquo;a sort
of a Sadducee in this town&rdquo; &ldquo;hath written a Volumn of invented and
notorious lies&rdquo;; &ldquo;this Volumn,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;hee is, as
I understand, sending to England, that it may bee printed there.&rdquo; Why it
found no printer in New England can be guessed; the storm it raised when it
appeared in print is well known. President Increase Mather &ldquo;ordered the
wicked book to be burnt in the college yard,&rdquo; <ref target="n154">[154]</ref> and his son's diary is
eloquent with vexation.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Some Years ago,&rdquo; runs his entry of November 15, 1700,
&ldquo;a very wicked sort of a Sadducee in this Town, raking together a crue of
Libels, which he had written at several Times,

<pb n="294"/>




(especially relating to the <hi rend="italic">Wonders of the Invisible
World</hi> which have been among us) wherein I am the cheef Butt of his
malice, (tho' many other better Servants of the Lord are also most maliciously
abused by him:) he sent this vile Volume to London to be published. Now, tho'
I had often and often cried unto the Lord, that the Cup of this Man's abominable
Bundle of Lies, written on purpose, with a Quil under a special Energy and
Management of Satan, to damnify my precious Opportunities of Glorifying my
Lord Jesus Christ, might pass from me; Yett, in this point, the Lord has denied
my Request: the Book is printed, and the Impression is this week arrived
here.&rdquo;</p>


<p>It was even felt necessary to print a reply; but the two Mathers held it
beneath them to plead in their own vindication. It fell to their parishioners.
&ldquo;My pious neighbours are so provoked,&rdquo; writes Cotton Mather
(December 4), &ldquo;at the diabolical Wickedness of the Man who has
published a Volume of Libels against my Father and myself, that they sett apart
whole Dayes of Prayer, to complain unto God against him.&rdquo; The outcome
of their communings together was a pamphlet called <hi rend="italic">Some
Few Remarks upon a Scandalous Book against the Gospel and Ministry of New
England, written by one Robert Calef</hi>. It was signed by seven, one of
them John Goodwin; but the materials were furnished by their pastors. It aimed
however at their personal exculpation, and has small interest for the public
story.<ref target="n155">[155]</ref></p>


<p>The doughty merchant survived the storm. In 1702-1704 he served his
townsmen as an overseer of the poor, in 1707

<pb n="295"/>




was chosen an assessor, in 1710 a tithingman. It was perhaps about this time that
he retired to Roxbury, where in 1707 he had bought a place and where he was
a selectman of the town when, in 1719, death found him. There, in the old burial
ground just opposite his home, a stone still testifies that &ldquo;Here lyes buried
the body of Mr. Robert Calef, aged seventy-one years, died April the Thirteenth,
1719.&rdquo; <ref target="n156">[156]</ref></p>


<p>Calef's book has been five times reprinted: in 1796, at Salem, by William
Carlton (12&deg;, pp. 318); again at Salem, in 1823, a mere reimpression, with
the addition, from the court files, of Giles Corey's examination (12&deg;, pp.
312); in Boston, 1828 (24&deg;, pp. 333), again a reimpression; at Salem, 1861,
edited by Mr. S. P. Fowler, with Cotton Mather's <hi
rend="italic">Wonders</hi>, in his volume <hi rend="italic">Salem
Witchcraft</hi> (see p. 207); and, more faithfully, in 1866 at Roxbury, as nos.
VI., VII., of Woodward's <hi rend="italic">Historical Series</hi>, under
the editorship of S. G. Drake (see pp. 207-208). The present text follows the
original edition (1700), but corrects it by the list of <hi
rend="italic">Errata</hi> to be found in the copy (once Cotton Mather's)
possessed by the Massachusetts Historical Society.<ref target="n157">[157]</ref></p>



<div3 type="notes" id="d5">
<head>Notes</head>

<note id="n149"><seg type="note-symbol">[149].</seg> <p>S. G. Drake, in the introduction to his edition of Calef, would make his
age 14; but the genealogist of the family, Mr. Matthew A. Stickney, says 18. Yet
Mr. Stickney urges the father's authorship (<hi rend="italic">N. E. Hist. and
Gen. Register</hi>, XXX. 461; XLIX. 224). He died in 1894, leaving this
genealogy, alas, unpublished, and his heirs decline to let it be consulted.</p></note>

<note id="n150"><seg type="note-symbol">[150].</seg> <p>Mass. Hist. Soc., <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi>, 1858, p.
288.</p></note>

<note id="n151"><seg type="note-symbol">[151].</seg> <p>Thus in 1706 &ldquo;Robt. Calef, Jun.,&rdquo; was chosen a clerk of
the market (<hi rend="italic">Boston Record Commissioners' Reports</hi>,
VIII. 36); thus in 1708 &ldquo;Robert Calef, junr.&rdquo; becomes a constable
(<hi rend="italic">id</hi>., VIII. 45), and gains permission to erect a
house (<hi rend="italic">id</hi>., XI. 68, XXIX. 187); thus, too, in that
year (see plate) he signs himself &ldquo;Ro. Calfe Jnr&rdquo;; thus in 1710
&ldquo;Robert Calfe, Jr.,&rdquo; appears on the rolls of the Artillery Company
(<hi rend="italic">N. E. Hist. and Gen. Register</hi>, XXXVIII. 341);
and it is after his father's death that (see plate) in 1719 to a receipted account, in
1721 to his will, in 1722 to the release of a mortgage, he signed &ldquo;Rob
Calfe&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ro: Calfe&rdquo;, &ldquo;Robert Calfe&rdquo; (see the
last two in Drake's <hi rend="italic">Witchcraft Delusion</hi>, II. xxii,
xxiv).</p></note>

<note id="n152"><seg type="note-symbol">[152].</seg> <p>From the author of <hi rend="italic">More Wonders</hi> we have
two unquestionable autographs: (1) his marginalia of 1695 on Cotton Mather's
paper (see below, p. 306, note 1) and (2) a letter of 1700
presenting a copy of his book to the Earl of Bellomont, then governor of
Massachusetts and New York. A page of the former is to be photographed in the
Massachusetts Historical Society's <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for
1913-1914; and the latter (now in the New York Public Library) is reproduced
in full in the <hi rend="italic">Memorial History of Boston</hi> (II. 168).
Specimens of both are given in our own plate; and to these are added (1) the
signature &ldquo;Robert Calef&rdquo; from the report of two appraisers,
October 30, 1693; (2) the signature &ldquo;Robt. Calef&rdquo; from the verdict
of a Boston coroner's jury, January 15, 1696; (3) the same signature, with a line
or two of text in the same hand, from the decision of two arbitrators (Boston,
July 29, 1697); and (4) the last lines and the signature of a paper drawn by
&ldquo;Robt. Calef&rdquo; as a selectman of Roxbury in March, 1717 (?). That
all six specimens are in the same hand, and in a hand different from the younger
Calef's, will hardly be questioned. Is not the older Robert, too, more likely than
the younger to have been an appraiser in 1693, a coroner's juror in 1696, and an
arbiter in 1697? And (though Calef and Calfe were undoubtedly pronounced alike
or nearly so) is it not less probable that the author of <hi rend="italic">More
Wonders</hi> changed the habitual spelling of his signature than that a younger
Robert, if not the author, should thus have distinguished his identity from his
father's? What arguments led the genealogist Stickney to ascribe the book to the
father cannot now be learned: the &ldquo;full statement of the reasons&rdquo;
promised by him to the <hi rend="italic">N. E. Hist. and Gen.
Register</hi> (see XXX. 461) was, like his genealogy, never published. But,
from an article on &ldquo;Robert Calef&rdquo; by Mr. W. S. Harris in the <hi
rend="italic">Granite Monthly</hi> for 1907 (XXXIX. 157-163), and from
correspondence with its author, it is learned that another student of the Calef
pedigree (Mr. W. W. Lunt, of Hingham, Mass.) has reached that result by a
comparison of handwritings. Mr. Harris, it should be added, quotes the Rev. John
Kelly as saying in a funeral sermon (1808) for Judge John Calfe (b. 1740) of
Hampstead, N. H., that the latter's ancestor (who was the elder Calef, not the
younger) was the author of the book.</p></note>

<note id="n153"><seg type="note-symbol">[153].</seg> <p>In 1701 Cotton Mather calls him &ldquo;the Weaver (though he presumes
to call himself Merchant)&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">Some Few
Remarks</hi>, p. 35).</p></note>

<note id="n154"><seg type="note-symbol">[154].</seg> <p>Eliot, <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary</hi> (1809), <hi
rend="italic">s. v.</hi> &ldquo;Calef.&rdquo;</p></note>

<note id="n155"><seg type="note-symbol">[155].</seg> <p>Let any who would know the contents of the excessively rare little
booklet turn to the works of Upham and Poole mentioned on p. 91; and in his
<hi rend="italic">Diary
</hi> (I. 383-384) Mather narrates how the book was compiled. The <hi
rend="italic">More Wonders</hi> it describes as &ldquo;a Libellous Book
lately come into this Countrey... which is writ (with what help we know not) by
one Robert Calef, who presumes to call himself Merchant of Boston.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It was highly rejoicing to us,&rdquo; add the writers, &ldquo;when we
heard that our Booksellers were so well acquainted with the Integrity of our
Pastors, as that not one of them could admit of any of those Libels to be vended
in their shops.&rdquo; Pp. 34-50 of its seventy-one pages are taken up by a letter
of Cotton Mather to the authors. It was perhaps a passage in Mather's letter that
led &ldquo;E. P.&rdquo; to think Robert Calef a &ldquo;young man&rdquo;;
for those words, in italics and with capital initials, stare from a sentence so
obscure that to a hasty glance Calef, instead of Mather himself, might easily seem
to be meant.</p></note>

<note id="n156"><seg type="note-symbol">[156].</seg> <p>For these and other personal details see Drake's memoir, in his ed. of
Calef, and his <hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities of Boston</hi>,
pp. 529, 531; <hi rend="italic">Boston Record Commissioners'
Reports</hi>, I. 156, 160, VII. 210, 218, 225, 229, VIII. 24, 26, 31, 33, 41,
43, 75, IX. 179, 195, XI. 145; <hi rend="italic">Memorial History of
Boston</hi>, IV. 652; F. S. Drake, <hi rend="italic">The Town of
Roxbury</hi> (Boston, 1905), pp. 102, 140-149; <hi rend="italic">N. E.
Hist. and Gen. Register</hi>, XIV. 52; and the above-cited article of W. S.
Harris, which has a photograph of the gravestone. From these mentions will be
learned also the name of his wife, Mary, and of the two of his eight children who
were born (1688, 1691) after his coming to Boston. It will be learned, too, that
in 1692 he was a constable, in 1694 hayward and fenceviewer, in 1697 a
surveyor of highways, in 1698 a clerk of the market. At least it is to
&ldquo;Robert Calef,&rdquo; not to &ldquo;Robert Calef, Jr.,&rdquo; that the
records award these offices. And it is perhaps to be noticed that while the name
of &ldquo;Robert Calef&rdquo; is often preceded by &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;, that
title does not appear before that of &ldquo;Robert Calef, Jr.&rdquo;</p></note>

<p>You that are freed from the Slavery of a corrupt Education; and that in
spite of human Precepts, Examples and Presidents,<ref target="n160">[160]</ref> can hearken to the Dictates
of Scripture and Reason:</p>


<pb n="297"/>

<p>For your sakes I am content, that these Collections of mine, as also my
Sentiments should be exposed to publick view; In hopes that having well
considered, and compared them with Scripture, you will see reason, as I do, to
question a belief so prevalent (as that here treated of) as also the practice flowing
from thence; they standing as nearly connext as cause and effect; it being found
wholly impracticable, to extirpate the latter without first curing the former.</p>


<p>And if the Buffoon or Satyrical will be exercising their Talents, or if the
Biggots wilfully and blindly reject the Testimonies of their own Reason, and more
sure word, it is no more than what I expected from them.</p>


<p>But you Gentlemen, I doubt not, are willing to Distinguish between Truth
and Error, and if this may be any furtherance to you herein, I shall not miss my
Aim.</p>


<p>But if you find the contrary, and that my belief herein is any way
Heterodox, I shall be thankful for the Information to any Learned or Reverend
Person, or others, that shall take that pains to inform me better by Scripture, or
sound Reason, which is what I have been long seeking for in this Country in
vain.</p>


<p>In a time when not only England in particular, but almost all Europe had
been labouring against the Usurpations of Tyranny and Slavery, The English
America has not been behind in a share in the Common calamities; more
especially New-England has met not only with such calamities as are common to
the rest, but with several aggravations enhansing such Afflictions, by the
Devastations and Cruelties of the Barbarous Indians in their Eastern borders,
etc.</p>


<p>But this is not all, they have been harrast (on many accounts) by a more
dreadful Enemy, as will herein appear to the considerate.</p>


<p>P. 66.<ref target="n161">[161]</ref> Were it as we are told in <hi rend="italic">Wonders of the
Invisible World</hi>, that the Devils were walking about our Streets with

<pb n="298"/>




lengthned Chains making a dreadful noise in our Ears, and Brimstone, even
without a Metaphor, was making a horrid and a hellish stench in our
Nostrils,</p>


<p>P. 49. And that the Devil exhibiting himself ordinarily as a
black-Man,<ref target="n162">[162]</ref>
had decoy'd a fearful knot of Proud, Froward, Ignorant, Envious and Malitious
Creatures, to list themselves in his horrid Service, by entring their Names in a
Book tendered unto them; and that they have had their Meetings and Sacraments,
and associated themselves to destroy the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, in
these parts of the World; having each of them their Spectres, or Devils
Commissionated by them, and representing of them, to be the Engines of their
Malice, by these wicked Spectres siezing poor People about the Country with
various and bloody Torments. And of those evidently preternatural Torments
some to[o] have died. And that they have bewitched some even so far, as to make
them self destroyers, and others in many Towns here and there languish'd under
their evil hands. The People thus afflicted miserably scratch'd and bitten; and that
the same Invisible Furies did stick Pins in them, and scald them, distort and
disjoint them, with a Thousand other Plagues; and sometimes drag them out of
their Chambers, and carry them over Trees and Hills Miles together, many of
them being tempted to sign the Devils Laws.</p>


<p>P. 7[0]. These furies whereof several have killed more People perhaps than
would serve to make a Village.<ref target="n163">[163]</ref></p>


<p>If this be the true state of the Afflictions of this Country, it is very
deplorable, and beyond all other outward Calamities miserable. But if on the
other side, the Matter be as others do understand it, That the Devil has been too
hard for us by his Temptations, signs, and lying Wonders, with the help of
pernicious notions, formerly imbibed and professed; together with the Accusations
of a parcel of possessed, distracted, or lying Wenches, accusing their Innocent
Neighbours, pretending they see their Spectres (<hi rend="italic">i.
e</hi>.) Devils in their likeness Afflicting of them, and that God in righteous
Judgment (after Men

<pb n="299"/>




had ascribed his Power to Witches, of Commissionating Devils to do these things)
may have given them over to strong delusions to believe lyes, etc. And to let
loose the Devils of Envy, Hatred, Pride, Cruelty, and Malice against each other;
yet still disguised under the Mask of Zeal for God, and left them to the branding
one another with the odious Name of Witch; and upon the Accusation of those
above mentioned, Brother to Accuse and Prosecute Brother, Children their
Parents, Pastors and Teachers their immediate Flock unto death; Shepherds
becoming Wolves, Wise Men Infatuated; People hauled to Prisons, with a bloody
noise pursuing to, and insulting over, the (true) Sufferers at Execution, while
some are fleeing from that call'd Justice, Justice it self fleeing before such
Accusations, when once it did but begin to refrain further proceedings, and to
question such Practises, some making their Escape out of Prisons, rather than by
an obstinate Defence of their Innocency, to run so apparent hazard of their Lives;
Estates seized, Families of Children and others left to the Mercy of the
Wilderness (not to mention here the Numbers prescribed,<ref target="n164">[164]</ref> dead in Prisons, or
Executed, etc.)</p>


<p>All which Tragedies, tho begun in one Town, or rather by one Parish, has
Plague-like spread more than through that Country. And by its Eccho giving a
brand of Infamy to this whole Country, throughout the World,</p>


<p>If this were the Miserable case of this Country in the time thereof, and that
the Devil had so far prevailed upon us in our Sentiments and Actions, as to draw
us from so much as looking into the Scriptures for our guidance in these
pretended Intricacies, leading us to a trusting in blind guides, such as the corrupt
practices of some other Countries, or the bloody Experiments of Bodin, and such
other Authors &mdash; Then tho our Case be most miserable, yet it must be said
of New-England, Thou has destroyed thy self, and brought this greatest of
Miseries upon thee.</p>


<p>And now whether the Witches (such as have made a compact by Explicit
Covenant with the Devil, having thereby obtained a power to Commissionate him)
have been the cause of our miseries,</p>


<p>Or whether a Zeal governed by blindness and passion, and

<pb n="300"/>




led by president, has not herein precipitated us into far greater wickedness (if not
Witchcrafts) than any have been yet proved against those that suffered,</p>


<p>To be able to distinguish aright in this matter, to which of these two to
refer our Miseries is the present Work. As to the former, I know of no sober
Man, much less Reverend Christian, that being ask'd dares affirm and abide by
it, that Witches have that power; <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> to
Commissionate Devils to kill and destroy. And as to the latter, it were well if
there were not too much of truth in it, which remains to be demonstrated.</p>


<p>But here it will be said, what need of Raking in the Coals that lay buried
in oblivion. We cannot recall those to Life again that have suffered, supposing it
were unjustly; it tends but to the exposing the Actors, as if they had proceeded
irregularly.</p>


<p>Truly I take this to be just as the Devil would have it, so much to fear
disobliging men, as not to endeavour to detect his Wiles, that so he may the
sooner, and with the greater Advantages set the same on foot again (either here
or else where) so dragging us through the Pond twice by the same
Cat.<ref target="n165">[165]</ref> And if
Reports do not (herein) deceive us, much the same has been acting this present
year in Scotland.<ref target="n166">[166]</ref> And what Kingdom or Country is it, that has not had their
bloody fits and turns at it. And if this is such a catching disease, and so universal,
I presume I need make no Apology for my Endeavours to prevent, as far as in
my power, any more such bloody Victims or Sacrifices; tho indeed I had rather
any other would

<pb n="301"/>




have undertaken so offensive, tho necessary a task; yet all things weighed, I had
rather thus Expose my self to Censure, than that it should be wholly omitted.
Were the notions in question innocent and harmless, respecting the Glory of God,
and well being of Men, I should not have engaged in them, but finding them in
my esteem so intollerably destructive of both, This together with my being by
Warrant called before the Justices, in my own Just Vindication, I took it to be a
call from God, to my Power,<ref target="n167">[167]</ref> to Vindicate his Truths, against the Pagan and
Popish Assertions, which are so prevalent; for tho Christians in general do own
the Scriptures to be their only Rule of Faith and Doctrine, yet these Notions will
tell us, that the Scriptures have not sufficiently, nor at all described the crime of
Witchcraft, whereby the culpable might be detected, tho it be positive in the
Command to punish it by Death; hence the World has been from time to time
perplext in the prosecution of the several Diabolical mediums of Heathenish and
Popish Invention, to detect an Imaginary Crime (not but that there are Witches,
such as the Law of God describes) which has produced a deluge of Blood; hereby
rendering the Commands of God not only void but dangerous.</p>


<p>So also they own Gods Providence and Government of the World, and that
Tempests and Storms, Afflictions and Diseases, are of his sending; yet these
Notions tell us, that the Devil has the power of all these, and can perform them
when commission'd by a Witch thereto, and that he has a power at the Witches
call to act and do, without and against the course of Nature, and all natural
causes, in afflicting and killing of Innocents; and this is that so many have died
for.</p>


<p>Also it is generally believed, that if any Man has strength, it is from God
the Almighty Being: But these notions will tell us, that the Devil can make one
Man as strong as many, which was one of the best proofs, as it was counted,
against Mr. Burroughs the Minister;<ref target="n168">[168]</ref> tho his contemporaries in the Schools
during his Minority could have testified, that his strength was then as much
superiour to theirs as ever (setting aside incredible Romances) it was discovered
to be since. Thus rendring the power of God, and his providence of none
Effect.</p>


<pb n="302"/>


<p>These are some of the destructive notions of this Age, and however the
asserters of them seem sometimes to value themselves much upon sheltring their
Neighbours from Spectral Accusations, They may deserve as much thanks as that
Tyrant, that having industriously obtained an unintelligible charge against his
Subjects, in matters wherein it was impossible they should be Guilty, having
thereby their lives in his power, yet suffers them of his meer Grace to live, and
will be call'd gracious Lord.</p>


<p>It were too Icarian<ref target="n169">[169]</ref> a task for one unfurnish'd with necessary learning, and
Library, to give any Just account, from whence so great delusions have sprung,
and so long continued. Yet as an Essay from those scraps of reading that I have
had opportunity of, it will be no great venture to say, that Signs and Lying
Wonders have been one principal cause.<ref target="n170">[170]</ref></p>


<p>It is written of Justin Martyr, who lived in the second Century, that he was
before his conversion a great Philosopher; first in the way of the Stoicks, and
after of the Peripateticks, after that of the Pythagorean, and after that of the
Platonists sects; and after all proved of Eminent use in the Church of Christ; Yet
a certain Author speaking of one Apollonius Tyaneus<ref target="n171">[171]</ref> has these words,
&ldquo;That the most Orthodox themselves began to deem him vested with power
sufficient for a Deity; which occasioned that so strange a doubt from Justin
Martyr, as cited by the learned Gregory, Fol.
37.,<ref target="n172">[172]</ref> etc. If God be the Creator
and Lord of the World, how comes it to pass that Apollonius his
Telisms,<ref target="n173">[173]</ref> have
so much over-ruled the course of things! for we see that they also have stilled the
Waves of the Sea, and the raging of the Winds, and prevailed against the
Noisome Flies, and Incursions of wild Beasts,&rdquo; etc. If so Eminent and
Early a Christian were by these false shews in such doubt, it is the less wonder
in our

<pb n="303"/>




depraved times, to meet with what is Equivalent thereto: Besides this a certain
Author informs me, that &ldquo;Julian (afterwards called the Apostate) being
instructed in the Philosophy and Disciplines of the Heathen, by
Libarius<ref target="n174">[174]</ref> his
Tutor, by this means he came to love Philosophy better than the Gospel, and so
by degrees turn'd from Christianity to Heathenism.&rdquo;</p>


<p>This same Julian did, when Apostate, forbid that Christians should be
instructed in the Discipline of the Gentiles, which (it seems) Socrates a Writer of
the Ecclesiastical History, does acknowledge to be by the singular Providence of
God; Christians having then begun to degenerate from the Gospel, and to betake
themselves to Heathenish learning. And in the <hi
rend="italic">Mercury</hi> for the Month of February, 1695, there is this
Account, &ldquo;That the Christian Doctors conversing much with the writings
of the Heathen, for the gaining of Eloquence, A Counsel<ref target="n175">[175]</ref> was held at Carthage,
which forbad the reading of the Books of the Gentiles.&rdquo;</p>


<p>From all which it may be easily perceived, that in the Primitive times of
Christianity, when not only many Heathen of the Vulgar, but also many learn'd
Men and Philosophers had imbraced the Christian Faith, they still retained a love
to their Heathen-learning, which as one observes being transplanted into a
Christian soile, soon proved productive of pernicious weeds, which over-ran the
face of the Church, hence it was so deformed as the Reformation found it.</p>


<p>Among other pernicious Weeds arising from this Root, the Doctrine of the
power of Devils and Witchcraft as it is now, and long has been understood, is not
the least; the Fables of Homer, Virgil, Horace and Ovid, etc., being for the
Elegancy of their Language retained then (and so are to this day) in the schools,
have not only introduced, but established such Doctrines to the poisoning the
Christian World. A certain Author Expresses it thus, &ldquo;that as the Christian
Schools at first brought Men from Heathenism to the Gospel, so these Schools
carry Men from the Gospel to Heathenism, as to their great perfection,&rdquo;
and Mr. I. M.<ref target="n176">[176]</ref> in his <hi rend="italic">Remarkable Providences</hi>,
gives an account that (as he calls it) an Old Counsel<ref target="n177">[177]</ref> did

<pb n="304"/>




Anathematize all those that believed such power of the Devils, accounting it a
Damnable Doctrine. But as other Evils did afterwards increase in the Church
(partly by such Education) so this insensibly grew up with them, tho not to that
degree, as that any Counsel<ref target="n178">[178]</ref> I have ever heard or Read of has to this day taken
off those Anathema's; yet after this the Church so far declined, that Witchcraft
became a Principal Ecclesiastical Engine (as also that of Heresie was) to root up
all that stood in their way; and besides the ways of Tryal that we have still in
practice, they invented some, which were peculiar to themselves; which when
ever they were minded to improve against any Orthodox believer, they could
easily make Effectual: That Deluge of Blood which that Scarlet
Whore<ref target="n179">[179]</ref> has to
answer for, shed under this notion, how amazing is it.</p>


<p>The first in England that I have read of, of any note since the Reformation,
that asserts this Doctrine, is the famous Mr. Perkins,<ref target="n180">[180]</ref> he (as also Mr. Gaul,<ref target="n181">[181]</ref> and
Mr. Bernard,<ref target="n182">[182]</ref> etc. seems all of them to have undertaken one Task, they) taking
notice of the Multiplicity of irregular ways to try them by, invented by Heathen
and Papists, made it their business and main work herein to oppose such as they
saw to be pernicious. And if they did not look more narrowly into it, but
followed the first, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Mr. Perkins whose Education
(as theirs also) had

<pb n="305"/>




forestall'd him into such belief, whom they readily followed, it cannot be
wondered at: And that they were men liable to Err, and so not to be trusted to as
perfect guides, will manifestly appear to him that shall see their several receits
laid down to detect them by their Presumptive and Positive ones. And consider
how few of either have any foundation in Scripture or Reason; and how vastly
they differ from each other in both, each having his Art by himself, which Forty
or an Hundred more may as well imitate, and give theirs, <hi
rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi>, being without all manner of proof.</p>


<p>But tho this be their main design to take off People from those Evil and
bloody ways of trial which they speak so much against, Yet this does not hinder
to this day, but the same evil ways or as bad are still used to detect them by, and
that even among Protestants; and is so far Justified, that a Reverend Person has
said lately here, how else shall we detect Witches? And another being urged to
prove by Scripture such a sort of Witch as has power to send Devils to kill men,
replied, that he did as firmly believe it as any article of his Faith. And that he
(the Inquirer) did not go to the Scripture, to learn the Mysteries of his trade or
Art. What can be said more to Establish there Heathenish notions and to villifie
the Scriptures, our only Rule; and that after we have seen such dire effects
thereof, as has threatned the utter Extirpation of this whole Country.</p>


<p>And as to most of the Actors in these Tragedies, tho they are so far from
defending their Actions that they will Readily own, that undue steps have been
taken, etc., Yet it seems they choose that the same should be Acted over again
inforced by their Example, rather than that it should Remain as a Warning to
Posterity, wherein they have mist it. So far are they from giving Glory to God,
and taking the due shame to themselves.</p>


<p>And now to sum up all in a few words, we have seen a Biggotted Zeal,
stirring up a Blind and most Bloody rage, not against Enemies, or Irreligious
Proffligate Persons, But (in Judgment of Charity, and to view) against as
Vertuous and Religious as any they have left behind them in this Country, which
have suffered as Evil doers with the utmost extent of rigour (not that so high a
Charactor is due to all that Suffered)

<pb n="306"/>




and this by the Testimony of Vile Varlets as not only were known before, but
have been further apparent since by their Manifest Lives, Whordoms, Incest, etc.
The Accusations of these, from their Spectral Sight, being the chief Evidence
against those that Suffered. In which Accusations they were upheld by both
Magistrates and Ministers, so long as they Apprehended themselves in no
Danger.</p>


<p>And then tho they could defend neither the Doctrine, nor the Practice, yet
none of them have in such a publick manner as the case Requires, testified against
either; tho at the same time they could not but be sensible what a Stain and
lasting Infamy they have brought upon the whole Country, to the Indangering the
future welfair not only of this but of other places, induced by their Example; if
not, to an intailing the Guilt of all the Righteous Blood that has been by the same
means Shed, by Heathen or Papists, etc., upon themselves, whose deeds they
have so far justified, occasioning the great Dishonour and Blasphemy of the
Name of God, Scandalizing the Heathen, hardning of Enemies; and as a Natural
effect thereof, to the great Increase of Atheism.</p>


<p>I shall conclude only with acquainting the Reader, that of these Collections,
the first, containing more Wonders of the Invisible World, I received of a
Gentleman,<ref target="n183">[183]</ref> who had it of the Author
and communicated it to me,<ref target="n184">[184]</ref> with his
express consent, of which this is a true Copy.<ref target="n185">[185]</ref> As to the Letters, they

are for Substance the same I sent, tho with some small Variation or Addition.
Touching the two Letters from a Gentleman, at his request I have forborn naming
him. It is great Pity the matters of Fact, and indeed the whole, had not been done
by some abler hand better Accomplished and Advantaged with both natural and
acquired Judgments, but others not Appearing, I have inforc'd my self to do what
is done, my other occasions Will not admit any further Scrutiny therein.</p>

<p>I now lay before you a very Entertaining Story, a Story which relates yet
more Wonders of the Invisible World,<ref target="n186">[186]</ref> a Story which tells the Remarkable
Afflictions and Deliverance of one that had been Prodigiously handled by the Evil
Angels. I was my self a daily Eye Witness to a large part of these Occurrences,
and there may be produced Scores of Substantial Witnesses to the most of them;
yea, I know not of any one Passage of the Story, but what may be sufficiently
Attested. I do not Write it with a design of throwing it presently into the Press,
but only to preserve the Memory of such Memorable things, the forgetting
whereof would neither be pleasing to God, nor useful to Men; as also to give
you, with some others of peculiar and obliging Friends, a sight of some
Curiosities, and I hope this Apologie will serve to Excuse me, if I mention, as

&ldquo;the Diabolical Practices of above Twenty.&rdquo; Neither the relation

most mild and cautious of the Puritan monographs. The tiny volume, now very
rare, had perhaps never a great circulation (in 1692 Increase Mather declares it,
like Gaule's book, &ldquo;rare to be had&rdquo;); but its rules for the detection
of witches gained much vogue from their adoption by Michael Dalton into his
<hi rend="italic">The Countrey Justice</hi>, the standard manual for the

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Within</hi> these few years there died in the
Southern Parts a Christian Indian, who notwithstanding some of his Indian
Weakness, had something of a better Character of vertue and Goodness, than
many of our People can allow to most of their Countrey-men, that profess the
Christian Religion. He had been a Zealous Preacher of the Gospel to his
Neighbour-hood, and a sort of Overseer, or Officer, to whose Conduct was owing
very much of what good order was maintained among those Proselited Savages:
This Man returning home from the Funeral of his Son, was Complemented by an
English-Man, expressing Sorrow for his Loss; now, tho' the Indians use, upon
the Death of Relations, to be the most Passionate and Outragious Creatures in the
World, yet this Converted Indian Handsomely and Chearfully repli'd,
&ldquo;Truly I am sorry, and I am not sorry; I am sorry that I have Buried a
dear Son; but I am not sorry that the will of God is done. I know that without the
will of God my Son could not have Died, and I know that the will of God is
allways just and good, and so I am satisfied.&rdquo; Immediately upon this, even
within a few hours, he fell himself Sick of a Disease that quickly kill'd him; in
the time of which Disease he called his Folks about him, earnestly perswading
them to be Sincere in their Praying unto God, and beware of the Drunkenness,
the Idleness, the Lying, whereby so many of that Nation disgrac'd their
Profession of Christianity; adding, that he was ashamed when he thought how
little Service he had hitherto done for God; and that if God would prolong his
Life he would Labour to do better Service, but that he was fully sure he was now
going to the Lord Jesus Christ, who had bought him with his own Precious
Blood; and for his part he long'd to Die that he might be with his Glorious Lord;
and in the mid'st of such passages he gave up

the Ghost, but in such repute, that the English People of good Fashion did not
think much of Travelling a great way to his Interment. Lest my Reader do now
wonder why I have related this piece of a Story, I will now hasten to abate that
Wonder, by telling that whereto this was intended, but for an Introduction: Know
then that this remarkable Indian being a little before he Died at work in the Wood
making of Tarr, there appeared unto him a Black-Man, of a Terrible aspect, and
more than humane Dimensions, threatning bitterly to kill him if he would not
promise to leave off Preaching as he did to his Countrey-Men, and promise
particularly, that if he Preached any more, he would say nothing of Jesus Christ
unto them. The Indian amaz'd, yet had the courage to answer, I will in spite of
you go on to Preach Christ more than ever I did, and the God whom I serve will
keep me that you shall never hurt me. Hereupon the Apparition abating somewhat
of his fierceness, offered to the Indian a Book of a considerable thickness and a
Pen and Ink, and said, that if he would now set his hand unto that Book, he
would require nothing further of him; but the Man refused the motion with
indignation, and fell down upon his knees into a Fervent and Pious Prayer unto
God for help against the Tempter, whereupon the D&aelig;mon Vanish't.</p>


<p>This is a Story which I would never have tendered unto my Reader, if I had
not Receiv'd it from an honest and useful English Man, who is at this time a
Preacher of the Gospel to the Indians,<ref target="n189">[189]</ref>
nor would the probable<ref target="n190">[190]</ref> Truth of it have
encouraged me to have tendered it, if this also had not been a fit introduction
unto yet a further Narrative.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect.</hi> 2. 'Twas not much above a year or two,
after this Accident (of which no manner of Noise has been made) that there was
a Prodigious descent of Devils upon divers places near the Center of this
Province, wherein some scores of Mis

<pb n="310"/>




erable People were Troubled by horrible appearances of a Black-Man,
accompanied with Spectres, wearing these and those Humane Shapes, who offer'd
them a Book to be by them sign'd, in token of their being Listed for the Service
of the Devil, and upon their denying to do it, they were
Dragoon'd<ref target="n191">[191]</ref> with a
thousand Preternatural Torments, which gave no little terror to the beholders of
these unhappy Energuments.<ref target="n192">[192]</ref> There was one in the North part of Boston seized
by the Evil-Angels many Months after the General Storm of the late Inchantments
was over, and when the Countrey had long lain pretty quiet, both as to
Molestations and Accusations from the <hi rend="italic">Invisible
World</hi>, her Name was Margaret Rule, a Young Woman. She was born of
sober and honest Parents, yet Living, but what her own Character was before her
Visitation, I can speak with the less confidence of exactness, because I observe
that wherever the Devils have been let loose to worry any Poor Creature amongst
us, a great part of the Neighbourhood presently set themselves to inquire and
relate all the little Vanities of their Childhood, with such unequal exaggerations,
as to make them appear greater Sinners than any whom the Pilate of Hell has not
yet Preyed upon: But it is affirm'd, that for about half a year before her
Visitation, she was observably improved in the hopeful symptoms of a new
Creature; She was become seriously concern'd for the everlasting Salvation of her
Soul, and careful to avoid the snares of Evil Company. This Young Woman had
never seen the affliction of Mercy Short, whereof a Narrative has been already
given,<ref target="n193">[193]</ref> and yet about half a year after the glorious and signal deliverance of that
poor Damsel, this Margaret fell into an affliction, marvellous, resembling hers
in almost all the circumstances of it, indeed the Afflictions were so much alike,
that the relation I have given of the one, would almost serve as the full History
of the other, this was to that, little more than the second part to the same Tune,
indeed Margarets case was in several points less remarkable than Mercies, and
in some other things the Entertainment did a little vary.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 3. 'Twas upon the Lords Day the 10th
of September, in the Year 1693, that Margaret Rule, after some hours of previous
disturbance in the Publick Assembly, fell into odd

<pb n="311"/>




Fits, which caused her Friends to carry her home, where her Fits in a few hours
grew into a Figure that satisfied the Spectators of their being preternatural; some
of the Neighbours were forward enough to suspect the rise of this Mischief in an
House hard-by, where lived a Miserable Woman, who had been formerly
Imprisoned on the suspicion of Witchcraft, and who had frequently Cured very
painfull Hurts by muttering over them certain Charms, which I shall not indanger
the Poysoning of my Reader by repeating. This Woman had the Evening before
Margaret fell into her Calamities, very bitterly treated her, and threatn'd her; but
the hazard of hurting a poor Woman that might be innocent, notwithstanding
Surmizes that might have been more strongly grounded than those, caus'd the
pious People in the Vicinity to try rather whether incessant Supplication to God
alone, might not procure a quicker and safer Ease to the Afflicted, than hasty
Prosecution of any suppos'd Criminal, and accordingly that unexceptionable
course was all that was ever followed; yea, which I look't on as a token for good,
the Afflicted Family was as averse as any of us all to entertain thoughts of any
other course.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 4. The Young Woman was assaulted by
Eight cruel Spectres, whereof she imagin'd that she knew three or four, but the
rest came still with their Faces cover'd, so that she could never have a
distinguishing view of the countenance of those whom she thought she knew; she
was very careful of my reitterated charges to forbear blazing the Names, lest any
good Person should come to suffer any blast of Reputation thro' the cunning
Malice of the great Accuser; nevertheless having since privately named them to
my self, I will venture to say this of them, that they are a sort of Wretches who
for these many years have gone under as Violent Presumptions of Witchcraft, as
perhaps any creatures yet living upon Earth; altho' I am farr from thinking that
the Visions of this Young Woman were Evidence enough to prove them so. These
cursed Spectres now brought unto her a Book about a Cubet long, a Book Red
and thick, but not very broad, and they demanded of her that she would set her
Hand to that Book, or touch it at least with her Hand, as a Sign of her becoming
a Servant of the Devil; upon her peremptory refusal to do what they asked, they
did not after renew the profers of the

<pb n="312"/>




Book unto her, but instead thereof, they fell to Tormenting of her in a manner too
Hellish to be sufficiently described, in those Torments confining her to her Bed,
for just Six weeks together.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 5. Sometimes, but not always, together
with the Spectres there look't in upon the Young Woman (according to her
account) a short and a Black Man, whom they call'd their Master, a Wight
exactly of the same Dimensions and Complexion and voice, with the Divel that
has exhibited himself unto other infested People, not only in other parts of this
Country but also in other Countrys, even of the European World, as the relation
of the Enchantments there inform us, they all profest themselves Vassals of this
Devil, and in obedience unto him they address themselves unto various ways of
Torturing her; accordingly she was cruelly pinch't with Invisible hands very often
in a Day, and the black and blew marks of the pinches became immediately
visible unto the standers by. Besides this, when her attendants had left her without
so much as one pin about her, that so they might prevent some fear'd
inconveniencies; yet she would ever now and then be miserably hurt with Pins
which were found stuck into her Neck, Back and Arms, however, the Wounds
made by the Pins would in a few minutes ordinarily be cured; she would also be
strangely distorted in her Joynts, and thrown into such exorbitant Convulsions as
were astonishing unto the Spectators in General; They that could behold the
doleful condition of the poor Family without sensible compassions, might have
Intrals indeed, but I am sure they could have no true Bowels in them.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 6. It were a most Unchristian and
uncivil, yea a most unreasonable thing to imagine that the Fitt's of the Young
Woman were but meer Impostures: And I believe scarce any, but People of a
particular Dirtiness, will harbour such an Uncharitable Censure; however,
because I know not how far the Devil may drive the Imagination of poor
Creatures when he has possession of them, that at another time when they are
themselves would scorn to Dissemble any thing, I shall now confine my Narrative
unto passages, wherein there could be no room left for any Dissimulation. Of
these the first that I'll mention shall be this; From the time that Margaret Rule

<pb n="313"/>




first found herself to be formally besieged by the Spectres untill the Ninth Day
following, namely from the Tenth of September to the Eighteenth, she kept an
entire Fast, and yet she was unto all appearance as Fresh, as Lively, as Hearty,
at the Nine Days End, as before they began; in all this time, tho' she had a very
eager Hunger upon her Stomach, yet if any refreshment were brought unto her,
her Teeth would be set, and she would be thrown into many Miseries, Indeed
once or twice or so in all this time, her Tormentors permitted her to swallow a
Mouthful of somewhat that might encrease her Miseries, whereof a Spoonful of
Rum was the most considerable; but otherwise, as I said, her Fast unto the Ninth
day was very extream and rigid: However, afterwards there scarce passed a day
wherein she had not liberty to take something or other for her Sustentation, And
I must add this further, that this business of her Fast was carried so, that it was
impossible to be dissembled without a Combination of Multitudes of People
unacquainted with one another to support the Juggle, but he that can imagine such
a thing of a Neighbourhood so fill'd with Vertuous People is a base man, I cannot
call him any other.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 7. But if the Sufferings of this Young
Woman were not Imposture, yet might they not be pure Distemper? I will not
here inquire of our Saducees, what sort of Distemper 'tis shall stick the Body full
of Pins, without any Hand that could be seen to stick them; or whether all the
Pin-makers in the World would be willing to be Evaporated into certain ill habits
of Body producing a Distemper, but of the Distemper my Reader shall be Judge
when I have told him something further of those unusual Sufferings. I do believe
that the Evil Angels do often take Advantage from Natural Distempers in the
Children of Men to annoy them with such further Mischiefs as we call
preternatural. The Malignant Vapours and Humours of our Diseased Bodies may
be used by Devils thereinto insinuating as engine of the Execution of their Malice
upon those Bodies; and perhaps for this reason one Sex may suffer more Troubles
of some kinds from the Invisible World than the other, as well as for that reason
for which the Old Serpent made where he did his first Address. But I Pray what
will you say to this, Margaret Rule would sometimes have her Jaws for

<pb n="314"/>




cibly pulled open, whereupon something Invisible would be poured down her
Throat; we all saw her swallow, and yet we saw her try all she could by Spitting,
Coughing and Shriking,<ref target="n194">[194]</ref> that she might not swalow, but one time the standers by
plainly saw something of that odd Liquor it self on the outside of her Neck; She
cried out of it as of Scalding Brimstone poured into her, and the whole House
would Immediately scent so hot of Brimstone that we were scarce able to endure
it, whereof there are scores of Witnesses; but the Young Woman her self would
be so monstrously Inflam'd that it would have broke a Heart of Stone to have
seen her Agonies. This was a thing that several times happen'd and several times
when her Mouth was thus pull'd open, the standers by clapping their Hands close
thereupon the distresses that otherwise followed would be diverted. Moreover
there was a whitish powder to us Invisible somtimes cast upon the Eyes of this
Young Woman, whereby her Eyes would be extreamly incommoded, but one time
some of this Powder was fallen actually Visible upon her Cheek, from whence
the People in the Room wiped it with their Handkerchiefs, and somtimes the
Young Woman would also be so bitterly scorched with the unseen Sulphur thrown
upon her, that very sensible Blisters would be raised upon her Skin, whereto her
Friends found it necessary to apply the Oyl's proper for common Burning, but the
most of these Hurts would be cured in two or three days at farthest: I think I may
without Vanity pretend to have read not a few of the best System's of Physick
that have been yet seen in these American Regions, but I must confess that I have
never yet learned the Name of the Natural Distemper, whereto these odd
symptoms do belong: However I might suggest perhaps many a Natural Medicine,
which would be of singular use against many of them.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 8. But there fell out some other matters
far beyond the reach of Natural Distemper: This Margaret Rule once in the
middle of the Night Lamented sadly that the Spectres threatned the Drowning of
a Young Man in the Neighbourhood, whom she named unto the Company: well
it was afterwards found that at that very time this Young Man, having been prest
on Board a Man of War then in the Harbour, was

<pb n="315"/>




out of some dissatisfaction attempting to swim ashoar, and he had been Drowned
in the attempt, if a Boat had not seasonably taken him up; it was by computation
a minute or two after the Young Womans discourse of the Drowning, that the
Young Man took the Water. At another time she told us that the Spectres bragg'd
and laughed in her hearing about an exploit they had lately done, by stealing from
a Gentleman his Will soon after he had written it; and within a few hours after
she had spoken this there came to me a Gentleman with a private complaint, that
having written his Will it was unaccountably gone out of the way, how or where
he could not Imagine; and besides all this, there were wonderful Noises every
now and then made about the Room, which our People could Ascribe to no other
Authors but the Spectres, yea, the Watchers affirm that they heard those fiends
clapping of their hands together with an Audibleness, wherein they could not be
Imposed upon: And once her Tormentors pull'd her up to the Cieling of the
Chamber, and held her there before a very Numerous Company of Spectators,
who found it as much as they could all do to pull her down again. There was also
another very surprising circumstance about her, agreeable to what we have not
only Read in several Histories concerning the Imps that have been Imployed in
Witchcraft; but also known in some of our own afflicted: We once thought we
perceived something stir upon her Pillow at a little distance from her, whereupon
one present laying his hand there, he to his horror apprehended that he felt, tho'
none could see it, a living Creature, not altogether unlike a Rat, which nimbly
escap'd from him: and there were diverse other Persons who were thrown into
a great consternation by feeling, as they Judg'd, at other times the same Invisible
Animal.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 9. As it has been with a Thousand other
Inchanted People, so it was with Margaret Rule in this particular, that there were
several words which her Tormentors would not let her hear, especially the words
Pray or Prayer, and yet she could so hear the letters of those words distinctly
mentioned as to know what they ment. The standers by were forced sometimes
thus in discourse to spell a word to her, but because there were some so
ridiculous as to count it a sort of Spell or a Charm for any thus to accommodate
themselves to the

<pb n="316"/>




capacity of the Sufferer, little of this kind was done. But that which was more
singular in this matter, was that she could not use these words in those
penetrating discourses, wherewith she would sometimes address the Spectres that
were about her. She would sometimes for a long while together apply herself to
the Spectres, whom she supposed the Witches, with such Exhortations to
Repentance as would have melted an Heart of Adamant to have heard them; her
strains of Expression and Argument were truly Extraordinary; A person perhaps
of the best Education and Experience and of Attainments much beyond hers could
not have exceeded them: nevertheless when she came to these Words God, Lord,
Christ, Good, Repent, and some other such, her Mouth could not utter them,
whereupon she would somtimes in an Angry Parenthesis complain of their
Wickedness in stopping that Word, but she would then go on with some other
Terms that would serve to tell what she ment. And I believe that if the most
suspicious Person in the world had beheld all the Circumstances of this matter,
he would have said it could not have been dissembled.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 10. Not only in the Swedish, but also
in the Salem Witchcraft the Inchanted People have talked much of a White Spirit
from whence they received marvellous Assistances in their Miseries; what lately
befel Mercy Short from the Communications of such a Spirit, hath been the just
Wonder of us all, but by such a Spirit was Margaret Rule now also visited. She
says that she could never see his Face; but that she had a frequent view of his
bright, Shining and Glorious Garments; he stood by her Bed-side continually
heartning and comforting of her and counselling her to maintain her Faith and
hope in God, and never comply with the temptations of her Adversaries; she says
he told her, that God had permitted her Affictions to befall her for the everlasting
and unspeakable good of her own Soul, and for the good of many others, and for
his own Immortal Glory, and that she should therefore be of good Chear and be
assured of a speedy deliverance; And the wonderful resolution of mind wherewith
she encountered her Afflictions were but agreeable to such expectations.
Moreover a Minister<ref target="n195">[195]</ref> having one Day with some Importunity Prayed for the
deliverance of this Young Woman, and pleaded

<pb n="317"/>




that she belong'd to his Flock and charge; he had so far a right unto her as that
he was to do the part of a Minister of our Lord for the bringing of her home unto
God; only now the Devil hindred him in doing that which he had a right thus to
do, and whereas He had a better Title unto her to bring her home to God than the
Divel could have unto her to carry her away from the Lord, he therefore humbly
applied himself unto God, who alone could right this matter, with a suit that she
might be rescued out of Satans Hands; Immediatly upon this, tho' she heard
nothing of this transaction she began to call that Minister her Father, and that was
the Name whereby she every day before all sorts of People distinguished him: the
occasion of it she says was this, the white Spirit presently upon this transaction
did after this manner speak to her, &ldquo;Margaret, you now are to take notice
that&rdquo; (such a Man) &ldquo;is your Father, God has given you to him, do
you from this time look upon him as your Father, obey him, regard him as your
Father, follow his Counsels and you shall do well&rdquo;; And tho' there was
one passage more, which I do as little know what to make of as any of the Rest,
I am now going to relate it; more than three times have I seen it fulfilled in the
Deliverance of Inchanted and Possest Persons, whom the Providence of God has
cast into my way, that their Deliverance could not be obtained before the third
Fast kept for them, and the third day still obtain'd the Deliverance, altho' I have
thought of beseeching of the Lord thrice, when buffeted by Satan, yet I must
earnestly Intreat all my Readers to beware of any superstitious conceits upon the
Number Three; if our God will hear us upon once Praying and Fasting before
him 'tis well, and if he will not vouchsafe his Mercy upon our thrice doing so,
yet we must not be so discouraged as to throw by our Devotion but if the
Soveraign Grace of our God will in any particular Instances count our Patience
enough tryed when we have Solemnly waited upon him for any determinate
Number of times, who shall say to him, what doest thou, and if there shall be any
Number of Instances, wherein this Grace of our God has exactly holden the same
course, it may have a room in our humble Observations, I hope, without any
Superstition; I say then that after Margaret Rule had been more than five weeks
in her Miseries, this White Spirit said unto her, &ldquo;Well

<pb n="318"/>




this day such a Man&rdquo; (whom he named<ref target="n196">[196]</ref>) &ldquo;has kept a third day for
your deliverance, now be of good cheer you shall speedily be delivered.&rdquo;
I inquired whether what had been said of that Man were true, and I gained exact
and certain Information that it was precisely so, but I doubt lest in relating this
Passage that I have used more openness than a Friend should be treated with, and
for that cause I have concealed several of the most memorable things that have
occurred not only in this but in some former Histories, altho indeed I am not so
well satisfied about the true nature of this white Spirit, as to count that I can do
a Friend much Honour by reporting what notice this white Spirit may have thus
taken of him.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 11. On the last day of the Week her
Tormentors as she thought and said, approaching towards her, would be forced
still to recoil and retire as unaccountably unable to meddle with her, and they
would retire to the Fire side with their Poppets; but going to stick Pins into those
Poppets, they could not (according to their visions) make the Pins to enter, she
insulted over them with a very Proper derision, daring them now to do their
worst, whilst she had the satisfaction to see their Black Master strike them and
kick them, like an Overseer of so many Negro's, to make them to do their work,
and renew the marks of his vengeance on them, when they failed of doing of it.
At last being as it were tired with their ineffectual Attempts to mortifie her they
furiously said, &ldquo;Well you shant be the last.&rdquo; And after a pause they
added, &ldquo;Go, and the Devil go with you, we can do no more&rdquo;;
whereupon they flew out of the Room and she returning perfectly to her self most
affectionately gave thanks to God for her deliverance; her Tormentors left her
extream weak and faint, and overwhelmed with Vapours, which would not only
cause her sometimes to Swoon away, but also now and then for a little while
discompose the reasonableness of her Thoughts; Nevertheless her former troubles
returned not, but we are now waiting to see the good effects of those troubles
upon the Souls of all concern'd. And now I suppose that some of our Learned
witlings of the Coffee-House, for fear lest these proofs of an Invisible-world
should spoil some of their sport, will endeavour to turn them all into sport, for
which Buffoonary their only

<pb n="319"/>




pretence will be, they cant understand how such things as these could be done,
whereas indeed he that is but Philosopher enough to have read but one Little
Treatise, Published in the Year 1656 by no other Man than the Chyrurgion of an
Army,<ref target="n197">[197]</ref> or but one Chap. of
Helmont,<ref target="n198">[198]</ref> which I will not quote at this time too
particularly, may give a far more intelligible account of these Appearances than
most of these Blades can give why and how their Tobacco makes 'em Spit; or
which way the flame of their Candle becomes illuminating. As for that cavil, the
world would be undone if the Devils could have such power as they seem to have
in several of our stories, it may be Answered that as to many things the Lying
Devils have only known them to be done, and then pretended unto the doing of
those things, but the true and best Answer is, that by these things we only see
what the Devils could have powers to do, if the great God should give them those
powers, whereas now our Histories affords a Glorious Evidence for the being of
a God, the World would indeed be undone, and horribly undone, if these Devils,
who now and then get liberty to play some very mischievous pranks, were not
under a daily restraint of some Almighty Superior from doing more of such
Mischiefs. Wherefore instead of all Apish flouts and jeers at Histories, which
have such undoubted confirmation, as that no Man that has breeding enough to
regard the Common Laws of Humane Society, will offer to doubt of 'em, it
becomes us rather to adore the Goodness of God, who does not permit such
things every day to befall us all, as he sometimes did permit to befall some few
of our miserable Neighbours.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 12. And what, after all my unwearied
Cares and

<pb n="320"/>




Pains, to rescue the Miserable from the Lions and Bears of Hell, which had
siezed them, and after all my Studies to disappoint the Devils in their designs to
confound my Neighbourhood, must I be driven to the necessity of an Apologie?
Truly the hard representations wherewith some Ill Men have reviled my conduct,
and the Countenance which other Men have given to these representations, oblige
me to give Mankind some account of my Behaviour; No Christian can, I say none
but evil workers can criminate my visiting such of my poor flock as have at any
time fallen under the terrible and sensible molestations of Evil-Angels; let their
Afflictions have been what they will, I could not have answered it unto my
Glorious Lord, if I had withheld my just Counsels and Comforts from them; and
if I have also with some exactness observ'd the methods of the Invisible-World,
when they have thus become observable, I have been but a Servant of Mankind
in doing so; yea no less a Person than the Venerable Baxter has more than once
or twice in the most Publick manner invited Mankind to thank me for that
Service.<ref target="n199">[199]</ref> I have not been insensible of a greater danger attending me in this
fulfilment of my Ministry, than if I had been to take Ten Thousand steps over a
Rocky Mountain fill'd with Rattle-Snakes, but I have consider'd, he that is wise
will observe things, and the Surprizing Explication and confirmation of the
biggest part of the Bible, which I have seen given in these things, has abundantly
paid me for observing them. Now in my visiting of the Miserable, I was always
of this opinion that we were Ignorant of what Powers the Devils might have to
do their mischiefs in the shapes of some that had never been explicitly engaged
in Diabolical Confederacies, and that therefore tho' many Witchcrafts had been
fairly detected on Enquiries provoked and begun by Specteral Exhibitions, yet we
could not easily be too jealous<ref target="n200">[200]</ref> of the Snares laid for us in the devices of Satan;
the World knows how many Pages I have Composed and Published, and
particular Gentlemen in the Government know how many Letters I have written
to prevent the excessive Credit of

<pb n="321"/>




Specteral Accusations, wherefore I have still charged the Afflicted that they
should Cry out of no body for Afflicting of 'em. But that if this might be any
Advantage they might privately tell their minds to some one Person of discretion
enough to make no ill use of their communications, accordingly there has been
this effect of it, that the Name of No one good Person in the World ever came
under any blemish by means of any Afflicted Person that fell under my particular
cognisance, yea no one Man, Woman or Child ever came into any trouble for the
sake of any that were Afflicted after I had once begun to look after'em; how
often have I had this thrown into my dish, that many years ago I had an
opportunity to have brought forth such People as have in the late storm of
Witchcraft been complain'd of, but that I smother'd all, and after that storm was
rais'd at Salem, I did myself offer to provide Meat, Drink and Lodging for no
less than Six of the Afflicted, that so an Experiment might be made, whether
Prayer with Fasting upon the removal of the distressed might not put a Period to
the trouble then rising, without giving the Civil Authority the trouble of
prosecuting those things which nothing but a Conscientious regard unto the cries
of Miserable Families, could have overcome the Reluctancies of the Honourable
Judges to meddle with; In short I do humbly but freely affirm it, there is not that
Man living in this World who has been more desirous than the poor Man I to
shelter my Neighbours from the Inconveniencies of Spectral Outcries, yea I am
very jealous I have done so much that way as to Sin in what I have done, such
have been the Cowardize and Fearfulness whereunto my regard unto the
dissatisfactions of other People has precipitated me. I know a Man in the World,
who has thought he has been able to Convict some such Witches as ought to Dye,
but his respect unto the Publick Peace has caused him rather to try whether He
could not renew them by Repentance: And as I have been Studious to defeat the
Devils of their expectations to set people together by the Ears, thus, I have also
checked and quell'd those forbidden curiosities, which would have given the devil
an invitation to have tarried amongst us, when I have seen wonderful Snares laid
for Curious People, by the secret and future things discovered from the Mouths
of Damsels possest with a

<pb n="322"/>




Spirit of divination; Indeed I can recollect but one thing wherein there could be
given so much as a Shadow of Reason for Exceptions, and that is my allowing
of so many to come and see those that were Afflicted, now for that I have this to
say, that I have almost a Thousand times intreated the Friends of the Miserable,
that they would not permit the Intrusion of any Company, but such as by Prayers
or other ways might be helpful to them; Nevertheless I have not absolutely forbid
all Company from coming to your Haunted Chambers, partly because the
Calamities of the Families were such as required the Assistance of many Friends;
partly because I have been willing that there should be disinterested Witnesses of
all sorts, to confute the Calumnies of such as would say all was but Imposture;
and partly because I saw God had Sanctified the Spectacle of the Miseries on the
Afflicted unto the Souls of many that were Spectators, and it is a very Glorious
thing that I have now to mention &mdash; The Devils have with most horrendous
operations broke in upon our Neighbourhood, and God has at such a rate
over-ruled all the Fury and Malice of those Devils, that all the Afflicted have not
only been Delivered, but I hope also savingly brought home unto God, and the
Reputation of no one good Person in the World has been damaged, but instead
thereof the Souls of many, especially of the rising Generation, have been thereby
awaken'd unto some acquaintance with Religion; our young People who belonged
unto the Praying Meetings, of both Sexes, a part would ordinarily spend whole
Nights by the whole Weeks together in Prayers and Psalms upon these occasions,
in which Devotions the Devils could get nothing but like Fools a Scourge for their
own Backs, and some scores of other young People, who were strangers to real
Piety, were now struck with the lively demonstrations of Hell evidently set forth
before their Eyes, when they saw Persons cruelly Frighted, wounded and Starved
by Devils and Scalded with burning Brimstone, and yet so preserved in this

Benefits; I am not so vain as to say that any Wisdome or Vertue of mine did
contribute unto this good order of things: But I am so just, as to say I did not
hinder this Good. When therefore there have been those that pickt up little
incoherent scraps and bits of my Discourses in this faithful discharge of my
Ministry, and so traversted<ref target="n201">[201]</ref> 'em in
their abusive Pamphlets,<ref target="n202">[202]</ref> as to perswade the
Town that I was their common Enemy in those very points, wherein, if in any
one thing whatsoever, I have sensibly approved my self as true a Servant unto
'em as possibly I could, tho my Life and Soul had been at Stake for it, Yea to do
like Satan himself, by sly, base, unpretending Insinuations, as if I wore not the
Modesty and Gravity which became a Minister of the Gospel, I could not but
think my self unkindly dealt withal, and the neglects of others to do me justice
in this affair has caused me to conclude this Narrative with complaints in another
hearing of such Monstrous Injuries.<ref target="n203">[203]</ref></p>

<note id="n203"><seg type="note-symbol">[203]</seg> <p>The story of Margaret Rule is told again in Mather's <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> (I. 171 ff.) and in a way that throws fresh light on
his relation to the case.</p><p>&ldquo;About a Week after the Beginning of September, being sollicitous
to do some further Service, for the Name of God, I took a Journey to Salem.
There, I not only sought a further Supply of my Furniture for my
Church-History, but also endeavoured, that the complete History of the late
Witchcrafts and Possessions might not bee lost. I judg'd that the Preservacion of
that History might in a while bee a singular Benefit unto the Church, and unto the
World, which made mee sollicitous about it. Moreover, I was willing to preach
the Word of God unto the numerous Congregation at Salem; which I did, on both
Parts of the Sabbath, not only with a most glorious Assistence of Heaven, but
also with some Assurance of Good thereby to bee done among the People. But
I had one singular Unhappiness, which befel mee, in this Journey. I had largely
written three Discourses, which I designed both to preach at Salem, and hereafter
to print. These Notes were before the Sabbath stolen from mee, with such
Circumstances, that I am somewhat satisfied, The Spectres, or Agents in the
invisible World, were the Robbers. This Diaster had like to have disturbed my
Designs for the Sabbath; but God helped mee to remember a great part of what
I had written, and to deliver also many other Things, which else I had not now
made use of. So that the Divel gott nothing!</p><p>&ldquo;Among
other things which entertained mee at Salem, one was, a
Discourse with one Mrs. Carver, who had been strangely visited with some
shining Spirits, which were good Angels, in her opinion of them.</p><p>&ldquo;She
intimated several things unto mee whereof some were to be
kept secret. Shee also told mee, That a new Storm of Witchcraft would fall upon
the Countrey, to chastise the Iniquity that was used in the wilful Smothering and
Covering of the Last; and that many fierce Opposites to the Discovery of that
Witchcraft would bee thereby convinced.</p><p>&ldquo;Unto my
Surprise, when I came home, I found one of my
Neighbours horribly arrested by evil Spirits. I then beg'd of God, that Hee would
help mee wisely to discharge my Duty upon this occasion, and avoid gratifying
of the evil Angels in any of their Expectations. I did then concern myself to use
and gett as much Prayer as I could for the afflicted young Woman; and at the
same time, to forbid, either her from accusing any of her Neighbours, or others
from enquiring any thing of her. Nevertheless, a wicked Man wrote a most lying
Libel to revile my Conduct in these matters; which drove mee to the Blessed
God, with my Supplications that Hee would wonderfully protect mee, as well
from unreasonable Men acted by the Divels, as from the Divels themselves. I did
at first, it may bee, too much resent the Injuries of that Libel; but God brought
good out of it; it occasioned the Multiplication of my Prayers before Him; it very
much promoted the Works of Humiliation and Mortification in my Soul. Indeed,
the Divel made that Libel an Occasion of those Paroxysms in the Town, that
would have exceedingly gratify'd him, if God had not helped mee to forgive and
forgett the Injuries done unto mee, and to bee deaf unto the Sollicitations of those
that would have had mee so to have resented the Injuries of some few Persons,
as to have deserted the Lecture at the Old Meeting house.</p><p>&ldquo;When the
afflicted young woman had undergone six Weeks of
pr&aelig;ternatural Calamities and when God had helped mee to keep just three
Dayes of Prayer on her behalf, I had the Pleasure of seeing the same Success,
which I used to have, on my third Fast, for such possessed People, as have been
cast into my cares. God gave her a glorious Deliverance; The remarkable
Circumstances whereof, I have more fully related, in an History of the whole
Business.</p><p>&ldquo;As for my
missing Notes, the possessed young Woman, of her own
Accord, enquir'd whether I missed them not? Shee told mee, the Spectres brag'd
in her hearing, that they had rob't mee of them; shee added, Bee n't concern'd;
for they confess, they can't keep them alwayes from you; you shall have them all
brought you again. (They were Notes on Ps. 119. 19 and Ps. 90. 12 and Hag. 1.
7, 9. I was tender of them and often pray'd unto God, that they might bee
return'd.) On the fifth of October following, every Leaf of my Notes again came
into my Hands, tho' they were in eighteen separate Quarters of Sheets. They were
found drop't here and there, about the Streets of Lyn; but how they came to bee
so drop't I cannot imagine; and I as much wonder at the Exactness of their
Pr&aelig;servation.&rdquo;</p><p>And under October 10th
he adds: &ldquo;On this Day, I also visited a
possessed young Woman in the Neighbourhood, whose Distresses were not the
least occasion of my being thus before the Lord. I wrestled with God for her: and
among other things, I pleaded, that God had made it my Office and Business to
engage my Neighbours in the Service of the Lord Jesus Christ; and that this
young Woman had expressed her Compliance with my Invitations unto that
Service; only that the evil Spirits now hindred her from doing what shee had
vowd: and therefore that I had a sort of Right to demand her Deliverance from
these invading Divels, and to demand such a Liberty for her as might make her
capable of glorifying my Glorious Lord; which I did accordingly. In the close of
this Day, a wonderful Spirit, in White and bright Raiment, with a Face unseen,
appeared unto this young woman, and bid her count mee her Father, and regard
mee and obey mee, as her Father; for hee said, the Lord had given her to mee;
and she should now within a few Dayes bee delivered. It proved,
accordingly.&rdquo;</p><p>And again
in December (p. 178): &ldquo;And one memorable Providence,
I must not forgett. A young Woman being arrested, possessed, afflicted by evil
Angels, her Tormentors made my Image or Picture to appear before her, and then
made themselves Masters of her Tongue so far, that she began in her Fits to
complain that I threatened her and molested her, tho' when shee came out of
them, shee own'd, that they could not so much as make my dead Shape do her
any Harm, and that they putt a Force upon her Tongue in her Exclamations. Her
greatest Out-cries when shee was herself, were, for my poor Prayers to be
concerned on her behalf.</p><p>&ldquo;Being
hereupon extremely sensible, how much a malicious Town
and Land would insult over mee, if such a lying Piece of a Story should fly
abroad, that the Divels in my Shape tormented the Neighbourhood, I was putt
upon some Agonies, and singular Salleys and Efforts of Soul, in the Resignation
of my Name unto the Lord; content that if Hee had no further service for my
Name, it should bee torn to pieces with all the Reproches in the world. But I
cried unto the Lord as for the Deliverance of my Name, from the Malice of Hell,
so for the Deliverance of the young Woman, whom the Powers of Hell had now
seized upon. And behold! Without any further Noise, the possessed Person, upon
my praying by her, was delivered from her Captivity, on the very same Day that
shee fell into it; and the whole Plott of the Divel, to reproach a poor Servant of
the Lord Jesus Christ, was defeated.&rdquo;</p></note>

<p rend="center">September the 13th, 1693.</p>

<q>In the Evening when the Sun was withdrawn, giving place to Darkness to
succeed, I with some others were drawn by curiosity to see Margaret Rule, and
so much the rather because it was reported Mr. M &mdash; <ref target="n205">[205]</ref> would be there that
Night: Being come to her Fathers House into the Chamber wherein she was in
Bed, found her of a

<pb n="325"/>




healthy countenance of about seventeen Years Old, lying very still, and speaking
very little, what she did say seem'd as if she were Light-headed. Then Mr.
M &mdash; , Father and Son, came up and others with them, in the whole were
about 30 or 40 Persons; they being sat, the Father on a Stool, and the Son upon
the Bedside by her, the Son began to question her, Margaret Rule, how do you
do? then a pause without any answer. <hi rend="italic">Question</hi>.
What, do there a great many Witches sit upon you? <hi
rend="italic">Answer</hi>. Yes. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you
not know that there is a hard Master? Then she was in a Fit; He laid his hand
upon her Face and Nose, but, as he said, without perceiving Breath; then he
brush'd her on the Face with his Glove, and rubb'd her Stomach (her breast not
covered with the Bed-cloaths) and bid others do so too, and said it eased her, then
she revived. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Don't you know there is a hard
Master? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi
rend="italic">Reply</hi>; Don't serve that hard Master, you know who.
<hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you believe? Then again she was in a Fit,
and he again rub'd her Breast, etc. (about this time Margaret Perd an attendant
assisted him in rubbing of her. The Afflicted spake angerely to her saying don't
you meddle with me, and hastily put away her hand) he wrought his Fingers
before her Eyes and asked her if she saw the Witches? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. No. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you

<pb n="326"/>




believe? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>.
Do you believe in you know who? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. Would you have other people do so too, to believe in
you know who? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. Who is it that Afflicts you? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. I know not, there is a great many of them (about this
time the Father question'd if she knew the Spectres? An attendant said, if she did
she would not tell; The Son proceeded) <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You have
seen the Black-man, hant<ref target="n206">[206]</ref> you? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No. <hi
rend="italic">Reply</hi>; I hope you never shall. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. You have had a Book offered you, hant you? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. No. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. The brushing of
you gives you ease, don't it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. She turn'd her
selfe and a little Groan'd. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now the Witches
Scratch you and Pinch you, and Bite you, don't they? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. Then he put his hand upon her Breast and Belly,
<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> on the Cloaths over her, and felt a Living thing,
as he said, which moved the Father also to feel, and some others; <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. Don't you feel the Live thing in the Bed? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. No. <hi rend="italic">Reply</hi>, that is only
Fancie. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. the great company of People increase
your Torment, don't they? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. The People
about were desired to withdraw. One Woman said, I am sure I am no Witch, I
will not go; so others, so none withdrew. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Shall
we go to Prayers? Then she lay in a Fit as before. But this time to revive her,
they waved a Hat and brushed her Head and Pillow therewith. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. Shall we go to <hi rend="italic">Pray</hi>, etc.
Spelling the Word. <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. The Father went

<pb n="327"/>




to Prayer for perhaps half an Hour, chiefly against the Power of the Devil and
Witchcraft, and that God would bring out the Afflicters: during Prayer-time, the
Son stood by, and when they thought she was in a Fit, rub'd her and brush'd her
as before, and beckned to others to do the like; after Prayer he proceeded; <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. You did not hear when we were at Prayer, did you?
<hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You dont
hear always, you dont hear sometimes past a Word or two, do you? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. No. Then turning him about said, this is just another
Mercy Short: Margaret Perd reply'd, she was not like her in her Fits. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. What does she eat or drink? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. Not eat at all; but drink Rum. Then he admonished
the young People to take warning, etc. Saying it was a sad thing to be so
Tormented by the Devil and his Instruments: A Young-man present in the habit
of a Seaman, reply'd this is the Devil all over. Than<ref target="n207">[207]</ref> the Ministers withdrew.
Soon after they were gon the Afflicted desired the Women to be gone, saying,
that the Company of the Men was not offensive to her, and having hold of the
hand of a Young-man, said to have been her Sweet-heart formerly, who was
withdrawing; She pull'd him again into his Seat, saying he should not go to
Night.</q>

<p rend="center">September the 19th, 1693.</p>


<q>This Night I renew'd my Visit, and found her rather of a fresher
Countenance than before, about eight Persons present with her, she was in a Fit
Screeming and making a Noise: Three or four Persons rub'd and brush'd her with
their hands, they said that the brushing did put them away, if they brush'd or
rub'd in the right place; therefore they brush'd and rub'd in several places, and
said that when they did it in the right place she could fetch her Breath, and by
that they knew. She being come to her self was soon in a merry talking Fit. A
Young-man came in and ask'd her how she did? She answered very bad, but at
present a little better; he soon told her he must be gon and bid her good Night,
at which she seem'd troubled, saying, that she liked his Company, and said she
would not have him go till she was well; adding, for I shall Die when you are
gon. Then she complained they did not put her on a clean Cap, but let her ly so
like a Beast, saying, she should lose her Fellows. She said she wondered any
People should be so Wicked as to think she was not Afflicted, but to think she
Dissembled. A Young-woman answered Yes, if they were to see you in this
merry Fit, they would say you Dissembled indeed; She reply'd, Mr. M &mdash;
said this was her laughing time, she must laugh now: She said Mr. M &mdash;
had been there this Evening, and she enquired, how long he had been gon? She
said,

<pb n="328"/>




he stay'd alone with her in the room half an Hour, and said that he told her there
were some that came for Spies, and to report about Town that she was not
Afflicted. That during the said time she had no Fit, that he asked her if she knew
how many times he had Prayed for her to Day? And that she answered that she
could not tell; and that he replyed he had Prayed for her Nine times to Day; the
Attendants said that she was sometimes in a Fit that none could open her Joynts,
and that there came an Old Iron-jaw'd Woman and try'd, but could not do it; they
likewise said, that her Head could not be moved from the Pillow; I try'd to move
her head, and found no more difficulty than another Bodies (and so did others)
but was not willing to offend by lifting it up, one being reproved for
endeavouring it, they saying angrily you will break her Neck; The Attendants said
Mr. M &mdash; would not go to Prayer with her when People were in the Room,
as they did one Night, that Night he felt the Live Creature. Margaret Perd and
another said they smelt Brimstone; I and others said we did not smell any; then
they said they did not know what it was: This Margaret said, she wish'd she had
been here when Mr. M &mdash; was here, another Attendant said, if you had
been here you might not have been permitted in, for her own Mother was not
suffered to be present.</q>


<p>Sir, after the sorest Affliction and greatest blemish to Religion that ever
befel this Countrey, and after most Men began to Fear that some undue steps had
been taken, and after His Excellency (with their Majesties
Approbation<ref target="n208">[208]</ref> as is
said) had put a stop to Executions, and Men began to hope there would never be
a return of the like; finding these Accounts to contain in them something
extraordinary, I writ them down the same Nights in order to attain the certainty
of them, and soon found them so confirmed that I have (besides other
Demonstrations) the whole, under the Hands of two Persons are ready to attest
the Truth of it; but not satisfied herewith, I shewed them to some of your
particular Friends,

<pb n="329"/>




that so I might have the greater certainty: But was much surprized with the

<p>Having expected some Weeks, your meeting me at Mr. Wilkins according
to what you intimated to Mr. J. M. &mdash; <ref target="n210">[210]</ref> and the time draw

<pb n="330"/>




ing near for our meeting elsewhere, I thought it not amiss to give you a Summary
of my thoughts in the great concern, which as you say has been agitated with so
much heat. That there are Witches is not the doubt, the Scriptures else were in
vain, which assign their Punishment to be by Death; But what this Witchcraft is,
or wherein it does consist, seems to be the whole difficulty: And as it may be
easily demonstrated, that all that bear that Name cannot be justly so accounted,
so that some things and Actions not so esteemed by the most, yet upon due
examination will be found to merit no better Character.</p>


<p>In your late Book you lay down a brief Synopsis of what has been written
on that Subject, by a Triumvirate of as Eminent Men as ever handled it (as you
are pleas'd to call them) <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> Mr.
Perkins,<ref target="n211">[211]</ref> Gaule,<ref target="n212">[212]</ref>
and Bernard<ref target="n213">[213]</ref> consisting of about 30 Tokens to know them by, many of them
distinct from, if not thwarting each other: Among all of which I can find but one
decisive, <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> That of Mr. Gaule, Head IV. and
runs thus; Among the most unhappy Circumstances to convict a Witch, one is a
maligning and oppugning the Word, Work, or Worship of God, and by any
extraordinary Sign seeking to seduce any from it, see Deu. 13. 1, 2. Mat. 24. 24.
Acts. 13. 8, 10. 2 Tim. 3. 8. Do but mark well the places, and for this very
property of thus opposing and perverting, they are all there concluded
<unclear></unclear> and absolute Witches.<ref target="n214">[214]</ref></p>


<p>This Head as here laid down and inserted by you, either is a Truth or not;
if not, why is it here inserted from one of the Triumvirate, if it be a Truth, as the
Scriptures quoted will abundantly testifie, whence is it that it is so little regarded,
tho it be the only Head well proved by Scripture, or that the rest of the
Triumvirate should so far forget their Work as not to mention it. It were to be
unjust to the Memory of those otherwise Wise Men, to suppose them to have any
Sinister design; But perhaps the force of a prevailing opinion, together with an
Education thereto Suited, might over

<pb n="331"/>




shadow their Judgments, as being wont to be but too prevalent in many other
cases. But if the above be Truth, then the Scripture is full and plain, What is
Witchcraft? And if so, what need of his next Head of Hanging of People without
as full and clear Evidence as in other Cases? Or what need of the rest of the
Receipts of the Triumvirate? what need of Praying that the Afflicted may be able
to discover who tis that Afflicts them? or what need of Searching for Tet's for the
Devil to Suck in his Old Age, or the Experiment of saying the Lords Prayer, etc.
Which<ref target="n215">[215]</ref> a multitude more practised in some places Superstitiously inclin'd. Other
Actions have been practised for easing the Afflicted, less justifiable, if not
strongly savouring of Witchcraft it self, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Fondly
Imagining by the Hand, etc., to drive off Spectres, or to knock off Invisible
Chains, or by striking in the Air to Wound either the Afflicted or others, etc. I
write not this to accuse any, but that all may beware believing, That the Devil's
bounds are set, which he cannot pass, That the Devils are so full of Malice, That
it cant be added to by Mankind, That where he hath Power, he neither can nor
will omit Executing it, That 'tis only the Almighty that sets bounds to his rage,
and that only can Commissionate him to hurt or destroy any.</p>


<p>These last, Sir, are such Foundations of Truth, in my esteem, that I cannot
but own it to be my duty to ascert them, when call'd tho' with the hazard of my
All: And consequently to detect such as these, That a Witch can Commissionate
Devils to Afflict Mortals, That he can at his or the Witches pleasure Assume any
Shape, That Hanging or Chaining of Witches can lessen his Power of Afflicting,
or restore those that were at a distance Tormented, with many others depending
on these; all tending, in my esteem, highly to the Dishonour of God, and the
Indangering the well-being of a People, and do further add, that as the Scriptures
are full that there is Witchcraft, (<hi rend="italic">ui sup.</hi>) so 'tis as
plain that there are Possessions, and that the Bodies of the Possest have hence
been not only Afflicted, but strangely agitated, if not their Tongues improved to
foretell futurities, etc. and why not to accuse the Innocent, as bewitching them;
having pretence to Divination to gain credence. This being reasonable to be
expected, from him who is the Father of Lies, to the end he may thereby involve
a Countrey in Blood, Mallice, and Evil, surmising which he greedily seeks after,
and so finally lead them from their fear and dependence upon God to fear him,
and a supposed Witch thereby attaining his end upon Mankind; and not only so,
but Natural Distemper, as has been frequently observed by the Judicious, have
so operated as to deceive, more than the Vulgar, as

is testified by many Famous Physicians, and others. And as for that proof of
Multitudes of Confessions, this Countrey may be by this time thought Competent

Instances, as also how obtain'd.</p>

you, not to account it the worse for coming from so mean a hand; which however
you may have receiv'd Prejudices, etc., Am ready to serve you to my Power; but

<p>In Answer to this last, Sir, you replyed to the Gentleman that presented
it, that you had nothing to Prosecute against me; and said as to your Sentiments
in your Books, you did not bind any to believe them, and then again renew'd
your promise of meeting me, as before, tho' not yet performed. Accordingly, tho'
I waited at Sessions, there was none to object ought against me, upon which I
was dismissed. This gave me some reason to believe that you intended all should
have been forgotten; But instead of that, I find the Coals are fresh blown up, I

<p>Whereas you intimate your desires, that what's not fairly, (I take it for
granted you mean truly also,) represented in a Paper you lately sent me,
containing a pretended Narrative of a Visit by my Father and self to an Afflicted
Young woman, whom we apprehended to be under a Diabolical Possession, might
be rectified: I have this to say, as I have often already said, that I do scarcely
find any one thing in the whole Paper, whether respecting my Father or self,
either fairly or truly represented. Nor can I think that any that know my Parents
Circumstances, but must think him deserving a better Character by far, than this
Narrative can be thought to give him. When the main design we managed in
Visiting the poor Afflicted Creature, was to prevent the Accusations of the
Neighbourhood, can it be fairly represented that our design was to draw out such
Accusations, which is the representation

<pb n="334"/>




of the Paper? We have Testimonies of the best Witnesses and in Number not a
few, That when we asked Rule whether she thought she knew who Tormented
her? the Question was but an Introduction to the Solemn charges which we then
largely gave, that she should rather Dye than tell the Names of any whom she
might Imagine that she knew. Your Informers have reported the Question, and
report nothing of what follows, as essential to the giving of that Question: And
can this be termed a piece of fairness? Fair it cannot be, that when Ministers
Faithfully and Carefully discharge their Duty to the Miserable in their Flock, little
bits, scraps and shreds of their Discourses should be tackt together to make them
contemtible, when there shall be no notice of all the Necessary, Seasonable, and
Profitable things that occur'd, in those Discourses; And without which, the
occasion of the lesser Passages cannot be understood; And yet I am furnished
with abundant Evidences, ready to be Sworn, that will possitively prove this part
of unfairness, by the above mention'd Narrative, to be done both to my Father
and self. Again, it seems not fair or reasonable that I should be expos'd, for
which your self (not to say some others) might have expos'd me for, if I had not
done, <hi rend="italic">Viz.
</hi> for discouraging so much Company from flocking about the Possest
Maid, and yet, as I perswade my self, you cannot but think it to be good advice,
to keep much Company from such haunted Chambers; besides the unfairness doth
more appear, in that I find nothing repeated of what I said about the advantage,
which the Devil takes from too much Observation and Curiosity.</p>


<p>In that several of the Questions in the Paper are so Worded, as to carry in
them a presupposal of the things inquired after, to say the best of it is very
unfair: But this is not all, the Narrative contains a number of Mistakes and
Falshoods; which were they willful and design'd, might justly be termed gross
Lies. The representations are far from true, when 'tis affirm'd my Father and self
being come into the Room, I began the Discourse; I hope I understand breeding
a little better than so: For proof of this, did occasion serve, sundry can depose
the contrary.</p>


<p>'Tis no less untrue, that either my Father or self put the Question, how
many Witches sit upon you? We always

<pb n="335"/>




cautiously avoided that expression; It being contrary to our inward belief: All the
standers by will (I believe) Swear they did not hear us use it (your Witnesses
excepted) and I tremble to think how hardy those woful Creatures must be, to call
the Almighty by an Oath, to so false a thing. As false a representation 'tis, that
I rub'd Rule's Stomach, her Breast not being covered. The Oath of the nearest
Spectators, giving a true account of that matter will prove this to be little less
than a gross (if not a doubled) Lie; and to be somewhat plainer, it carries the
Face of a Lie contrived on purpose (by them at least, to whom you are beholden
for the Narrative) Wickedly and Basely to expose me. For you cannot but know
how much this Representation hath contributed, to make People believe a Smutty
thing of me; I am far from thinking, but that in your own Conscience you
believe, that no indecent Action of that Nature could then be done by me before
such observers, had I been so Wicked as to have been inclin'd to what is Base.
It looks next to impossible that a reparation shoud be made me for the wrong
done to, I hope, as to any Scandal, an unblemish'd, tho' weak and small Servant
of the Church of God. Nor is what follows a less untruth, that 'twas an Attendant
and not my self who said, if Rule knows who Afflicts her, yet she wont tell. I
therefore spoke it that I might incourage her to continue in that concealment of
all Names whatsoever; to this I am able to furnish my self with the Attestation
of Sufficient Oaths. 'Tis as far from true, that my apprehension of the Imp, about
Rule, was on her Belly, for the Oaths of the Spectators, and even of those that
thought they felt it, can testify that 'twas upon the Pillow, at a distance from her
Body. As untrue a Representation is that which follows, <hi
rend="italic">Viz.</hi> That it was said unto her, that her not Apprehending
of that odd palpable, tho' not visible, Mover was from her Fancy, for I
endeavoured to perswade her that it might be but Fancy in others, that there was
any such thing at all. Witnesses every way sufficient can be produced for this
also. 'Tis falsely represented that my Father felt on the Young-woman after the
appearance mentioned, for his hand was never near her; Oath can sufficiently
vindicate him. 'Tis very untrue that my Father Prayed for perhaps half an Hour,
against the power of the Devil and Witchcraft, and that God would bring out the

<pb n="336"/>




Afflictors. Witnesses of the best Credit, can depose, that his Prayer was not a
quarter of an Hour, and that there was no more than about one clause towards the
close of the Prayer, which was of this import; And this clause also was guarded
with a singular wariness and modesty, <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> If there
were any evil Instruments in this matter God would please to discover them: And
that there was more than common reason for that Petition I can satisfie any one
that will please to Inquire of me. And strange it is, that a Gentleman that from
18 to 54 hath been an Exemplary Minister of the Gospel; and that besides a
station in the Church of God, as considerable as any that his own Country can
afford, hath for divers years come off with Honour, in his Application to three
Crown'd Heads, and the chiefest Nobility of three Kingdoms, Knows not yet how
to make one short Prayer of a quarter of an hour, but in New-England he must
be Libell'd for it. There are divers other down-right mistakes, which you have
permitted your self, I would hope not knowingly, and with a Malicious design,
to be receiver or Compiler of, which I shall now forbear to Animadvert upon. As
for the Appendix of the Narrative I do find myself therein Injuriously treated, for
the utmost of your proof for what you say of me, amounts to little more than,
<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Some People told you, that others told them,
that such and such things did pass, but you may assure yourself, that I am not
unfurnish'd with Witnesses, that can convict the same. Whereas you would give
me to believe the bottom of these your Methods, to be some dissatisfaction about
the commonly receiv'd Power of Devils and Witches; I do not only with all
freedom offer you the use of any part of my Library, which you may see cause
to peruse on that Subject, but also if you and any else, whom you please, will
visit me at my Study, yea, or meet me at any other place, less inconvenient than
those by you propos'd; I will with all the fairness and calmness in the World
dispute the point. I beg of God that he would bestow as many Blessings on you,
as ever on myself, and out of a sincere wish, that you may be made yet more
capable of these Blessings, I take this occasion to lay before you the faults (not
few nor small ones neither) which the Paper contained, you lately sent me in
order to be Examined by me. In case you want a true and full Narrative of my

<pb n="337"/>




Visit, whereof such an indecent Traversty (to say the best) hath been made, I am
not unwilling to communicate it, in mean time must take liberty to say, 'Tis
scarcely consistent with Common Civility, much less Christian Charity, to offer
the Narrative, now with you, for a true one, till you have a truer, or for a full
one, till you have a fuller. Your Sincere (tho Injur'd) Friend and Servant,</p>

<p>Yours of the 15th Instant, I receiv'd yesterday; and soon found I had
promised my self too much by it, <hi rend="italic">Viz</hi>, Either
concurrence with, or a denial of those Fundamentals mentioned in mine, of
Novem. the 24th, finding this waved by an Invitation to your Library, etc. I thank
God I have the Bible, and do Judge that sufficient to demonstrate that cited Head
of Mr. Gaule to be a Truth, as also those other Heads mentioned, as the
Foundations of Religion. And in my apprehension, if it be asked any Christian,
whether God governs the World, and whether it be he only can Commissionate
Devils, and such other Fundamentals, He ought to be as ready as in the Question,
who made him? (a little Writing certainly might be of more use, to clear up the
controverted points, than either looking over many Books in a well furnish'd
Library, or than a dispute, if I were qualified for it; the Inconveniencies of
Passion being this way best avoided) And am not without hopes that you will yet
oblige me so far, as to consider that Letter, and if I Err, to let me see it by
Scripture, etc.</p>


<p>Yours, almost the whole of it, is concerning the Narrative I sent to you,
and you seem to intimate as if I were giving

<pb n="339"/>




Characters, Reflections, and Libell's etc. concerning your self and Relations; all
which were as far from my thoughts, as ever they were in writing after either
your self, or any other Minister. In the front you declare your apprehension to
be, that the Afflicted was under a Diabolical Possession, and if so, I see not how
it should be occasion'd by any Witchcraft (unless we ascribe that Power to a
Witch, which is only the Prerogative of the Almighty, of Sending or
Commissionating the Devils to Afflict her.) But to your particular Objections
against the Narrative; and to the first my intelligence not giving me any further,
I could not insert that I knew not. And it seems improbable that a Question
should be put, whether she knew (or rather who they were) and at the same time
to charge her, and that upon her Life, not to tell, and if you had done so, I see
but little good you could promise your self or others by it, she being Possest, as
also having it inculcated so much to her of Witchcraft. And as to the next
Objection about company flocking, etc., I do profess my Ignorance, not knowing
what you mean by it. And Sir, that most of the Questions did carry with them a
presupposing the things inquired after, is evident, if there were such as those
relating to the Black-man and a Book, and about her hearing the Prayer, etc.
(related in the said Narrative, which I find no Objection against.) As to that
which is said of mentioning your self first discoursing and your hopes that your
breeding was better (I doubt it not) nor do I doubt your Father might first apply
himself to others; but my intelligence is, that you first spake to the Afflicted or
Possessed, for which you had the advantage of a nearer approach. The next two
Objections are founded upon mistakes: I find not in the Narrative any such
Question, as how many Witches sit upon you? and that her Breast was not
covered, in which those material words &ldquo;with the Bed-Cloaths&rdquo; are
wholly omitted; I am not willing to retort here your own Language upon you; but
can tell you, that your own discourse of it publickly, at Sir W.
P.'s<ref target="n221">[221]</ref> Table, has
much more contributed to, etc. As to the Reply, if she could she would not tell,
whether either or both spake it it matters not much. Neither does the Narrative
say you felt the live thing on her Belly; tho I omit now to say what further
demonstrations there are

<pb n="340"/>




of it. As to that Reply, that is only her fancy, I find the word &ldquo;her&rdquo;
added. And as to your Fathers feeling for the live Creature after you had felt it,
if it were on the Bed it was not so very far from her. And for the length of his
Prayer, possibly your Witnesses might keep a more exact account of the time than
those others, and I stand not for a few Minutes. For the rest of the Objections I
suppose them of less moment, if less can be (however shall be ready to receive
them, those matters of greatest concern I find no Objections against). These being
all that yet appear, it may be thought that if the Narrative be not fully exact, it
was as near as Memory could bear away; but should be glad to see one more
perfect (which yet is not to be expected, seeing none writ at the time). You
mention the appendix, by which I understand the Second Visit, and if you be by
the possessed belyed (as being half an hour with her alone, excluding her own
Mother, and as telling her you had Prayed for her Nine times that day, and that
now was her Laughing time, she must Laugh now) I can see no Wonder in it;
what can be expected less from the Father of Lies, by whom, you Judge, she was
possest.</p>


<p>And besides the above Letter, you were pleased to send me another Paper
containing several Testimonies of the Possessed being lifted up, and held a space
of several Minutes to the Garret floor, etc., but they omit giving the account,
whether after she was down they bound her down: or kept holding her: And
relate not how many were to pull her down, which hinders the knowledge what
number they must be to be stronger than an Invisible Force. Upon the whole, I
suppose you expect I should believe it; and if so, the only advantage gain'd, is
that which has been so long controverted between Protestants and Papists,
whether Miracles are ceast, will hereby seem to be decided for the latter; it
being, for ought I can see, if so, as true a Miracle as for Iron to swim, and that
the Devil can work such Miracles.</p>


<p>But Sir, leaving these little disputable things, I do again pray that you
would let me have the happiness of your approbation or confutation of that Letter
before referred to.</p>


<p>And now, Sir, that the God of all Grace may enable us Zealously to own
his Truths, and to follow those things that tend to Peace, and that yourself may
be as an useful Instrument

<pb n="341"/>




in his hand, effectually to ruin the remainders of Heathenish and Popish
Superstitions, is the earnest desire and prayer of yours to command, in what I
may.</p>

<head>PART V. <hi rend="italic">An Impartial Account of the most Memorable Matters
of Fact, touching the supposed Witchcraft in New England</hi>.<ref target="n223">[223]</ref></head>


<p>Mr. Parris had been some years a Minister in Salem-Village,<ref target="n224">[224]</ref> when this
sad Calamity (as a deluge) overflowed them, spreading it self far and near: He
was a Gentleman of Liberal Education, and not meeting with any great
Encouragement, or Advantage in Merchandizing, to which for some time he
apply'd himself, betook himself to the work of the Ministry; this Village being
then vacant, he met with so much Encouragement, as to settle in that Capacity
among them.</p>


<p>After he had been there about two years, he obtained a Grant from a part
of the Town, that the House and Land he Occupied, and which had been Alotted
by the whole People to the Ministry, should be and remain to him, etc. as his
own Estate in Fee Simple. This occasioned great Divisions both between the
Inhabitants themselves, and between a considerable part of them and their said
Minister, which Divisions were but as a beginning or Pr&aelig;ludium to what
immediately followed.</p>


<p>It was the latter end of February 1691,<ref target="n225">[225]</ref> when divers young Persons
belonging to Mr. Parris's Family, and one or

<pb n="342"/>

more of the Neighbourhood, began to Act, after a strange and unusual manner,
<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> as by getting into Holes, and creeping under
Chairs and Stools, and to use sundry odd Postures and Antick Gestures, uttering
foolish, ridiculous Speeches, which neither they themselves nor any others could
make sense of; the Physicians that were called could assign no reason for this; but
it seems one of them,<ref target="n226">[226]</ref> having recourse to the old shift, told them he was afraid
they were Bewitched; upon such suggestions, they that were concerned applied
themselves to Fasting and Prayer, which was attended not only in their own
private Families, but with calling in the help of others.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.
Mr. Parris invited several Neighbouring Ministers to join with him in keeping a
Solemn day of Prayer at his own House; the time of the exercise those Persons
were for the most part silent, but after any one Prayer was ended, they would Act
and Speak strangely and Ridiculously, yet were such as had been well Educated
and of good Behaviour, the one, a Girl of 11 or 12 years old,<ref target="n227">[227]</ref> would sometimes
seem to be in a Convulsion Fit, her Limbs being twisted several ways, and very
stiff, but presently her Fit would be over.</p>


<p>A few days before this Solemn day of Prayer, Mr. Parris's Indian Man and
Woman<ref target="n228">[228]</ref> made a Cake of Rye Meal, with the Childrens Water, and Baked it in
the Ashes, and as is said, gave it to the Dog; this was done as a means to
Discover Witchcraft;<ref target="n229">[229]</ref> soon after which those ill affected or afflicted Persons
named several that they said they saw, when in their Fits, afflicting of
them.</p>


<pb n="343"/>

<p>The first complain'd of, was the said Indian Woman, named Tituba. She
confessed that the Devil urged her to sign a Book, which he presented to her, and
also to work Mischief to the Children, etc. She was afterwards Committed to
Prison, and lay there till Sold for her Fees.<ref target="n230">[230]</ref> The account she since gives of it is,
that her Master did beat her and otherways abuse her, to make her confess and
accuse (such as he call'd) her Sister-Witches, and that whatsoever she said by
way of confessing or accusing others, was the effect of such usage; her Master
refused to pay her Fees, unless she would stand to what she had
said.<ref target="n231">[231]</ref></p>


<p>The Children complained likewise of two other Women, to be the Authors
of their Hurt, <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> Sarah Good, who had long been
counted a Melancholy or Distracted Woman, and one Osburn, an Old Bed-rid
Woman; which two were Persons so ill thought of, that the accusation was the
more readily believed; and after Examination before two Salem
Magistrates,<ref target="n232">[232]</ref>
were committed:</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March the</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,
Mr. Lawson (who had been formerly a Preacher at the said Village) came thither,
and hath since set fourth in Print an account of what then passed, about which
time, as he saith, they complained of Goodwife Cory, and Goodwife Nurse,
Members of the Churches at the Village and at Salem, many others being by that
time Accused.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March the</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi>,
Goodwife Cory was examined before the Magistrates of Salem, at the Meeting
House in the Village, a throng of Spectators being present to see the Novelty.
Mr. Noyes, one of the Ministers of Salem, began with Prayer, after which the
Prisoner being call'd, in order to answer to what should be Alledged against her,
she desired that she might go to Prayer, and was answered by the Magistrates,
that they did not come to hear her pray, but to examine her.</p>


<p>The number of the Afflicted were at that time about Ten,

<pb n="344"/>




<hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> Mrs. Pope, Mrs. Putman, Goodwife Bibber,
and Goodwife Goodall, Mary Wolcott, Mercy Lewes (at Thomas Putmans) and
Dr. Griggs Maid, and three Girls, <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> Elizabeth
Parris, Daughter to the Minister, Abigail Williams his Neice, and Ann Putman,
which last three were not only the beginners, but were also the chief in these
Accusations. These Ten were most of them present at the Examination, and did
vehemently accuse her of Afflicting them, by Biting, Pinching, Strangling, etc.
And they said, they did in their Fits see her likeness coming to them, and
bringing a Book for them to Sign; Mr. Hathorn, a Magistrate of Salem, asked
her, why she Afflicted those Children? she said, she did not Afflict them; he
asked her, who did then? she said, &ldquo;I do not know, how should I
know?&rdquo; she said, they were Poor Distracted Creatures, and no heed to be
given to what they said; Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Noyes replied that it was the
Judgment of all that were there present, that they were bewitched, and only she
(the Accused) said they were Distracted: She was Accused by them, that the
Black Man Whispered to her in her Ear now (while she was upon Examination)
and that she had a Yellow Bird, that did use to Suck between her Fingers, and
that the said Bird did Suck now in the Assembly; order being given to look in
that place to see if there were any sign, the Girl that pretended to see it said, that
it was too late now, for she had removed a Pin, and put it on her head, it was
upon search found, that a Pin was there sticking upright. When the Accused had
any motion of their Body, Hands or Mouth, the Accusers would cry out, as when
she bit her Lip, they would cry out of being bitten, if she grasped one hand with
the other, they would cry out of being Pinched by her, and would produce marks,
so of the other motions of her Body, as complaining of being Prest, when she
lean'd to the seat next her, if she stirred her Feet, they would stamp and cry out
of Pain there. After the hearing the said Cory was committed to Salem Prison,
and then their crying out of her abated.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March the</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,
Goodwife Nurse was brought before Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Curwin (Magistrates)
in the Meeting House. Mr. Hale, Minister of Beverly, began with Prayer, after
which she being Accus'd of much the same Crimes made the like an

<pb n="345"/>




swers, asserting her own Innocence with earnestness. The Accusers were mostly
the same, Tho. Putmans Wife, etc. complaining much. The dreadful Shreiking
from her and others, was very amazing, which was heard at a great distance; she
was also Committed to Prison.</p>


<p>A Child of Sarah Goods was likewise apprehended, being between 4 and
5 years Old. The Accusers said this Child bit them, and would shew such like
marks, as those of a small Sett of Teeth upon their Arms; as many of the
Afflicted as the Child cast its Eye upon, would complain they were in Torment;
which Child they also Committed.</p>


<p>Concerning these that had been hitherto Examined and Committed, it is
among other things observed by Mr. Lawson (in Print<ref target="n233">[233]</ref>) that they were by the
Accusers charged to belong to a Company that did muster in Arms, and were
reported by them to keep Days of Fast, Thanksgiving and Sacraments; and that
those Afflicted (or Accusers) did in the Assembly Cure each others, even with a
touch of their Hand, when strangled and otherways tortured, and would
endeavour to get to the Afflicted to relieve them thereby (for hitherto they had not
used the Experiment of bringing the Accused to touch the Afflicted, in order to
their Cure) and could foretel one anothers Fits to be coming, and would say, look
to such a one, she will have a Fit presently and so it happened, and that at the
same time when the Accused person was present, the Afflicted said they saw her
Spectre or likeness in other places of the Meeting House Suckling<ref target="n234">[234]</ref> of their
Familiars.</p>


<p>The said Mr. Lawson being to Preach at the Village, after the Psalm was
Sung, Abigail Williams said, &ldquo;Now stand up and name your Text&rdquo;;
after it was read, she said, &ldquo;It is a long Text.&rdquo; Mrs. Pope in the
beginning of Sermon said to him, &ldquo;Now there is enough of that.&rdquo;
In Sermon, he referring to his Doctrine, Abigail Williams said to him, &ldquo;I
know no Doctrine you had, if you did name one I have forgot it.&rdquo; Ann
Putman, an afflicted Girl, said, There was a Yellow Bird sate on his Hat as it
hung on the Pin in the Pulpit.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 31, 1692. Was set apart as a day of
Solemn Humiliation at Salem, upon the Account of this Business, on which day
Abigail Williams said, That she saw a great number

<pb n="346"/>




of Persons in the Village at the Administration of a Mock Sacrament, where they
had Bread as read as raw Flesh, and red Drink.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">April</hi> 1. Mercy Lewis affirmed, That she saw
a man in white, with whom she went into a Glorious Place, <hi
rend="italic">viz.</hi> In her fits, where was no Light of the Sun, much
less of Candles, yet was full of Light and Brightness, with a great Multitude in
White Glittering Robes, who Sang the Song in 5. Rev. 9. and the 110 and 149
Psalms; And was grieved that she might tarry no longer in this place. This White
Man is said to have appeared several times to others of them, and to have given
them notice how long it should be before they should have another Fit.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">April the</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.
Being Sacrament Day at the Village, Sarah Cloys, Sister to Goodwife Nurse, a
Member to one of the Churches, was (tho' it seems with difficulty prevail'd with
to be) present; but being entred the place, and Mr. Parris naming his Text, 6
John, 70. <hi rend="italic">Have not I chosen you Twelve, and one of you
is a Devil</hi> (for what cause may rest as a doubt whether upon the account
of her Sisters being Committed, or because of the choice of that Text) she rose
up and went out, the wind shutting the Door forcibly, gave occasion to some to
suppose she went out in Anger, and might occasion a suspicion of her; however
she was soon after complain'd of, examin'd and Committed.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">April the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.
By this time the number of the Accused and Accusers being much encreased, was
a Publick Examination at Salem, Six of the Magistrates with several Ministers
being present;<ref target="n235">[235]</ref> there appeared several who complain'd against others with hidious
clamors and Screechings. Goodwife Proctor was brought thither, being Accused
or cryed out against; her Husband coming to attend and assist her, as there might

<pb n="347"/>




be need, the Accusers cryed out of him also, and that with so much earnestness,
that he was Committed with his Wife. About this time besides the Experiment of
the Afflicted falling at the sight, etc., they put the Accused upon saying the Lords
Prayer, which one among them performed, except in that petition, <hi
rend="italic">Deliver us from Evil</hi>, she exprest it thus, <hi
rend="italic">Deliver us from all Evil</hi>. This was lookt upon as if she
Prayed against what she was now justly under, and being put upon it again, and
repeating those words, <hi rend="italic">Hallowed be thy name</hi>, she
exprest it, <hi rend="italic">Hollowed be thy Name</hi>, this was counted
a depraving the words, as signifying to make void, and so a Curse
rather then<ref target="n236">[236]</ref>
a Prayer, upon the whole it was concluded that she also could not say it, etc.
Proceeding in this work of examination and Commitment, many were sent to
Prison. As an Instance, see the following Mittimus:</p>

<p>The occasion of Bishops being cry'd out of<ref target="n241">[241]</ref> was, he being at an
Examination in Salem, when at the Inn an afflicted Indian<ref target="n242">[242]</ref> was very unruly,
whom he undertook, and so managed him, that he was very orderly, after which
in riding home, in company of him and other Accusers, the Indian fell into a fit,
and clapping hold with his Teeth on the back of the Man that rode before him,
thereby held himself upon the Horse, but said Bishop striking him with his stick,
the Indian soon recovered, and promised he would do so no more; to which
Bishop replied, that he doubted not, but he could cure them all, with more to the
same effect; immediately after he was parted from them, he was cried out of,

<p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 14, 1692. Sir William Phips arrived with
Commission from Their Majesties to be Governour, pursuant to the New-Charter;
which he now brought with him; the Ancient Charter having been vacated by
King Charles, and King James (by which they had a power not only to make their
own Laws; but also to chuse their own Governour and Officers;) and the
Countrey for some years was put under an absolute Commission-Government, till
the Revolution,<ref target="n243">[243]</ref> at which time tho more than two thirds of the People were for
reassuming their ancient Government, (to which they had encouragement by His
then Royal Highness's Proclamation) yet some that might have been better
imployed (in another Station)<ref target="n244">[244]</ref> made it their business (by printing, as well as
speaking) to their

utmost to divert them from such a settlement; and so far prevailed, that for about
seven Weeks after the Revolution, here was not so much as a face of any
Government; but some few Men upon their own Nomination would be called a
Committee of Safety; but at length the Assembly prevailed with those that had
been of the Government, to promise that they would reassume; and accordingly
a Proclamation was drawn, but before publishing it, it was underwritten, that they
would not have it understood that they did reassume Charter-Government; so that
between Government and no Government, this Countrey remained till Sir William
arrived; Agents being in this time impowered in England, which no doubt did not
all of them act according to the Minds or Interests of those that impowered them,
which is manifest by their not acting jointly in what was done; so that this place
is perhaps a single Instance (even in the best of Reigns) of a Charter not restored
after so happy a Revolution.</p>


<p>This settlement by Sir William Phips his being come Governour put an end
to all disputes of these things, and being arrived, and having read his
Commission, the first thing he exerted his Power in, was said to be his giving
Orders that Irons should be put upon those in Prison; for tho for some time after
these were Committed, the Accusers ceased to cry out of them;<ref target="n245">[245]</ref> yet now the cry
against them was renewed, which occasioned such Order; and tho there was
partiality in the executing it (some having taken them off<ref target="n246">[246]</ref> almost as soon as put
on) yet the cry of these Accusers against such ceased after this
Order.<ref target="n247">[247]</ref></p>

<q><p>I having heard some days, that my Wife was accused of Witchcraft, being much
disturbed at it, by advice, we went to Salem-Village, to see if the afflicted did
know her; we arrived there, 24 May, it happened to be a day appointed for
Examination; accordingly soon after our arrival, Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Curwin,
etc., went to the Meeting-house, which was the place appointed for that Work,
the Minister began with Prayer, and having taken care to get a convenient place,
I observed, that the afflicted were two Girls of about Ten Years
old,<ref target="n249">[249]</ref> and about
two or three other, of about eighteen, one of the Girls talked most, and could
discern more than the rest. The Prisoners were called in one by one, and as they
came in were cried out of, etc. The Prisoner was placed about 7 or 8 foot from
the Justices, and the Accusers between the Justices and them; the Prisoner was
ordered to stand right before the Justices, with an Officer appointed to hold each
hand, least they should therewith afflict them, and the Prisoners Eyes must be
constantly on the Justices; for if they look'd on the afflicted, they would either
fall into their Fits, or cry out of being hurt by them; after Examination of the
Prisoners, who it was afflicted these Girls, etc., they were put upon saying the
Lords Prayer, as a tryal of their guilt; after the afflicted seem'd to be out of their
Fits, they would look steadfastly on some one person, and frequently not speak;
and then the Justices said they were struck dumb, and after a little time would
speak again; then the Justices said to the Accusers, &ldquo;which of you will go
and touch the Prisoner at the Bar?&rdquo; then the most couragious would
adventure, but before they had made three steps would ordinarily fall down as in
a Fit; the Justices ordered that they should be taken up and carried to the
Prisoner, that she might touch them; and as soon as they were touched by the
accused, the Justices would say, they are well, before I could discern any
alteration; by which I observed that the Justices understood the manner of it.
Thus far I was only as a Spectator, my Wife also was there part of the time, but
no notice taken of her by the afflicted, except once or twice they came to her and
asked her name.</p>


<p>But I having an opportunity to Discourse<ref target="n250">[250]</ref> Mr. Hale<ref target="n251">[251]</ref> (with whom I had
formerly acquaintance) I took his advice, what I had best to do, and desired of
him that I might have an opportunity to speak with her that accused my Wife;
which he promised should be, I acquainting him that I reposed my trust in
him.</p>


<p>Accordingly he came to me after the Examination was over, and told me
I had now an opportunity to speak with the said Accuser,

<pb n="351"/>




<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. Abigail Williams, a Girl of 11 or 12 Years old;
but that we could not be in private at Mr. Parris's House, as he had promised
me; we went therefore into the Alehouse, where an Indian Man attended us, who
it seems was one of the afflicted: to him we gave some Cyder, he shewed several
Scars, that seemed as if they had been long there, and shewed them as done by
Witchcraft, and acquainted us that his Wife, who also was a Slave, was
imprison'd for Witchcraft.<ref target="n252">[252]</ref> And now instead of one Accuser, they all came in,
who began to tumble down like Swine, and then three Women were called in to
attend them. We in the Room were all at a stand, to see who they would cry out
of; but in a short time they cried out, Cary; and immediately after a Warrant was
sent from the Justices to bring my Wife before them, who were sitting in a
Chamber near by, waiting for this.</p>


<p>Being brought before the Justices, her chief accusers were two Girls; my
Wife declared to the Justices, that she never had any knowledge of them before
that day; she was forced to stand with her Arms stretched out. I did request that
I might hold one of her hands, but it was denied me; then she desired me to wipe
the Tears from her Eyes, and the Sweat from her Face, which I did; then she
desired she might lean her self on me, saying, she should faint.</p>


<p>Justice Hathorn replied, she had strength enough to torment those persons,
and she should have strength enough to stand. I speaking something against their
cruel proceedings, they commanded me to be silent, or else I should be turned out
of the Room. The Indian before mentioned, was also brought in, to be one of her
Accusers: being come in, he now (when before the Justices) fell down and
tumbled about like a Hog, but said nothing. The Justices asked the Girls, who
afflicted the Indian? they answered she (meaning my Wife) and now lay upon
him; the Justices ordered her to touch him, in order to his cure, but her head
must be turned another way, least instead of curing, she should make him worse,
by her looking on him, her hand being guided to take hold of his; but the Indian
took hold on her hand, and pulled her down on the Floor, in a barbarous manner;
then his hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and the cure was quickly
wrought. I being extreamly troubled at their Inhumane dealings, uttered a hasty
Speech (That God would take vengeance on them, and desired that God would
deliver us out of the hands of unmerciful men.) Then her Mittimus was writ. I
did with difficulty and charge obtain the liberty of a Room, but no Beds in it; if
there had, could have taken but little rest that Night. She was committed to
Boston Prison; but I obtained a Habeas Corpus to remove her to Cambridge
Prison, which is in our County of Mid

dlesex. Having been there one Night, next Morning the Jaylor put Irons on her
legs (having received such a command) the weight of them was about eight
pounds; these Irons and her other Afflictions, soon brought her into Convulsion
Fits, so that I thought she would have died that Night. I sent to intreat that the
Irons might be taken off, but all intreaties were in vain, if it would have saved
her Life, so that in this condition she must continue. The Tryals at Salem coming
on, I went thither, to see how things were there managed; and finding that the
Spectre-Evidence was there received, together with Idle, if not malicious Stories,
against Peoples Lives, I did easily perceive which way the rest would go; for the
same Evidence that served for one, would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her
with her danger; and that if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I feared she
would never return. I did my utmost that she might have her Tryal in our own
County, I with several others Petitioning the Judge for it, and were put in hopes
of it; but I soon saw so much, that I understood thereby it was not intended,
which put me upon consulting the means of her escape; which thro the goodness
of God was effected, and she got to Road Island,<ref target="n253">[253]</ref> but soon found her self not
safe when there, by reason of the pursuit after her; from thence she went to
New-York, along with some others that had escaped their cruel hands; where we
found his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, Esq; Governour, who was very
courteous to us. After this some of my Goods were seized in a Friends hands,
with whom I had left them, and my self imprisoned by the Sheriff, and kept in
Custody half a day, and then dismist; but to speak of their usage of the Prisoners,
and their Inhumanity shewn to them, at the time of their Execution, no sober
Christian could bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings; which is the more,
considering what a People for Religion, I mean the profession of it, we have
been; those that suffered being many of them Church-Members, and most of them
unspotted in their Conversation, till their Adversary the Devil took up this
Method for accusing them.</p></q>

<p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 31. Captain John Aldin<ref target="n255">[255]</ref> was Examined
at Salem, and Committed to Boston Prison. The Prison-Keeper seeing

<pb n="353"/>




such a Man Committed, of whom he had a good esteem, was after this the more
Compassionate to those that were in Prison on the like account; and did refrain
from such hard things to the Prisoners, as before he had used. Mr. Aldin himself
has given account of his Examination, in these Words.</p>


<div3 type="subsection" id="d28"><head><hi rend="italic">An Account how John Aldin, Senior, was dealt with
at Salem-Village</hi>.</head>


<p>John Aldin Senior, of Boston, in the County of Suffolk, Marriner, on the
28th Day of May, 1692, was sent for by the Magistrates of Salem, in the County
of Essex, upon the Accusation of a company of poor distracted, or possessed
Creatures or Witches; and being sent by Mr. Stoughton,<ref
target="n256">[256]</ref> arrived there the 31st
of May, and appeared at Salem-Village, before Mr. Gidney,<ref target="n257">[257]</ref> Mr. Hathorn, and
Mr. Curwin.</p>


<p>Those Wenches being present, who plaid their jugling tricks, falling down,
crying out, and staring in Peoples Faces; the Magistrates demanded of them
several times, who it was of all the People in the Room that hurt them? one of
these Accusers pointed several times at one Captain Hill, there present, but spake
nothing; the same Accuser had a Man standing at her back to hold her up; he
stooped down to her Ear, then she cried out, Aldin, Aldin afflicted her; one of
the Magistrates asked her if she had ever seen Aldin, she answered no, he asked
her how she knew it was Aldin? She said, the Man told her so.</p>


<p>Then all were ordered to go down into the Street, where a Ring was made;
and the same Accuser cried out, &ldquo;there stands Aldin, a bold fellow with
his Hat on before the Judges, he sells Powder and Shot to the Indians and French,
and lies with the Indian Squaes, and has Indian Papooses.&rdquo; Then was
Aldin committed to the Marshal's Custody, and his Sword taken from him; for
they said he afflicted them with his Sword. After some hours Aldin was sent for
to the Meeting-house in the Village before the Magistrates; who required Aldin
to stand upon a Chair, to the open view of all the People.</p>


<p>The Accusers cried out that Aldin did pinch them, then, when he stood
upon the Chair, in the sight of all the People, a good way distant from them, one
of the Magistrates bid the Marshal to hold open Aldin's hands, that he might not
pinch those Creatures. Aldin asked

<pb n="354"/>




them why they should think, that he should come to that Village to afflict those
persons that he never knew or saw before? Mr. Gidney bid Aldin confess, and
give glory to God; Aldin said he hoped he should give glory to God, and hoped
he should never gratifie the Devil; but appealed to all that ever knew him, if they
ever suspected him to be such a person, and challenged any one, that could bring
in any thing upon their own knowledge, that might give suspicion of his being
such an one. Mr. Gidney said he had known Aldin many Years, and had been at
Sea with him, and always look'd upon him to be an honest Man, but now he did
see cause to alter his judgment: Aldin answered, he was sorry for that, but he
hoped God would clear up his Innocency, that he would recall that judgment
again, and added that he hoped that he should with Job maintain his Integrity till
he died. They bid Aldin look upon the Accusers, which he did, and then they fell
down. Aldin asked Mr. Gidney, what Reason there could be given, why Aldin's
looking upon <hi rend="italic">him</hi> did not strike <hi
rend="italic">him</hi> down as well; but no reason was given that I heard.
But the Accusers were brought to Aldin to touch them, and this touch they said
made them well. Aldin began to speak of the Providence of God in suffering
these Creatures to accuse Innocent persons. Mr. Noyes asked Aldin why he
would offer to speak of the Providence of God. God by his Providence (said Mr.
Noyes) governs the World, and keeps it in peace; and so went on with Discourse,
and stopt Aldin's mouth, as to that. Aldin told Mr. Gidney, that he could assure
him that there was a lying Spirit in them, for I can assure you that there is not
a word of truth in all these say of me. But Aldin was again committed to the
Marshal, and his Mittimus written, which was as follows.</p>

Case made and provided: These are therefore in Their Majesties, King William
and Queen Marys Names, to Will and require you, to take into your Custody, the
bodies of the said John Aldin, and Sarah Rice, and them safely keep, until they

<pb n="356"/>




most that was done this Week, was the Tryal of one Bishop, <hi
rend="italic">alias</hi> Oliver, of Salem; who having long undergone the
repute of a Witch, occasioned by the Accusations of one Samuel Gray: he about
20 Years since, having charged her with such Crimes, and though upon his
Death-bed he testified his sorrow and repentance for such Accustations, as being
wholly groundless; yet the report taken up by his means continued, and she being
accused by those afflicted, and upon search a Tet, as they call it, being found,
she was brought in guilty by the Jury; she received her Sentence of Death, and
was Executed, June 10, but made not the least Confession of any thing relating
to Witchcraft.<ref target="n260">[260]</ref></p>


<p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 15. Several Ministers in and near Boston,
having been to that end consulted by his Excellency,<ref target="n261">[261]</ref> exprest their minds to this
effect, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>.</p>


<p>That they were affected with the deplorable state of the afflicted; That they
were thankful for the diligent care of the Rulers, to detect the abominable
Witchcrafts, which have been committed in the Country, praying for a perfect
discovery thereof. But advised to a cautious proceeding, least many Evils ensue,
etc. And that tenderness be used towards those accused, relating to matters
presumptive and convictive, and also to privacy in Examinations, and to consult
Mr. Perkins and Mr. Bernard,<ref target="n262">[262]</ref> what tests to make use of in the Scrutiny: That
Presumptions and Convictions ought to have better grounds, than the Accusers
affirming that they see such persons Spectres afflicting them: And that the Devil
may afflict in the shape of good Men; and that falling at the sight, and rising at
the touch of the Accused, is no infallible proof of guilt; That seeing the Devils
strength consists in such Accusations, our disbelieving them may be a means to
put a period to the dreadful Calamities; Nevertheless they humbly recommend to
the Government, the speedy and vigorous prosecu

tion of such as have rendered themselves obnoxious, according to the direction
given in the Laws of God, and the wholesome Statutes of the English Nation, for
the Detection of Witchcraft.</p>


<p>This is briefly the substance of what may be seen more at large in <hi
rend="italic">Cases of Conscience</hi>, (<hi
rend="italic">ult.</hi>)<ref target="n263">[263]</ref>
And one of them<ref target="n264">[264]</ref> since taking occasion to repeat some part of this advice, <hi
rend="italic">Wonders of the Invisible World</hi>, p. 83, declares,
(notwithstanding the Dissatisfaction of others) that if his said Book may conduce
to promote thankfulness to God for such Executions, he shall rejoyce, etc.</p>


<p>The 30<hi rend="italic">th of June</hi>, the Court according to
Adjournment again sat; five more were tried, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>.
Sarah Good and Rebecca Nurse, of Salem-Village; Susanna Martin of Amsbury;
Elizabeth How of Ipswich; and Sarah Wildes of Topsfield; these were all
condemned that Sessions, and were all Executed on the 19th of
July.<ref target="n265">[265]</ref></p>


<p>At the Tryal of Sarah Good, one of the afflicted fell in a Fit, and after
coming out of it, she cried out of the Prisoner, for stabing her in the breast with
a Knife, and that she had broken the Knife in stabbing of her, accordingly a piece
of the blade of a Knife was found about her. Immediately information being given
to the Court, a young Man was called, who produced a Haft and part of the
Blade, which the Court having viewed and compared, saw it to be the same. And
upon inquiry the young Man affirmed, that yesterday he happened to break that
Knife, and that he cast away the upper part, this afflicted person being then
present. The young Man was

<pb n="358"/>




dismist, and she was bidden by the Court not to tell lyes; and was improved (after
as she had been before) to give Evidence against the Prisoners.</p>


<p>At Execution, Mr. Noyes urged Sarah Good to Confess, and told her she
was a Witch, and she knew she was a Witch, to which she replied, &ldquo;you
are a lyer; I am no more a Witch than you are a Wizard, and if you take away
my Life, God will give you Blood to drink.&rdquo;</p>


<p>At the Tryal of Rebecka Nurse, this was remarkable that the Jury brought
in their Verdict not Guilty, immediately all the accusers in the Court, and
suddenly after all the afflicted out of Court, made an hideous out-cry, to the
amazement, not only of the Spectators, but the Court also seemed strangely
surprized; one of the Judges exprest himself not satisfied, another of them as he
was going off the Bench, said they would have her Indicted anew. The chief
Judge said he would not Impose upon the Jury; but intimated, as if they had not
well considered one Expression of the Prisoners, when she was upon Tryal, <hi
rend="italic">viz</hi>. That when one Hobbs, who had confessed her self
to be a Witch, was brought into the Court to witness against her, the Prisoner
turning her head to her, said, &ldquo;What, do you bring her? she is one of
us,&rdquo; or to that effect; this together with the Clamours of the Accusers,
induced the Jury to go out again, after their Verdict, not Guilty. But not agreeing,
they came into the Court, and she being then at the Bar, her words were repeated
to her, in order to have had her explanation of them, and she making no Reply
to them, they found the Bill, and brought her in Guilty; these words being the
Inducement to it, as the Foreman has signified in writing, as follows.</p>

<div3 type="letter" id="d32"><head><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 4, 1692.</head>

<p>I Thomas Fisk, the Subscriber hereof, being one of them that were of the Jury the last week at Salem-Court,
upon the Tryal of Rebecka Nurse, etc., being desired by some of the Relations
to give a Reason why the Jury brought her in Guilty, after her Verdict not Guilty;
I do hereby give my Reasons to be as follows, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>.</p>


<p>When the Verdict not Guilty was, the honoured Court was pleased to object
against it, saying to them, that they think they let slip the words, which the
Prisoner at the Bar spake against her self, which were spoken in reply to
Goodwife Hobbs and her Daughter, who had been faulty in setting their hands to
the Devils Book, as they have confessed formerly; the words were &ldquo;What,
do these persons

<pb n="359"/>




give in Evidence against me now, they used to come among us.&rdquo;
After the honoured Court had manifested their dissatisfaction of the Verdict,
several of the Jury declared themselves desirous to go out again, and thereupon
the honoured Court gave leave; but when we came to consider of the Case, I
could not tell how to take her words, as an Evidence against her, till she had a
further opportunity to put her Sense upon them, if she would take it; and then
going into Court, I mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the Court
were affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being then at the Bar, but made
no reply, nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were to me a
principal Evidence against her.</p>

</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d33">
<p>When Goodwife Nurse was informed what use was made of these words,
she put in this following Declaration into the Court.</p>

<div3 type="decree" id="d34">
<p>These presents do humbly shew, to the honoured Court and Jury, that I
being informed, that the Jury brought me in Guilty, upon my saying that
Goodwife Hobbs and her Daughter were of our Company; but I intended no
otherways, then as<ref target="n266">[266]</ref> they were Prisoners with us, and therefore did then, and yet
do judge them not legal Evidence against their fellow Prisoners. And I being
something hard of hearing, and full of grief, none informing me how the Court
took up my words, and therefore had not opportunity to declare what I intended,
when I said they were of our Company.</p>

<p>After her Condemnation she was by one of the Ministers of Salem
excommunicated;<ref target="n267">[267]</ref> yet the Governour saw cause to grant a Reprieve, which when
known (and some say immediately upon granting) the Accusers renewed their
dismal out-cries against her, insomuch that the Governour was by some Salem
Gentleman prevailed with to recall the Reprieve, and she was Executed with the
rest.</p>


<pb n="360"/>


<p>The Testimonials of her Christian behaviour, both in the course of her Life,
and at her Death, and her extraordinary care in educating her Children, and
setting them good Examples, etc., under the hands of so many, are so numerous,
that for brevity they are here omitted.<ref target="n268">[268]</ref></p>


<p>It was at the Tryal of these that one of the Accusers cried out publickly of
Mr. Willard Minister in Boston,<ref target="n269">[269]</ref> as afflicting of her; she was sent out of the
Court, and it was told about she was mistaken in the person.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">August</hi> 5. The Court again sitting, six more
were tried on the same Account, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Mr. George
Burroughs, sometime minister of Wells, John Procter, and Elizabeth Procter his
Wife, with John Willard of Salem-Village, George Jacobs Senior, of Salem, and
Martha Carryer of Andover;<ref target="n270">[270]</ref> these were all brought in Guilty and Condemned;
and were all Executed Aug. 19, except Procter's Wife, who pleaded
Pregnancy.<ref target="n271">[271]</ref></p>


<p>Mr. Burroughs was carried in a Cart with the others, through the streets of
Salem to Execution; when he was upon the Ladder, he made a Speech for the
clearing of his Innocency, with such Solemn and Serious Expressions, as were to
the Admiration of all present; his Prayer (which he concluded by repeating the
Lord's Prayer,) was so well worded, and uttered with such composedness, and
such (at least seeming) fervency of Spirit, as was very affecting, and drew Tears
from many (so that it seemed to some, that the Spectators would hinder

<pb n="361"/>




the Execution). The accusers said the black Man stood and dictated to him; as
soon as he was turned off, Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a Horse,
addressed himself to the People, partly to declare, that he was no ordained
Minister, and partly to possess the People of his guilt; saying, That the Devil has
often been transformed into an Angel of Light; and this did somewhat appease the
People, and the Executions went on; when he was cut down, he was dragged by
the Halter to a Hole, or Grave, between the Rocks, about two foot deep, his Shirt
and Breeches being pulled off, and an old pair of Trousers of one Executed, put
on his lower parts, he was so put in, together with Willard and Carryer, one of
his Hands and his Chin, and a Foot of one [of] them being left
uncovered.<ref target="n272">[272]</ref></p>


<p>John Willard had been imployed to fetch in several that were accused; but
taking dissatisfaction from his being sent, to fetch up some that he had better
thoughts of, he declined the Service, and presently after he himself was accused
of the same Crime, and that with such vehemency, that they sent after him to
apprehend him; he had made his Escape as far as Nashawag,<ref target="n273">[273]</ref> about 40 Miles
from Salem; yet'tis said those Accusers did then presently tell the exact time,
saying, now Willard is taken.</p>


<p>John Procter and his Wife being in Prison, the Sheriff came to his House
and seized all the Goods, Provisions, and Cattle that he could come at, and sold
some of the Cattle at half price, and killed others, and put them up for the
West-Indies; threw out the Beer out of a Barrel, and carried away the Barrel;
emptied a Pot of Broath, and took away the Pot, and left nothing in the House for
the support of the Children: No part of the said Goods are known to be returned.
Procter earnestly requested Mr. Noyes to pray with and for him, but

<pb n="362"/>

it was wholly denied, because he would not own himself to be a Witch.</p>

<p>During his Imprisonment he sent the following Letter, in behalf of himself
and others.</p>

<p>The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our
Judges, and Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn,
having Condemned us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and
engaged against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your
Favourable Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it
be possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will
be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates, Ministers,
Jewries,<ref target="n275">[275]</ref> and all the People in general, being so much inraged and incensed
against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no other, by reason
we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent Persons. Here are five
Persons who have lately

<pb n="363"/>




confessed themselves to be Witches, and do accuse some of us, of being along
with them at a Sacrament, since we were committed into close Prison, which we
know to be Lies. Two of the 5 are (Carriers Sons<ref target="n276">[276]</ref>) Young-men, who would not
confess any thing till they tyed them Neck and Heels<ref target="n277">[277]</ref> till the Blood was ready
to come out of their Noses, and 'tis credibly believed and reported this was the
occasion of making them confess that<ref target="n278">[278]</ref> they never did, by reason they said one
had been a Witch a Month, and another five Weeks, and that their Mother had
made them so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son William
Procter, when he was examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty,
when he was Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out
at his Nose, and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the
rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions are
very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our Estates, and
that will not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods. If it cannot be
granted that we can have our

<pb n="364"/>




Trials at Boston, we humbly beg that you would endeavour to have these
Magistrates changed, and others in their rooms, begging also and beseeching you
would be pleased to be here, if not all, some of you at our Trials, hoping thereby
you may be the means of saving the shedding our Innocent Bloods, desiring your
Prayers to the Lord in our behalf, we rest your Poor Afflicted Servants,</p>

<p>He pleaded very hard at Execution, for a little respite of time, saying that
he was not fit to Die; but it was not granted.</p>


<p>Old Jacobs being Condemned, the Sheriff and Officers came and seized all
he had, his Wife had her Wedding Ring taken from her, but with great difficulty
obtained it again. She was forced to buy Provisions of the Sheriff, such as he had
taken, towards her own support, which not being sufficient, the Neighbours of
Charity relieved her.<ref target="n279">[279]</ref></p>

against her Grand-Father Jacobs, Mr. Burroughs, and John Willard, She the day
before Executions, came to Mr. Burroughs, acknowledging that she had belyed
them,<ref target="n280">[280]</ref> and begged Mr. Burroughs Forgiveness, who not only

forgave her, but also Prayed with and for her. She wrote the following Letter to

<p>After my Humble Duty Remembred to you, hoping in the Lord of your
good Health, as Blessed be God I enjoy, tho in abundance of Affliction, being
close confined here in a loathsome Dungeon, the Lord look down in mercy upon
me, not knowing how soon I shall be put to Death, by means of the Afflicted
Persons; my Grand-Father having Suffered already, and all his Estate Seized for
the King. The reason of my Confinement is this, I having, through the
Magistrates Threatnings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed several
things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding of my own
Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! the terrors of a wounded Conscience
who can bear. But blessed be the Lord, he would not let me go on in my Sins,
but in mercy I hope so my Soul would not suffer me to keep it in any longer, but
I was forced to confess the truth of all before the Magistrates, who would not
believe me, but tis their pleasure to put me in here, and God knows how soon I
shall be put to death. Dear Father, let me beg your Prayers to the Lord on my
behalf, and send us a Joyful and Happy meeting in Heaven. My Mother poor

<p>Giles Cory pleaded not Guilty to his Indictment, but would not put himself
upon Tryal by the Jury (they having cleared none upon Tryal) and knowing there
would be the same Witnesses against him, rather chose to undergo what Death
they would put him to. In pressing his Tongue being prest out of his Mouth, the
Sheriff with his Cane forced it in again, when he was dying. He was the first in
New-England, that was ever prest to Death.<ref target="n285">[285]</ref></p>

time at a sett; the afflicted and others said, that the Devil hindred it, etc.</p>


<p>Martha Cory, Wife to Giles Cory, protesting her Innocency, concluded her
Life with an Eminent Prayer upon the Ladder.</p>


<p>Wardwell having formerly confessed himself Guilty, and after denied it,
was soon brought upon his Tryal; his former Confession and Spectre Testimony
was all that appeared against him. At Execution while he was speaking to the
People, protesting his Innocency, the Executioner being at the same time
smoaking Tobacco, the smoak coming in his Face, interrupted his Discourse,
those Accusers said, the Devil hindred him with smoak.</p>


<p>Mary Easty, Sister also to Rebecka Nurse, when she took

her last farewell of her Husband, Children and Friends, was, as is reported by
them present, as Serious, Religious, Distinct, and Affectionate as could well be
exprest, drawing Tears from the Eyes of almost all present. It seems besides the
Testimony of the Accusers and Confessors, another proof, as it was counted,
appeared against her, it having been usual to search the Accused for Tets; upon
some parts of her Body, not here to be named, was found an Excrescence, which
they called a Tet. Before her Death she put up the following Petition:</p>
<div3 type="decree" id="d40">

<p>To the Honorable Judge and Bench now sitting in Judicature in Salem and
the Reverend Ministers, humbly sheweth, That whereas your humble poor
Petitioner being Condemned to die, doth humbly beg of you, to take it into your
Judicious and Pious Consideration, that your poor and humble Petitioner knowing
my own Innocency (blessed be the Lord for it) and seeing plainly the Wiles and
Subtilty of my Accusers, by my self, cannot but judge charitably of others, that
are going the same way with my self, if the Lord step not mightily in. I was
confined a whole Month on the same account that I am now condemned for, and
then cleared by the Afflicted persons, as some of your Honours know, and in two
days time I was cried out upon by them, and have been confined, and now am
condemned to die. The Lord above knows my Innocency then, and likewise doth
now, as at the great day will be known to Men and Angels. I Petition to your
Honours not for my own Life, for I know I must die, and my appointed time is
set; but the Lord he knows it is, if it be possible, that no more Innocent Blood
be shed, which undoubtedly cannot be avoided in the way and course you go in.
I question not, but your Honours do to the utmost of your powers, in the
discovery and detecting of Witchcraft and Witches, and would not be guilty of
Innocent Blood for the World; but by my own Innocency I know you are in the
wrong way. The Lord in his infinite Mercy direct you in this great work, if it be
his blessed will, that Innocent Blood be not shed; I would humbly beg of you,
that your Honours would be pleased to Examine some of those confessing
Witches, I being confident there are several of them have belyed themselves and
others, as will appear, if not in this World, I am sure in the World to come,
whither I am going; and I question not, but your selves will see an alteration in
these things: They say, my self and others have made a league with the Devil, we
cannot confess. I know and the Lord he knows (as will shortly appear) they belye
me, and so I question not but they do others; the Lord alone, who is the searcher
of all hearts, knows that as I shall answer it at the

Tribunal Seat, that I know not the least thing of Witchcraft, therefore I cannot,
I durst not belye my own Soul. I beg your Honours not to deny this my humble
Petition, from a poor dying Innocent person, and I question not but the Lord will
give a blessing to your Endeavours.</p>

Christianity, caused him to alter his Judgment; for it was come to a stated

in a good Man's shape; it seems nothing else could convince him: yet when it

<p>Mr. Philip English and his Wife having made their Escape out of Prison,
Mr. Corwin the Sheriff seiz'd his Estate, to the value of about Fifteen Hundred
Pound, which was wholly lost to him, except about Three Hundred Pound value,
(which was afterward restored.)<ref target="n292">[292]</ref></p>


<p>After Goodwife Hoar was Condemned, her Estate was seiz'd, and was also
bought again for Eight Pound.</p>


<p>George Jacobs, Son to old Jacobs,<ref target="n293">[293]</ref> being accused, he fled, then the
Officers came to his House, his Wife was a Woman Crazy in her Senses and had
been so several Years. She it seems had been also accused; there were in the
House with her only four small Children, and one of them suck'd, her Eldest
Daughter<ref target="n294">[294]</ref> being in Prison; the Officer perswaded her out of the House, to go
along with him, telling her she should speedily return, the Children ran a great
way after her crying.</p>


<p>When she came where the Afflicted were, being asked, they said they did
not know her, at length one said, don't you know Jacobs the old Witch, and then
they cry'd out of her, and fell down in their Fits; she was sent to Prison, and lay
there Ten Months, the Neighbours of pitty took care of the Children to preserve
them from perishing.</p>


<p>About this time a New Scene was begun, one Joseph Ballard of Andover,
whose Wife was ill (and after died of a Fever) sent to Salem for some of those
Accusers, to tell him who

<pb n="372"/>




afflicted his Wife; others did the like: Horse and Man were sent from several
places to fetch those Accusers who had the Spectral sight, that they might thereby
tell who afflicted those that were any ways ill.</p>


<p>When these came into any place where such were, usually they fell into a
Fit; after which being asked who it was that afflicted the person, they would, for
the most part, name one whom they said sat on the head, and another that sat on
the lower parts of the afflicted. Soon after Ballard's sending (as above) more than
Fifty of the People of Andover were complained of, for afflicting their
Neighbours. Here it was that many accused themselves, of Riding upon Poles
through the Air; Many Parents believing their Children to be Witches, and many
Husbands their Wives, etc. When these Accusers came to the House of any upon
such account, it was ordinary for other young People to be taken in Fits, and to
have the same Spectral sight.</p>


<p>Mr. Dudley Bradstreet,<ref target="n295">[295]</ref> a Justice of Peace in Andover, having granted out
Warrants against, and Committed Thirty or Forty to Prisons, for the supposed
Witchcrafts, at length saw cause to forbear granting out any more Warrants. Soon
after which he and his Wife were cried out of, himself was (by them) said to have
killed Nine persons by Witchcraft, and found it his safest course to make his
Escape.</p>


<p>A Dog being afflicted at Salem-Village, those that had the Spectral sight
being sent for, they accused Mr. John Bradstreet (Brother to the Justice) that he
afflicted the said Dog, and now rid upon him: He made his Escape into
Pescattequa-Government,<ref target="n296">[296]</ref> and the Dog was put to death, and was all of the
Afflicted that suffered death.</p>


<p>At Andover, the Afflicted complained of a Dog, as afflicting of them, and
would fall into their Fits at the Dogs looking upon them; the Dog was put to
death.</p>


<p>A worthy Gentleman of Boston, being about this time accused by those at
Andover, he sent by some particular Friends a Writ to Arrest those Accusers in
a Thousand Pound Action for Defamation, with instructions to them, to inform
themselves of the certainty of the proof, in doing which their business was

<pb n="373"/>




perceived, and from thence forward the Accusations at Andover generally
ceased.<ref target="n297">[297]</ref></p>


<p>In October some of these Accusers were sent for to Glocester, and
occasioned four Women to be sent to Prison, but Salem Prison being so full it
could receive no more, two were sent to Ipswich Prison. In November they were
sent for again by Lieutenant Stephens, who was told that a Sister of his was
bewitched; in their way passing over Ipswich-bridge, they met with an old
Woman, and instantly fell into their Fits: But by this time the validity of such
Accusations being much questioned, they found not that Encouragement they had
done elsewhere, and soon withdrew.</p>


<p>These Accusers swore that they saw three persons sitting upon Lieutenant
Stephens's Sister till she died; yet Bond was accepted for those Three.</p>


<p>And now Nineteen persons having been hang'd, and one prest to death, and
Eight more condemned, in all Twenty and Eight, of which above a third part
were Members of some of the Churches in N. England, and more than half of
them of a good Conversation in general, and not one clear'd; About Fifty having
confest themselves to be Witches, of which not one Executed; above an Hundred
and Fifty in Prison, and above Two Hundred more accused; The Special
Commission of Oyer and Terminer comes to a period,<ref target="n298">[298]</ref> which has no other
foundation than the Governours Commission,<ref target="n299">[299]</ref> and had proceeded in the manner
of swearing Witnesses, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> By holding up the hand,
(and by receiving Evidences in writing) according to the Ancient Usage of this
Countrey; as also having their Indictments in English. In the Tryals, when any
were Indicted for Afflicting, Pining, and wasting the Bodies of particular persons
by Witchcraft; it was usual to hear Evidence of matter foreign, and of perhaps
Twenty or Thirty years standing, about over-setting Carts, the death of Cattle, un

kindness to Relations, or unexpected Accidents befalling after some quarrel.
Whether this was admitted by the Law of England, or by what other Law, wants
to be determined; the Executions seemed mixt, in pressing to death for not
pleading, which most agrees with the Laws of England, and Sentencing Women
to be hanged for Witchcraft, according to the former practice of this Country, and
not by burning, as is said to have been the Law of England.<ref target="n300">[300]</ref> And though the
confessing Witches were many; yet not one of them that confessed their own
guilt, and abode by their Confession were put to Death.<ref target="n301">[301]</ref></p>


<p>Here followeth what account some of those miserable Creatures give of
their Confession under their own hands.</p>
<div3 type="decree" id="d44">

<p>We whose Names are under written, Inhabitants of Andover, when as that
horrible and tremendous Judgment beginning at Salem-Village, in the Year 1692,
(by some) call'd Witchcraft, first breaking forth at Mr. Parris's House, several
Young persons being seemingly afflicted, did accuse several persons for afflicting
them, and many there believing it so to be; we being informed that if a person
were sick, that the afflicted persons could tell, what or who was the cause of that
sickness. Joseph Ballard of Andover (his Wife being sick at the same time) he
either from himself, or by the advice of others, fetch'd two of the persons call'd
the afflicted persons, from Salem-Village to Andover. Which was the beginning
of that dreadful Calamity that befel us in Andover. And the Authority in
Andover, believing the said Accusations to be true, sent for the said persons to
come together, to the Meeting-house in Andover (the afflicted persons

<pb n="375"/>



being there.) After Mr. Bernard<ref target="n302">[302]</ref> had been at Prayer, we were blindfolded,
and our hands were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their Fits, and
falling into their Fits at our coming into their presence (as they said) and some
led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they said they were well, and that
we were guilty of afflicting of them; whereupon we were all seized as Prisoners,
by a Warrant from the Justice of the Peace, and forthwith carried to Salem. And
by reason of that suddain surprizal, we knowing our selves altogether Innocent
of that Crime, we were all exceedingly astonished and amazed, and consternated
and affrighted even out of our Reason; and our nearest and dearest Relations,
seeing us in that dreadful condition, and knowing our great danger, apprehending
that there was no other way to save our lives, as the case was then
circumstantiated, but by our confessing our selves to be such and such persons,
as the afflicted represented us to be, they out of tender love and pitty perswaded
us to confess what we did confess. And indeed that Confession, that is said we
made, was no other than what was suggested to us by some Gentlemen; they
telling us, that we were Witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, and they
knew that we knew it, which made us think that it was so; and our understanding,
our reason, and our faculties almost gone, we were not capable of judging our
condition; as also the hard measures they used with us, rendred us uncapable of
making our Defence; but said any thing and every thing which they desired, and
most of what we said, was but in effect a consenting to what they said. Sometime
after when we were better composed, they telling of us what we had confessed,
we did profess that we were Innocent, and Ignorant of such things. And we
hearing that Samuel Wardwell had renounced his Confession, and quickly after
Condemned and Executed, some of us were told that we were going after
Wardwell.</p>

<p>It may here be further added concerning those that did Confess, that besides
that powerful Argument, of Life (and

<pb n="376"/>
freedom from hardships and Irons not only promised, but
also performed to all that owned their guilt), There are numerous
Instances, too many to be here inserted, of the tedious Examinations
before private persons, many hours together; they all that time urging
them to Confess (and taking turns to perswade them) till the accused
were wearied out by being forced to stand so long, or for want of
Sleep, etc. and so brought to give an Assent to what they said; they
then asking them , Were you at such a Witch-meeting, or have you
signed the Devil's Book, etc. upon their replying, yes, the whole was
drawn into form as their Confession.

</p><p>But that which did mightily further such Confessions, was their
nearest and dearest Relations urging them to it. These seeing no other
way of escape for them, thought it the best advice that could be
given; hence it was that the Husbands of some, by counsel often
urging, and utmost earnestness, and Children upon their Knees
intreating, have at length prevailed with them, to say they were
guilty.<ref target="n304">[304]</ref>

<p>And considering that this may fall into the hands of such as never saw those
Wonders, it may be needful to transcribe the whole account he has given thereof,
without any variation (but with one of the Indictments annext to the Tryal of
each).<ref target="n308">[308]</ref></p>


<p>Thus far the Account given in <hi rend="italic">Wonders of the
Invisible World</hi>; in which setting aside such words as these, in the Tryal
of G. B. <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi>, &ldquo;They (<hi rend="italic">i.
e.</hi> the Witnesses) were enough to fix the character of a Witch upon
him.&rdquo;<ref target="n309">[309]</ref></p>


<p>In the Tryal of Bishop, these words, &ldquo;but there was no need of
them,&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> of further Testimony.<ref target="n310">[310]</ref></p>


<p>In the Tryal of How, where it is said, &ldquo;and there came in Testimony
of preternatural Mischiefs, presently befalling some that had been instrumental to
debar her from the Communion, whereupon she was intruding.&rdquo;<ref target="n311">[311]</ref> Martin
is call'd &ldquo;one of

<pb n="379"/>




the most impudent, scurrilous, wicked Creatures in the World.&rdquo; In his
Account of Martha Carryer, he is pleased to call her &ldquo;a Rampant
Hag,&rdquo;<ref target="n312">[312]</ref> etc.</p>


<p>These Expressions, as they manifest that he wrote more like an Advocate
than an Historian,<ref target="n313">[313]</ref> so also that those
that were his Imployers<ref target="n314">[314]</ref> were not mistaken
in their choice of him for that work, however he may have mist it in other
things.</p>


<p>As in his owning (in the Tryal of G. B.) That the Testimony of the
bewitched and confessors was not enough against the Accused, for it is known
that not only in New-England, such Evidence has been taken for sufficient, but
also in England, as himself there owns, and will also hold true of Scotland, etc.,
they having proceeded upon such Evidence, to the taking away of the Lives of
many, to assert that this is not enough is to tell the World that such Executions
were but so many Bloody Murders; which surely was not his intent to say.</p>


<p>His telling that the Court began to think that Burroughs stept aside to put
on invisibility, is a rendring them so mean Philosophers, and such weak
Christians, as to be fit to be imposed upon by any silly pretender.</p>


<p>His calling the Evidence against How trivial, and others against Burroughs,
he accounts no part of his Conviction; and that of lifting a Gun with one Finger,
its being not made use of as Evidence, renders the whole but the more perplext.
(Not to mention the many mistakes therein contain'd.)<ref target="n315">[315]</ref></p>


<p>Yet all this (and more that might have been hinted at) does not hinder, but
that his Account of the manner of Trials of those for Witchcraft is as faithfully
related as any Tryals of that kind, that was ever yet made
publick;<ref target="n316">[316]</ref> and it may
also

<pb n="380"/>




be reasonably thought that there was as careful a Scrutiny, and as unquestion'd
Evidences improved, as had been formerly used in the Tryals of others, for such
crimes in other places. Tho indeed a second part might be very useful, to set
forth which was the Evidence Convictive in these Tryals, for it is not supposed,
that Romantick or Ridiculous stories should have any influence, such as biting a
Spectres Finger, so that the Blood flowed out, or such as Shattock's Story of 12
Years standing, which yet was presently 18 Years or more, and yet a Man of that
excellent Memory, as to be able to recall a small difference his Wife had with
another Woman, when Eighteen Years were past.<ref target="n317">[317]</ref></p>


<p>As it is not to be supposed that such as these could Influence any Judge or
Jury, so not unkindness to relations, or God's having given to one Man more
strength than to some others, the over-setting of Carts, or the death of Cattle, nor
yet Excrescencies (call'd Tets) nor little bits of Rags tied together (call'd
Poppets.) Much less any persons illness, or having their Cloaths rent when a
Spectre has been well banged, much less the burning the Mares Fart, mentioned
in the Tryal of How.<ref target="n318">[318]</ref></p>


<p>None of these being in the least capable of proving the Indictment; The
supposed Criminals were Indicted for Afflicting, etc., such and such particular
persons by Witchcraft, to which none of these Evidences have one word to say,
and the Afflicted and Confessors being declared not enough, the matter needs yet
further explaining.<ref target="n319">[319]</ref></p>


<pb n="381"/>


<p>But to proceed, the General Court having sat and enacted Laws, particularly
one against Witchcraft, assigning the Penalty of Death to any that shall feed,
reward or employ, etc., Evil Spirits, though it has not yet been explained what
is intended thereby, or what it is to feed, reward or imploy Devils, etc., yet some
of the Legislators have given this instead of an Explanation, that they had therein
but Copied the Law of another Country.<ref target="n320">[320]</ref></p>


<pb n="382"/>

<p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 3. By vertue of an Act of the General
Court, the first Superior Court was held at Salem, for the County of Essex, the
Judges appointed were Mr. William Stoughton (the Lieutenant Governour)
Thomas Danforth, John Richards, Wait Winthorp,<ref target="n321">[321]</ref> and Samuel Sewall, Esquires,
Where Ignoramus<ref target="n322">[322]</ref> was found upon the several Bills of Indictment against Thirty,
and <hi rend="italic">Billa Vera</hi><ref target="n323">[323]</ref> against Twenty six more; of all
these Three only were found Guilty by the Jewry upon Trial, two of which were
(as appears by their Behaviour) the most senseless and Ignorant Creatures that
could be found;<ref target="n324">[324]</ref> besides which it does not appear what came in against those
more than against the rest that were acquitted.<ref target="n325">[325]</ref></p>


<p>The Third was the Wife of Wardwell, who was one of the Twenty
Executed, and it seems they had both confessed themselves Guilty; but he
retracting his said Confession, was tried and Executed;<ref target="n326">[326]</ref> it is supposed that this
Woman fearing her Husbands fate, was not so stiff in her denyals of her former
Confession, such as it was. These Three received Sentence of Death.</p>


<p>At these Tryals some of the Jewry made Inquiry of the Court, what
Account they ought to make of the Spectre Evidence? and received for Answer
&ldquo;as much as of Chips in Wort.&rdquo;<ref target="n327">[327]</ref></p>


<p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 31, 169 2/3. The Superior Court began
at Charles-town, for the County of Middlesex, Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Danforth, Mr.
Winthorp, and Mr. Sewall Judges, where several had Ignoramus returned upon
their Bills of Indictment, and <hi rend="italic">Billa Vera</hi> upon
others.</p>


<p>In the time the Court sat, word was brought in, that a Reprieve was sent
to Salem,<ref target="n328">[328]</ref> and had prevented the Execution of Seven of those that were there
Condemned, which so moved the chief Judge,<ref target="n329">[329]</ref> that he said to this effect,
&ldquo;We were in a way to have cleared the Land of these, etc., who
it is obstructs

<pb n="383"/>




the course of Justice I know not; the Lord be merciful to the
Countrey,&rdquo; and so went off the Bench, and came no more that Court: The
most remarkable of the Tryals, was of Sarah Daston, she was a Woman of about
70 or 80 Years of Age. To usher in her Tryal, a report went before, that if there
were a Witch in the World she was one, as having been so accounted of, for 20
or 30 Years; which drew many People from Boston, etc., to hear her Tryal.
There were a multitude of Witnesses produced against her; but what Testimony
they gave in seemed wholly forreign, as of accidents, illness, etc., befalling them,
or theirs after some Quarrel; what these testified was much of it of Actions said
to be done 20 Years before that time. The Spectre-Evidence was not made use of
in these Tryals, so that the Jewry soon brought her in not Guilty; her Daughter
and Grand-daughter, and the rest that were then tried, were also acquitted. After
she was cleared Judge Danforth Admonished her in these words, &ldquo;Woman,
Woman, repent, there are shrewd things come in against you&rdquo;; she was
remanded to Prison for her Fees, and there in a short time expired. One of
Boston that had been at the Tryal of Daston, being the same Evening in company
with one of the Judges in a publick place, acquainted him that some that had been
both at the Tryals at Salem and at this at Charlestown, had asserted that there was
more Evidence against the said Daston than against any at Salem, to which the
said Judge conceeded, saying, That it was so. It was replied by that person, that
he dare give it under his hand, that there was not enough come in against her to
bear a just reproof.<ref target="n330">[330]</ref></p>


<p><hi rend="italic">April</hi> 25, 1693. The first Superiour Court was
held at Boston, for the County of Suffolk, the Judges were the Lieutenant
Governour, Mr. Danforth, Mr. Richards and Mr. Sewall, Esquires.</p>


<p>Where (besides the acquitting Mr. John Aldin by Proclamation) the most
remarkable was, what related to Mary Watkins, who had been a Servant, and
lived about Seven Miles from Boston, having formerly Accused her Mistress of
Witch

<pb n="384"/>




craft, and was supposed to be distracted, she was threatned if she persisted in
such Accusations to be punished; this with the necessary care to recover her
Health, had that good effect, that she not only had her Health restored, but also
wholly acquitted her Mistress of any such Crimes, and continued in Health till the
return of the Year, and then again falling into Melancholly humours she was
found strangling her self; her Life being hereby prolonged, she immediately
accused her self of being a Witch; was carried before a Magistrate and
committed. At this Court a Bill of Indictment was brought to the Grand Jury
against her, and her confession upon her Examination given in as Evidence, but
these not wholly satisfied herewith, sent for her, who gave such account of her
self, that they (after they had returned into the Court to ask some Questions)
Twelve of them agreed to find Ignoramus, but the Court was pleased to send
them out again, who again at coming in returned it as before.</p>


<p>She was continued for some time in Prison, etc., and at length was sold to
Virginia.<ref target="n331">[331]</ref> About this time the
Prisoners in all the Prisons were released.<ref target="n332">[332]</ref></p>


<p>To omit here the mentioning of several Wenches in Boston, etc., who
pretended to be Afflicted, and accused several, the Ministers often visiting them,
and praying with them, concerning whose Affliction Narratives are in being in
Manuscript.<ref target="n333">[333]</ref> Not only these, but the generality of those Accusers may have since
convinc'd the Ministers by their vicious courses that they might err in extending
too much Charity to them.</p>


<p>The conclusion of the whole in the Massachusetts Colony was, Sir William
Phips, Governour, being call'd home, before he went he pardon'd such as had
been condemned, for which they gave about 30 Shillings each to the Kings
Attorney.<ref target="n334">[334]</ref></p>


<pb n="385"/>



<p>In <hi rend="italic">August</hi> 1697. The Superiour Court sat at
Hartford, in the Colony of Connecticut, where one Mistress Benom was tried for
Witchcraft, she had been accused by some Children that pretended to the Spectral
sight; they searched her several times for Tets; they tried the Experiment of
casting her into the Water,<ref target="n335">[335]</ref> and after this she was Excommunicated by the
Minister of Wallinsford.<ref target="n336">[336]</ref> Upon her Tryal nothing material appearing against her,
save Spectre Evidence, she was acquitted, as also her Daughter, a Girl of Twelve
or Thirteen Years old, who had been likewise Accused; but upon renewed
Complaints against them, they both fled into New-York Government.<ref target="n337">[337]</ref></p>


<p>Before this the Government Issued forth the following
Proclamation.<ref target="n338">[338]</ref></p>

withstand the mysterious delusions of the Powers of Darkness, and Prince of the
Air; but were for want of Knowledge in our selves, and better Information from
others, prevailed with to take up with such Evidence against the Accused, as on
further consideration, and better Information, we justly fear was insufficient for
the touching the Lives of any, Deut. 17. 6, whereby we fear we have been
instrumental with others, tho Ignorantly and unwittingly, to bring upon our
selves, and this People of the Lord, the Guilt of Innocent Blood; which Sin the
Lord saith in Scripture, he would not pardon, 2 Kings 24. 4, that is we suppose
in regard of his temporal Judgments. We do therefore hereby signifie to all in
general (and to the surviving Sufferers in especial) our deep sense of, and sorrow
for our Errors, in acting on such Evidence to the condemning of any
person.</p>


<p>And do hereby declare that we justly fear that we were sadly deluded and
mistaken, for which we are much disquieted and dis

<pb n="388"/>




tressed in our minds; and do therefore humbly beg forgiveness, first of God for
Christ's sake for this our Error; And pray that God would not impute the guilt
of it to our selves, nor others; and we also pray that we may be considered
candidly, and aright by the living Sufferers as being then under the power of a
strong and general Delusion, utterly unacquainted with, and not experienced in
matters of that Nature.</p>


<p>We do heartily ask forgiveness of you all, whom we have justly offended,
and do declare according to our present minds, we would none of us do such
things again on such grounds for the whole World; praying you to accept of this
in way of Satisfaction for our Offence; and that you would bless the Inheritance
of the Lord, that he may be intreated for the Land.</p>

<p>Mr. C. M. having been very forward to write Books of Witchcraft, has not
been so forward either to explain or defend the Doctrinal part thereof, and his
belief (which he had a Years time to compose) he durst not venture so as to be
copied.<ref target="n343">[343]</ref>

Yet in this of the Life of Sir William he sufficiently testifies his retaining that
Heterodox belief, seeking by frightfull stories of the sufferings of some, and the
refined sight of others, etc., P. 69 to obtrude upon the World, and confirm it in
such a belief, as hitherto he either cannot or will not defend, as if the Blood
already shed thereby were not sufficient.</p>


<p>Mr. I. Mather, in his <hi rend="italic">Cases of Conscience</hi>,
P. 25, tells of a Bewitched Eye, and that such can see more than others. They
were certainly bewitched Eyes that could see as well shut as open, and that could
see what never was, that could see the Prisoners upon the Afflicted, harming of
them, when those whose Eyes were not bewitched could have sworn that they did
not stir from the Bar. The Accusers are said to have suffered much by biting, P.
73. And the prints of just such a set of Teeth, as those they Accused, had, but
such as had not such bewitch'd Eyes have seen the Accusers bite themselves, and
then complain of the Accused. It has also been seen when the Accused, instead
of having just such a set of Teeth, has not had one in his head. They were such
bewitched Eyes that could see the Poisonous Powder (brought by Spectres P. 70.)
And that could see in the Ashes the print of the Brand, there invisibly heated to
torment the pretended Sufferers with, etc.</p>


<p>These with the rest of such Legends have this direct tendency, <hi
rend="italic">viz.</hi> To tell the World that the Devil is more ready to
serve his Votaries, by his doing for them things above or against the course of
Nature, shewing himself to them, and making explicit contract with them, etc.,
than the Divine Being is to his faithful Servants, and that as he is willing, so also
able to perform their desires. The way whereby these People are believed to
arrive at a power to Afflict their Neighbours, is by a compact with the Devil, and
that they have a power to Commissionate him to those Evils, P. 72. However
Irrational, or Inscriptural such Assertions are, yet they seem

<pb n="390"/>




a necessary part of the Faith of such as maintain the belief of such a sort of
Witches.</p>


<p>As the Scriptures know nothing of a covenanting or commissioning Witch,
so Reason cannot conceive how Mortals should by their Wickedness arrive at a
power to Commissionate Angels, Fallen Angels, against their Innocent
Neighbours. But the Scriptures are full in it, and the Instances numerous, that the
Almighty, Divine Being has this prerogative to make use of what Instrument he
pleaseth, in Afflicting any, and consequently to commissionate Devils: And tho
this word commissioning, in the Authors former Books, might be thought to be
by inadvertency; yet now after he hath been caution'd of it, still to persist in it
seems highly Criminal. And therefore in the name of God, I here charge such
belief as guilty of Sacriledge in the highest Nature, and so much worse than
stealing Church Plate, etc., As it is a higher Offence to steal any of the glorious
Attributes of the Almighty, to bestow them upon Mortals, than it is to steal the
Utensils appropriated to his Service. And whether to ascribe such power of
commissioning Devils to the worst of Men, be not direct Blasphemy, I leave to
others better able to determine. When the Pharisees were so wicked as to ascribe
to Beelzebub, the mighty works of Christ (whereby he did manifestly shew forth
his Power and Godhead) then it was that our Saviour declar'd the Sin against the
Holy Ghost to be unpardonable.</p>


<p>When the Righteous God is contending with Apostate Sinners, for their
departures from him, by his Judgments, as Plagues, Earthquakes, Storms and
Tempests, Sicknesses and Diseases, Wars, loss of Cattle, etc. Then not only to
ascribe this to the Devil, but to charge one another with sending or
commissionating those Devils to these things, is so abominable and so wicked,
that it requires a better Judgment than mine to give it its just denomination.</p>


<p>But that Christians so called should not only charge their fellow Christians
therewith, but proceed to Tryals and Executions; crediting that Enemy to all
Goodness, and Accuser of the Brethren, rather than believe their Neighbours in
their own Defence; This is so Diabolical a Wickedness as cannot proceed, but
from a Doctrine of Devils; how far damnable it is let others discuss. Tho such
things were acting in this

Country in Sir Williams time, yet p. 65. there is a Discourse of a Guardian
Angel, as then over-seeing it, which notion, however it may suit the Faith of
Ethnicks,<ref target="n344">[344]</ref> or the fancies of
Trithemius,<ref target="n345">[345]</ref> it is certain that the Omnipresent Being
stands not in need as Earthly Potentates do, of governing the World by
Vicegerents. And if Sir William had such an Invisible pattern to imitate, no
wonder tho some of his Actions were unaccountable, especially those relating to
Witchcraft: For if there was in those Actions an Angel super-intending, there is
little reason to think it was Gabriel or the Spirit of Mercury, nor Hanael the
Angel or Spirit of Venus, nor yet Samuel the Angel or Spirit of Mars; Names
feigned by the said Trithemius, etc. It may rather be thought to be Apollyon, or
Abaddon.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Obj.</hi><ref target="n346">[346]</ref> But here it will be said, &ldquo;What,
are there no Witches? Do's not the Law of God command that they should be
extirpated? Is the Command vain and Unintelligible?&rdquo; <hi
rend="italic">Sol.</hi><ref target="n347">[347]</ref> For any to say that a Witch is one that makes a
compact with, and Commissions Devils, etc., is indeed to render the Law of God
vain and Unintelligible, as having provided no way whereby they might be
detected, and proved to be such; And how the Jews waded thro this difficulty for
so many Ages, without the Supplement of Mr. Perkins and Bernard thereto,
would be very mysterious. But to him that can read the Scriptures without
prejudice from Education, etc., it will manifestly appear that the Scripture is full
and Intelligible, both as to the Crime and means to detect the culpable. He that
shall hereafter see any person, who to confirm People in a false belief, about the
power of Witches and Devils, pretending to a sign to confirm it, such as knocking
off of invisible Chains with the hand, driving away Devils by brushing, striking
with a Sword or Stick, to wound a person at a great distance, etc., may
(according to that head of Mr. Gauls, quoted by Mr. C. M. and so often herein
before recited, and so well proved by Scripture) conclude that he has seen
Witchcraft performed.</p>


<pb n="392"/>

<p>If Baalam became a Sorcerer by Sacrifizing and Praying to the true God
against his visible people; Then he that shall pray that the afflicted (by their
Spectral Sight) may accuse some other Person (whereby their reputations and
lives may be indangered) such will justly deserve the Name of a Sorcerer. If any
Person pretends to know more then<ref target="n348">[348]</ref> can be known by humane means, and
professeth at the same time that they have it from the Black-Man, <hi
rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the Devil, and shall from hence give Testimony
against the Lives of others, they are manifestly such as have a familiar Spirit; and
if any, knowing them to have their Information from the Black-Man, shall be
inquisitive of them for their Testimony against others, they therein are dealing
with such as have a Familiar-Spirit.</p>


<p>And if these shall pretend to see the dead by their Spectral Sight, and others
shall be inquisitive of them, and receive their Answers what it is the dead say,
and who it is they accuse, both the one and the other are by Scripture Guilty of
Necromancy.</p>


<p>These are all of them crimes as easily proved as any whatsoever, and that
by such proof as the Law of God requires, so that it is no Unintelligible
Law.</p>


<p>But if the Iniquity of the times be such, that these Criminals not only
Escape Indemnified,<ref target="n349">[349]</ref> but are Incouraged in their Wickedness, and made use of
to take away the Lives of others, this is worse than a making the Law of God
Vain, it being a rendring of it dangerous, against the Lives of Innocents, and
without all hopes of better, so long as these Bloody Principles remain.</p>


<p>As long as Christians do Esteem the Law of God to be Imperfect, as not
describing that crime that it requires to be Punish'd by Death;</p>


<p>As long as men suffer themselves to be Poison'd in their Education, and be
grounded in a False Belief by the Books of the Heathen;</p>


<p>As long as the Devil shall be believed to have a Natural Power, to Act
above and against a course of Nature;</p>


<p>As long as the Witches shall be believed to have a Power to Commission
him;</p>


<p>As long as the Devils Testimony, by the pretended afflicted,

<pb n="393"/>




shall be received as more valid to Condemn, than their Plea of Not Guilty to
acquit;</p>


<p>As long as the Accused shall have their Lives and Liberties confirmed and
restored to them, upon their Confessing themselves Guilty;</p>


<p>As long as the Accused shall be forc't to undergo Hardships and Torments
for their not Confessing;</p>


<p>As long as Tets for the Devil to Suck are searched for upon the Bodies of
the accused, as a token of guilt;</p>


<p>As long as the Lords Prayer shall be profaned, by being made a Test, who
are culpable;</p>


<p>As long as Witchcraft, Sorcery, Familiar Spirits, and Necromancy, shall
be improved to discover who are Witches, etc.,</p>


<p>So long it may be expected that Innocents will suffer as Witches.</p>


<p>So long God will be Daily dishonoured, And so long his Judgments must
be expected to be continued.</p>

&ldquo;George Burrough, John Willard, Jno. Procter, Martha Carrier and
George Jacobs were executed at Salem, a very great number of Spectators being
present. Mr. Cotton Mather was there, Mr. Sims, Hale, Noyes, Chiever, etc. All
of them said they were innocent, Carrier and all. Mr. Mather says they all died
by a Righteous Sentence. Mr. Burrough by his Speech, Prayer, protestation of his
Innocence, did much move unthinking persons, which occasions their speaking
hardly concerning his being executed.&rdquo; In the margin he later added
&ldquo;Dolefull Witchcraft!&rdquo;</p></note>

<note id="n274"><seg type="note-symbol">[274].</seg> <p>By &ldquo;Mr. Mather&rdquo; is unquestionably meant Increase Mather.
He alone, as the senior in age and in dignity, could with propriety be thus given
the first place; and his son, if named at all, would have been identified as
&ldquo;Mr. Cotton Mather.&rdquo; That he is not named at all needs no
explanation to those who have read his own words as to accusers and accused and
his complaints as to the blame heaped upon himself. Of Moody, Willard, Bailey,
we have perhaps seen enough in earlier pages to guess why such an appeal might
with hope be addressed to them. The Boston Tory Joshua Broadbent, writing on
June 21 from New York, reported that &ldquo;Mrs. Moody, Parson Moody's
wife, is said to be one&rdquo; of the witches. (<hi rend="italic">Calendar
of State Papers, Colonial</hi>, 1689-1692, p. 653.) Of Allen, the well-to-do
minister of the First Church, who seems to have been a man of much caution, it
may be well to remember that prior to 1678 he had owned the estate at Salem
Village since occupied, but not yet in full ownership, by the Nurses, Procter's
near neighbors, and that he was doubtless personally known to the petitioner.
Bailey, who had come to America in 1683, had at first assisted Willard at the
South Church, and, after a pastorate at Watertown, was now Allen's assistant at
the First.</p></note>

were chosen from among church-members only, not, as later, from all who had
the property to make them voters under the new charter. The act establishing this

For some of the evidence extorted by it in this case see <hi
rend="italic">Records of Salem Witchcraft</hi>, p. 198. The use of torture
in cases of witchcraft had been recommended by Perkins, the Puritan oracle, and
yet more warmly by King James; and despite protesting jurists it came into use.
Even Coke, who maintains that &ldquo;there is no Law to warrant tortures in this
land, nor can they be justified by any prescription,&rdquo; has to add
&ldquo;being so lately brought in&rdquo; (<hi
rend="italic">Institutes</hi>, III., cap. 2). As to its actual use in English
witch-trials see Notestein, <hi rend="italic">Witchcraft in England</hi>,
index, <hi rend="italic">s. v.
</hi> &ldquo;Torture.&rdquo; But Massachusetts law, from 1641 on, had
straitly forbidden it except, after conviction, to extort the names of accomplices;
and even then forbade &ldquo;such tortures as be barbarous and
inhumane&rdquo; (see <hi rend="italic">Body of Liberties</hi>, par. 45;
ed. of 1660, p. 67; ed. of 1672, p. 129). If in 1648 the highest court of the
colony, learning with admiration of the achievements of Matthew Hopkins in
England, was &ldquo;desirous that the same course which hath been taken in
England for the discovery of witches, by watchinge, may also be taken
here,&rdquo; and ordered, in the case of a witch, that &ldquo;a strict watch be
set about her every night, and that her husband be confined to a private room,
and watched also&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">Records of
Massachusetts</hi>, III. 126), their phrasing betrays how little they understood
the rigor of the English method. In 1692 even Cotton Mather declared himself
&ldquo;farr from urging the un-English method of torture&rdquo; (<hi
rend="italic">Mather Papers</hi>, p. 394), though he urged on the judges
&ldquo;whatever hath a tendency to put the witches into confusion,&rdquo; such
as &ldquo;Crosse and Swift Questions.&rdquo; But the procedure of that day,
like our own, drew a line between what might be used in the courts and what
might be permitted to extra-judicial inquiry, and we shall see yet more of methods
used at Salem to extort confession.</p></note>

whereas your poor and humble declarant being closely
confined here in Salem jail for the crime of witchcraft, which crime, thanks be
to the Lord, I am altogether ignorant of, as will appear at the great day of
judgment. May it please the honoured court, I was cried out upon by some of the
possessed persons, as afflicting of them; whereupon I was brought to my
examination, which persons at the sight of me fell down, which did very much
startle and affright me. The Lord above knows I knew nothing, in the least
measure, how or who afflicted them; they told me, without doubt I did, or else
they would not fall down at me; they told me if I would not confess, I should be
put down into the dungeon and would be hanged, but if I would confess I should
have my life; the which did so affright me, with my own vile wicked heart, to
save my life made me make the confession I did, which confession, may it please
the honoured court, is altogether false and untrue. The very first night after I had
made my confession, I was in such horror of conscience that I could not sleep,
for fear the Devil should carry me away for telling such horrid lies. I was, may
it please the honoured court, sworn to my confession, as I understand since, but
then, at that time, was ignorant of it, not knowing what an oath did mean. The
Lord, I hope, in whom I trust, out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive
me my false forswearing myself. What I said was altogether false, against my
grandfather, and Mr. Burroughs, which I did to save my life and to have my
liberty; but the Lord, charging it to my conscience, made me in so much horror,
that I could not contain myself before I had denied my confession, which I did,
though I saw nothing but death before me, choosing rather death with a quiet
conscience, than to live in such horror, which I could not suffer. Whereupon my
denying my confession, I was committed to close prison, where I have enjoyed
more felicity in spirit a thousand times than I did before in my
enlargement.</p><p>&ldquo;And now, may it please your honours, your poor and humble
declarant having, in part, given your honours a description of my condition, do
leave it to your honours pious and judicious discretions to take pity and
compassion on my young and tender years; to act and do with me as the Lord

my cause for me; not being guilty in the least measure of the crime of witchcraft,
nor any other sin that deserves death from man; and your poor and humble

had been represented to her, One amongst others, but she knew not what hand
Afflicted her then, but on the 5th of the 9th [<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>,

Mrs. Hayle did sorely Afflict her by pinching, pricking and Choaking her. On the

did Afflict her as formerly. Sd Easty made as if she would speake but did not,
but on the same night they Came again and Mrs. Hayle did sorely Afflict her,
and asked her if she thought she was a Witch. The Girl answered no, You be the
Devill. Then said Easty sd and speake, She Came to tell her She had been put to
Death wrongfully and was Innocent of Witchcraft, and she Came to Vindicate her
Cause and she Cryed Vengeance, Vengeance, and bid her reveal this to Mr.
Hayle and Gerish, and then she would rise no more, nor should Mrs. Hayle
Afflict her any more. Memorand: that Just before sd Easty was Executed, She
Appeared to sd Girl, and said I am going upon the Ladder to be hanged for a
Witch, but I am innocent, and before a 12 Month be past you shall believe it. Sd
Girl sd she speake not of this before because she believed she was Guilty, Till

&ldquo;petty treason,&rdquo; they were burned (see Coke, <hi

rend="italic">Pleas of the Crown</hi>, p. 6). But this, of course, was after
trial by an ecclesiastical court; and since the Reformation ecclesiastical courts had
not had cognizance of such cases.</p></note>

<note id="n301"><seg type="note-symbol">[301].</seg> <p>This, the most striking feature of the Salem trials, is perhaps partially
explained by the closing suggestion of Cotton Mather's advice to the judges (<hi

lesser Criminalls be onely scourged with lesser punishments, and also put upon
some solemn, open, Publike and Explicitt renunciation of the Divil?... Or what
if the death of some of the offenders were either diverted or inflicted, according

confessed escaped death, it was nothing unique that they should be reckoned
&ldquo;lesser Criminalls.&rdquo;</p></note>

<note id="n304"><seg type="note-symbol">[304]The</seg> <p>best commentary on these words is a remarkable paper which
more than a century ago came into the hands of the Massachusetts
Historical Society and was published in its <hi rend="italic">Collections</hi>
(second series, 111. 221-225). As Dr. Belknap, who prepared it for
publication, labelled it "Remainder of the account of the Salem
Witchcraft" and seems to have meant it to be printed with Brattle's
letter (see pp. 169-190, above), it is not improbable that, with that
document, it had come from the family of Brattle and that it was
originally his. In that case it is by no means impossible that in his
hands Calef may have seen it and that from him he may have received
the recantation printed just above. The added paper runs:</p><p><hi rend="italic">"Salem</hi>,
Oct. 19, '92. The Rev. Mr. 1. Mather went to Salem
[to visit] the confessours (so called): He conferred with several of
them, and they spake as follows:" [Then are narrated the explanations
given by eleven of the women, the most suggestive being this:]
"Goodwife Tyler did say, that when she was first apprehended, she had
no fears upon her, and did think that nothing could have made her
confesse against herself; but since, she had found to her great grief,
that she had wronged the truth, and falsely accused herself: she
said, that when she was brought to Salem, her brother Bridges rode
with her, and that all along the way from Andover to Salem, her
brother kept telling her that she must needs be a witch, since the
afflicted accused her, and at her touch were raised out of their
fitts, and urging her to confess herself a witch; she as constantly
told him,that she was no witch, that she knew nothing of witchcraft, and begg'd
of him not to urge her to confesse; however when she came to Salem,
she was carried to a room, where her brother on one side and Mr. John
Emerson on the other side did tell her that she was certainly a witch,
and that she saw the devill before her eyes at that time (and
accordingly the said Emerson would attempt with his hand to beat him
away from her eyes) and they so urged her to confesse, that she wished
herself in any dungeon, rather than be so treated: Mr. Emerson told
her once and again, Well! I see you will not confesse! Well! I will
now leave you , and then you are undone, body and soul forever: Her
brother urged her to confesse, and told her that in so doing she could
not lye; to which she answered, Good brother, do not say so, for I
shall lye if I confesse, and then who shall answer unto God for my
lye? He still asserted it, and said that God would not suffer so many
good men to be in such an errour about it, and that she would
be hang'd, if she did not confesse, and continued
so long and so violently to urge and presse her to confesse, that she
thought verily her life would have gone from her, and became so
terrifyed in her mind, that she own'd at length almost any thing that
they propounded to her; but she had wronged her conscience in so
doing, she was guilty of a great sin in belying of herself, and
desired to mourn for it as long as she lived: This she said and a
great deal more of the like nature, and all of it with such affection,
sorrow, relenting, grief, and mourning as that it exceeds any pen for
to describe and expresse the same."</p><p>The "Mr. John Emerson"
of this episode was that clerical schoolmaster
whom we have already met in New Hampshire (see p. 37, note 3), but who
was now, a teacher at Charlestown. (Sibley, <hi rend="italic">Harvard
Graduates,</hi> II. 471-474.) If so personal an activity of President
Mather surprise, let it be remembered how widely the persecution was
now striking. His parishioner Lady Phips was among the accused, and
the Quaker John Whiting has a yet more startling suggestion:
commenting in 1702 on the account just printed in Cotton Mather's
<hi rend="italic">Magnalia</hi>, he mentions the "two Hundred more accused, some of
which of great Estates in Boston," and in the margin adds, "Query, Was
not the Governour's Wife, and C. M.'s Mother, some of them?"
(<hi rend="italic">Truth and Innocency Defended</hi>, p. 140.)</p><p>Yet not all
dared to retract. "More than one or two of those now in
Prison," writes Increase Mather (<hi rend="italic">Cases of Conscience</hi>,
Postscript), "have freely and credibly acknowledged their Communion
and Familiarity with the Spirits of Darkness; and have also declared
unto me the Time and Occasion, with the particular Circumstances of
their Hellish Obligations and Abominations."</p></note>

have done something to allay the panic. But, though it is dated by the author

<note id="n319"><seg type="note-symbol">[319].</seg> <p>The offense charged, in the indictments printed by Calef, was that the
accused &ldquo;wickedly and feloniously hath used certain detestable arts, called
witchcrafts and sorceries, by which said wicked arts&rdquo; the said bewitched
&ldquo;was and is tortured, afflicted, pined, consumed, wasted and tormented
against the peace of our sovereign lord and lady, the King and Queen, and against
the form of the statute in that case made and provided.&rdquo; This was the
usual form; but four of the indictments extant (against Rebecca Eames, Samuel
Wardwell, Rebecca Jacobs, <hi rend="italic">Records of Salem
Witchcraft</hi>, II. 24, 143, 147-148, and William Barker's, preserved by
Chandler, <hi rend="italic">American Criminal Trials</hi>, I. 429) charge
instead that the accused &ldquo;wickedly and feloniously a covenant with the Evil
Spirit the Devil did make,&rdquo; and in two of these &ldquo;the statute of King
James the First&rdquo; is expressly named as contravened. That statute, indeed,
punished alike with death those who should &ldquo;consult, covenant with,
entertain, employ, feed, or reward any evil or wicked spirit,&rdquo; and the laws
of Massachusetts made it death &ldquo;if any man or woman be a witch (that is,
hath or consulteth with a familiar spirit)&rdquo; &mdash; without a mention of
harm to man or beast as element of the crime. That the indictments specify such
harm was perhaps only because the public attorney &mdash; Thomas Newton
(succeeded on July 26 by Anthony Checkley) &mdash; was fresh from English
practice; but, as Calef implies, the proof should meet the indictment. Newton
(1660-1721) had come to Boston in 1688. Mr. Goodell, who studied the originals,
says the quoted indictments mentioning the English statute &ldquo;appear to have
been drawn in blank by him, and afterwards filled in by Checkley&rdquo; (<hi
rend="italic">Further Notes</hi>, p. 37). As to Newton see the study of
Moore (<hi rend="italic">Final Notes</hi>, pp. 94-103). Edward Randolph
says of him (V. 143) that he was &ldquo;a person well known in the practice in
the Courts in England and New England,&rdquo; while Checkley he calls
&ldquo;a man ignorant in the Laws of England.&rdquo; In 1691 Newton had
been attorney general at New York.</p></note>

<note id="n320"><seg type="note-symbol">[320].</seg> <p>The laws of the colony had never ceased to be operative; and the first act
passed (June 15, 1692) by the General Court under the new charter was for the
continuance of these laws, &ldquo;being not repugnant to the laws of England nor
inconsistent with the present constitution,&rdquo; in full force till November 10.
On October 29 the Court passed a general &ldquo;act for the punishing of capital
offenders,&rdquo; in which the old Massachusetts law as to
witchcraft &mdash; &ldquo;If any man or woman be a witch, that is, hath or
consulteth with a familiar spirit, they shall be put to death&rdquo; &mdash; retains
its old place and wording. And on December 14, &ldquo;for more particular
direction in the execution of the law against witchcraft,&rdquo; the same General
Court enacted the long English statute of 1604 (1 James I., cap. 12) &mdash;
omitting only the penalty of loss of &ldquo;the privilege and benefit of clergy and
sanctuary&rdquo; and the clauses saving dower and inheritance to widow and heir
of the convicted and providing that peers shall be tried by peers, substituting as
the place of pillorying &ldquo;some shire town&rdquo; for &ldquo;some market
town upon the market day or at such time as any fair shall be kept there,&rdquo;
and adding to the penalty (for the lighter degrees of sorcery) of imprisonment,
pillory, and public confession of the offence, the clause: &ldquo;which said
offense shall be written in capital letters, and placed upon the breast of said
offender.&rdquo; The commission creating the Court of Oyer and Terminer (May
27, 1692) antedated, however, all these laws, and instructed that body &ldquo;to
enquire of, hear and determine for this time, according to the law and custom of
England and of this their Majesties' province, all and all manner of
crimes.&rdquo; (For a learned study of witchcraft laws in England and New
England see Moore's <hi rend="italic">Notes on Witchcraft</hi>, pp.

himself and family; and being sensible, that as to the Guilt contracted upon the
opening of the late Commission of Oyer and Terminer at Salem (to which the
order for this Day relates) he is, upon many accounts, more concerned than any
that he knows of, Desires to take the Blame and shame of it, Asking pardon of
men, And especially desiring prayers that God, who has an Unlimited Authority,
would pardon that sin and all other his sins, personal and Relative: And according
to his infinite Benignity, and Sovereignty, Not Visit the sin of him, or of any
other, upon himself or any of his, nor upon the Land: But that He would

<note id="n342"><seg type="note-symbol">[342].</seg> <p>This ends the book, as first written; but the author adds a
&ldquo;Postscript,&rdquo; called out by the publication, in 1697, of Cotton
Mather's life of Sir William Phips, who had died in London early in 1695. Not
the achievements of Sir William, thinks Calef, but Increase Mather's negotiation
in England and his procuring of the new charter, &ldquo;are the things
principally driven at in the book,&rdquo; and &ldquo;another principal thing is
to set forth the supposed witchcrafts in New-England, and how well Mr. Mather
the Younger therein acquitted himself.&rdquo; Wherefore, after freeing his mind
as to the matter of the charter, he takes up Mather's allegations as to the Salem
episode, and, pointing out that, &ldquo;tho this Book pretends to raise a Statue
in Honour of Sir William, yet it appears it was the least part of the design of the
Author to Honour him, but rather to Honour himself, and the Ministers,&rdquo;
since by so printing the advice of the ministers (see above, p. 356) &ldquo;as to
give a full Account of the cautions given him, but designedly hiding from the
Reader the Incouragements and Exhortations to proceed,&rdquo; it really throws
the blame upon Phips, he devotes the remaining pages, here reprinted, to Cotton
Mather's real views and their influence. The <hi rend="italic">Life of
Phips</hi>, now a rare book, is reprinted in Mather's <hi

a fortnight and uncopied. It was perhaps the MS. described by Poole (<hi

possession of the Massachusetts Historical Society, and called &ldquo;Cotton
Mather's belief and practice in those thorny difficulties which have distracted us

another hand.&rdquo; [Since the foregoing words were written, this conjecture
has been proved true. See above, p. 306, note 1.]</p></note>
