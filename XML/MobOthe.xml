</p><p><stage>Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly<lb/>
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse<lb/>
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>'Sblood, but you will not hear me:<lb/>
If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,<lb/>
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<lb/>
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,<lb/>
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:<lb/>
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,<lb/>
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance<lb/>
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;<lb/>
And, in conclusion,<lb/>
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,<lb/>
'I have already chose my officer.'<lb/>
And what was he?<lb/>
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<lb/>
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<lb/>
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;<lb/>
That never set a squadron in the field,<lb/>
Nor the division of a battle knows<lb/>
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,<lb/>
Wherein the toged consuls can propose<lb/>
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,<lb/>
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:<lb/>
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<lb/>
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds<lb/>
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd<lb/>
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,<lb/>
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<lb/>
And I&mdash;God bless the mark!&mdash;his Moorship's ancient.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,<lb/>
Preferment goes by letter and affection,<lb/>
And not by old gradation, where each second<lb/>
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,<lb/>
Whether I in any just term am affined<lb/>
To love the Moor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I would not follow him then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O, sir, content you;<lb/>
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:<lb/>
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<lb/>
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark<lb/>
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,<lb/>
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<lb/>
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,<lb/>
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:<lb/>
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are<lb/>
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,<lb/>
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<lb/>
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,<lb/>
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined<lb/>
their coats<lb/>
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;<lb/>
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<lb/>
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<lb/>
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:<lb/>
In following him, I follow but myself;<lb/>
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<lb/>
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:<lb/>
For when my outward action doth demonstrate<lb/>
The native act and figure of my heart<lb/>
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after<lb/>
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<lb/>
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>What a full fortune does the thicklips owe<lb/>
If he can carry't thus!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Call up her father,<lb/>
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,<lb/>
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<lb/>
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,<lb/>
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,<lb/>
Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,<lb/>
As it may lose some colour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell<lb/>
As when, by night and negligence, the fire<lb/>
Is spied in populous cities.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!<lb/>
Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!<lb/>
Thieves! thieves!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>What is the reason of this terrible summons?<lb/>
What is the matter there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Signior, is all your family within?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Are your doors lock'd?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Why, wherefore ask you this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on<lb/>
your gown;<lb/>
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;<lb/>
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram<lb/>
Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;<lb/>
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,<lb/>
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:<lb/>
Arise, I say.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>What, have you lost your wits?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker><p>	Not I<lb/>
what are you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>My name is Roderigo.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>The worser welcome:<lb/>
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:<lb/>
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say<lb/>
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,<lb/>
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,<lb/>
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come<lb/>
To start my quiet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Sir, sir, sir,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>But thou must needs be sure<lb/>
My spirit and my place have in them power<lb/>
To make this bitter to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Patience, good sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;<lb/>
My house is not a grange.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Most grave Brabantio,<lb/>
In simple and pure soul I come to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not<lb/>
serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to<lb/>
do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll<lb/>
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;<lb/>
you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have<lb/>
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>What profane wretch art thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter<lb/>
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Thou art a villain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>You are&mdash;a senator.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,<lb/>
If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,<lb/>
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,<lb/>
At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,<lb/>
Transported, with no worse nor better guard<lb/>
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,<lb/>
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor&mdash;<lb/>
If this be known to you and your allowance,<lb/>
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;<lb/>
But if you know not this, my manners tell me<lb/>
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe<lb/>
That, from the sense of all civility,<lb/>
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:<lb/>
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,<lb/>
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;<lb/>
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes<lb/>
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<lb/>
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:<lb/>
If she be in her chamber or your house,<lb/>
Let loose on me the justice of the state<lb/>
For thus deluding you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Strike on the tinder, ho!<lb/>
Give me a taper! call up all my people!<lb/>
This accident is not unlike my dream:<lb/>
Belief of it oppresses me already.<lb/>
Light, I say! light!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit above</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Farewell; for I must leave you:<lb/>
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,<lb/>
To be produced&mdash;as, if I stay, I shall&mdash;<lb/>
Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,<lb/>
However this may gall him with some cheque,<lb/>
Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd<lb/>
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,<lb/>
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,<lb/>
Another of his fathom they have none,<lb/>
To lead their business: in which regard,<lb/>
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.<lb/>
Yet, for necessity of present life,<lb/>
I must show out a flag and sign of love,<lb/>
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,<lb/>
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;<lb/>
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>It is too true an evil: gone she is;<lb/>
And what's to come of my despised time<lb/>
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,<lb/>
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!<lb/>
With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!<lb/>
How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me<lb/>
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:<lb/>
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Truly, I think they are.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!<lb/>
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds<lb/>
By what you see them act. Is there not charms<lb/>
By which the property of youth and maidhood<lb/>
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,<lb/>
Of some such thing?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir, I have indeed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!<lb/>
Some one way, some another. Do you know<lb/>
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I think I can discover him, if you please,<lb/>
To get good guard and go along with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;<lb/>
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!<lb/>
And raise some special officers of night.<lb/>
On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Another street.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Though in the trade of war I have slain men,<lb/>
Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience<lb/>
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity<lb/>
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times<lb/>
I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>'Tis better as it is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Nay, but he prated,<lb/>
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms<lb/>
Against your honour<lb/>
That, with the little godliness I have,<lb/>
I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,<lb/>
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,<lb/>
That the magnifico is much beloved,<lb/>
And hath in his effect a voice potential<lb/>
As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;<lb/>
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance<lb/>
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,<lb/>
Will give him cable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Let him do his spite:<lb/>
My services which I have done the signiory<lb/>
Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,&mdash;<lb/>
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,<lb/>
I shall promulgate&mdash;I fetch my life and being<lb/>
From men of royal siege, and my demerits<lb/>
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune<lb/>
As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,<lb/>
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,<lb/>
I would not my unhoused free condition<lb/>
Put into circumscription and confine<lb/>
For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Those are the raised father and his friends:<lb/>
You were best go in.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker><p>	Not I<lb/>
I must be found:<lb/>
My parts, my title and my perfect soul<lb/>
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>By Janus, I think no.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.<lb/>
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!<lb/>
What is the news?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>The duke does greet you, general,<lb/>
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,<lb/>
Even on the instant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What is the matter, think you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Something from Cyprus as I may divine:<lb/>
It is a business of some heat: the galleys<lb/>
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers<lb/>
This very night at one another's heels,<lb/>
And many of the consuls, raised and met,<lb/>
Are at the duke's already: you have been<lb/>
hotly call'd for;<lb/>
When, being not at your lodging to be found,<lb/>
The senate hath sent about three several guests<lb/>
To search you out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>'Tis well I am found by you.<lb/>
I will but spend a word here in the house,<lb/>
And go with you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Ancient, what makes he here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:<lb/>
If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I do not understand.<lb/>

<p>He's married.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>To who?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter OTHELLO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Marry, to&mdash;Come, captain, will you go?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Have with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Here comes another troop to seek for you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>It is Brabantio. General, be advised;<lb/>
He comes to bad intent.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with	torches and weapons</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Holla! stand there!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Signior, it is the Moor.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Down with him, thief!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They draw on both sides</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.<lb/>
Good signior, you shall more command with years<lb/>
Than with your weapons.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?<lb/>
Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;<lb/>
For I'll refer me to all things of sense,<lb/>
If she in chains of magic were not bound,<lb/>
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,<lb/>
So opposite to marriage that she shunned<lb/>
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,<lb/>
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,<lb/>
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom<lb/>
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.<lb/>
Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense<lb/>
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,<lb/>
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals<lb/>
That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;<lb/>
'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.<lb/>
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee<lb/>
For an abuser of the world, a practiser<lb/>
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.<lb/>
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,<lb/>
Subdue him at his peril.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Hold your hands,<lb/>
Both you of my inclining, and the rest:<lb/>
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it<lb/>
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go<lb/>
To answer this your charge?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>To prison, till fit time<lb/>
Of law and course of direct session<lb/>
Call thee to answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What if I do obey?<lb/>
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,<lb/>
Whose messengers are here about my side,<lb/>
Upon some present business of the state<lb/>
To bring me to him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Officer</speaker>
<p>'Tis true, most worthy signior;<lb/>
The duke's in council and your noble self,<lb/>
I am sure, is sent for.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>How! the duke in council!<lb/>
In this time of the night! Bring him away:<lb/>
Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,<lb/>
Or any of my brothers of the state,<lb/>
Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;<lb/>
For if such actions may have passage free,<lb/>
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>There is no composition in these news<lb/>
That gives them credit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Indeed, they are disproportion'd;<lb/>
My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>And mine, a hundred and forty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>And mine, two hundred:<lb/>
But though they jump not on a just account,&mdash;<lb/>
As in these cases, where the aim reports,<lb/>
'Tis oft with difference&mdash;yet do they all confirm<lb/>
A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:<lb/>
I do not so secure me in the error,<lb/>
But the main article I do approve<lb/>
In fearful sense.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Sailor</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Now, what's the business?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Sailor</speaker>
<p>The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;<lb/>
So was I bid report here to the state<lb/>
By Signior Angelo.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>How say you by this change?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>This cannot be,<lb/>
By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,<lb/>
To keep us in false gaze. When we consider<lb/>
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,<lb/>
And let ourselves again but understand,<lb/>
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,<lb/>
So may he with more facile question bear it,<lb/>
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,<lb/>
But altogether lacks the abilities<lb/>
That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,<lb/>
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful<lb/>
To leave that latest which concerns him first,<lb/>
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,<lb/>
To wake and wage a danger profitless.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Officer</speaker>
<p>Here is more news.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,<lb/>
Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,<lb/>
Have there injointed them with an after fleet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Of thirty sail: and now they do restem<lb/>
Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance<lb/>
Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,<lb/>
Your trusty and most valiant servitor,<lb/>
With his free duty recommends you thus,<lb/>
And prays you to believe him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.<lb/>
Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>He's now in Florence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you<lb/>
Against the general enemy Ottoman.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To BRABANTIO</stage></p>


<p>
I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;<lb/>
We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;<lb/>
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business<lb/>
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care<lb/>
Take hold on me, for my particular grief<lb/>
Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature<lb/>
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows<lb/>
And it is still itself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Why, what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>My daughter! O, my daughter!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE, Senator</speaker>
<p>Dead?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Ay, to me;<lb/>
She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted<lb/>
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;<lb/>
For nature so preposterously to err,<lb/>
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,<lb/>
Sans witchcraft could not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding<lb/>
Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself<lb/>
And you of her, the bloody book of law<lb/>
You shall yourself read in the bitter letter<lb/>
After your own sense, yea, though our proper son<lb/>
Stood in your action.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Humbly I thank your grace.<lb/>
Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,<lb/>
Your special mandate for the state-affairs<lb/>
Hath hither brought.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE, Senator</speaker>
<p>We are very sorry for't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p><stage>[To OTHELLO]</stage></p><p>  What, in your own part, can you say to this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Nothing, but this is so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,<lb/>
My very noble and approved good masters,<lb/>
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,<lb/>
It is most true; true, I have married her:<lb/>
The very head and front of my offending<lb/>
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,<lb/>
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:<lb/>
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,<lb/>
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used<lb/>
Their dearest action in the tented field,<lb/>
And little of this great world can I speak,<lb/>
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,<lb/>
And therefore little shall I grace my cause<lb/>
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,<lb/>
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver<lb/>
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,<lb/>
What conjuration and what mighty magic,<lb/>
For such proceeding I am charged withal,<lb/>
I won his daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>A maiden never bold;<lb/>
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion<lb/>
Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,<lb/>
Of years, of country, credit, every thing,<lb/>
To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!<lb/>
It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect<lb/>
That will confess perfection so could err<lb/>
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven<lb/>
To find out practises of cunning hell,<lb/>
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again<lb/>
That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,<lb/>
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,<lb/>
He wrought upon her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>To vouch this, is no proof,<lb/>
Without more wider and more overt test<lb/>
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods<lb/>
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>But, Othello, speak:<lb/>
Did you by indirect and forced courses<lb/>
Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?<lb/>
Or came it by request and such fair question<lb/>
As soul to soul affordeth?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I do beseech you,<lb/>
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,<lb/>
And let her speak of me before her father:<lb/>
If you do find me foul in her report,<lb/>
The trust, the office I do hold of you,<lb/>
Not only take away, but let your sentence<lb/>
Even fall upon my life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Fetch Desdemona hither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt IAGO and Attendants</stage></p>


<p>
And, till she come, as truly as to heaven<lb/>
I do confess the vices of my blood,<lb/>
So justly to your grave ears I'll present<lb/>
How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,<lb/>
And she in mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Say it, Othello.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Her father loved me; oft invited me;<lb/>
Still question'd me the story of my life,<lb/>
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,<lb/>
That I have passed.<lb/>
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,<lb/>
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;<lb/>
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,<lb/>
Of moving accidents by flood and field<lb/>
Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,<lb/>
Of being taken by the insolent foe<lb/>
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence<lb/>
And portance in my travels' history:<lb/>
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<lb/>
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven<lb/>
It was my hint to speak,&mdash;such was the process;<lb/>
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,<lb/>
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads<lb/>
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear<lb/>
Would Desdemona seriously incline:<lb/>
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:<lb/>
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,<lb/>
She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear<lb/>
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,<lb/>
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<lb/>
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<lb/>
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<lb/>
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<lb/>
But not intentively: I did consent,<lb/>
And often did beguile her of her tears,<lb/>
When I did speak of some distressful stroke<lb/>
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,<lb/>
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:<lb/>
She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,<lb/>
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:<lb/>
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd<lb/>
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,<lb/>
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,<lb/>
I should but teach him how to tell my story.<lb/>
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:<lb/>
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,<lb/>
And I loved her that she did pity them.<lb/>
This only is the witchcraft I have used:<lb/>
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>I think this tale would win my daughter too.<lb/>
Good Brabantio,<lb/>
Take up this mangled matter at the best:<lb/>
Men do their broken weapons rather use<lb/>
Than their bare hands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>I pray you, hear her speak:<lb/>
If she confess that she was half the wooer,<lb/>
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame<lb/>
Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:<lb/>
Do you perceive in all this noble company<lb/>
Where most you owe obedience?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>My noble father,<lb/>
I do perceive here a divided duty:<lb/>
To you I am bound for life and education;<lb/>
My life and education both do learn me<lb/>
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;<lb/>
I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,<lb/>
And so much duty as my mother show'd<lb/>
To you, preferring you before her father,<lb/>
So much I challenge that I may profess<lb/>
Due to the Moor my lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>God be wi' you! I have done.<lb/>
Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:<lb/>
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.<lb/>
Come hither, Moor:<lb/>
I here do give thee that with all my heart<lb/>
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart<lb/>
I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,<lb/>
I am glad at soul I have no other child:<lb/>
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,<lb/>
To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,<lb/>
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers<lb/>
Into your favour.<lb/>
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended<lb/>
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.<lb/>
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone<lb/>
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.<lb/>
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes<lb/>
Patience her injury a mockery makes.<lb/>
The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;<lb/>
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;<lb/>
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.<lb/>
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears<lb/>
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,<lb/>
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow<lb/>
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.<lb/>
These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,<lb/>
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:<lb/>
But words are words; I never yet did hear<lb/>
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.<lb/>
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for<lb/>
Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best<lb/>
known to you; and though we have there a substitute<lb/>
of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a<lb/>
sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer<lb/>
voice on you: you must therefore be content to<lb/>
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this<lb/>
more stubborn and boisterous expedition.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>The tyrant custom, most grave senators,<lb/>
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war<lb/>
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise<lb/>
A natural and prompt alacrity<lb/>
I find in hardness, and do undertake<lb/>
These present wars against the Ottomites.<lb/>
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,<lb/>
I crave fit disposition for my wife.<lb/>
Due reference of place and exhibition,<lb/>
With such accommodation and besort<lb/>
As levels with her breeding.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>If you please,<lb/>
Be't at her father's.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>I'll not have it so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Nor I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Nor I; I would not there reside,<lb/>
To put my father in impatient thoughts<lb/>
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,<lb/>
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;<lb/>
And let me find a charter in your voice,<lb/>
To assist my simpleness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>What would You, Desdemona?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>That I did love the Moor to live with him,<lb/>
My downright violence and storm of fortunes<lb/>
May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued<lb/>
Even to the very quality of my lord:<lb/>
I saw Othello's visage in his mind,<lb/>
And to his honour and his valiant parts<lb/>
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.<lb/>
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,<lb/>
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,<lb/>
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,<lb/>
And I a heavy interim shall support<lb/>
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Let her have your voices.<lb/>
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,<lb/>
To please the palate of my appetite,<lb/>
Nor to comply with heat&mdash;the young affects<lb/>
In me defunct&mdash;and proper satisfaction.<lb/>
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:<lb/>
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think<lb/>
I will your serious and great business scant<lb/>
For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys<lb/>
Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness<lb/>
My speculative and officed instruments,<lb/>
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,<lb/>
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,<lb/>
And all indign and base adversities<lb/>
Make head against my estimation!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Be it as you shall privately determine,<lb/>
Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,<lb/>
And speed must answer it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>You must away to-night.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>With all my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.<lb/>
Othello, leave some officer behind,<lb/>
And he shall our commission bring to you;<lb/>
With such things else of quality and respect<lb/>
As doth import you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>So please your grace, my ancient;<lb/>
A man he is of honest and trust:<lb/>
To his conveyance I assign my wife,<lb/>
With what else needful your good grace shall think<lb/>
To be sent after me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE OF VENICE</speaker>
<p>Let it be so.<lb/>
Good night to every one.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To BRABANTIO</stage></p>


<p>
And, noble signior,<lb/>
If virtue no delighted beauty lack,<lb/>
Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRABANTIO</speaker>
<p>Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:<lb/>
She has deceived her father, and may thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, &amp;c</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,<lb/>
My Desdemona must I leave to thee:<lb/>
I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:<lb/>
And bring them after in the best advantage.<lb/>

Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour<lb/>
Of love, of worldly matters and direction,<lb/>
To spend with thee: we must obey the time.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Iago,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What say'st thou, noble heart?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>What will I do, thinkest thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, go to bed, and sleep.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I will incontinently drown myself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,<lb/>
thou silly gentleman!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and<lb/>
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four<lb/>
times seven years; and since I could distinguish<lb/>
betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man<lb/>
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I<lb/>
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I<lb/>
would change my humanity with a baboon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so<lb/>
fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus<lb/>
or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which<lb/>
our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant<lb/>
nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up<lb/>
thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or<lb/>
distract it with many, either to have it sterile<lb/>
with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the<lb/>
power and corrigible authority of this lies in our<lb/>
wills. If the balance of our lives had not one<lb/>
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the<lb/>
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us<lb/>
to most preposterous conclusions: but we have<lb/>
reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal<lb/>
stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that<lb/>
you call love to be a sect or scion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>It cannot be.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of<lb/>
the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown<lb/>
cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy<lb/>
friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with<lb/>
cables of perdurable toughness; I could never<lb/>
better stead thee than now. Put money in thy<lb/>
purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with<lb/>
an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It<lb/>
cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her<lb/>
love to the Moor,&mdash; put money in thy purse,&mdash;nor he<lb/>
his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou<lb/>
shalt see an answerable sequestration:&mdash;put but<lb/>
money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in<lb/>
their wills: fill thy purse with money:&mdash;the food<lb/>
that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be<lb/>
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must<lb/>
change for youth: when she is sated with his body,<lb/>
she will find the error of her choice: she must<lb/>
have change, she must: therefore put money in thy<lb/>
purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a<lb/>
more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money<lb/>
thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt<lb/>
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not<lb/>
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou<lb/>
shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of<lb/>
drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek<lb/>
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than<lb/>
to be drowned and go without her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on<lb/>
the issue?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Thou art sure of me:&mdash;go, make money:&mdash;I have told<lb/>
thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I<lb/>
hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no<lb/>
less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge<lb/>
against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost<lb/>
thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many<lb/>
events in the womb of time which will be delivered.<lb/>
Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more<lb/>
of this to-morrow. Adieu.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Where shall we meet i' the morning?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>At my lodging.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I'll be with thee betimes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>What say you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>No more of drowning, do you hear?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:<lb/>
For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,<lb/>
If I would time expend with such a snipe.<lb/>
But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:<lb/>
And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets<lb/>
He has done my office: I know not if't be true;<lb/>
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,<lb/>
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;<lb/>
The better shall my purpose work on him.<lb/>
Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:<lb/>
To get his place and to plume up my will<lb/>
In double knavery&mdash;How, how? Let's see:&mdash;<lb/>
After some time, to abuse Othello's ear<lb/>
That he is too familiar with his wife.<lb/>
He hath a person and a smooth dispose<lb/>
To be suspected, framed to make women false.<lb/>
The Moor is of a free and open nature,<lb/>
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,<lb/>
And will as tenderly be led by the nose<lb/>
As asses are.<lb/>
I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night<lb/>
Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.<lb/>

<head>Scene 1</head><p><stage>A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>What from the cape can you discern at sea?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;<lb/>
I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,<lb/>
Descry a sail.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;<lb/>
A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:<lb/>
If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,<lb/>
What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,<lb/>
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>A segregation of the Turkish fleet:<lb/>
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,<lb/>
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;<lb/>
The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,<lb/>
seems to cast water on the burning bear,<lb/>
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:<lb/>
I never did like molestation view<lb/>
On the enchafed flood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>If that the Turkish fleet<lb/>
Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:<lb/>
It is impossible they bear it out.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a third Gentleman</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>News, lads! our wars are done.<lb/>
The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,<lb/>
That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice<lb/>
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance<lb/>
On most part of their fleet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>How! is this true?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>The ship is here put in,<lb/>
A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,<lb/>
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,<lb/>
Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,<lb/>
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort<lb/>
Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,<lb/>
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted<lb/>
With foul and violent tempest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>Pray heavens he be;<lb/>
For I have served him, and the man commands<lb/>
Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!<lb/>
As well to see the vessel that's come in<lb/>
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,<lb/>
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue<lb/>
An indistinct regard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Come, let's do so:<lb/>
For every minute is expectancy<lb/>
Of more arrivance.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CASSIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,<lb/>
That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens<lb/>
Give him defence against the elements,<lb/>
For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>Is he well shipp'd?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot<lb/>
Of very expert and approved allowance;<lb/>
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,<lb/>
Stand in bold cure.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter a fourth Gentleman</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>What noise?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Gentleman</speaker>
<p>The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea<lb/>
Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>My hopes do shape him for the governor.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Guns heard</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentlemen</speaker>
<p>They do discharge their shot of courtesy:<lb/>
Our friends at least.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I pray you, sir, go forth,<lb/>
And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>I shall.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid<lb/>
That paragons description and wild fame;<lb/>
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,<lb/>
And in the essential vesture of creation<lb/>
Does tire the ingener.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter second Gentleman</stage></p>


<p>
How now! who has put in?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Has had most favourable and happy speed:<lb/>
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,<lb/>
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands&mdash;<lb/>
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,&mdash;<lb/>
As having sense of beauty, do omit<lb/>
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by<lb/>
The divine Desdemona.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>What is she?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,<lb/>
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,<lb/>
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts<lb/>
A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,<lb/>
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,<lb/>
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,<lb/>
Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,<lb/>
Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits<lb/>
And bring all Cyprus comfort!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and	Attendants</stage></p>


<p>
O, behold,<lb/>
The riches of the ship is come on shore!<lb/>
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.<lb/>
Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,<lb/>
Before, behind thee, and on every hand,<lb/>
Enwheel thee round!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I thank you, valiant Cassio.<lb/>
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught<lb/>
But that he's well and will be shortly here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>O, but I fear&mdash;How lost you company?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>The great contention of the sea and skies<lb/>
Parted our fellowship&mdash;But, hark! a sail.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>They give their greeting to the citadel;<lb/>
This likewise is a friend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>See for the news.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Gentleman</stage></p>


<p>
Good ancient, you are welcome.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To EMILIA</stage></p>


<p>
Welcome, mistress.<lb/>
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,<lb/>
That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding<lb/>
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kissing her</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Sir, would she give you so much of her lips<lb/>
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,<lb/>
You'll have enough.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Alas, she has no speech.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>In faith, too much;<lb/>
I find it still, when I have list to sleep:<lb/>
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,<lb/>
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,<lb/>
And chides with thinking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>You have little cause to say so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,<lb/>
Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,<lb/>
Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,<lb/>
Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>O, fie upon thee, slanderer!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:<lb/>
You rise to play and go to bed to work.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>You shall not write my praise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>No, let me not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst<lb/>
praise me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O gentle lady, do not put me to't;<lb/>
For I am nothing, if not critical.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Ay, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I am not merry; but I do beguile<lb/>
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.<lb/>
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I am about it; but indeed my invention<lb/>
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;<lb/>
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,<lb/>
And thus she is deliver'd.<lb/>
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,<lb/>
The one's for use, the other useth it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Well praised! How if she be black and witty?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>If she be black, and thereto have a wit,<lb/>
She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Worse and worse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>How if fair and foolish?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>She never yet was foolish that was fair;<lb/>
For even her folly help'd her to an heir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'<lb/>
the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for<lb/>
her that's foul and foolish?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,<lb/>
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.<lb/>
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving<lb/>
woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her<lb/>
merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>She that was ever fair and never proud,<lb/>
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,<lb/>
Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,<lb/>
Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'<lb/>
She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,<lb/>
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,<lb/>
She that in wisdom never was so frail<lb/>
To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;<lb/>
She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,<lb/>
See suitors following and not look behind,<lb/>
She was a wight, if ever such wight were,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>To do what?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn<lb/>
of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say<lb/>
you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal<lb/>
counsellor?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in<lb/>
the soldier than in the scholar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,<lb/>
whisper: with as little a web as this will I<lb/>
ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon<lb/>
her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.<lb/>
You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as<lb/>
these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had<lb/>
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so<lb/>
oft, which now again you are most apt to play the<lb/>
sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent<lb/>
courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers<lb/>
to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Trumpet within</stage></p>


<p>
The Moor! I know his trumpet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>'Tis truly so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Let's meet him and receive him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Lo, where he comes!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter OTHELLO and Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O my fair warrior!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>My dear Othello!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>It gives me wonder great as my content<lb/>
To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!<lb/>
If after every tempest come such calms,<lb/>
May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!<lb/>
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas<lb/>
Olympus-high and duck again as low<lb/>
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,<lb/>
'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,<lb/>
My soul hath her content so absolute<lb/>
That not another comfort like to this<lb/>
Succeeds in unknown fate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>The heavens forbid<lb/>
But that our loves and comforts should increase,<lb/>
Even as our days do grow!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Amen to that, sweet powers!<lb/>
I cannot speak enough of this content;<lb/>
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:<lb/>
And this, and this, the greatest discords be<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kissing her</stage></p>


<p>
That e'er our hearts shall make!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  O, you are well tuned now!<lb/>
But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,<lb/>
As honest as I am.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Come, let us to the castle.<lb/>
News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks<lb/>
are drown'd.<lb/>
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?<lb/>
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;<lb/>
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,<lb/>
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote<lb/>
In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,<lb/>
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:<lb/>
Bring thou the master to the citadel;<lb/>
He is a good one, and his worthiness<lb/>
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,<lb/>
Once more, well met at Cyprus.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come<lb/>
hither. If thou be'st valiant,&mdash; as, they say, base<lb/>
men being in love have then a nobility in their<lb/>
natures more than is native to them&mdash;list me. The<lb/>
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of<lb/>
guard:&mdash;first, I must tell thee this&mdash;Desdemona is<lb/>
directly in love with him.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>With him! why, 'tis not possible.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.<lb/>
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,<lb/>
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:<lb/>
and will she love him still for prating? let not<lb/>
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;<lb/>
and what delight shall she have to look on the<lb/>
devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of<lb/>
sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to<lb/>
give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,<lb/>
sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which<lb/>
the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these<lb/>
required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will<lb/>
find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,<lb/>
disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will<lb/>
instruct her in it and compel her to some second<lb/>
choice. Now, sir, this granted,&mdash;as it is a most<lb/>
pregnant and unforced position&mdash;who stands so<lb/>
eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio<lb/>
does? a knave very voluble; no further<lb/>
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of<lb/>
civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing<lb/>
of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,<lb/>
none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a<lb/>
finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and<lb/>
counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never<lb/>
present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the<lb/>
knave is handsome, young, and hath all those<lb/>
requisites in him that folly and green minds look<lb/>
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman<lb/>
hath found him already.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I cannot believe that in her; she's full of<lb/>
most blessed condition.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of<lb/>
grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never<lb/>
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou<lb/>
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst<lb/>
not mark that?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue<lb/>
to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met<lb/>
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced<lb/>
together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these<lb/>
mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes<lb/>
the master and main exercise, the incorporate<lb/>
conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I<lb/>
have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;<lb/>
for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows<lb/>
you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find<lb/>
some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking<lb/>
too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what<lb/>
other course you please, which the time shall more<lb/>
favourably minister.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply<lb/>
may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for<lb/>
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to<lb/>
mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true<lb/>
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So<lb/>
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by<lb/>
the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the<lb/>
impediment most profitably removed, without the<lb/>
which there were no expectation of our prosperity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I will do this, if I can bring it to any<lb/>
opportunity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:<lb/>
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Adieu.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;<lb/>
That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:<lb/>
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,<lb/>
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,<lb/>
And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona<lb/>
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;<lb/>
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure<lb/>
I stand accountant for as great a sin,<lb/>
But partly led to diet my revenge,<lb/>
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor<lb/>
Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof<lb/>
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;<lb/>
And nothing can or shall content my soul<lb/>
Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,<lb/>
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor<lb/>
At least into a jealousy so strong<lb/>
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,<lb/>
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash<lb/>
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,<lb/>
I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,<lb/>
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb&mdash;<lb/>
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too&mdash;<lb/>
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.<lb/>
For making him egregiously an ass<lb/>
And practising upon his peace and quiet<lb/>
Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:<lb/>
Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>Herald</speaker>
<p>It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant<lb/>

every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,<lb/>
some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:<lb/>
Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,<lb/>
Not to outsport discretion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Iago hath direction what to do;<lb/>
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye<lb/>
Will I look to't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Iago is most honest.<lb/>
Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest<lb/>
Let me have speech with you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To DESDEMONA</stage></p>


<p>
Come, my dear love,<lb/>
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;<lb/>
That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.<lb/>
Good night.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter IAGO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the<lb/>
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love<lb/>
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:<lb/>
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and<lb/>
she is sport for Jove.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>She's a most exquisite lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of<lb/>
provocation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>She is indeed perfection.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I<lb/>
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace<lb/>
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to<lb/>
the health of black Othello.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and<lb/>
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish<lb/>
courtesy would invent some other custom of<lb/>
entertainment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for<lb/>
you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was<lb/>
craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation<lb/>
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,<lb/>
and dare not task my weakness with any more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants<lb/>
desire it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Where are they?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I'll do't; but it dislikes me.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>If I can fasten but one cup upon him,<lb/>
With that which he hath drunk to-night already,<lb/>
He'll be as full of quarrel and offence<lb/>
As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,<lb/>
Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,<lb/>
To Desdemona hath to-night caroused<lb/>
Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:<lb/>
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,<lb/>
That hold their honours in a wary distance,<lb/>
The very elements of this warlike isle,<lb/>
Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,<lb/>
And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,<lb/>
Am I to put our Cassio in some action<lb/>
That may offend the isle.&mdash;But here they come:<lb/>
If consequence do but approve my dream,<lb/>
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen;	servants following with wine</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am<lb/>
a soldier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Some wine, ho!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Sings</stage></p>


<p>
And let me the canakin clink, clink;<lb/>
And let me the canakin clink<lb/>
A soldier's a man;<lb/>
A life's but a span;<lb/>
Why, then, let a soldier drink.<lb/>
Some wine, boys!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>'Fore God, an excellent song.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are<lb/>
most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and<lb/>
your swag-bellied Hollander&mdash;Drink, ho!&mdash;are nothing<lb/>
to your English.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead<lb/>
drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he<lb/>
gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle<lb/>
can be filled.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>To the health of our general!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O sweet England!<lb/>
King Stephen was a worthy peer,<lb/>
His breeches cost him but a crown;<lb/>
He held them sixpence all too dear,<lb/>
With that he call'd the tailor lown.<lb/>
He was a wight of high renown,<lb/>
And thou art but of low degree:<lb/>
'Tis pride that pulls the country down;<lb/>
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.<lb/>
Some wine, ho!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Will you hear't again?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that<lb/>
does those things. Well, God's above all; and there<lb/>
be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>It's true, good lieutenant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>For mine own part,&mdash;no offence to the general, nor<lb/>
any man of quality,&mdash;I hope to be saved.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>And so do I too, lieutenant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the<lb/>
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's<lb/>
have no more of this; let's to our affairs.&mdash;Forgive<lb/>
us our sins!&mdash;Gentlemen, let's look to our business.<lb/>
Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my<lb/>
ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:<lb/>
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and<lb/>
speak well enough.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Excellent well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>You see this fellow that is gone before;<lb/>
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar<lb/>
And give direction: and do but see his vice;<lb/>
'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,<lb/>
The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.<lb/>
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.<lb/>
On some odd time of his infirmity,<lb/>
Will shake this island.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>But is he often thus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:<lb/>
He'll watch the horologe a double set,<lb/>
If drink rock not his cradle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>It were well<lb/>
The general were put in mind of it.<lb/>
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature<lb/>
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,<lb/>
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter RODERIGO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to him]</stage></p><p>  How now, Roderigo!<lb/>
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit RODERIGO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor<lb/>
Should hazard such a place as his own second<lb/>
With one of an ingraft infirmity:<lb/>
It were an honest action to say<lb/>
So to the Moor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Not I, for this fair island:<lb/>
I do love Cassio well; and would do much<lb/>
To cure him of this evil&mdash;But, hark! what noise?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Cry within: 'Help! help!'</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>You rogue! you rascal!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>What's the matter, lieutenant?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>A knave teach me my duty!<lb/>
I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Beat me!<lb/>

Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>Come, come,<lb/>
you're drunk.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Drunk!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They fight</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to RODERIGO]</stage></p><p>  Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.<lb/>

<p>
Nay, good lieutenant,&mdash;alas, gentlemen;&mdash;<lb/>
Help, ho!&mdash;Lieutenant,&mdash;sir,&mdash;Montano,&mdash;sir;<lb/>
Help, masters!&mdash;Here's a goodly watch indeed!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Bell rings</stage></p>


<p>
Who's that which rings the bell?&mdash;Diablo, ho!<lb/>
The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!<lb/>
You will be shamed for ever.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What is the matter here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Faints</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Hold, for your lives!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Hold, ho! Lieutenant,&mdash;sir&mdash;Montano,&mdash;gentlemen,&mdash;<lb/>
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?<lb/>
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?<lb/>
Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that<lb/>
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?<lb/>
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:<lb/>
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage<lb/>
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.<lb/>
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle<lb/>
From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?<lb/>
Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,<lb/>
Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I do not know: friends all but now, even now,<lb/>
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom<lb/>
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now&mdash;<lb/>
As if some planet had unwitted men&mdash;<lb/>
Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,<lb/>
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak<lb/>
Any beginning to this peevish odds;<lb/>
And would in action glorious I had lost<lb/>
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;<lb/>
The gravity and stillness of your youth<lb/>
The world hath noted, and your name is great<lb/>
In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,<lb/>
That you unlace your reputation thus<lb/>
And spend your rich opinion for the name<lb/>
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:<lb/>
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,&mdash;<lb/>
While I spare speech, which something now<lb/>
offends me,&mdash;<lb/>
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught<lb/>
By me that's said or done amiss this night;<lb/>
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,<lb/>
And to defend ourselves it be a sin<lb/>
When violence assails us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Now, by heaven,<lb/>
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;<lb/>
And passion, having my best judgment collied,<lb/>
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,<lb/>
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you<lb/>
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know<lb/>
How this foul rout began, who set it on;<lb/>
And he that is approved in this offence,<lb/>
Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,<lb/>
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,<lb/>
Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,<lb/>
To manage private and domestic quarrel,<lb/>
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!<lb/>
'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>If partially affined, or leagued in office,<lb/>
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,<lb/>
Thou art no soldier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Touch me not so near:<lb/>
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth<lb/>
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;<lb/>
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth<lb/>
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.<lb/>
Montano and myself being in speech,<lb/>
There comes a fellow crying out for help:<lb/>
And Cassio following him with determined sword,<lb/>
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman<lb/>
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:<lb/>
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,<lb/>
Lest by his clamour&mdash;as it so fell out&mdash;<lb/>
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,<lb/>
Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather<lb/>
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,<lb/>
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night<lb/>
I ne'er might say before. When I came back&mdash;<lb/>
For this was brief&mdash;I found them close together,<lb/>
At blow and thrust; even as again they were<lb/>
When you yourself did part them.<lb/>
More of this matter cannot I report:<lb/>
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:<lb/>
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,<lb/>
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,<lb/>
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received<lb/>
From him that fled some strange indignity,<lb/>
Which patience could not pass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I know, Iago,<lb/>
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,<lb/>
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee<lb/>
But never more be officer of mine.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended</stage></p>


<p>
Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!<lb/>
I'll make thee an example.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.<lb/>
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:<lb/>
Lead him off.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To MONTANO, who is led off</stage></p>


<p>
Iago, look with care about the town,<lb/>
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.<lb/>
Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life<lb/>
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What, are you hurt, lieutenant?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Ay, past all surgery.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Marry, heaven forbid!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost<lb/>
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of<lb/>
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,<lb/>
Iago, my reputation!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>As I am an honest man, I thought you had received<lb/>
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than<lb/>
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false<lb/>
imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without<lb/>
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,<lb/>
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!<lb/>
there are ways to recover the general again: you<lb/>
are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in<lb/>
policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his<lb/>
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue<lb/>
to him again, and he's yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so<lb/>
good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so<lb/>
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?<lb/>
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse<lb/>
fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible<lb/>
spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,<lb/>
let us call thee devil!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What was he that you followed with your sword? What<lb/>
had he done to you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I know not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Is't possible?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;<lb/>
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men<lb/>
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away<lb/>
their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance<lb/>
revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus<lb/>
recovered?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place<lb/>
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me<lb/>
another, to make me frankly despise myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,<lb/>
the place, and the condition of this country<lb/>
stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;<lb/>
but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me<lb/>
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,<lb/>
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a<lb/>
sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a<lb/>
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is<lb/>
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,<lb/>
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.<lb/>
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.<lb/>
I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife<lb/>
is now the general: may say so in this respect, for<lb/>
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the<lb/>
contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and<lb/>
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune<lb/>
her help to put you in your place again: she is of<lb/>
so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,<lb/>
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more<lb/>
than she is requested: this broken joint between<lb/>
you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my<lb/>
fortunes against any lay worth naming, this<lb/>
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>You advise me well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will<lb/>
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:<lb/>
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I<lb/>
must to the watch.<lb/>




</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>And what's he then that says I play the villain?<lb/>
When this advice is free I give and honest,<lb/>
Probal to thinking and indeed the course<lb/>
To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy<lb/>
The inclining Desdemona to subdue<lb/>
In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful<lb/>
As the free elements. And then for her<lb/>
To win the Moor&mdash;were't to renounce his baptism,<lb/>
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,<lb/>
His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,<lb/>
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,<lb/>
Even as her appetite shall play the god<lb/>
With his weak function. How am I then a villain<lb/>
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,<lb/>
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!<lb/>
When devils will the blackest sins put on,<lb/>
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,<lb/>
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool<lb/>
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes<lb/>
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,<lb/>
I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,<lb/>
That she repeals him for her body's lust;<lb/>
And by how much she strives to do him good,<lb/>
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.<lb/>
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,<lb/>
And out of her own goodness make the net<lb/>
That shall enmesh them all.<lb/>

<p>
How now, Roderigo!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that<lb/>
hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is<lb/>
almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well<lb/>
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall<lb/>
have so much experience for my pains, and so, with<lb/>
no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>How poor are they that have not patience!<lb/>
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?<lb/>
Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;<lb/>
And wit depends on dilatory time.<lb/>
Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.<lb/>
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:<lb/>
Though other things grow fair against the sun,<lb/>
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:<lb/>
Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;<lb/>
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.<lb/>
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:<lb/>
Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:<lb/>
Nay, get thee gone.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit RODERIGO</stage></p>


<p>
Two things are to be done:<lb/>
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;<lb/>
I'll set her on;<lb/>
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,<lb/>
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find<lb/>
Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way<lb/>
Dull not device by coldness and delay.<lb/>

<p>Well, sir, we will not.<lb/>

<p>I'll send her to you presently;<lb/>
And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry<lb/>
For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.<lb/>
The general and his wife are talking of it;<lb/>
And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,<lb/>
That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,<lb/>
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom<lb/>
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you<lb/>
And needs no other suitor but his likings<lb/>
To take the safest occasion by the front<lb/>
To bring you in again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Yet, I beseech you,<lb/>
If you think fit, or that it may be done,<lb/>
Give me advantage of some brief discourse<lb/>
With Desdemona alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Pray you, come in;<lb/>
I will bestow you where you shall have time<lb/>
To speak your bosom freely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I am much bound to you.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do<lb/>
All my abilities in thy behalf.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,<lb/>
As if the case were his.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,<lb/>
But I will have my lord and you again<lb/>
As friendly as you were.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Bounteous madam,<lb/>
Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,<lb/>
He's never any thing but your true servant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:<lb/>
You have known him long; and be you well assured<lb/>
He shall in strangeness stand no further off<lb/>
Than in a polite distance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Ay, but, lady,<lb/>
That policy may either last so long,<lb/>
Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,<lb/>
Or breed itself so out of circumstance,<lb/>
That, I being absent and my place supplied,<lb/>
My general will forget my love and service.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Do not doubt that; before Emilia here<lb/>
I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,<lb/>
If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it<lb/>
To the last article: my lord shall never rest;<lb/>
I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;<lb/>
His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;<lb/>
I'll intermingle every thing he does<lb/>
With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;<lb/>
For thy solicitor shall rather die<lb/>
Than give thy cause away.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Ha! I like not that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What dost thou say?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Nothing, my lord: or if&mdash;I know not what.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,<lb/>
That he would steal away so guilty-like,<lb/>
Seeing you coming.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I do believe 'twas he.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>How now, my lord!<lb/>
I have been talking with a suitor here,<lb/>
A man that languishes in your displeasure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Who is't you mean?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,<lb/>
If I have any grace or power to move you,<lb/>
His present reconciliation take;<lb/>
For if he be not one that truly loves you,<lb/>
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,<lb/>
I have no judgment in an honest face:<lb/>
I prithee, call him back.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Went he hence now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Ay, sooth; so humbled<lb/>
That he hath left part of his grief with me,<lb/>
To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>But shall't be shortly?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>The sooner, sweet, for you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Shall't be to-night at supper?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>No, not to-night.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>To-morrow dinner, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I shall not dine at home;<lb/>
I meet the captains at the citadel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;<lb/>
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:<lb/>
I prithee, name the time, but let it not<lb/>
Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;<lb/>
And yet his trespass, in our common reason&mdash;<lb/>
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples<lb/>
Out of their best&mdash;is not almost a fault<lb/>
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?<lb/>
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,<lb/>
What you would ask me, that I should deny,<lb/>
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,<lb/>
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,<lb/>
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,<lb/>
Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do<lb/>
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;<lb/>
I will deny thee nothing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Why, this is not a boon;<lb/>
'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,<lb/>
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,<lb/>
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit<lb/>
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit<lb/>
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,<lb/>
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight<lb/>
And fearful to be granted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I will deny thee nothing:<lb/>
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,<lb/>
To leave me but a little to myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;<lb/>
Whate'er you be, I am obedient.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,<lb/>
But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,<lb/>
Chaos is come again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>My noble lord&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What dost thou say, Iago?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,<lb/>
Know of your love?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>But for a satisfaction of my thought;<lb/>
No further harm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Why of thy thought, Iago?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I did not think he had been acquainted with her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O, yes; and went between us very oft.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Indeed!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?<lb/>
Is he not honest?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Honest, my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Honest! ay, honest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>My lord, for aught I know.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What dost thou think?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Think, my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Think, my lord!<lb/>
By heaven, he echoes me,<lb/>
As if there were some monster in his thought<lb/>
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:<lb/>
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,<lb/>
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?<lb/>
And when I told thee he was of my counsel<lb/>
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'<lb/>
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,<lb/>
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain<lb/>
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,<lb/>
Show me thy thought.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>My lord, you know I love you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I think thou dost;<lb/>
And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,<lb/>
And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,<lb/>
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:<lb/>
For such things in a false disloyal knave<lb/>
Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just<lb/>
They are close delations, working from the heart<lb/>
That passion cannot rule.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>For Michael Cassio,<lb/>
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I think so too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Men should be what they seem;<lb/>
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Certain, men should be what they seem.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Nay, yet there's more in this:<lb/>
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,<lb/>
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts<lb/>
The worst of words.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Good my lord, pardon me:<lb/>
Though I am bound to every act of duty,<lb/>
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.<lb/>
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;<lb/>
As where's that palace whereinto foul things<lb/>
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,<lb/>
But some uncleanly apprehensions<lb/>
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit<lb/>
With meditations lawful?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,<lb/>
If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear<lb/>
A stranger to thy thoughts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I do beseech you&mdash;<lb/>
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,<lb/>
As, I confess, it is my nature's plague<lb/>
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy<lb/>
Shapes faults that are not&mdash;that your wisdom yet,<lb/>
From one that so imperfectly conceits,<lb/>
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble<lb/>
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.<lb/>
It were not for your quiet nor your good,<lb/>
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,<lb/>
To let you know my thoughts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What dost thou mean?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,<lb/>
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:<lb/>
Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;<lb/>
'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:<lb/>
But he that filches from me my good name<lb/>
Robs me of that which not enriches him<lb/>
And makes me poor indeed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;<lb/>
Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ha!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;<lb/>
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock<lb/>
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss<lb/>
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;<lb/>
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er<lb/>
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O misery!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Poor and content is rich and rich enough,<lb/>
But riches fineless is as poor as winter<lb/>
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.<lb/>
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend<lb/>
From jealousy!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Why, why is this?<lb/>
Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,<lb/>
To follow still the changes of the moon<lb/>
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt<lb/>
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,<lb/>
When I shall turn the business of my soul<lb/>
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,<lb/>
Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous<lb/>
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,<lb/>
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;<lb/>
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:<lb/>
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<lb/>
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;<lb/>
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;<lb/>
I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<lb/>
And on the proof, there is no more but this,&mdash;<lb/>
Away at once with love or jealousy!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason<lb/>
To show the love and duty that I bear you<lb/>
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,<lb/>
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.<lb/>
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;<lb/>
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:<lb/>
I would not have your free and noble nature,<lb/>
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:<lb/>
I know our country disposition well;<lb/>
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks<lb/>
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience<lb/>
Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Dost thou say so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>She did deceive her father, marrying you;<lb/>
And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,<lb/>
She loved them most.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>And so she did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, go to then;<lb/>
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,<lb/>
To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-<lb/>
He thought 'twas witchcraft&mdash;but I am much to blame;<lb/>
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon<lb/>
For too much loving you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I am bound to thee for ever.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Not a jot, not a jot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I' faith, I fear it has.<lb/>
I hope you will consider what is spoke<lb/>
Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:<lb/>
I am to pray you not to strain my speech<lb/>
To grosser issues nor to larger reach<lb/>
Than to suspicion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I will not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Should you do so, my lord,<lb/>
My speech should fall into such vile success<lb/>
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend&mdash;<lb/>
My lord, I see you're moved.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>No, not much moved:<lb/>
I do not think but Desdemona's honest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Long live she so! and long live you to think so!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>And yet, how nature erring from itself,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Ay, there's the point: as&mdash;to be bold with you&mdash;<lb/>
Not to affect many proposed matches<lb/>
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,<lb/>
Whereto we see in all things nature tends&mdash;<lb/>
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,<lb/>
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.<lb/>
But pardon me; I do not in position<lb/>
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear<lb/>
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,<lb/>
May fall to match you with her country forms<lb/>
And happily repent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Farewell, farewell:<lb/>
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;<lb/>
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Going]</stage></p><p>  My lord, I take my leave.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless<lb/>
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Returning]</stage></p><p>  My lord, I would I might entreat<lb/>
your honour<lb/>
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:<lb/>
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,<lb/>
For sure, he fills it up with great ability,<lb/>
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,<lb/>
You shall by that perceive him and his means:<lb/>
Note, if your lady strain his entertainment<lb/>
With any strong or vehement importunity;<lb/>
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,<lb/>
Let me be thought too busy in my fears&mdash;<lb/>
As worthy cause I have to fear I am&mdash;<lb/>
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Fear not my government.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I once more take my leave.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>This fellow's of exceeding honesty,<lb/>
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,<lb/>
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,<lb/>
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,<lb/>
I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,<lb/>
To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black<lb/>
And have not those soft parts of conversation<lb/>
That chamberers have, or for I am declined<lb/>
Into the vale of years,&mdash;yet that's not much&mdash;<lb/>
She's gone. I am abused; and my relief<lb/>
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,<lb/>
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,<lb/>
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,<lb/>
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,<lb/>
Than keep a corner in the thing I love<lb/>
For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;<lb/>
Prerogatived are they less than the base;<lb/>
'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:<lb/>
Even then this forked plague is fated to us<lb/>
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:<lb/>

<p>How now, my dear Othello!<lb/>
Your dinner, and the generous islanders<lb/>
By you invited, do attend your presence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I am to blame.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Why do you speak so faintly?<lb/>
Are you not well?<lb/>

<p>I have a pain upon my forehead here.<lb/>

<p>'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>I am glad I have found this napkin:<lb/>
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:<lb/>
My wayward husband hath a hundred times<lb/>
Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,<lb/>
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,<lb/>
That she reserves it evermore about her<lb/>
To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,<lb/>
And give't Iago: what he will do with it<lb/>
Heaven knows, not I;<lb/>
I nothing but to please his fantasy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>A thing for me? it is a common thing&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Ha!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What handkerchief?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>What handkerchief?<lb/>
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;<lb/>
That which so often you did bid me steal.<lb/>

Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad<lb/>
When she shall lack it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.<lb/>
Go, leave me.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit EMILIA</stage></p>


<p>
I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,<lb/>
And let him find it. Trifles light as air<lb/>
Are to the jealous confirmations strong<lb/>
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.<lb/>
The Moor already changes with my poison:<lb/>
Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.<lb/>
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,<lb/>
But with a little act upon the blood.<lb/>
Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:<lb/>
Look, where he comes!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter OTHELLO</stage></p>


<p>
Not poppy, nor mandragora,<lb/>
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,<lb/>
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<lb/>
Which thou owedst yesterday.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ha! ha! false to me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, general! no more of that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:<lb/>
I swear 'tis better to be much abused<lb/>
Than but to know't a little.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>How now, my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?<lb/>
I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:<lb/>
I slept the next night well, was free and merry;<lb/>
I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:<lb/>
He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,<lb/>
Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I am sorry to hear this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I had been happy, if the general camp,<lb/>
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,<lb/>
So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever<lb/>
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!<lb/>
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,<lb/>
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!<lb/>
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,<lb/>
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,<lb/>
The royal banner, and all quality,<lb/>
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!<lb/>
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats<lb/>
The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,<lb/>
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Is't possible, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,<lb/>
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:<lb/>
Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,<lb/>
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog<lb/>
Than answer my waked wrath!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Is't come to this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,<lb/>
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop<lb/>
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>My noble lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>If thou dost slander her and torture me,<lb/>
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;<lb/>
On horror's head horrors accumulate;<lb/>
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;<lb/>
For nothing canst thou to damnation add<lb/>
Greater than that.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O grace! O heaven forgive me!<lb/>
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?<lb/>
God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.<lb/>
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!<lb/>
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,<lb/>
To be direct and honest is not safe.<lb/>
I thank you for this profit; and from hence<lb/>
I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I should be wise, for honesty's a fool<lb/>
And loses that it works for.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>By the world,<lb/>
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;<lb/>
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.<lb/>
I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh<lb/>
As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black<lb/>
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,<lb/>
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,<lb/>
I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:<lb/>
I do repent me that I put it to you.<lb/>
You would be satisfied?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Would! nay, I will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?<lb/>
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on&mdash;<lb/>
Behold her topp'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Death and damnation! O!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>It were a tedious difficulty, I think,<lb/>
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,<lb/>
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster<lb/>
More than their own! What then? how then?<lb/>
What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?<lb/>
It is impossible you should see this,<lb/>
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,<lb/>
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross<lb/>
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,<lb/>
If imputation and strong circumstances,<lb/>
Which lead directly to the door of truth,<lb/>
Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Give me a living reason she's disloyal.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I do not like the office:<lb/>
But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,<lb/>
Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,<lb/>
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;<lb/>
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,<lb/>
I could not sleep.<lb/>
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,<lb/>
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:<lb/>
One of this kind is Cassio:<lb/>
In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,<lb/>
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'<lb/>
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,<lb/>
Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,<lb/>
As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots<lb/>
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg<lb/>
Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then<lb/>
Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O monstrous! monstrous!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Nay, this was but his dream.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>But this denoted a foregone conclusion:<lb/>
'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>And this may help to thicken other proofs<lb/>
That do demonstrate thinly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I'll tear her all to pieces.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;<lb/>
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,<lb/>
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief<lb/>
Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I know not that; but such a handkerchief&mdash;<lb/>
I am sure it was your wife's&mdash;did I to-day<lb/>
See Cassio wipe his beard with.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>If it be that&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>If it be that, or any that was hers,<lb/>
It speaks against her with the other proofs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!<lb/>
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.<lb/>
Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;<lb/>
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.<lb/>
'Tis gone.<lb/>
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!<lb/>
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne<lb/>
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,<lb/>
For 'tis of aspics' tongues!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Yet be content.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O, blood, blood, blood!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,<lb/>
Whose icy current and compulsive course<lb/>
Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on<lb/>
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,<lb/>
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,<lb/>
Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,<lb/>
Till that a capable and wide revenge<lb/>
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kneels</stage></p>


<p>
In the due reverence of a sacred vow<lb/>
I here engage my words.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Do not rise yet.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Kneels</stage></p>


<p>
Witness, you ever-burning lights above,<lb/>
You elements that clip us round about,<lb/>
Witness that here Iago doth give up<lb/>
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,<lb/>
To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,<lb/>
And to obey shall be in me remorse,<lb/>
What bloody business ever.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They rise</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I greet thy love,<lb/>
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,<lb/>
And will upon the instant put thee to't:<lb/>
Within these three days let me hear thee say<lb/>
That Cassio's not alive.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:<lb/>
But let her live.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!<lb/>
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,<lb/>
To furnish me with some swift means of death<lb/>
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I am your own for ever.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>Before the castle.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I dare not say he lies any where.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Why, man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,<lb/>
is stabbing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Go to: where lodges he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Can any thing be made of this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a<lb/>
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were<lb/>
to lie in mine own throat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I will catechise the world for him; that is, make<lb/>
questions, and by them answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have<lb/>
moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and<lb/>
therefore I will attempt the doing it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>I know not, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse<lb/>
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor<lb/>
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness<lb/>
As jealous creatures are, it were enough<lb/>
To put him to ill thinking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Is he not jealous?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Who, he? I think the sun where he was born<lb/>
Drew all such humours from him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Look, where he comes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I will not leave him now till Cassio<lb/>
Be call'd to him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter OTHELLO</stage></p>


<p>
How is't with you, my lord<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Well, my good lady.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
O, hardness to dissemble!&mdash;<lb/>
How do you, Desdemona?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Well, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:<lb/>
Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires<lb/>
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,<lb/>
Much castigation, exercise devout;<lb/>
For here's a young and sweating devil here,<lb/>
That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,<lb/>
A frank one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>You may, indeed, say so;<lb/>
For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;<lb/>
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What promise, chuck?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;<lb/>
Lend me thy handkerchief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Here, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>That which I gave you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I have it not about me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>No, indeed, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>That is a fault.<lb/>
That handkerchief<lb/>
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;<lb/>
She was a charmer, and could almost read<lb/>
The thoughts of people: she told her, while<lb/>
she kept it,<lb/>
'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father<lb/>
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it<lb/>
Or made gift of it, my father's eye<lb/>
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt<lb/>
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;<lb/>
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,<lb/>
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;<lb/>
Make it a darling like your precious eye;<lb/>
To lose't or give't away were such perdition<lb/>
As nothing else could match.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Is't possible?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:<lb/>
A sibyl, that had number'd in the world<lb/>
The sun to course two hundred compasses,<lb/>
In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;<lb/>
The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;<lb/>
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful<lb/>
Conserved of maidens' hearts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Indeed! is't true?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Most veritable; therefore look to't well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Then would to God that I had never seen't!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ha! wherefore?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Why do you speak so startingly and rash?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out<lb/>
o' the way?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Heaven bless us!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Say you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>It is not lost; but what an if it were?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>How!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I say, it is not lost.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Fetch't, let me see't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.<lb/>
This is a trick to put me from my suit:<lb/>
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Come, come;<lb/>
You'll never meet a more sufficient man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>The handkerchief!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I pray, talk me of Cassio.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>The handkerchief!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>A man that all his time<lb/>
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,<lb/>
Shared dangers with you,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>The handkerchief!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>In sooth, you are to blame.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Away!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Is not this man jealous?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I ne'er saw this before.<lb/>
Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:<lb/>
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:<lb/>
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;<lb/>
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,<lb/>
They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CASSIO and IAGO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:<lb/>
And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you<lb/>
That by your virtuous means I may again<lb/>
Exist, and be a member of his love<lb/>
Whom I with all the office of my heart<lb/>
Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.<lb/>
If my offence be of such mortal kind<lb/>
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,<lb/>
Nor purposed merit in futurity,<lb/>
Can ransom me into his love again,<lb/>
But to know so must be my benefit;<lb/>
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,<lb/>
And shut myself up in some other course,<lb/>
To fortune's alms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!<lb/>
My advocation is not now in tune;<lb/>
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,<lb/>
Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.<lb/>
So help me every spirit sanctified,<lb/>
As I have spoken for you all my best<lb/>
And stood within the blank of his displeasure<lb/>
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:<lb/>
What I can do I will; and more I will<lb/>
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Is my lord angry?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>He went hence but now,<lb/>
And certainly in strange unquietness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,<lb/>
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,<lb/>
And, like the devil, from his very arm<lb/>
Puff'd his own brother:&mdash;and can he be angry?<lb/>
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:<lb/>
There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I prithee, do so.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit IAGO</stage></p>


<p>
Something, sure, of state,<lb/>
Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise<lb/>
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,<lb/>
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases<lb/>
Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,<lb/>
Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;<lb/>
For let our finger ache, and it indues<lb/>
Our other healthful members even to that sense<lb/>
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,<lb/>
Nor of them look for such observances<lb/>
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,<lb/>
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,<lb/>
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;<lb/>
But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,<lb/>
And he's indicted falsely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,<lb/>
And no conception nor no jealous toy<lb/>
Concerning you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Alas the day! I never gave him cause.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;<lb/>
They are not ever jealous for the cause,<lb/>
But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster<lb/>
Begot upon itself, born on itself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Lady, amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:<lb/>
If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit<lb/>
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I humbly thank your ladyship.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter BIANCA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>Save you, friend Cassio!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>What make you from home?<lb/>
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?<lb/>
I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.<lb/>
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?<lb/>
Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,<lb/>
More tedious than the dial eight score times?<lb/>
O weary reckoning!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, Bianca:<lb/>
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:<lb/>
But I shall, in a more continuate time,<lb/>
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief</stage></p>


<p>
Take me this work out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>O Cassio, whence came this?<lb/>
This is some token from a newer friend:<lb/>
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:<lb/>
Is't come to this? Well, well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Go to, woman!<lb/>
Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,<lb/>
From whence you have them. You are jealous now<lb/>
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:<lb/>
No, in good troth, Bianca.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>Why, whose is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.<lb/>
I like the work well: ere it be demanded&mdash;<lb/>
As like enough it will&mdash;I'ld have it copied:<lb/>
Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>Leave you! wherefore?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I do attend here on the general;<lb/>
And think it no addition, nor my wish,<lb/>
To have him see me woman'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>Why, I pray you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Not that I love you not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>But that you do not love me.<lb/>
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,<lb/>
And say if I shall see you soon at night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;<lb/>
For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.<lb/>

<head>Scene 1</head><p><stage>Cyprus. Before the castle.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter OTHELLO and IAGO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Will you think so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Think so, Iago!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What,<lb/>
To kiss in private?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>An unauthorized kiss.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Or to be naked with her friend in bed<lb/>
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!<lb/>
It is hypocrisy against the devil:<lb/>
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,<lb/>
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:<lb/>
But if I give my wife a handkerchief,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,<lb/>
She may, I think, bestow't on any man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>She is protectress of her honour too:<lb/>
May she give that?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Her honour is an essence that's not seen;<lb/>
They have it very oft that have it not:<lb/>
But, for the handkerchief,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.<lb/>
Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,<lb/>
As doth the raven o'er the infected house,<lb/>
Boding to all&mdash;he had my handkerchief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Ay, what of that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>That's not so good now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What,<lb/>
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?<lb/>
Or heard him say,&mdash;as knaves be such abroad,<lb/>
Who having, by their own importunate suit,<lb/>
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,<lb/>
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose<lb/>
But they must blab&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Hath he said any thing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,<lb/>
No more than he'll unswear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What hath he said?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>'Faith, that he did&mdash;I know not what he did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What? what?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Lie&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>With her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>With her, on her; what you will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when<lb/>
they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.<lb/>
&mdash;Handkerchief&mdash;confessions&mdash;handkerchief!&mdash;To<lb/>
confess, and be hanged for his labour;&mdash;first, to be<lb/>
hanged, and then to confess.&mdash;I tremble at it.<lb/>
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing<lb/>
passion without some instruction. It is not words<lb/>
that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.<lb/>
&mdash;Is't possible?&mdash;Confess&mdash;handkerchief!&mdash;O devil!&mdash;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Falls in a trance</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Work on,<lb/>
My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;<lb/>
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,<lb/>
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!<lb/>
My lord, I say! Othello!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CASSIO</stage></p>


<p>
How now, Cassio!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:<lb/>
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Rub him about the temples.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>No, forbear;<lb/>
The lethargy must have his quiet course:<lb/>
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by<lb/>
Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:<lb/>
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,<lb/>
He will recover straight: when he is gone,<lb/>
I would on great occasion speak with you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit CASSIO</stage></p>


<p>
How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Dost thou mock me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I mock you! no, by heaven.<lb/>
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>A horned man's a monster and a beast.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>There's many a beast then in a populous city,<lb/>
And many a civil monster.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Did he confess it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Good sir, be a man;<lb/>
Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked<lb/>
May draw with you: there's millions now alive<lb/>
That nightly lie in those unproper beds<lb/>
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.<lb/>
O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,<lb/>
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,<lb/>
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;<lb/>
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Stand you awhile apart;<lb/>
Confine yourself but in a patient list.<lb/>
Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief&mdash;<lb/>
A passion most unsuiting such a man&mdash;<lb/>
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,<lb/>
And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,<lb/>
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;<lb/>
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,<lb/>
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,<lb/>
That dwell in every region of his face;<lb/>
For I will make him tell the tale anew,<lb/>
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when<lb/>
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:<lb/>
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;<lb/>
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,<lb/>
And nothing of a man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Dost thou hear, Iago?<lb/>
I will be found most cunning in my patience;<lb/>
But&mdash;dost thou hear?&mdash;most bloody.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>That's not amiss;<lb/>
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>OTHELLO retires</stage></p>


<p>
Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<lb/>
A housewife that by selling her desires<lb/>
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature<lb/>
That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague<lb/>
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:<lb/>
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain<lb/>
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter CASSIO</stage></p>


<p>
As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;<lb/>
And his unbookish jealousy must construe<lb/>
Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,<lb/>
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>The worser that you give me the addition<lb/>
Whose want even kills me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Speaking lower</stage></p>


<p>
Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,<lb/>
How quickly should you speed!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor caitiff!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Look, how he laughs already!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I never knew woman love man so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Do you hear, Cassio?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Now he importunes him<lb/>
To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>She gives it out that you shall marry hey:<lb/>
Do you intend it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some<lb/>
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.<lb/>
Ha, ha, ha!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Prithee, say true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I am a very villain else.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Have you scored me? Well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>This is the monkey's own giving out: she is<lb/>
persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and<lb/>
flattery, not out of my promise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.<lb/>
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with<lb/>
certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,<lb/>
and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture<lb/>
imports it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,<lb/>
and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,<lb/>
I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall<lb/>
throw it to.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Well, I must leave her company.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Before me! look, where she comes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter BIANCA</stage></p>


<p>
What do you mean by this haunting of me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you<lb/>
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?<lb/>
I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the<lb/>
work?&mdash;A likely piece of work, that you should find<lb/>
it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!<lb/>
This is some minx's token, and I must take out the<lb/>
work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever<lb/>
you had it, I'll take out no work on't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you<lb/>
will not, come when you are next prepared for.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>After her, after her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Will you sup there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>'Faith, I intend so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain<lb/>
speak with you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Prithee, come; will you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Go to; say no more.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit CASSIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Advancing]</stage></p><p>  How shall I murder him, Iago?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O Iago!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>And did you see the handkerchief?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Was that mine?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the<lb/>
foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he<lb/>
hath given it his whore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I would have him nine years a-killing.<lb/>
A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Nay, you must forget that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;<lb/>
for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to<lb/>
stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the<lb/>
world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by<lb/>
an emperor's side and command him tasks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's not your way.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate<lb/>
with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she<lb/>
will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high<lb/>
and plenteous wit and invention:&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>She's the worse for all this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so<lb/>
gentle a condition!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Ay, too gentle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!<lb/>
O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her<lb/>
patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes<lb/>
near nobody.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O, 'tis foul in her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>With mine officer!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>That's fouler.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not<lb/>
expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty<lb/>
unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even<lb/>
the bed she hath contaminated.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you<lb/>
shall hear more by midnight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Excellent good.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>A trumpet within</stage></p>


<p>
What trumpet is that same?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>The duke and senators of Venice greet you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Gives him a letter</stage>

<p>And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I am very glad to see you, signior<lb/>
Welcome to Cyprus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Lives, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord<lb/>
An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Are you sure of that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'This fail you not to do, as you will&mdash;'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>He did not call; he's busy in the paper.<lb/>
Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>A most unhappy one: I would do much<lb/>
To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Fire and brimstone!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Are you wise?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>What, is he angry?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>May be the letter moved him;<lb/>
For, as I think, they do command him home,<lb/>
Deputing Cassio in his government.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Trust me, I am glad on't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Indeed!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I am glad to see you mad.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Why, sweet Othello,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Striking her]</stage></p><p>  Devil!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I have not deserved this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,<lb/>
Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:<lb/>
Make her amends; she weeps.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O devil, devil!<lb/>
If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,<lb/>
Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.<lb/>
Out of my sight!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I will not stay to offend you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Going</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Truly, an obedient lady:<lb/>
I do beseech your lordship, call her back.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Mistress!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What would you with her, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Who, I, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:<lb/>
Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,<lb/>
And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;<lb/>
And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,<lb/>
Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.<lb/>
Concerning this, sir,&mdash;O  well-painted passion!&mdash;<lb/>
I am commanded home. Get you away;<lb/>
I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,<lb/>
And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit DESDEMONA</stage></p>


<p>
Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,<lb/>
I do entreat that we may sup together:<lb/>
You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.&mdash;Goats and monkeys!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate<lb/>
Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature<lb/>
Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue<lb/>
The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,<lb/>
Could neither graze nor pierce?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>He is much changed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure<lb/>
What he might be: if what he might he is not,<lb/>
I would to heaven he were!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>What, strike his wife!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew<lb/>
That stroke would prove the worst!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Is it his use?<lb/>
Or did the letters work upon his blood,<lb/>
And new-create this fault?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Alas, alas!<lb/>
It is not honesty in me to speak<lb/>
What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,<lb/>
And his own courses will denote him so<lb/>
That I may save my speech: do but go after,<lb/>
And mark how he continues.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>But then I saw no harm, and then I heard<lb/>
Each syllable that breath made up between them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What, did they never whisper?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Never, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Nor send you out o' the way?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Never.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Never, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>That's strange.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,<lb/>
Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,<lb/>
Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.<lb/>
If any wretch have put this in your head,<lb/>
Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!<lb/>
For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,<lb/>
There's no man happy; the purest of their wives<lb/>
Is foul as slander.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Bid her come hither: go.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit EMILIA</stage></p>


<p>
She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd<lb/>
That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,<lb/>
A closet lock and key of villanous secrets<lb/>
And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>My lord, what is your will?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Pray, chuck, come hither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>What is your pleasure?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Let me see your eyes;<lb/>
Look in my face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>What horrible fancy's this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p><stage>[To EMILIA]</stage></p><p>  Some of your function, mistress;<lb/>
Leave procreants alone and shut the door;<lb/>
Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:<lb/>
Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit EMILIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?<lb/>
I understand a fury in your words.<lb/>
But not the words.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Why, what art thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Your wife, my lord; your true<lb/>
And loyal wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Come, swear it, damn thyself<lb/>
Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves<lb/>
Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:<lb/>
Swear thou art honest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Heaven doth truly know it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O Desdemona! away! away! away!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?<lb/>
Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?<lb/>
If haply you my father do suspect<lb/>
An instrument of this your calling back,<lb/>
Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,<lb/>
Why, I have lost him too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Had it pleased heaven<lb/>
To try me with affliction; had they rain'd<lb/>
All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.<lb/>
Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,<lb/>
Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,<lb/>
I should have found in some place of my soul<lb/>
A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me<lb/>
A fixed figure for the time of scorn<lb/>
To point his slow unmoving finger at!<lb/>
Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:<lb/>
But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,<lb/>
Where either I must live, or bear no life;<lb/>
The fountain from the which my current runs,<lb/>
Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!<lb/>
Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads<lb/>
To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,<lb/>
Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,&mdash;<lb/>
Ay, there, look grim as hell!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,<lb/>
That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,<lb/>
Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet<lb/>
That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst<lb/>
ne'er been born!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,<lb/>
Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!<lb/>
Committed! O thou public commoner!<lb/>
I should make very forges of my cheeks,<lb/>
That would to cinders burn up modesty,<lb/>
Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!<lb/>
Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,<lb/>
The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets<lb/>
Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,<lb/>
And will not hear it. What committed!<lb/>
Impudent strumpet!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>By heaven, you do me wrong.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Are you not a strumpet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>No, as I am a Christian:<lb/>
If to preserve this vessel for my lord<lb/>
From any other foul unlawful touch<lb/>
Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What, not a whore?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>No, as I shall be saved.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Is't possible?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>O, heaven forgive us!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I cry you mercy, then:<lb/>
I took you for that cunning whore of Venice<lb/>
That married with Othello.<lb/>

<p>Why, with my lord, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Who is thy lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>He that is yours, sweet lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;<lb/>
I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,<lb/>
But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight<lb/>
Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;<lb/>
And call thy husband hither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What is your pleasure, madam?<lb/>
How is't with you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes<lb/>
Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:<lb/>
He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,<lb/>
I am a child to chiding.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What's the matter, lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.<lb/>
Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,<lb/>
As true hearts cannot bear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Am I that name, Iago?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What name, fair lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Such as she says my lord did say I was.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink<lb/>
Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why did he so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I do not know; I am sure I am none such.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Hath she forsook so many noble matches,<lb/>
Her father and her country and her friends,<lb/>
To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>It is my wretched fortune.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Beshrew him for't!<lb/>
How comes this trick upon him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Nay, heaven doth know.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,<lb/>
Some busy and insinuating rogue,<lb/>
Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,<lb/>
Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>If any such there be, heaven pardon him!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!<lb/>
Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?<lb/>
What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?<lb/>
The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,<lb/>
Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.<lb/>
O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,<lb/>
And put in every honest hand a whip<lb/>
To lash the rascals naked through the world<lb/>
Even from the east to the west!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Speak within door.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was<lb/>
That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,<lb/>
And made you to suspect me with the Moor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>You are a fool; go to.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>O good Iago,<lb/>
What shall I do to win my lord again?<lb/>
Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,<lb/>
I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:<lb/>
If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,<lb/>
Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,<lb/>
Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,<lb/>
Delighted them in any other form;<lb/>
Or that I do not yet, and ever did.<lb/>
And ever will&mdash;though he do shake me off<lb/>
To beggarly divorcement&mdash;love him dearly,<lb/>
Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;<lb/>
And his unkindness may defeat my life,<lb/>
But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'<lb/>
It does abhor me now I speak the word;<lb/>
To do the act that might the addition earn<lb/>
Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:<lb/>
The business of the state does him offence,<lb/>
And he does chide with you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>If 'twere no other&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>'Tis but so, I warrant.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter RODERIGO</stage></p>


<p>
How now, Roderigo!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What in the contrary?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;<lb/>
and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me<lb/>
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least<lb/>
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure<lb/>
it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what<lb/>
already I have foolishly suffered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Will you hear me, Roderigo?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and<lb/>
performances are no kin together.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>You charge me most unjustly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of<lb/>
my means. The jewels you have had from me to<lb/>
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a<lb/>
votarist: you have told me she hath received them<lb/>
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden<lb/>
respect and acquaintance, but I find none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Well; go to; very well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis<lb/>
not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin<lb/>
to find myself fobbed in it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Very well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself<lb/>
known to Desdemona: if she will return me my<lb/>
jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my<lb/>
unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I<lb/>
will seek satisfaction of you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>You have said now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from<lb/>
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than<lb/>
ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast<lb/>
taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I<lb/>
protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>It hath not appeared.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your<lb/>
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,<lb/>
Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I<lb/>
have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean<lb/>
purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if<lb/>
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,<lb/>
take me from this world with treachery and devise<lb/>
engines for my life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice<lb/>
to depute Cassio in Othello's place.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona<lb/>
return again to Venice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with<lb/>
him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be<lb/>
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be<lb/>
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>How do you mean, removing of him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;<lb/>
knocking out his brains.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>And that you would have me to do?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.<lb/>
He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I<lb/>
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable<lb/>
fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which<lb/>
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,<lb/>
you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near<lb/>
to second your attempt, and he shall fall between<lb/>
us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with<lb/>
me; I will show you such a necessity in his death<lb/>
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on<lb/>
him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows<lb/>
to waste: about it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I will hear further reason for this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>And you shall be satisfied.<lb/>

done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a<lb/>
joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for<lb/>
gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty<lb/>
exhibition; but for the whole world,&mdash;why, who would<lb/>
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a<lb/>
monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>

having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your<lb/>
own world, and you might quickly make it right.<lb/>

But I do think it is their husbands' faults<lb/>
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,<lb/>
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,<lb/>
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<lb/>
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,<lb/>
Or scant our former having in despite;<lb/>
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,<lb/>
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<lb/>
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell<lb/>
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<lb/>
As husbands have. What is it that they do<lb/>
When they change us for others? Is it sport?<lb/>
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?<lb/>
I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?<lb/>
It is so too: and have not we affections,<lb/>
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<lb/>
Then let them use us well: else let them know,<lb/>
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,<lb/>
Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:<lb/>
Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:<lb/>
Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:<lb/>
It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,<lb/>
And fix most firm thy resolution.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RODERIGO</speaker>
<p>I have no great devotion to the deed;<lb/>
And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:<lb/>
'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,<lb/>
And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,<lb/>
Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,<lb/>
Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,<lb/>
He calls me to a restitution large<lb/>
Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,<lb/>
As gifts to Desdemona;<lb/>
It must not be: if Cassio do remain,<lb/>
He hath a daily beauty in his life<lb/>
That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor<lb/>
May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:<lb/>
No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.<lb/>

Give me some help.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I think that one of them is hereabout,<lb/>
And cannot make away.<lb/>

<p>O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,<lb/>
Cassio, Cassio!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect<lb/>
Who they should be that have thus many led you?<lb/>

<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash<lb/>
To be a party in this injury.<lb/>
Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;<lb/>
Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?<lb/>
Alas my friend and my dear countryman<lb/>
Roderigo! no:&mdash;yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.<lb/>

<p>Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;<lb/>
These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,<lb/>
That so neglected you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>I am glad to see you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!<lb/>

<p>Roderigo!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>He, he 'tis he.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>A chair brought in</stage></p>

O, that's well said; the chair!<lb/>

I'll fetch the general's surgeon.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To BIANCA</stage></p>


<p>
For you, mistress,<lb/>
Save you your labour. He that lies slain<lb/>
here, Cassio,<lb/>
Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>None in the world; nor do I know the man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p><stage>[To BIANCA]</stage></p><p>  What, look you pale? O, bear him out<lb/>
o' the air.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off</stage></p>


<p>
Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?<lb/>
Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?<lb/>
Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.<lb/>
Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:<lb/>
Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,<lb/>
Though tongues were out of use.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Cassio hath here been set on in the dark<lb/>
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:<lb/>
He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,<lb/>
Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To BIANCA</stage></p>


<p>
What, do you shake at that?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIANCA</speaker>
<p>I am no strumpet; but of life as honest<lb/>
As you that thus abuse me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>As I! foh! fie upon thee!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.<lb/>
Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.<lb/>
Emilia run you to the citadel,<lb/>
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.<lb/>
Will you go on? I pray.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter OTHELLO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,&mdash;<lb/>
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!&mdash;<lb/>
It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;<lb/>
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,<lb/>
And smooth as monumental alabaster.<lb/>
Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.<lb/>
Put out the light, and then put out the light:<lb/>
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,<lb/>
I can again thy former light restore,<lb/>
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,<lb/>
Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,<lb/>
I know not where is that Promethean heat<lb/>
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,<lb/>
I cannot give it vital growth again.<lb/>
It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kissing her</stage></p>


<p>
Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade<lb/>
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.<lb/>
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,<lb/>
And love thee after. One more, and this the last:<lb/>
So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,<lb/>
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;<lb/>
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Who's there? Othello?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ay. Desdemona.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Will you come to bed, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Ay, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>If you bethink yourself of any crime<lb/>
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,<lb/>
Solicit for it straight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:<lb/>
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;<lb/>
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Talk you of killing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ay, I do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Then heaven<lb/>
Have mercy on me!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Amen, with all my heart!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Hum!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then<lb/>
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,<lb/>
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Think on thy sins.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>They are loves I bear to you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ay, and for that thou diest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>That death's unnatural that kills for loving.<lb/>
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?<lb/>
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:<lb/>
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,<lb/>
They do not point on me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Peace, and be still!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>I will so. What's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee<lb/>
Thou gavest to Cassio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>No, by my life and soul!<lb/>
Send for the man, and ask him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Sweet soul, take heed,<lb/>
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Ay, but not yet to die.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Yes, presently:<lb/>
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;<lb/>
For to deny each article with oath<lb/>
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception<lb/>
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>Then Lord have mercy on me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I say, amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>And have you mercy too! I never did<lb/>
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio<lb/>
But with such general warranty of heaven<lb/>
As I might love: I never gave him token.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.<lb/>
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,<lb/>
And makest me call what I intend to do<lb/>
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:<lb/>
I saw the handkerchief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>He found it then;<lb/>
I never gave it him: send for him hither;<lb/>
Let him confess a truth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DESDEMONA</speaker>
<p>But half an hour!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Being done, there is no pause.<lb/>

<p>She said so: I must needs report the truth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:<lb/>
'Twas I that kill'd her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>O, the more angel she,<lb/>
And you the blacker devil!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>She was false as water.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Thou art rash as fire, to say<lb/>
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.<lb/>
O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,<lb/>
But that I did proceed upon just grounds<lb/>
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>My husband!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Thy husband.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>That she was false to wedlock?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,<lb/>
If heaven would make me such another world<lb/>
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,<lb/>
I'ld not have sold her for it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>My husband!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ay, 'twas he that told me first:<lb/>
An honest man he is, and hates the slime<lb/>
That sticks on filthy deeds.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>My husband!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,<lb/>
My husband say that she was false!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>He, woman;<lb/>
I say thy husband: dost understand the word?<lb/>
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>If he say so, may his pernicious soul<lb/>
Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:<lb/>
She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ha!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Do thy worst:<lb/>
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven<lb/>
Than thou wast worthy her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Peace, you were best.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Thou hast not half that power to do me harm<lb/>
As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!<lb/>
As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed&mdash;<lb/>
I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,<lb/>
Though I lost twenty lives.&mdash;Help! help, ho! help!<lb/>
The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>What is the matter? How now, general!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,<lb/>
That men must lay their murders on your neck.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>What is the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:<lb/>
He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:<lb/>
I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:<lb/>
Speak, for my heart is full.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I told him what I thought, and told no more<lb/>
Than what he found himself was apt and true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>But did you ever tell him she was false?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;<lb/>
Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.<lb/>
She false with Cassio!&mdash;did you say with Cassio?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:<lb/>
My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>O heavens forfend!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>And your reports have set the murder on.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>'Tis a strange truth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>O monstrous act!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Villany, villany, villany!<lb/>
I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!&mdash;<lb/>
I thought so then:&mdash;I'll kill myself for grief:&mdash;<lb/>
O villany, villany!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:<lb/>
'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.<lb/>
Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O! O! O!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>He falls on the bed</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Nay, lay thee down and roar;<lb/>
For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent<lb/>
That e'er did lift up eye.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Rising]</stage></p><p>  O, she was foul!<lb/>
I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,<lb/>
Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:<lb/>
I know this act shows horrible and grim.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:<lb/>
Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief<lb/>
Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,<lb/>
This sight would make him do a desperate turn,<lb/>
Yea, curse his better angel from his side,<lb/>
And fall to reprobation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows<lb/>
That she with Cassio hath the act of shame<lb/>
A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:<lb/>
And she did gratify his amorous works<lb/>
With that recognizance and pledge of love<lb/>
Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:<lb/>
It was a handkerchief, an antique token<lb/>
My father gave my mother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>O heaven! O heavenly powers!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Come, hold your peace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!<lb/>
No, I will speak as liberal as the north:<lb/>
Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,<lb/>
All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Be wise, and get you home.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>I will not.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>IAGO offers to stab EMILIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Fie!<lb/>
Your sword upon a woman?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of<lb/>
I found by fortune and did give my husband;<lb/>
For often, with a solemn earnestness,<lb/>
More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,<lb/>
He begg'd of me to steal it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Villanous whore!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,<lb/>
And I did give't my husband.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Filth, thou liest!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.<lb/>
O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool<lb/>
Do with so good a woman?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Are there no stones in heaven<lb/>
But what serve for the thunder?&mdash;Precious villain!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He runs at IAGO  IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTANO</speaker>
<p>'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,<lb/>
Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:<lb/>
Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,<lb/>
But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,<lb/>
For 'tis a damned slave.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I am not valiant neither,<lb/>
But ever puny whipster gets my sword:<lb/>
But why should honour outlive honesty?<lb/>
Let it go all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>What did thy song bode, lady?<lb/>
Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.<lb/>
And die in music.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Singing</stage></p>


<p>
Willow, willow, willow,&mdash;<lb/>
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;<lb/>
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;<lb/>
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I have another weapon in this chamber;<lb/>
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:&mdash;<lb/>
O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:<lb/>
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Look in upon me then and speak with me,<lb/>
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter GRATIANO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>What is the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Behold, I have a weapon;<lb/>
A better never did itself sustain<lb/>
Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,<lb/>
That, with this little arm and this good sword,<lb/>
I have made my way through more impediments<lb/>
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!<lb/>
Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.<lb/>
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;<lb/>
Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,<lb/>
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.<lb/>
Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;<lb/>
Man but a rush against Othello's breast,<lb/>
And he retires. Where should Othello go?<lb/>
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!<lb/>
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,<lb/>
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,<lb/>
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!<lb/>
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!<lb/>
Whip me, ye devils,<lb/>
From the possession of this heavenly sight!<lb/>
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!<lb/>
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!<lb/>
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!<lb/>
Oh! Oh! Oh!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair,	and Officers with IAGO, prisoner</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>That's he that was Othello: here I am.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.<lb/>
If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Wounds IAGO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Wrench his sword from him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;<lb/>
For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,<lb/>
Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,<lb/>
What shall be said to thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Why, any thing:<lb/>
An honourable murderer, if you will;<lb/>
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:<lb/>
Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Ay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Dear general, I never gave you cause.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.<lb/>
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil<lb/>
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IAGO</speaker>
<p>Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:<lb/>
From this time forth I never will speak word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>What, not to pray?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Torments will ope your lips.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Well, thou dost best.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,<lb/>
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter<lb/>
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;<lb/>
And here another: the one of them imports<lb/>
The death of Cassio to be undertook<lb/>
By Roderigo.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O villain!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>Most heathenish and most gross!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>Now here's another discontented paper,<lb/>
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,<lb/>
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;<lb/>
But that belike Iago in the interim<lb/>
Came in and satisfied him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O the pernicious caitiff!<lb/>
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief<lb/>
That was my wife's?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>I found it in my chamber:<lb/>
And he himself confess'd but even now<lb/>
That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose<lb/>
Which wrought to his desire.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>O fool! fool! fool!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>There is besides in Roderigo's letter,<lb/>
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him<lb/>
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came<lb/>
That I was cast: and even but now he spake,<lb/>
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,<lb/>
Iago set him on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>You must forsake this room, and go with us:<lb/>
Your power and your command is taken off,<lb/>
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,<lb/>
If there be any cunning cruelty<lb/>
That can torment him much and hold him long,<lb/>
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,<lb/>
Till that the nature of your fault be known<lb/>
To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>Soft you; a word or two before you go.<lb/>
I have done the state some service, and they know't.<lb/>
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,<lb/>
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<lb/>
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,<lb/>
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak<lb/>
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;<lb/>
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought<lb/>
Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,<lb/>
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away<lb/>
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,<lb/>
Albeit unused to the melting mood,<lb/>
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees<lb/>
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;<lb/>
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<lb/>
Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk<lb/>
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,<lb/>
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,<lb/>
And smote him, thus.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Stabs himself</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p>O bloody period!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>All that's spoke is marr'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OTHELLO</speaker>
<p>I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;<lb/>
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Falls on the bed, and dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIO</speaker>
<p>This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;<lb/>
For he was great of heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LODOVICO</speaker>
<p><stage>[To IAGO]</stage></p><p>  O Spartan dog,<lb/>
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!<lb/>
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;<lb/>
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;<lb/>
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,<lb/>
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,<lb/>
For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,<lb/>
Remains the censure of this hellish villain;<lb/>
The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!<lb/>
Myself will straight aboard: and to the state<lb/>
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>
