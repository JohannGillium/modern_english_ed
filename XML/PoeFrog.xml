<p>I never knew any one so keenly alive to a joke as the king 
was.  He seemed to live only for joking.  To tell a good story of 
the joke kind, and to tell it well, was the surest road to his 
favour.  Thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted 
for their accomplishments as jokers.  They all took after the 
king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as 
inimitable jokers.  Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether 
there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I 
have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a 
lean joker is a <foreign lang="lat">rara avis in terris</foreign>. 
<pb n="235"/>  
</p><p>About the refinements, or, as he called them, the 'ghosts' 
of wit, the king troubled himself very little.  He had an 
especial admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up 
with length, for the sake of it.  Over-niceties wearied him.  He 
would have preferred Rabelais's Gargantua to the Zadig of 
Voltaire; and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste 
far better than verbal ones. 
</p><p>At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not 
altogether gone out of fashion at court.  Several of the great 
continental 'powers' still retained their 'fools', who wore 
motley, with caps and bells, and who were expected to be always 
ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment's notice, in 
consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table. 
</p><p>Our king, as a matter of course, retained his 'fool'.  The 
fact is, he required something in the way of folly &mdash; if only to 
counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were 
his ministers &mdash; not to mention himself. 
</p><p>His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, 
however.  His value was trebled in the eyes of the king by the 
fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple.  Dwarfs were as 
common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs would 
have found it difficult to get through their days (days are 
rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to 
laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at.  But, as I have already 
observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, 
are fat, round, and unwieldy &mdash; so that it was no small source of 
self-gratulation with our king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the 
fool's name) he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person. 
</p><p>I believe the name 'Hop-Frog' was not given to the dwarf by 
his sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by 
general consent of the seven ministers, on account of his 
inability to walk as other men do.  In fact, Hop-Frog could only 
get along by a sort of interjectional gait &mdash; something between a 
leap and a wriggle &mdash; a movement that afforded illimitable 
amusement, and of course consolation, to the king, for 
(notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a 
constitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his 
whole court, was accounted a capital figure. 
</p><p>But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, 
could move only with great pain and difficulty 
along a road or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature 
seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way of compensation for 
deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform many feats 
<pb n="236"/>  
of 
wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question, or anything 
else to climb.  At such exercises he certainly much more 
resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog. 
</p><p>I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog originally came.  It was from some barbarous region, 
however, that no person ever heard of &mdash; a vast distance from the 
court of our king.  Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less 
dwarfish than himself (although of exquisite proportions, and a 
marvellous dancer), had been forcibly carried off from their 
respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to 
the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals. 
</p><p>Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that 
a close intimacy arose between the two little captives.  Indeed, 
they soon became sworn friends.  Hop-Frog, who, although he made 
a great deal of sport, was by no means popular, had it not in his 
power to render Trippetta many services; but she, on account of 
her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf), was 
universally admired and petted: so she possessed much influence; 
and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit 
of Hop-Frog. 
</p><p>On some grand state occasion &mdash; I forget what &mdash; the king 
determined to have a masquerade; and whenever a masquerade, or 
anything of that kind, occurred at our court, then the talents 
both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta were sure to be called in play. 
Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up 
pageants, suggesting novel characters and arranging costume for 
masked balls, that nothing could be done, it seems, without his 
assistance. 
</p><p>The night appointed for the fete had arrived.  A gorgeous 
hall had been fitted up, under Trippetta's eye, with every kind 
of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade.  The 
whole court was in a fever of expectation.  As for costumes and 
characters, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to 
a decision on such points.  Many had made up their minds as to 
what roles they should assume, a week, or even a month, in 
advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision 
anywhere &mdash; except in the case of the king and his seven ministers. 
Why they hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way 
of a joke.  More probably, they found it difficult, on account of 
being so fat, to make up their minds.  At all events, time flew; 
and, as a last resource, they sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog. 
</p><p>When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king, 
<pb n="237"/>  
they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his 
cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill 
humour.  He knew that Hop-Frog was not fond of wine; for it 
excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and madness is no 
comfortable thing.  But the king loved his practical jokes, and 
took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king 
called it) 'to be merry'. 
</p><p>'Come here, Hop-Frog,' said he, as the jester and his friend 
entered the room: 'swallow this bumper to the health of your 
absent friends' (here Hop-Frog sighed), 'and then let us have the 
benefit of your invention.  We want characters &mdash; characters, man &mdash; 
something novel &mdash; out of the way.  We are wearied 
with this everlasting sameness.  Come, drink! the wine will brighten 
your wits.' 
</p><p>Hop-Frog endeavoured, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to 
these advances from the king; but the effort was too much.  It 
happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday, and the command to 
drink to his 'absent friends' forced the tears to his eyes.  Many 
large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly, 
from the hand of the tyrant. 
</p><p>'Ah! ha! ha! ha!' roared the latter, as the dwarf 
reluctantly drained the beaker.  'See what a glass of good wine 
can do!  Why, your eyes are shining already!' 
</p><p>Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed rather than shone, for 
the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful 
than instantaneous.  He placed the goblet nervously on the table, 
and looked round upon the company with a half-insane stare.  They 
all seemed highly amused at the success of the king's 'joke'. 
</p><p>'And now to business,' said the prime minister, a very fat 
man. 
</p><p>'Yes,' said the king; 'come, Hop-Frog, lend us your 
assistance.  Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of 
characters &mdash; all of us &mdash; ha! ha! ha!' and as this was seriously 
meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven. 
</p><p>Hop-Frog also laughed, although feebly and somewhat 
vacantly. 
</p><p>'Come, come,' said the king, impatiently, 'have you nothing 
to suggest?' 
</p><p>'I am endeavouring to think of something novel,' replied the 
dwarf, abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine. 
</p><p>'Endeavouring!' cried the tyrant, fiercely; 'what do you 
mean by that?  Ah, I perceive.  You are sulky, and want more 
<pb n="238"/>  
wine.  Here, drink this!' and he poured out another gobletful and 
offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for 
breath. 
</p><p>'Drink, I say!' shouted the monster, 'or by the fiends &mdash; ' 
</p><p>The dwarf hesitated.  The king grew purple with rage.  The 
courtiers smirked.  Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the 
monarch's seat, and, falling to her knees before him, implored 
him to spare her friend. 
</p><p>The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder 
at her audacity.  He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say &mdash; 
how most becomingly to express his indignation.  At last, without 
uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw 
the contents of the brimming goblet in her face. 
</p><p>The poor girl got up as best she could, and, not daring even 
to sigh, resumed her position at the foot of the table. 
</p><p>There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during 
which the falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been 
heard.  It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted 
grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of 
the room. 
</p><p>'What &mdash; what &mdash; what are you making that noise for?' demanded 
the king, turning furiously to the dwarf. 
</p><p>The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from 
his intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the 
tyrant's face, merely ejaculated: 
</p><p>'I &mdash; I?  How could it have been me?' 
</p><p>'The sound appeared to come from without,' 
observed one of the courtiers.  'I fancy it was the parrot at the 
window, whetting his bill upon his cage-wires.' 
</p><p>'True,' replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the 
suggestion; 'but, on the honour of a knight, I could have sworn 
that it was the gritting of this vagabond's teeth.' 
</p><p>Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a 
joker to object to any one's laughing), and displayed a set of 
large, powerful, and very repulsive teeth.  Moreover, he avowed 
his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired.  The 
monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no 
very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and with 
spirit, into the plans for the masquerade. 
</p><p>'I cannot tell what was the association of idea,' observed 
he, very tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his 
life, 'but just after your majesty had struck the girl and thrown 
the wine in her face &mdash; just after your majesty had done this, and 
<pb n="239"/>  
while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window, 
there came into my mind a capital diversion &mdash; one of my own 
country frolics &mdash; often enacted among us, at our masquerades: but 
here it will be new altogether.  Unfortunately, however, it 
requires a company of eight persons, and &mdash; ' 
</p><p>'Here we are!' cried the king, laughing at his acute 
discovery of the coincidence; 'eight to a fraction &mdash; I and my 
seven ministers.  Come! what is the diversion?' 
</p><p>'We call it,' replied the cripple, 'the Eight Chained 
Ourang-Outangs, and it really is excellent sport if well 
enacted.' 
</p><p>'We will enact it,' remarked the king, drawing himself up, 
and lowering his eyelids. 
</p><p>'The beauty of the game,' continued Hop-Frog, 'lies in the 
fright it occasions among the women.' 
</p><p>'Capital!' roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry. 
</p><p>'I will equip you as ourang-outangs,' proceeded the dwarf; 
'leave all that to me.  The resemblance shall be so striking that 
the company of masqueraders will take you for real beasts &mdash; and, 
of course, they will be as much terrified as astonished.' 
</p><p>'Oh, this is exquisite!' exclaimed the king.  'Hop-Frog!  I 
will make a man of you.' 
</p><p>'The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion 
by their jangling.  You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, 
from your keepers.  Your majesty cannot conceive the effect 
produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs, 
imagined to be real ones by most of the company, and rushing in 
with savage cries among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously 
habited men and women.  The contrast is inimitable.' 
</p><p>'It must be,' said the king: and the council arose hurriedly 
(as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog. 
</p><p>His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very 
simple, but effective enough for his purposes.  The animals in 
question had, at the epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in 
any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by 
the dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently 
hideous, their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be 
secured. 
</p><p>The king and his ministers were first encased in 
tight-fitting stockinette shirts and drawers.  They were then saturated 
with tar.  At this stage of the process, some one of the party 
suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once overruled by 
the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, 
<pb n="240"/>  
that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more 
efficiently represented by flax.  A thick coating of the latter 
was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar.  A long chain 
was now procured.  First, it was passed about the waist of the 
king, and tied; then about another of the party, and also tied, 
then about all successively, and in the same manner.  When this 
chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far 
apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to 
make all things appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of 
the chain, in two diameters, at right angles, across the circle, 
after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who 
capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo. 
</p><p>The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, 
was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the 
sun only through a single window at top.  At night (the season 
for which the apartment was especially designed), it was 
illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a 
chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, 
by means of a counterbalance as usual; but (in order not to look 
unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola and over the 
roof. 
</p><p>The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta's 
superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been 
guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf.  At his 
suggestion it was that, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed. 
Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was 
quite impossible to prevent) would have been seriously 
detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account of 
the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to 
keep from out its centre &mdash; that is to say, from under the 
chandelier.  Additional sconces were set in various parts of the 
hall, out of the way; and a flambeau, emitting sweet odour, was 
placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood 
against the wall &mdash; some fifty or sixty altogether. 
</p><p>The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog's advice, waited 
patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled 
with masqueraders) before making their appearance.  No sooner had 
the clock ceased striking, however, than they rushed, or rather 
rolled in, all together &mdash; for the impediment of their chains 
caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as they 
entered. 
</p><p>The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, 
<pb n="241"/>  
and 
filled the heart of the king with glee.  As had been anticipated, 
there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality, if not 
precisely ourang-outangs.  Many of the women swooned with 
affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude 
all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated 
their frolic in their blood.  As it was, a general rush was made 
for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked 
immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, 
the keys had been deposited with him. 
</p><p>While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader 
attentive only to his own safety (for, in 
fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited 
crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which 
had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very gradually 
to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor. 
</p><p>Soon after this, the king and his seven friends, having 
reeled about the hall in all directions, found themselves, at 
length, in its centre, and, of course, in immediate contact with 
the chain.  While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who had 
followed closely at their heels, inciting them to keep up the 
commotion, took hold of their own chain at the intersection of 
the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at 
right angles.  Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted 
the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, 
in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was 
drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an 
inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in 
close connection, and face to face. 
</p><p>The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some 
measure, from their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole 
matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of 
laughter at the predicament of the apes. 
</p><p>'Leave them to me!' now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice 
making itself easily heard through all the din.  'Leave them to 
me.  I fancy I know them.  If I can only get a good look at them, 
I can soon tell who they are.' 
</p><p>Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to 
get to the wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the 
Caryatides, he returned, as he went, 
to the centre of the room &mdash; leaped, with the agility of a monkey, upon 
the king's head &mdash; and thence clambered a few feet up the chain &mdash; 
holding down 
<pb n="242"/>  
the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and still 
screaming, 'I shall soon find out who they are!' 
</p><p>And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were 
convulsed with laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill 
whistle; when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feet &mdash; 
dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and 
leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the 
floor.  Hop-Frog, clinging to the chain as it rose, still 
maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers, 
and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to thrust his 
torch down towards them, as though endeavouring to discover who 
they were. 
</p><p>So thoroughly astonished were the whole company at this 
ascent, that a dead silence, of about a minute's duration, 
ensued.  It was broken by just such a low, harsh, grating sound, 
as had before attracted the attention of the king and his 
councillors, when the former threw the wine in the face of 
Trippetta.  But, on the present occasion, there could be no 
question as to whence the sound issued.  It came from the fang-like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he 
foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal 
rage, into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven 
companions. 
</p><p>'Ah, ha!' said at length the infuriated jester.  'Ah, ha!  I 
begin to see who these people are, now!'  Here, pretending to 
scrutinize the king more closely, he held the flambeau to the 
flaxen coat which enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a 
sheet of vivid flame.  In less than half a minute the whole 
eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of the 
multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and 
without the power to render them the slightest assistance. 
</p><p>At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, 
forced the jester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of 
their reach; and as he made this movement, the crowd again sank, 
for a brief instant, into silence.  The dwarf seized his 
opportunity, and once more spoke: 
</p><p>'I now see distinctly,' he said, 'what manner of people 
these maskers are.  They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors &mdash; a king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless 
girl, and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage.  As 
for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the jester &mdash; and this is my last 
jest.' 
<pb n="243"/>  
</p><p>Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the 
tar to which it adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of 
his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete.  The 
eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, 
and indistinguishable mass.  The cripple hurled his torch at 
them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared through 
the sky-light. 
</p><p>It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the 
saloon, had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery
