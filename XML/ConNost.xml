<head>AUTHOR'S NOTE</head>
<pb n="vii"/>
<p>     "NOSTROMO" is the most anxiously meditated of the<lb/>
longer novels which belong to the period following upon<lb/>
the publication of the "Typhoon" volume of short<lb/>
stories.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     I don't mean to say that I became then conscious of<lb/>
any impending change in my mentality and in my attitude <lb/>
towards the tasks of my writing life. And perhaps<lb/>
there was never any change, except in that mysterious,<lb/>
extraneous thing which has nothing to do with the<lb/>
theories of art; a subtle change in the nature of the<lb/>
inspiration; a phenomenon for which I can not in any<lb/>
way be held responsible. What, however, did cause me<lb/>
some concern was that after finishing the last story of<lb/>
the "Typhoon" volume it seemed somehow that there<lb/>
was nothing more in the world to write about.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This so strangely negative but disturbing mood<lb/>
lasted some little time; and then, as with many of my<lb/>
longer stories, the first hint for "Nostromo" came to<lb/>
me in the shape of a vagrant anecdote completely destitute <lb/>
of valuable details.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     As a matter of fact in 1875 or '6, when very young, in<lb/>
the West Indies or rather in the Gulf of Mexico, for my<lb/>
contacts with land were short, few, and fleeting, I heard<lb/>
the story of some man who was supposed to have stolen<lb/>
single-handed a whole lighter-full of silver, somewhere<lb/>


<pb n="viii"/>

on the Tierra Firme seaboard during the troubles of a<lb/>
revolution.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On the face of it this was something of a feat. But I<lb/>
heard no details, and having no particular interest in<lb/>
crime <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> crime I was not likely to keep that one in my<lb/>
 mind. And I forgot it till twenty-six or seven years<lb/>
afterwards I came upon the very thing in a shabby<lb/>
volume picked up outside a second-hand book-shop. It<lb/>
was the life story of an American seaman written by<lb/>
himself with the assistance of a journalist. In the<lb/>
course of his wanderings that American sailor worked<lb/>
for some months on board a schooner, the master and<lb/>
owner of which was the thief of whom I had heard in<lb/>
my very young days. I have no doubt of that because<lb/>
there could hardly have been two exploits of that peculiar <lb/>
kind in the same part of the world and both connected <lb/>
with a South American revolution.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The fellow had actually managed to steal a lighter<lb/>
with silver, and this, it seems, only because he was implicitly <lb/>
trusted by his employers, who must have been<lb/>
singularly poor judges of character. In the sailor's<lb/>
story he is represented as an unmitigated rascal, a small<lb/>
cheat, stupidly ferocious, morose, of mean appearance,<lb/>
and altogether unworthy of the greatness this opportunity <lb/>
had thrust upon him. What was interesting<lb/>
was that he would boast of it openly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He used to say: "People think I make a lot of<lb/>
money in this schooner of mine. But that is nothing.<lb/>
I don't care for that. Now and then I go away quietly<lb/>
and lift a bar of silver. I must get rich slowly &mdash; you<lb/>
understand."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There was also another curious point about the man.<lb/>
Once in the course of some quarrel the sailor threatened<lb/>
him: "What's to prevent me reporting ashore what<lb/>
you have told me about that silver?"<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="ix"/>


<p>     The cynical ruffian was not alarmed in the least. He<lb/>
actually laughed. "You fool, if you dare talk like that<lb/>
on shore about me you will get a knife stuck in your<lb/>
back. Every man, woman, and child in that port is<lb/>
my friend. And who's to prove the lighter wasn't<lb/>
sunk? I didn't show you where the silver is hidden.<lb/>
Did I? So you know nothing. And suppose I lied? Eh?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Ultimately the sailor, disgusted with the sordid meanness <lb/>
of that impenitent thief, deserted from the schooner.<lb/>
The whole episode takes about three pages of his<lb/>
autobiography. Nothing to speak of; but as I looked<lb/>
them over, the curious confirmation of the few casual<lb/>
words heard in my early youth evoked the memories<lb/>
of that distant time when everything was so fresh, so<lb/>
surprising, so venturesome, so interesting; bits of strange<lb/>
coasts under the stars, shadows of hills in the sunshine,<lb/>
men's passions in the dusk, gossip half-forgotten, faces<lb/>
grown dim. . . . Perhaps, perhaps, there still was<lb/>
in the world something to write about. Yet I did not<lb/>
see anything at first in the mere story. A rascal steals<lb/>
a large parcel of a valuable commodity &mdash; so people say.<lb/>
It's either true or untrue; and in any case it has no<lb/>
value in itself. To invent a circumstantial account of<lb/>
the robbery did not appeal to me, because my talents<lb/>
not running that way I did not think that the game was<lb/>
worth the candle. It was only when it dawned upon<lb/>
me that the purloiner of the treasure need not necessarily <lb/>
be a confirmed rogue, that he could be even a man<lb/>
of character, an actor and possibly a victim in the<lb/>
changing scenes of a revolution, it was only then that<lb/>
I had the first vision of a twilight country which was<lb/>
to become the province of Sulaco, with its high shadowy<lb/>
Sierra and its misty Campo for mute witnesses of events<lb/>
flowing from the passions of men short-sighted in good<lb/>
and evil.<lb/>


</p>

<pb n="x"/>

<p>     Such are in very truth the obscure origins of "Nostromo" <lb/>
&mdash; the book. From that moment, I suppose,<lb/>
it had to be. Yet even then I hesitated, as if warned<lb/>
by the instinct of self-preservation from venturing on a<lb/>
distant and toilsome journey into a land full of intrigues<lb/>
and revolutions. But it had to be done.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It took the best part of the years 1903-4 to do; with<lb/>
many intervals of renewed hesitation, lest I should lose<lb/>
myself in the ever-enlarging vistas opening before me<lb/>
as I progressed deeper in my knowledge of the country.<lb/>
Often, also, when I had thought myself to a standstill<lb/>
over the tangled-up affairs of the Republic, I would,<lb/>
figuratively speaking, pack my bag, rush away from<lb/>
Sulaco for a change of air and write a few pages of the<lb/>
"Mirror of the Sea." But generally, as I've said before, <lb/>
my sojourn on the Continent of Latin America,<lb/>
famed for its hospitality, lasted for about two years.<lb/>
On my return I found (speaking somewhat in the style<lb/>
of Captain Gulliver) my family all well, my wife heartily<lb/>
glad to learn that the fuss was all over, and our small<lb/>
boy considerably grown during my absence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     My principal authority for the history of Costaguana<lb/>
is, of course, my venerated friend, the late Don Jose<lb/>
Avellanos, Minister to the Courts of England and Spain,<lb/>
etc., etc., in his impartial and eloquent "History of Fifty<lb/>
Years of Misrule." That work was never published &mdash;<lb/>
the reader will discover why &mdash; and I am in fact the only<lb/>
person in the world possessed of its contents. I have<lb/>
mastered them in not a few hours of earnest meditation,<lb/>
and I hope that my accuracy will be trusted. In justice<lb/>
to myself, and to allay the fears of prospective readers,<lb/>
I beg to point out that the few historical allusions are<lb/>
never dragged in for the sake of parading my unique<lb/>
erudition, but that each of them is closely related to<lb/>
actuality; either throwing a light on the nature of current<lb/>

<pb n="xi"/>

events or affecting directly the fortunes of the<lb/>
people of whom I speak.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     As to their own histories I have tried to set them<lb/>
down, Aristocracy and People, men and women, Latin<lb/>
and Anglo-Saxon, bandit and politician, with as cool a<lb/>
hand as was possible in the heat and clash of my own<lb/>
conflicting emotions. And after all this is also the<lb/>
story of their conflicts. It is for the reader to say how<lb/>
far they are deserving of interest in their actions and<lb/>
in the secret purposes of their hearts revealed in the<lb/>
bitter necessities of the time. I confess that, for me,<lb/>
that time is the time of firm friendships and unforgotten<lb/>
hospitalities. And in my gratitude I must mention<lb/>
here Mrs. Gould, "the first lady of Sulaco," whom we<lb/>
may safely leave to the secret devotion of Dr. Monygham,<lb/>
and Charles Gould, the Idealist-creator of Material<lb/>
Interests whom we must leave to his Mine &mdash;<lb/>
from which there is no escape in this world.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     About Nostromo, the second of the two racially and<lb/>
socially contrasted men, both captured by the silver of<lb/>
the San Tom&eacute; Mine, I feel bound to say something<lb/>
more.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     I did not hesitate to make that central figure an Italian.<lb/>
First of all the thing is perfectly credible: Italians<lb/>
were swarming into the Occidental Province at the<lb/>
time, as anybody who will read further can see; and<lb/>
secondly, there was no one who could stand so well by<lb/>
the side of Giorgio Viola the Garibaldino, the Idealist<lb/>
of the old, humanitarian revolutions. For myself I<lb/>
needed there a Man of the People as free as possible<lb/>
from his class-conventions and all settled modes of<lb/>
thinking. This is not a side snarl at conventions. My<lb/>
reasons were not moral but artistic. Had he been an<lb/>
Anglo-Saxon he would have tried to get into local politics.<lb/>
But Nostromo does not aspire to be a leader in a<lb/>

<pb n="xii"/>

personal game. He does not want to raise himself<lb/>
above the mass. He is content to feel himself a power<lb/>
&mdash; within the People.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But mainly Nostromo is what he is because I received<lb/>
the inspiration for him in my early days from a<lb/>
Mediterranean sailor. Those who have read certain<lb/>
pages of mine will see at once what I mean when I say<lb/>
that Dominic, the padrone of the <hi rend="italic">Tremolino</hi>, might under<lb/>
given circumstances have been a Nostromo. At any<lb/>
rate Dominic would have understood the younger man<lb/>
perfectly &mdash; if scornfully. He and I were engaged together<lb/>
in a rather absurd adventure, but the absurdity<lb/>
does not matter. It is a real satisfaction to think that<lb/>
in my very young days there must, after all, have been<lb/>
something in me worthy to command that man's half-<lb/>
bitter fidelity, his half-ironic devotion. Many of Nostromo's<lb/>
speeches I have heard first in Dominic's voice.<lb/>
His hand on the tiller and his fearless eyes roaming the<lb/>
horizon from within the monkish hood shadowing his<lb/>
face, he would utter the usual exordium of his remorseless<lb/>
wisdom: "Vous autres gentilhommes!" in a caustic<lb/>
tone that hangs on my ear yet. Like Nostromo!<lb/>
"You hombres finos!" Very much like Nostromo.<lb/>
But Dominic the Corsican nursed a certain pride of<lb/>
ancestry from which my Nostromo is free; for Nostromo's<lb/>
lineage had to be more ancient still. He is a<lb/>
man with the weight of countless generations behind<lb/>
him and no parentage to boast of. . . . Like the<lb/>
People.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In his firm grip on the earth he inherits, in his improvidence<lb/>
and generosity, in his lavishness with his<lb/>
gifts, in his manly vanity, in the obscure sense of his<lb/>
greatness and in his faithful devotion with something<lb/>
despairing as well as desperate in its impulses, he is a<lb/>
Man of the People, their very own unenvious force,<lb/>

<pb n="xiii"/>

disdaining to lead but ruling from within. Years afterwards,<lb/>
grown older as the famous Captain Fidanza,<lb/>
with a stake in the country, going about his many affairs<lb/>
followed by respectful glances in the modernized streets<lb/>
of Sulaco, calling on the widow of the cargador, attending<lb/>
the Lodge, listening in unmoved silence to anarchist<lb/>
speeches at the meeting, the enigmatical patron of the<lb/>
new revolutionary agitation, the trusted, the wealthy<lb/>
comrade Fidanza with the knowledge of his moral ruin<lb/>
locked up in his breast, he remains essentially a Man<lb/>
of the People. In his mingled love and scorn of life and<lb/>
in the bewildered conviction of having been betrayed,<lb/>
of dying betrayed he hardly knows by what or by whom,<lb/>
he is still of the People, their undoubted Great Man &mdash;<lb/>
with a private history of his own.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     One more figure of those stirring times I would like to<lb/>
mention: and that is Antonia Avellanos &mdash; the "beautiful<lb/>
Antonia." Whether she is a possible variation of Latin-<lb/>
American girlhood I wouldn't dare to affirm. But, for<lb/>
me, she <hi rend="italic">is</hi>. Always a little in the background by the<lb/>
side of her father (my venerated friend) I hope she has<lb/>
yet relief enough to make intelligible what I am going<lb/>
to say. Of all the people who had seen with me the<lb/>
birth of the Occidental Republic, she is the only one<lb/>
who has kept in my memory the aspect of continued<lb/>
life. Antonia the Aristocrat and Nostromo the Man of<lb/>
the People are the artisans of the New Era, the true<lb/>
creators of the New State; he by his legendary and daring<lb/>
feat, she, like a woman, simply by the force of what<lb/>
she is: the only being capable of inspiring a sincere<lb/>
passion in the heart of a trifler.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     If anything could induce me to revisit Sulaco (I<lb/>
should hate to see all these changes) it would be Antonia.<lb/>
And the true reason for that &mdash; why not be frank<lb/>
about it? &mdash; the true reason is that I have modelled her<lb/>

<pb n="xiv"/>

on my first love. How we, a band of tallish schoolboys,<lb/>
the chums of her two brothers, how we used to look<lb/>
up to that girl just out of the schoolroom herself, as the<lb/>
standard-bearer of a faith to which we all were born but<lb/>
which she alone knew how to hold aloft with an unflinching<lb/>
hope! She had perhaps more glow and less<lb/>
serenity in her soul than Antonia, but she was an uncompromising<lb/>
Puritan of patriotism with no taint of the<lb/>
slightest worldliness in her thoughts. I was not the<lb/>
only one in love with her; but it was I who had to hear<lb/>
oftenest her scathing criticism of my levities &mdash; very<lb/>
much like poor Decoud &mdash; or stand the brunt of her austere,<lb/>
unanswerable invective. She did not quite understand<lb/>
&mdash; but never mind. That afternoon when I<lb/>
came in, a shrinking yet defiant sinner, to say the final<lb/>
good-bye I received a hand-squeeze that made my heart<lb/>
leap and saw a tear that took my breath away. She was<lb/>
softened at the last as though she had suddenly perceived<lb/>
(we were such children still!) that I was really<lb/>
going away for good, going very far away &mdash; even as far<lb/>
as Sulaco, lying unknown, hidden from our eyes in the<lb/>
darkness of the Placid Gulf.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     That's why I long sometimes for another glimpse of the<lb/>
"beautiful Antonia" (or can it be the Other?) moving in<lb/>
the dimness of the great cathedral, saying a short prayer<lb/>
at the tomb of the first and last Cardinal-Archbishop of<lb/>
Sulaco, standing absorbed in filial devotion before the<lb/>
monument of Don Jose Avellanos, and, with a lingering,<lb/>
tender, faithful glance at the medallion-memorial to<lb/>
Martin Decoud, going out serenely into the sunshine of<lb/>
the Plaza with her upright carriage and her white head;<lb/>
a relic of the past disregarded by men awaiting impatiently<lb/>
the Dawns of other New Eras, the coming of<lb/>
more Revolutions.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But this is the idlest of dreams; for I did understand<lb/>

<pb n="xv"/>

perfectly well at the time that the moment the breath<lb/>
left the body of the Magnificent Capataz, the Man of<lb/>
the People, freed at last from the toils of love and<lb/>
wealth, there was nothing more for me to do in Sulaco.<lb/>

<pb n="3"/>


<p>     IN THE time of Spanish rule, and for many years afterwards,<lb/>
the town of Sulaco &mdash; the luxuriant beauty of the<lb/>
orange gardens bears witness to its antiquity &mdash; had<lb/>
never been commercially anything more important than<lb/>
a coasting port with a fairly large local trade in ox-hides<lb/>
and indigo. The clumsy deep-sea galleons of the conquerors<lb/>
that, needing a brisk gale to move at all, would<lb/>
lie becalmed, where your modern ship built on clipper<lb/>
lines forges ahead by the mere flapping of her sails, had<lb/>
been barred out of Sulaco by the prevailing calms of its<lb/>
vast gulf. Some harbours of the earth are made difficult<lb/>
of access by the treachery of sunken rocks and the<lb/>
tempests of their shores. Sulaco had found an inviolable<lb/>
sanctuary from the temptations of a trading<lb/>
world in the solemn hush of the deep Golfo Placido as if<lb/>
within an enormous semi-circular and unroofed temple<lb/>
open to the ocean, with its walls of lofty mountains<lb/>
hung with the mourning draperies of cloud.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On one side of this broad curve in the straight seaboard<lb/>
of the Republic of Costaguana, the last spur of<lb/>
the coast range forms an insignificant cape whose name<lb/>
is Punta Mala. From the middle of the gulf the point<lb/>
of the land itself is not visible at all; but the shoulder of<lb/>
a steep hill at the back can be made out faintly like a<lb/>
shadow on the sky.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On the other side, what seems to be an isolated patch<lb/>





<pb n="4"/>

of blue mist floats lightly on the glare of the horizon.<lb/>
This is the peninsula of Azuera, a wild chaos of sharp<lb/>
rocks and stony levels cut about by vertical ravines. It<lb/>
lies far out to sea like a rough head of stone stretched<lb/>
from a green-clad coast at the end of a slender neck of<lb/>
sand covered with thickets of thorny scrub. Utterly<lb/>
waterless, for the rainfall runs off at once on all sides<lb/>
into the sea, it has not soil enough &mdash; it is said &mdash; to grow<lb/>
a single blade of grass, as if it were blighted by a curse.<lb/>
The poor, associating by an obscure instinct of consolation<lb/>
the ideas of evil and wealth, will tell you that<lb/>
it is deadly because of its forbidden treasures. The<lb/>
common folk of the neighbourhood, peons of the<lb/>
estancias, vaqueros of the seaboard plains, tame Indians<lb/>
coming miles to market with a bundle of sugar-cane<lb/>
or a basket of maize worth about threepence, are well<lb/>
aware that heaps of shining gold lie in the gloom of the<lb/>
deep precipices cleaving the stony levels of Azuera.<lb/>
Tradition has it that many adventurers of olden time had<lb/>
perished in the search. The story goes also that within<lb/>
men's memory two wandering sailors &mdash; Americanos,<lb/>
perhaps, but gringos of some sort for certain &mdash; talked<lb/>
over a gambling, good-for-nothing mozo, and the three<lb/>
stole a donkey to carry for them a bundle of dry sticks,<lb/>
a water-skin, and provisions enough to last a few days.<lb/>
Thus accompanied, and with revolvers at their belts,<lb/>
they had started to chop their way with machetes<lb/>
through the thorny scrub on the neck of the peninsula.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On the second evening an upright spiral of smoke (it<lb/>
could only have been from their camp-fire) was seen for<lb/>
the first time within memory of man standing up faintly<lb/>
upon the sky above a razor-backed ridge on the stony<lb/>
head. The crew of a coasting schooner, lying becalmed<lb/>
three miles off the shore, stared at it with amazement<lb/>
till dark. A negro fisherman, living in a lonely hut in a<lb/>




<pb n="5"/>

little bay near by, had seen the start and was on the lookout<lb/>
for some sign. He called to his wife just as the sun<lb/>
was about to set. They had watched the strange portent<lb/>
with envy, incredulity, and awe.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The impious adventurers gave no other sign. The<lb/>
sailors, the Indian, and the stolen burro were never<lb/>
seen again. As to the mozo, a Sulaco man &mdash; his wife<lb/>
paid for some masses, and the poor four-footed beast,<lb/>
being without sin, had been probably permitted to die;<lb/>
but the two gringos, spectral and alive, are believed to<lb/>
be dwelling to this day amongst the rocks, under the<lb/>
fatal spell of their success. Their souls cannot tear<lb/>
themselves away from their bodies mounting guard over<lb/>
the discovered treasure. They are now rich and hungry<lb/>
and thirsty &mdash; a strange theory of tenacious gringo<lb/>
ghosts suffering in their starved and parched flesh of<lb/>
defiant heretics, where a Christian would have renounced<lb/>
and been released.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     These, then, are the legendary inhabitants of Azuera<lb/>
guarding its forbidden wealth; and the shadow on the<lb/>
sky on one side with the round patch of blue haze<lb/>
blurring the bright skirt of the horizon on the other,<lb/>
mark the two outermost points of the bend which bears<lb/>
the name of Golfo Placido, because never a strong<lb/>
wind had been known to blow upon its waters.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On crossing the imaginary line drawn from Punta<lb/>
Mala to Azuera the ships from Europe bound to Sulaco<lb/>
lose at once the strong breezes of the ocean. They become<lb/>
the prey of capricious airs that play with them for<lb/>
thirty hours at a stretch sometimes. Before them the<lb/>
head of the calm gulf is filled on most days of the year<lb/>
by a great body of motionless and opaque clouds. On<lb/>
the rare clear mornings another shadow is cast upon the<lb/>
sweep of the gulf. The dawn breaks high behind the<lb/>
towering and serrated wall of the Cordillera, a clear-cut<lb/>


<pb n="6"/>

vision of dark peaks rearing their steep slopes on a lofty<lb/>
pedestal of forest rising from the very edge of the shore.<lb/>
Amongst them the white head of Higuerota rises<lb/>
majestically upon the blue. Bare clusters of enormous<lb/>
rocks sprinkle with tiny black dots the smooth dome of<lb/>
snow.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Then, as the midday sun withdraws from the gulf<lb/>
the shadow of the mountains, the clouds begin to roll<lb/>
out of the lower valleys. They swathe in sombre<lb/>
tatters the naked crags of precipices above the wooded<lb/>
slopes, hide the peaks, smoke in stormy trails across the<lb/>
snows of Higuerota. The Cordillera is gone from you<lb/>
as if it had dissolved itself into great piles of grey and<lb/>
black vapours that travel out slowly to seaward and<lb/>
vanish into thin air all along the front before the blazing<lb/>
heat of the day. The wasting edge of the cloud-bank<lb/>
always strives for, but seldom wins, the middle of the<lb/>
gulf. The sun &mdash; as the sailors say &mdash; is eating it up.<lb/>
Unless perchance a sombre thunder-head breaks away<lb/>
from the main body to career all over the gulf till it<lb/>
escapes into the offing beyond Azuera, where it bursts<lb/>
suddenly into flame and crashes like a sinster pirate-<lb/>
ship of the air, hove-to above the horizon, engaging the<lb/>
sea.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     At night the body of clouds advancing higher up<lb/>
the sky smothers the whole quiet gulf below with an<lb/>
impenetrable darkness, in which the sound of the falling<lb/>
showers can be heard beginning and ceasing abruptly &mdash;<lb/>
now here, now there. Indeed, these cloudy nights are<lb/>
proverbial with the seamen along the whole west coast<lb/>
of a great continent. Sky, land, and sea disappear<lb/>
together out of the world when the Placido &mdash; as the saying<lb/>
is &mdash; goes to sleep under its black poncho. The few<lb/>
stars left below the seaward frown of the vault shine<lb/>
feebly as into the mouth of a black cavern. In its<lb/>


<pb n="7"/>

vastness your ship floats unseen under your feet, her<lb/>
sails flutter invisible above your head. The eye of God<lb/>
Himself &mdash; they add with grim profanity &mdash; could not<lb/>
find out what work a man's hand is doing in there; and<lb/>
you would be free to call the devil to your aid with<lb/>
impunity if even his malice were not defeated by such a<lb/>
blind darkness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The shores on the gulf are steep-to all round; three uninhabited<lb/>
islets basking in the sunshine just outside the<lb/>
cloud veil, and opposite the entrance to the harbour of<lb/>
Sulaco, bear the name of "The Isabels."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There is the Great Isabel; the Little Isabel, which is<lb/>
round; and Hermosa, which is the smallest.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     That last is no more than a foot high, and about seven<lb/>
paces across, a mere flat top of a grey rock which smokes<lb/>
like a hot cinder after a shower, and where no man<lb/>
would care to venture a naked sole before sunset. On<lb/>
the Little Isabel an old ragged palm, with a thick bulging<lb/>
trunk rough with spines, a very witch amongst palm<lb/>
trees, rustles a dismal bunch of dead leaves above the<lb/>
coarse sand. The Great Isabel has a spring of fresh<lb/>
water issuing from the overgrown side of a ravine.<lb/>
Resembling an emerald green wedge of land a mile long,<lb/>
and laid flat upon the sea, it bears two forest trees standing<lb/>
close together, with a wide spread of shade at the<lb/>
foot of their smooth trunks. A ravine extending the<lb/>
whole length of the island is full of bushes; and presenting<lb/>
a deep tangled cleft on the high side spreads itself<lb/>
out on the other into a shallow depression abutting<lb/>
on a small strip of sandy shore.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     From that low end of the Great Isabel the eye plunges<lb/>
through an opening two miles away, as abrupt as if<lb/>
chopped with an axe out of the regular sweep of the<lb/>
coast, right into the harbour of Sulaco. It is an oblong,<lb/>
lake-like piece of water. On one side the short wooded<lb/>


<pb n="8"/>

spurs and valleys of the Cordillera come down at right<lb/>
angles to the very strand; on the other the open view<lb/>
of the great Sulaco plain passes into the opal mystery<lb/>
of great distances overhung by dry haze. The town of<lb/>
Sulaco itself &mdash; tops of walls, a great cupola, gleams of<lb/>
white miradors in a vast grove of orange trees &mdash; lies<lb/>
between the mountains and the plain, at some little<lb/>
distance from its harbour and out of the direct line of<lb/>
sight from the sea.<lb/>
</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="2" id="d10">
<head>CHAPTER TWO</head>

<pb n="9"/>


<p>     THE only sign of commercial activity within the<lb/>
harbour, visible from the beach of the Great Isabel, is<lb/>
the square blunt end of the wooden jetty which the<lb/>
Oceanic Steam Navigation Company (the O.S.N. of<lb/>
familiar speech) had thrown over the shallow part of the<lb/>
bay soon after they had resolved to make of Sulaco one<lb/>
of their ports of call for the Republic of Costaguana.<lb/>
The State possesses several harbours on its long sea-<lb/>
board, but except Cayta, an important place, all are<lb/>
either small and inconvenient inlets in an iron-bound<lb/>
coast &mdash; like Esmeralda, for instance, sixty miles to the<lb/>
south &mdash; or else mere open roadsteads exposed to the<lb/>
winds and fretted by the surf.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Perhaps the very atmospheric conditions which had<lb/>
kept away the merchant fleets of bygone ages induced<lb/>
the O.S.N. Company to violate the sanctuary of peace<lb/>
sheltering the calm existence of Sulaco. The variable<lb/>
airs sporting lightly with the vast semicircle of waters<lb/>
within the head of Azuera could not baffle the steam<lb/>
power of their excellent fleet. Year after year the<lb/>
black hulls of their ships had gone up and down<lb/>
the coast, in and out, past Azuera, past the Isabels,<lb/>
past Punta Mala &mdash; disregarding everything but the<lb/>
tyranny of time. Their names, the names of all<lb/>
mythology, became the household words of a coast that<lb/>
had never been ruled by the gods of Olympus. The<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Juno</hi> was known only for her comfortable cabins amid-<lb/>
ships, the <hi rend="italic">Saturn</hi> for the geniality of her captain and<lb/>
the painted and gilt luxuriousness of her saloon, whereas<lb/>




<pb n="10"/>

the <hi rend="italic">Ganymede</hi> was fitted out mainly for cattle transport,<lb/>
and to be avoided by coastwise passengers. The<lb/>
humblest Indian in the obscurest village on the coast<lb/>
was familiar with the <hi rend="italic">Cerberus</hi>, a little black puffer without<lb/>
charm or living accommodation to speak of, whose<lb/>
mission was to creep inshore along the wooded beaches<lb/>
close to mighty ugly rocks, stopping obligingly before<lb/>
every cluster of huts to collect produce, down to three-<lb/>
pound parcels of indiarubber bound in a wrapper of dry<lb/>
grass.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And as they seldom failed to account for the smallest<lb/>
package, rarely lost a bullock, and had never drowned<lb/>
a single passenger, the name of the O.S.N. stood<lb/>
very high for trustworthiness. People declared that<lb/>
under the Company's care their lives and property<lb/>
were safer on the water than in their own houses on<lb/>
shore.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The O.S.N.'s superintendent in Sulaco for the whole<lb/>
Costaguana section of the service was very proud of his<lb/>
Company's standing. He resumed it in a saying which<lb/>
was very often on his lips, "We never make mistakes."<lb/>
To the Company's officers it took the form of a severe<lb/>
injunction, "We must make no mistakes. I'll have<lb/>
no mistakes here, no matter what Smith may do at his<lb/>
end."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Smith, on whom he had never set eyes in his life, was<lb/>
the other superintendent of the service, quartered some<lb/>
fifteen hundred miles away from Sulaco. "Don't talk<lb/>
to me of your Smith."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Then, calming down suddenly, he would dismiss the<lb/>
subject with studied negligence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Smith knows no more of this continent than a<lb/>
baby."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Our excellent Se&ntilde;or Mitchell" for the business and<lb/>
official world of Sulaco; "Fussy Joe" for the commanders<lb/>


<pb n="11"/>

of the Company's ships, Captain Joseph Mitchell<lb/>
prided himself on his profound knowledge of men<lb/>
and things in the country &mdash; cosas de Costaguana.<lb/>
Amongst these last he accounted as most unfavourable<lb/>
to the orderly working of his Company the frequent<lb/>
changes of government brought about by revolutions<lb/>
of the military type.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The political atmosphere of the Republic was<lb/>
generally stormy in these days. The fugitive patriots of<lb/>
the defeated party had the knack of turning up again on<lb/>
the coast with half a steamer's load of small arms and<lb/>
ammunition. Such resourcefulness Captain Mitchell<lb/>
considered as perfectly wonderful in view of their utter<lb/>
destitution at the time of flight. He had observed that<lb/>
"they never seemed to have enough change about them<lb/>
to pay for their passage ticket out of the country."<lb/>
And he could speak with knowledge; for on a memorable<lb/>
occasion he had been called upon to save the life<lb/>
of a dictator, together with the lives of a few Sulaco<lb/>
officials &mdash; the political chief, the director of the customs,<lb/>
and the head of police &mdash; belonging to an overturned<lb/>
government. Poor Se&ntilde;or Ribiera (such was the dictator's<lb/>
name) had come pelting eighty miles over<lb/>
mountain tracks after the lost battle of Socorro, in<lb/>
the hope of out-distancing the fatal news &mdash; which, of<lb/>
course, he could not manage to do on a lame mule. The<lb/>
animal, moreover, expired under him at the end of the<lb/>
Alameda, where the military band plays sometimes in<lb/>
the evenings between the revolutions. "Sir," Captain<lb/>
Mitchell would pursue with portentous gravity, "the<lb/>
ill-timed end of that mule attracted attention to the<lb/>
unfortunate rider. His features were recognized by<lb/>
several deserters from the Dictatorial army amongst the<lb/>
rascally mob already engaged in smashing the windows<lb/>
of the Intendencia."<lb/>


<pb n="12"/>

</p>

<p>     Early on the morning of that day the local authorities<lb/>
of Sulaco had fled for refuge to the O.S.N. Company's<lb/>
offices, a strong building near the shore end of the jetty,<lb/>
leaving the town to the mercies of a revolutionary<lb/>
rabble; and as the Dictator was execrated by the<lb/>
populace on account of the severe recruitment law his<lb/>
necessities had compelled him to enforce during the<lb/>
struggle, he stood a good chance of being torn to<lb/>
pieces. Providentially, Nostromo &mdash; invaluable fellow<lb/>
&mdash; with some Italian workmen, imported to work upon<lb/>
the National Central Railway, was at hand, and<lb/>
managed to snatch him away &mdash; for the time at least.<lb/>
Ultimately, Captain Mitchell succeeded in taking everybody<lb/>
off in his own gig to one of the Company's steamers<lb/>
&mdash; it was the <hi rend="italic">Minerva</hi> &mdash; just then, as luck would have it,<lb/>
entering the harbour.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He had to lower these gentlemen at the end of a rope<lb/>
out of a hole in the wall at the back, while the mob<lb/>
which, pouring out of the town, had spread itself all along<lb/>
the shore, howled and foamed at the foot of the building<lb/>
in front. He had to hurry them then the whole length<lb/>
of the jetty; it had been a desperate dash, neck or<lb/>
nothing &mdash; and again it was Nostromo, a fellow in a<lb/>
thousand, who, at the head, this time, of the Company's<lb/>
body of lightermen, held the jetty against the rushes of<lb/>
the rabble, thus giving the fugitives time to reach the<lb/>
gig lying ready for them at the other end with the<lb/>
Company's flag at the stern. Sticks, stones, shots<lb/>
flew; knives, too, were thrown. Captain Mitchell<lb/>
exhibited willingly the long cicatrice of a cut over his<lb/>
left ear and temple, made by a razor-blade fastened to a<lb/>
stick &mdash; a weapon, he explained, very much in favour<lb/>
with the "worst kind of nigger out here."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Captain Mitchell was a thick, elderly man, wearing<lb/>
high, pointed collars and short side-whiskers, partial to<lb/>


<pb n="13"/>

white waistcoats, and really very communicative under<lb/>
his air of pompous reserve.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "These gentlemen," he would say, staring with great<lb/>
solemnity, "had to run like rabbits, sir. I ran like a<lb/>
rabbit myself. Certain forms of death are &mdash; er &mdash; distasteful<lb/>
to a &mdash; a &mdash; er &mdash; respectable man. They would<lb/>
have pounded me to death, too. A crazy mob, sir, does<lb/>
not discriminate. Under providence we owed our<lb/>
preservation to my Capataz de Cargadores, as they<lb/>
called him in the town, a man who, when I discovered<lb/>
his value, sir, was just the bos'n of an Italian ship, a<lb/>
big Genoese ship, one of the few European ships that<lb/>
ever came to Sulaco with a general cargo before the<lb/>
building of the National Central. He left her on<lb/>
account of some very respectable friends he made here,<lb/>
his own countrymen, but also, I suppose, to better himself.<lb/>
Sir, I am a pretty good judge of character. I<lb/>
engaged him to be the foreman of our lightermen, and<lb/>
caretaker of our jetty. That's all that he was. But<lb/>
without him Se&ntilde;or Ribiera would have been a dead<lb/>
man. This Nostromo, sir, a man absolutely above<lb/>
reproach, became the terror of all the thieves in the<lb/>
town. We were infested, infested, overrun, sir, here at<lb/>
that time by ladrones and matreros, thieves and<lb/>
murderers from the whole province. On this occasion<lb/>
they had been flocking into Sulaco for a week past.<lb/>
They had scented the end, sir. Fifty per cent. of that<lb/>
murdering mob were professional bandits from the<lb/>
Campo, sir, but there wasn't one that hadn't heard of<lb/>
Nostromo. As to the town leperos, sir, the sight of his<lb/>
black whiskers and white teeth was enough for them.<lb/>
They quailed before him, sir. That's what the force of<lb/>
character will do for you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It could very well be said that it was Nostromo alone<lb/>
who saved the lives of these gentlemen. Captain Mitchell,<lb/>


<pb n="14"/>

on his part, never left them till he had seen them<lb/>
collapse, panting, terrified, and exasperated, but safe, on<lb/>
the luxuriant velvet sofas in the first-class saloon of the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Minerva</hi>. To the very last he had been careful to address<lb/>
the ex-Dictator as "Your Excellency."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Sir, I could do no other. The man was down &mdash;<lb/>
ghastly, livid, one mass of scratches."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The <hi rend="italic">Minerva</hi> never let go her anchor that call. The<lb/>
superintendent ordered her out of the harbour at once.<lb/>
No cargo could be landed, of course, and the passengers<lb/>
for Sulaco naturally refused to go ashore. They could<lb/>
hear the firing and see plainly the fight going on at the<lb/>
edge of the water. The repulsed mob devoted its<lb/>
energies to an attack upon the Custom House, a dreary,<lb/>
unfinished-looking structure with many windows two<lb/>
hundred yards away from the O.S.N. Offices, and the<lb/>
only other building near the harbour. Captain Mitchell,<lb/>
after directing the commander of the <hi rend="italic">Minerva</hi><lb/>
to land "these gentlemen" in the first port of call outside<lb/>
Costaguana, went back in his gig to see what could<lb/>
be done for the protection of the Company's property.<lb/>
That and the property of the railway were preserved by<lb/>
the European residents; that is, by Captain Mitchell<lb/>
himself and the staff of engineers building the road,<lb/>
aided by the Italian and Basque workmen who rallied<lb/>
faithfully round their English chiefs. The Company's<lb/>
lightermen, too, natives of the Republic, behaved very<lb/>
well under their Capataz. An outcast lot of very mixed<lb/>
blood, mainly negroes, everlastingly at feud with the<lb/>
other customers of low grog shops in the town, they<lb/>
embraced with delight this opportunity to settle their<lb/>
personal scores under such favourable auspices. There<lb/>
was not one of them that had not, at some time or<lb/>
other, looked with terror at Nostromo's revolver poked<lb/>

Nostromo's resolution. He was "much of a man,"<lb/>
their Capataz was, they said, too scornful in his temper<lb/>
ever to utter abuse, a tireless taskmaster, and the more<lb/>
to be feared because of his aloofness. And behold!<lb/>
there he was that day, at their head, condescending to<lb/>
make jocular remarks to this man or the other.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Such leadership was inspiriting, and in truth all the<lb/>
harm the mob managed to achieve was to set fire to one<lb/>
&mdash; only one &mdash; stack of railway-sleepers, which, being<lb/>
creosoted, burned well. The main attack on the rail-<lb/>
way yards, on the O.S.N. Offices, and especially on the<lb/>
Custom House, whose strong room, it was well known,<lb/>
contained a large treasure in silver ingots, failed completely.<lb/>
Even the little hotel kept by old Giorgio,<lb/>
standing alone halfway between the harbour and the<lb/>
town, escaped looting and destruction, not by a miracle,<lb/>
but because with the safes in view they had neglected it<lb/>
at first, and afterwards found no leisure to stop. Nostromo,<lb/>
with his Cargadores, was pressing them too hard<lb/>
then.<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="16"/>

<p>     IT MIGHT have been said that there he was only protecting<lb/>
his own. From the first he had been admitted<lb/>
to live in the intimacy of the family of the hotel-keeper<lb/>
who was a countryman of his. Old Giorgio Viola, a<lb/>
Genoese with a shaggy white leonine head &mdash; often called<lb/>
simply "the Garibaldino" (as Mohammedans are<lb/>
called after their prophet) &mdash; was, to use Captain Mitchell's<lb/>
own words, the "respectable married friend" by<lb/>
whose advice Nostromo had left his ship to try for a run<lb/>
of shore luck in Costaguana.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The old man, full of scorn for the populace, as your<lb/>
austere republican so often is, had disregarded the<lb/>
preliminary sounds of trouble. He went on that day<lb/>
as usual pottering about the "casa" in his slippers,<lb/>
muttering angrily to himself his contempt of the non-<lb/>
political nature of the riot, and shrugging his shoulders.<lb/>
In the end he was taken unawares by the out-rush of<lb/>
the rabble. It was too late then to remove his family,<lb/>
and, indeed, where could he have run to with the portly<lb/>
Signora Teresa and two little girls on that great plain?<lb/>
So, barricading every opening, the old man sat down<lb/>
sternly in the middle of the darkened <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi> with an old<lb/>
shot-gun on his knees. His wife sat on another chair by<lb/>
his side, muttering pious invocations to all the saints of<lb/>
the calendar.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The old republican did not believe in saints, or in<lb/>
prayers, or in what he called "priest's religion."<lb/>
Liberty and Garibaldi were his divinities; but he<lb/>




<pb n="17"/>

tolerated "superstition" in women, preserving in these<lb/>
matters a lofty and silent attitude.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His two girls, the eldest fourteen, and the other two<lb/>
years younger, crouched on the sanded floor, on each<lb/>
side of the Signora Teresa, with their heads on their<lb/>
mother's lap, both scared, but each in her own way, the<lb/>
dark-haired Linda indignant and angry, the fair Giselle,<lb/>
the younger, bewildered and resigned. The Patrona<lb/>
removed her arms, which embraced her daughters, for a<lb/>
moment to cross herself and wring her hands hurriedly.<lb/>
She moaned a little louder.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Oh! Gian' Battista, why art thou not here? Oh!<lb/>
why art thou not here?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She was not then invoking the saint himself, but<lb/>
calling upon Nostromo, whose patron he was. And<lb/>
Giorgio, motionless on the chair by her side, would be<lb/>
provoked by these reproachful and distracted appeals.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Peace, woman! Where's the sense of it? There's<lb/>
his duty," he murmured in the dark; and she would<lb/>
retort, panting &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Eh! I have no patience. Duty! What of the<lb/>
woman who has been like a mother to him? I bent my<lb/>
knee to him this morning; don't you go out, Gian'<lb/>
Battista &mdash; stop in the house, Battistino &mdash; look at those<lb/>
two little innocent children!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Viola was an Italian, too, a native of Spezzia,<lb/>
and though considerably younger than her husband,<lb/>
already middle-aged. She had a handsome face, whose<lb/>
complexion had turned yellow because the climate of<lb/>
Sulaco did not suit her at all. Her voice was a rich<lb/>
contralto. When, with her arms folded tight under her<lb/>
ample bosom, she scolded the squat, thick-legged China<lb/>
girls handling linen, plucking fowls, pounding corn in<lb/>
wooden mortars amongst the mud outbuildings at the<lb/>
back of the house, she could bring out such an impassioned,<lb/>


<pb n="18"/>

vibrating, sepulchral note that the chained<lb/>
watch-dog bolted into his kennel with a great rattle.<lb/>
Luis, a cinnamon-coloured mulatto with a sprouting<lb/>
moustache and thick, dark lips, would stop sweeping the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi> with a broom of palm-leaves to let a gentle shudder<lb/>
run down his spine. His languishing almond eyes<lb/>
would remain closed for a long time.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This was the staff of the Casa Viola, but all these<lb/>
people had fled early that morning at the first sounds<lb/>
of the riot, preferring to hide on the plain rather than<lb/>
trust themselves in the house; a preference for which<lb/>
they were in no way to blame, since, whether true or not,<lb/>
it was generally believed in the town that the Garibaldino<lb/>
had some money buried under the clay floor of the<lb/>
kitchen. The dog, an irritable, shaggy brute, barked<lb/>
violently and whined plaintively in turns at the back,<lb/>
running in and out of his kennel as rage or fear prompted<lb/>
him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Bursts of great shouting rose and died away, like wild<lb/>
gusts of wind on the plain round the barricaded house;<lb/>
the fitful popping of shots grew louder above the yelling.<lb/>
Sometimes there were intervals of unaccountable stillness<lb/>
outside, and nothing could have been more gaily<lb/>
peaceful than the narrow bright lines of sunlight from<lb/>
the cracks in the shutters, ruled straight across the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi> over the disarranged chairs and tables to the wall<lb/>
opposite. Old Giorgio had chosen that bare, white-<lb/>
washed room for a retreat. It had only one window,<lb/>
and its only door swung out upon the track of thick<lb/>
dust fenced by aloe hedges between the harbour and<lb/>
the town, where clumsy carts used to creak along behind<lb/>
slow yokes of oxen guided by boys on horseback.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In a pause of stillness Giorgio cocked his gun. The<lb/>
ominous sound wrung a low moan from the rigid figure<lb/>
of the woman sitting by his side. A sudden outbreak<lb/>


<pb n="19"/>

of defiant yelling quite near the house sank all at once<lb/>
to a confused murmur of growls. Somebody ran along;<lb/>
the loud catching of his breath was heard for an instant<lb/>
passing the door; there were hoarse mutters and footsteps<lb/>
near the wall; a shoulder rubbed against the<lb/>
shutter, effacing the bright lines of sunshine pencilled<lb/>
across the whole breadth of the room. Signora Teresa's<lb/>
arms thrown about the kneeling forms of her daughters<lb/>
embraced them closer with a convulsive pressure.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The mob, driven away from the Custom House, had<lb/>
broken up into several bands, retreating across the plain<lb/>
in the direction of the town. The subdued crash of<lb/>
irregular volleys fired in the distance was answered by<lb/>
faint yells far away. In the intervals the single shots<lb/>
rang feebly, and the low, long, white building blinded in<lb/>
every window seemed to be the centre of a turmoil<lb/>
widening in a great circle about its closed-up silence.<lb/>
But the cautious movements and whispers of a routed<lb/>
party seeking a momentary shelter behind the wall<lb/>
made the darkness of the room, striped by threads of<lb/>
quiet sunlight, alight with evil, stealthy sounds. The<lb/>
Violas had them in their ears as though invisible<lb/>
ghosts hovering about their chairs had consulted in<lb/>
mutters as to the advisability of setting fire to this<lb/>
foreigner's casa.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was trying to the nerves. Old Viola had risen<lb/>
slowly, gun in hand, irresolute, for he did not see how he<lb/>
could prevent them. Already voices could be heard<lb/>
talking at the back. Signora Teresa was beside herself<lb/>
with terror.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! the traitor! the traitor!" she mumbled, almost<lb/>
inaudibly. "Now we are going to be burnt; and I<lb/>
bent my knee to him. No! he must run at the heels of<lb/>
his English."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She seemed to think that Nostromo's mere presence<lb/>


<pb n="20"/>

in the house would have made it perfectly safe. So far,<lb/>
she, too, was under the spell of that reputation the Capataz<lb/>
de Cargadores had made for himself by the waterside,<lb/>
along the railway line, with the English and with<lb/>
the populace of Sulaco. To his face, and even against<lb/>
her husband, she invariably affected to laugh it to scorn,<lb/>
sometimes good-naturedly, more often with a curious<lb/>
bitterness. But then women are unreasonable in their<lb/>
opinions, as Giorgio used to remark calmly on fitting<lb/>
occasions. On this occasion, with his gun held at<lb/>
ready before him, he stooped down to his wife's head,<lb/>
and, keeping his eyes steadfastly on the barricaded<lb/>
door, he breathed out into her ear that Nostromo would<lb/>
have been powerless to help. What could two men<lb/>
shut up in a house do against twenty or more bent upon<lb/>
setting fire to the roof? Gian' Battista was thinking of<lb/>
the casa all the time, he was sure.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He think of the casa! He!" gasped Signora Viola,<lb/>
crazily. She struck her breast with her open hands.<lb/>
"I know him. He thinks of nobody but himself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A discharge of firearms near by made her throw her<lb/>
head back and close her eyes. Old Giorgio set his<lb/>
teeth hard under his white moustache, and his eyes began<lb/>
to roll fiercely. Several bullets struck the end of<lb/>
the wall together; pieces of plaster could be heard<lb/>
falling outside; a voice screamed "Here they come!"<lb/>
and after a moment of uneasy silence there was a rush<lb/>
of running feet along the front.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Then the tension of old Giorgio's attitude relaxed,<lb/>
and a smile of contemptuous relief came upon his lips<lb/>
of an old fighter with a leonine face. These were not a<lb/>
people striving for justice, but thieves. Even to defend<lb/>
his life against them was a sort of degradation for<lb/>
a man who had been one of Garibaldi's immortal<lb/>
thousand in the conquest of Sicily. He had an immense<lb/>


<pb n="21"/>

scorn for this outbreak of scoundrels and leperos,<lb/>
who did not know the meaning of the word "liberty."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He grounded his old gun, and, turning his head,<lb/>
glanced at the coloured lithograph of Garibaldi in a<lb/>
black frame on the white wall; a thread of strong sunshine<lb/>
cut it perpendicularly. His eyes, accustomed to<lb/>
the luminous twilight, made out the high colouring of<lb/>
the face, the red of the shirt, the outlines of the square<lb/>
shoulders, the black patch of the Bersagliere hat with<lb/>
cock's feathers curling over the crown. An immortal<lb/>
hero! This was your liberty; it gave you not only life,<lb/>
but immortality as well!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     For that one man his fanaticism had suffered no<lb/>
diminution. In the moment of relief from the apprehension<lb/>
of the greatest danger, perhaps, his family<lb/>
had been exposed to in all their wanderings, he had<lb/>
turned to the picture of his old chief, first and only,<lb/>
then laid his hand on his wife's shoulder.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The children kneeling on the floor had not moved.<lb/>
Signora Teresa opened her eyes a little, as though he<lb/>
had awakened her from a very deep and dreamless<lb/>
slumber. Before he had time in his deliberate way to<lb/>
say a reassuring word she jumped up, with the children<lb/>
clinging to her, one on each side, gasped for breath, and<lb/>
let out a hoarse shriek.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was simultaneous with the bang of a violent blow<lb/>
struck on the outside of the shutter. They could hear<lb/>
suddenly the snorting of a horse, the restive tramping of<lb/>
hoofs on the narrow, hard path in front of the house; the<lb/>
toe of a boot struck at the shutter again; a spur jingled<lb/>
at every blow, and an excited voice shouted, "Hola!<lb/>
hola, in there!"<lb/>
</p>

</div2>

<head>CHAPTER FOUR</head>

<pb n="22"/>


<p>     ALL the morning Nostromo had kept his eye from afar<lb/>
on the Casa Viola, even in the thick of the hottest scrimmage<lb/>
near the Custom House. "If I see smoke rising<lb/>
over there," he thought to himself, "they are lost."<lb/>
Directly the mob had broken he pressed with a small<lb/>
band of Italian workmen in that direction, which, indeed,<lb/>
was the shortest line towards the town. That<lb/>
part of the rabble he was pursuing seemed to think of<lb/>
making a stand under the house; a volley fired by his<lb/>
followers from behind an aloe hedge made the rascals<lb/>
fly. In a gap chopped out for the rails of the harbour<lb/>
branch line Nostromo appeared, mounted on his<lb/>
silver-grey mare. He shouted, sent after them one<lb/>
shot from his revolver, and galloped up to the <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi><lb/>
window. He had an idea that old Giorgio would<lb/>
choose that part of the house for a refuge.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His voice had penetrated to them, sounding breathlessly<lb/>
hurried: "Hola! Vecchio! O, Vecchio! Is it all<lb/>
well with you in there?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You see &mdash;" murmured old Viola to his wife.<lb/>
Signora Teresa was silent now. Outside Nostromo<lb/>
laughed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I can hear the padrona is not dead."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have done your best to kill me with fear," cried<lb/>
Signora Teresa. She wanted to say something more,<lb/>
but her voice failed her.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda raised her eyes to her face for a moment, but<lb/>
old Giorgio shouted apologetically &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She is a little upset."<lb/>




<pb n="23"/>

</p>

<p>     Outside Nostromo shouted back with another<lb/>
laugh &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She cannot upset me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Signora Teresa found her voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is what I say. You have no heart &mdash; and you<lb/>
have no conscience, Gian' Battista &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     They heard him wheel his horse away from the<lb/>
shutters. The party he led were babbling excitedly in<lb/>
Italian and Spanish, inciting each other to the pursuit.<lb/>
He put himself at their head, crying, "Avanti!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He has not stopped very long with us. There is no<lb/>
praise from strangers to be got here," Signora Teresa<lb/>
said tragically. "Avanti! Yes! That is all he cares<lb/>
for. To be first somewhere &mdash; somehow &mdash; to be first<lb/>
with these English. They will be showing him to<lb/>
everybody. 'This is our Nostromo!'" She laughed<lb/>
ominously. "What a name! What is that? Nostromo?<lb/>
He would take a name that is properly no<lb/>
word from them."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Meantime Giorgio, with tranquil movements, had<lb/>
been unfastening the door; the flood of light fell on<lb/>
Signora Teresa, with her two girls gathered to her side,<lb/>
a picturesque woman in a pose of maternal exaltation.<lb/>
Behind her the wall was dazzlingly white, and the<lb/>
crude colours of the Garibaldi lithograph paled in the<lb/>
sunshine.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Old Viola, at the door, moved his arm upwards as if<lb/>
referring all his quick, fleeting thoughts to the picture<lb/>
of his old chief on the wall. Even when he was cooking<lb/>
for the "Signori Inglesi" &mdash; the engineers (he was a<lb/>
famous cook, though the kitchen was a dark place) &mdash; he<lb/>
was, as it were, under the eye of the great man who had<lb/>
led him in a glorious struggle where, under the walls<lb/>
of Gaeta, tyranny would have expired for ever had it not<lb/>
been for that accursed Piedmontese race of kings and<lb/>


<pb n="24"/>

ministers. When sometimes a frying-pan caught fire<lb/>
during a delicate operation with some shredded onions,<lb/>
and the old man was seen backing out of the doorway,<lb/>
swearing and coughing violently in an acrid cloud of<lb/>
smoke, the name of Cavour &mdash; the arch intriguer sold to<lb/>
kings and tyrants &mdash; could be heard involved in imprecations<lb/>
against the China girls, cooking in general,<lb/>
and the brute of a country where he was reduced to live<lb/>
for the love of liberty that traitor had strangled.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Then Signora Teresa, all in black, issuing from<lb/>
another door, advanced, portly and anxious, inclining<lb/>
her fine, black-browed head, opening her arms, and<lb/>
crying in a profound tone &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Giorgio! thou passionate man!   Misericordia<lb/>
Divina! In the sun like this! He will make himself<lb/>
ill."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     At her feet the hens made off in all directions, with<lb/>
immense strides; if there were any engineers from up<lb/>
the line staying in Sulaco, a young English face or two<lb/>
would appear at the billiard-room occupying one end of<lb/>
the house; but at the other end, in the <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi>, Luis, the<lb/>
mulatto, took good care not to show himself. The<lb/>
Indian girls, with hair like flowing black manes, and<lb/>
dressed only in a shift and short petticoat, stared dully<lb/>
from under the square-cut fringes on their foreheads;<lb/>
the noisy frizzling of fat had stopped, the fumes floated<lb/>
upwards in sunshine, a strong smell of burnt onions<lb/>
hung in the drowsy heat, enveloping the house; and the<lb/>
eye lost itself in a vast flat expanse of grass to the west,<lb/>
as if the plain between the Sierra overtopping Sulaco<lb/>
and the coast range away there towards Esmeralda had<lb/>
been as big as half the world.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Signora Teresa, after an impressive pause, remonstrated<lb/>
&mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Eh, Giorgio! Leave Cavour alone and take care of<lb/>


<pb n="25"/>

yourself now we are lost in this country all alone<lb/>
with the two children, because you cannot live under a<lb/>
king."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And while she looked at him she would sometimes put<lb/>
her hand hastily to her side with a short twitch of her<lb/>
fine lips and a knitting of her black, straight eyebrows<lb/>
like a flicker of angry pain or an angry thought on her<lb/>
handsome, regular features.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was pain; she suppressed the twinge. It had come<lb/>
to her first a few years after they had left Italy to emigrate<lb/>
to America and settle at last in Sulaco after<lb/>
wandering from town to town, trying shopkeeping in a<lb/>
small way here and there; and once an organized enterprise<lb/>
of fishing &mdash; in Maldonado &mdash; for Giorgio, like the<lb/>
great Garibaldi, had been a sailor in his time.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sometimes she had no patience with pain. For years<lb/>
its gnawing had been part of the landscape embracing<lb/>
the glitter of the harbour under the wooded spurs of the<lb/>
range; and the sunshine itself was heavy and dull &mdash;<lb/>
heavy with pain &mdash; not like the sunshine of her girlhood,<lb/>
in which middle-aged Giorgio had wooed her gravely<lb/>
and passionately on the shores of the gulf of Spezzia.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You go in at once, Giorgio," she directed. "One<lb/>
would think you do not wish to have any pity on me &mdash;<lb/>
with four Signori Inglesi staying in the house."<lb/>
"Va bene, va bene," Giorgio would mutter.<lb/>
He obeyed. The Signori Inglesi would require their<lb/>
midday meal presently.  He had been one of the<lb/>
immortal and invincible band of liberators who had<lb/>
made the mercenaries of tyranny fly like chaff before a<lb/>
hurricane, "un uragano terribile." But that was before<lb/>
he was married and had children; and before tyranny<lb/>
had reared its head again amongst the traitors who had<lb/>
imprisoned Garibaldi, his hero.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There were three doors in the front of the house, and<lb/>


<pb n="26"/>

each afternoon the Garibaldino could be seen at one or<lb/>
another of them with his big bush of white hair, his<lb/>
arms folded, his legs crossed, leaning back his leonine<lb/>
head against the side, and looking up the wooded<lb/>
slopes of the foothills at the snowy dome of Higuerota.<lb/>
The front of his house threw off a black long rectangle<lb/>
of shade, broadening slowly over the soft ox-cart track.<lb/>
Through the gaps, chopped out in the oleander hedges,<lb/>
the harbour branch railway, laid out temporarily on the<lb/>
level of the plain, curved away its shining parallel ribbons<lb/>
on a belt of scorched and withered grass within<lb/>
sixty yards of the end of the house. In the evening<lb/>
the empty material trains of flat cars circled round the<lb/>
dark green grove of Sulaco, and ran, undulating slightly<lb/>
with white jets of steam, over the plain towards the<lb/>
Casa Viola, on their way to the railway yards by<lb/>
the harbour. The Italian drivers saluted him from the<lb/>
foot-plate with raised hand, while the negro brakesmen<lb/>
sat carelessly on the brakes, looking straight forward,<lb/>
with the rims of their big hats flapping in the wind. In<lb/>
return Giorgio would give a slight sideways jerk of the<lb/>
head, without unfolding his arms.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On this memorable day of the riot his arms were not<lb/>
folded on his chest. His hand grasped the barrel of the<lb/>
gun grounded on the threshold; he did not look up once<lb/>
at the white dome of Higuerota, whose cool purity<lb/>
seemed to hold itself aloof from a hot earth. His eyes<lb/>
examined the plain curiously. Tall trails of dust subsided<lb/>
here and there. In a speckless sky the sun hung<lb/>
clear and blinding. Knots of men ran headlong; others<lb/>
made a stand; and the irregular rattle of firearms<lb/>
came rippling to his ears in the fiery, still air. Single<lb/>
figures on foot raced desperately. Horsemen galloped<lb/>
towards each other, wheeled round together, separated<lb/>
at speed. Giorgio saw one fall, rider and horse disappearing<lb/>


<pb n="27"/>

as if they had galloped into a chasm, and the<lb/>
movements of the animated scene were like the passages<lb/>
of a violent game played upon the plain by dwarfs<lb/>
mounted and on foot, yelling with tiny throats, under<lb/>
the mountain that seemed a colossal embodiment of<lb/>
silence. Never before had Giorgio seen this bit of plain<lb/>
so full of active life; his gaze could not take in all its<lb/>
details at once; he shaded his eyes with his hand, till<lb/>
suddenly the thundering of many hoofs near by startled<lb/>
him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A troop of horses had broken out of the fenced paddock<lb/>
of the Railway Company. They came on like a<lb/>
whirlwind, and dashed over the line snorting, kicking,<lb/>
squealing in a compact, piebald, tossing mob of bay,<lb/>
brown, grey backs, eyes staring, necks extended, nostrils<lb/>
red, long tails streaming. As soon as they had<lb/>
leaped upon the road the thick dust flew upwards from<lb/>
under their hoofs, and within six yards of Giorgio only<lb/>
a brown cloud with vague forms of necks and cruppers<lb/>
rolled by, making the soil tremble on its passage.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Viola coughed, turning his face away from the dust,<lb/>
and shaking his head slightly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "There will be some horse-catching to be done before<lb/>
to-night," he muttered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the square of sunlight falling through the door<lb/>
Signora Teresa, kneeling before the chair, had bowed<lb/>
her head, heavy with a twisted mass of ebony hair<lb/>
streaked with silver, into the palm of her hands. The<lb/>
black lace shawl she used to drape about her face had<lb/>
dropped to the ground by her side. The two girls had<lb/>
got up, hand-in-hand, in short skirts, their loose hair<lb/>
falling in disorder. The younger had thrown her arm<lb/>
across her eyes, as if afraid to face the light. Linda,<lb/>
with her hand on the other's shoulder, stared fearlessly.<lb/>
Viola looked at his children.<lb/>


<pb n="28"/>

The sun brought out the deep lines on his face, and,<lb/>
energetic in expression, it had the immobility of a<lb/>
carving. It was impossible to discover what he thought.<lb/>
Bushy grey eyebrows shaded his dark glance.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well! And do you not pray like your mother?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda pouted, advancing her red lips, which were<lb/>
almost too red; but she had admirable eyes, brown, with<lb/>
a sparkle of gold in the irises, full of intelligence and<lb/>
meaning, and so clear that they seemed to throw a glow<lb/>
upon her thin, colourless face. There were bronze<lb/>
glints in the sombre clusters of her hair, and the eye-<lb/>
lashes, long and coal black, made her complexion appear<lb/>
still more pale.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Mother is going to offer up a lot of candles in the<lb/>
church. She always does when Nostromo has been<lb/>
away fighting. I shall have some to carry up to the<lb/>
Chapel of the Madonna in the Cathedral."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She said all this quickly, with great assurance, in an<lb/>
animated, penetrating voice. Then, giving her sister's<lb/>
shoulder a slight shake, she added &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And she will be made to carry one, too!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Why made?" inquired Giorgio, gravely. "Does<lb/>
she not want to?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She is timid," said Linda, with a little burst of<lb/>
laughter. "People notice her fair hair as she goes along<lb/>
with us. They call out after her, 'Look at the Rubia!<lb/>
Look at the Rubiacita!' They call out in the streets.<lb/>
She is timid."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And you? You are not timid &mdash; eh?" the father<lb/>
pronounced, slowly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She tossed back all her dark hair.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Nobody calls out after me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Old Giorgio contemplated his children thoughtfully.<lb/>
There was two years difference between them. They<lb/>
had been born to him late, years after the boy had died.<lb/>


<pb n="29"/>

Had he lived he would have been nearly as old as<lb/>
Gian' Battista &mdash; he whom the English called Nostromo;<lb/>
but as to his daughters, the severity of his temper, his<lb/>
advancing age, his absorption in his memories, had prevented<lb/>
his taking much notice of them.  He loved his<lb/>
children, but girls belong more to the mother, and much<lb/>
of his affection had been expended in the worship and<lb/>
service of liberty.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     When quite a youth he had deserted from a ship trading<lb/>
to La Plata, to enlist in the navy of Montevideo,<lb/>
then under the command of Garibaldi. Afterwards,<lb/>
in the Italian legion of the Republic struggling against<lb/>
the encroaching tyranny of Rosas, he had taken part,<lb/>
on great plains, on the banks of immense rivers, in the<lb/>
fiercest fighting perhaps the world had ever known.<lb/>
He had lived amongst men who had declaimed about<lb/>
liberty, suffered for liberty, died for liberty, with a<lb/>
desperate exaltation, and with their eyes turned<lb/>
towards an oppressed Italy. His own enthusiasm had<lb/>
been fed on scenes of carnage, on the examples of lofty<lb/>
devotion, on the din of armed struggle, on the inflamed<lb/>
language of proclamations. He had never parted from<lb/>
the chief of his choice &mdash; the fiery apostle of independence<lb/>
&mdash; keeping by his side in America and in Italy till after<lb/>
the fatal day of Aspromonte, when the treachery of<lb/>
kings, emperors, and ministers had been revealed to the<lb/>
world in the wounding and imprisonment of his hero &mdash; a<lb/>
catastrophe that had instilled into him a gloomy doubt<lb/>
of ever being able to understand the ways of Divine<lb/>
justice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He did not deny it, however. It required patience,<lb/>
he would say. Though he disliked priests, and would<lb/>
not put his foot inside a church for anything, he believed<lb/>
in God. Were not the proclamations against tyrants<lb/>
addressed to the peoples in the name of God and liberty?<lb/>


<pb n="30"/>

"God for men &mdash; religions for women," he muttered<lb/>
sometimes. In Sicily, an Englishman who had turned<lb/>
up in Palermo after its evacuation by the army of the<lb/>
king, had given him a Bible in Italian &mdash; the publication<lb/>
of the British and Foreign Bible Society, bound in a<lb/>
dark leather cover. In periods of political adversity,<lb/>
in the pauses of silence when the revolutionists issued<lb/>
no proclamations, Giorgio earned his living with the<lb/>
first work that came to hand &mdash; as sailor, as dock labourer<lb/>
on the quays of Genoa, once as a hand on a farm in<lb/>
the hills above Spezzia &mdash; and in his spare time he<lb/>
studied the thick volume. He carried it with him into<lb/>
battles. Now it was his only reading, and in order not<lb/>
to be deprived of it (the print was small) he had consented<lb/>
to accept the present of a pair of silver-mounted<lb/>
spectacles from Se&ntilde;ora Emilia Gould, the wife of<lb/>
the Englishman who managed the silver mine in<lb/>
the mountains three leagues from the town. She was<lb/>
the only Englishwoman in Sulaco.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Giorgio Viola had a great consideration for the<lb/>
English. This feeling, born on the battlefields of<lb/>
Uruguay, was forty years old at the very least. Several<lb/>
of them had poured their blood for the cause of freedom<lb/>
in America, and the first he had ever known he remembered<lb/>
by the name of Samuel; he commanded a<lb/>
negro company under Garibaldi, during the famous<lb/>
siege of Montevideo, and died heroically with his<lb/>
negroes at the fording of the Boyana. He, Giorgio, had<lb/>
reached the rank of ensign-<hi rend="italic">alferez</hi>-and cooked for the<lb/>
general. Later, in Italy, he, with the rank of lieutenant,<lb/>
rode with the staff and still cooked for the general. He<lb/>
had cooked for him in Lombardy through the whole<lb/>
campaign; on the march to Rome he had lassoed his<lb/>
beef in the Campagna after the American manner; he<lb/>
had been wounded in the defence of the Roman Republic;<lb/>


<pb n="31"/>

he was one of the four fugitives who, with the<lb/>
general, carried out of the woods the inanimate body of<lb/>
the general's wife into the farmhouse where she died,<lb/>
exhausted by the hardships of that terrible retreat.<lb/>
He had survived that disastrous time to attend his<lb/>
general in Palermo when the Neapolitan shells from the<lb/>
castle crashed upon the town. He had cooked for him<lb/>
on the field of Volturno after fighting all day. And<lb/>
everywhere he had seen Englishmen in the front rank<lb/>
of the army of freedom. He respected their nation because<lb/>
they loved Garibaldi. Their very countesses<lb/>
and princesses had kissed the general's hands in London,<lb/>
it was said. He could well believe it; for the nation was<lb/>
noble, and the man was a saint. It was enough to look<lb/>
once at his face to see the divine force of faith in him<lb/>
and his great pity for all that was poor, suffering, and<lb/>
oppressed in this world.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The spirit of self-forgetfulness, the simple devotion to<lb/>
a vast humanitarian idea which inspired the thought<lb/>
and stress of that revolutionary time, had left its mark<lb/>
upon Giorgio in a sort of austere contempt for all<lb/>
personal advantage. This man, whom the lowest class<lb/>
in Sulaco suspected of having a buried hoard in his<lb/>
kitchen, had all his life despised money. The leaders of<lb/>
his youth had lived poor, had died poor. It had been a<lb/>
habit of his mind to disregard to-morrow. It was<lb/>
engendered partly by an existence of excitement,<lb/>
adventure, and wild warfare. But mostly it was a<lb/>
matter of principle. It did not resemble the carelessness<lb/>
of a condottiere, it was a puritanism of conduct,<lb/>
born of stern enthusiasm like the puritanism of religion.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This stern devotion to a cause had cast a gloom upon<lb/>
Giorgio's old age. It cast a gloom because the cause<lb/>
seemed lost. Too many kings and emperors flourished<lb/>
yet in the world which God had meant for the people.<lb/>


<pb n="32"/>

He was sad because of his simplicity. Though always<lb/>
ready to help his countrymen, and greatly respected by<lb/>
the Italian emigrants wherever he lived (in his exile he<lb/>
called it), he could not conceal from himself that they<lb/>
cared nothing for the wrongs of down-trodden nations.<lb/>
They listened to his tales of war readily, but seemed to<lb/>
ask themselves what he had got out of it after all.<lb/>
There was nothing that they could see. "We wanted<lb/>
nothing, we suffered for the love of all humanity!" he<lb/>
cried out furiously sometimes, and the powerful voice,<lb/>
the blazing eyes, the shaking of the white mane, the<lb/>
brown, sinewy hand pointing upwards as if to call<lb/>
heaven to witness, impressed his hearers. After the old<lb/>
man hadbroken off abruptly with a jerk of the head and<lb/>
a movement of the arm, meaning clearly, "But what's<lb/>
the good of talking to you?" they nudged each other.<lb/>
There was in old Giorgio an energy of feeling, a personal<lb/>
quality of conviction, something they called "terribilit&agrave;"<lb/>
-"an old lion," they used to say of him. Some<lb/>
slight incident, a chance word would set him off talking<lb/>
on the beach to the Italian fishermen of Maldonado, in<lb/>
the little shop he kept afterwards (in Valparaiso) to his<lb/>
countrymen customers; of an evening, suddenly, in the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi> at one end of the Casa Viola (the other was reserved<lb/>
for the English engineers) to the select <hi rend="italic">client&egrave;le</hi> of<lb/>
engine-drivers and foremen of the railway shops.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With their handsome, bronzed, lean faces, shiny<lb/>
black ringlets, glistening eyes, broad-chested, bearded,<lb/>
sometimes a tiny gold ring in the lobe of the ear,<lb/>
the aristocracy of the railway works listened to him,<lb/>
turning away from their cards or dominoes. Here<lb/>
and there a fair-haired Basque studied his hand<lb/>
meantime, waiting without protest. No native of<lb/>
Costaguana intruded there. This was the Italian<lb/>
stronghold. Even the Sulaco policemen on a night<lb/>


<pb n="33"/>

patrol let their horses pace softly by, bending low in the<lb/>
saddle to glance through the window at the heads in a<lb/>
fog of smoke; and the drone of old Giorgio's declamatory<lb/>
narrative seemed to sink behind them into the plain.<lb/>
Only now and then the assistant of the chief of police,<lb/>
some broad-faced, brown little gentleman, with a great<lb/>
deal of Indian in him, would put in an appearance.<lb/>
Leaving his man outside with the horses he advanced<lb/>
with a confident, sly smile, and without a word up to the<lb/>
long trestle table. He pointed to one of the bottles<lb/>
on the shelf; Giorgio, thrusting his pipe into his mouth<lb/>
abruptly, served him in person. Nothing would be<lb/>
heard but the slight jingle of the spurs. His glass<lb/>
emptied, he would take a leisurely, scrutinizing look all<lb/>
round the room, go out, and ride away slowly, circling<lb/>
towards the town.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     IN THIS way only was the power of the local authorities<lb/>
vindicated amongst the great body of strong-<lb/>
limbed foreigners who dug the earth, blasted the<lb/>
rocks, drove the engines for the "progressive and<lb/>
patriotic undertaking." In these very words eighteen<lb/>
months before the Excellentissimo Se&ntilde;or don Vincente<lb/>
Ribiera, the Dictator of Costaguana, had described the<lb/>
National Central Railway in his great speech at the<lb/>
turning of the first sod.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He had come on purpose to Sulaco, and there was a<lb/>
one-o'clock dinner-party, a <hi rend="italic">convit&eacute;</hi> offered by the O.S.N.<lb/>
Company on board the <hi rend="italic">Juno</hi> after the function on shore.<lb/>
Captain Mitchell had himself steered the cargo lighter,<lb/>
all draped with flags, which, in tow of the <hi rend="italic">Juno's</hi> steam<lb/>
launch, took the Excellentissimo from the jetty to the<lb/>
ship. Everybody of note in Sulaco had been invited &mdash;<lb/>
the one or two foreign merchants, all the representatives<lb/>
of the old Spanish families then in town, the great<lb/>
owners of estates on the plain, grave, courteous, simple<lb/>
men, caballeros of pure descent, with small hands and<lb/>
feet, conservative, hospitable, and kind. The Occidental<lb/>
Province was their stronghold; their Blanco<lb/>
party had triumphed now; it was their President-<lb/>
Dictator, a Blanco of the Blancos, who sat smiling<lb/>
urbanely between the representatives of two friendly<lb/>
foreign powers. They had come with him from Sta.<lb/>
Marta to countenance by their presence the enterprise<lb/>
in which the capital of their countries was engaged.<lb/>
The only lady of that company was Mrs. Gould, the<lb/>




<pb n="35"/>

wife of Don Carlos, the administrator of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
silver mine. The ladies of Sulaco were not advanced<lb/>
enough to take part in the public life to that extent.<lb/>
They had come out strongly at the great ball at the<lb/>
Intendencia the evening before, but Mrs. Gould alone<lb/>
had appeared, a bright spot in the group of black coats<lb/>
behind the President-Dictator, on the crimson cloth-<lb/>
covered stage erected under a shady tree on the shore<lb/>
of the harbour, where the ceremony of turning the first<lb/>
sod had taken place. She had come off in the cargo<lb/>
lighter, full of notabilities, sitting under the flutter of<lb/>
gay flags, in the place of honour by the side of Captain<lb/>
Mitchell, who steered, and her clear dress gave the only<lb/>
truly festive note to the sombre gathering in the long,<lb/>
gorgeous saloon of the <hi rend="italic">Juno</hi>.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The head of the chairman of the railway board (from<lb/>
London), handsome and pale in a silvery mist of white<lb/>
hair and clipped beard, hovered near her shoulder<lb/>
attentive, smiling, and fatigued. The journey from<lb/>
London to Sta. Marta in mail boats and the special<lb/>
carriages of the Sta. Marta coast-line (the only railway<lb/>
so far) had been tolerable &mdash; even pleasant &mdash; quite tolerable.<lb/>
But the trip over the mountains to Sulaco was<lb/>
another sort of experience, in an old diligencia over impassable<lb/>
roads skirting awful precipices.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "We have been upset twice in one day on the brink of<lb/>
very deep ravines," he was telling Mrs. Gould in an<lb/>
undertone. "And when we arrived here at last I don't<lb/>
know what we should have done without your hospitality.<lb/>
What an out-of-the-way place Sulaco is! &mdash;<lb/>
and for a harbour, too! Astonishing!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, but we are very proud of it. It used to be<lb/>
historically important. The highest ecclesiastical court<lb/>
for two viceroyalties, sat here in the olden time," she<lb/>
instructed him with animation.<lb/>


<pb n="36"/>

</p>

<p>     "I am impressed. I didn't mean to be disparaging.<lb/>
You seem very patriotic."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The place is lovable, if only by its situation. Perhaps<lb/>
you don't know what an old resident I am."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "How old, I wonder," he murmured, looking at her<lb/>
with a slight smile. Mrs. Gould's appearance was<lb/>
made youthful by the mobile intelligence of her face.<lb/>
"We can't give you your ecclesiastical court back again;<lb/>
but you shall have more steamers, a railway, a telegraph-cable<lb/>
&mdash; a future in the great world which is worth<lb/>
infinitely more than any amount of ecclesiastical past.<lb/>
You shall be brought in touch with something greater<lb/>
than two viceroyalties. But I had no notion that a<lb/>
place on a sea-coast could remain so isolated from the<lb/>
world. If it had been a thousand miles inland now &mdash; most<lb/>
remarkable! Has anything ever happened here for a<lb/>
hundred years before to-day?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     While he talked in a slow, humorous tone, she kept<lb/>
her little smile. Agreeing ironically, she assured him<lb/>
that certainly not &mdash; nothing ever happened in Sulaco.<lb/>
Even the revolutions, of which there had been two<lb/>
in her time, had respected the repose of the place.<lb/>
Their course ran in the more populous southern parts<lb/>
of the Republic, and the great valley of Sta. Marta,<lb/>
which was like one great battlefield of the parties,<lb/>
with the possession of the capital for a prize and<lb/>
an outlet to another ocean. They were more advanced<lb/>
over there.   Here in Sulaco they heard only the echoes<lb/>
of these great questions, and, of course, their official<lb/>
world changed each time, coming to them over their<lb/>
rampart of mountains which he himself had traversed<lb/>
in an old diligencia, with such a risk to life and limb.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The chairman of the railway had been enjoying her<lb/>
hospitality for several days, and he was really grateful<lb/>
for it. It was only since he had left Sta. Marta that he<lb/>


<pb n="37"/>

had utterly lost touch with the feeling of European life<lb/>
on the background of his exotic surroundings. In the<lb/>
capital he had been the guest of the Legation, and had<lb/>
been kept busy negotiating with the members of Don<lb/>
Vincente's Government &mdash; cultured men, men to whom<lb/>
the conditions of civilized business were not unknown.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     What concerned him most at the time was the<lb/>
acquisition of land for the railway. In the Sta. Marta<lb/>
Valley, where there was already one line in existence,<lb/>
the people were tractable, and it was only a matter of<lb/>
price. A commission had been nominated to fix the<lb/>
values, and the difficulty resolved itself into the judicious<lb/>
influencing of the Commissioners. But in Sulaco &mdash;<lb/>
the Occidental Province for whose very development<lb/>
the railway was intended &mdash; there had been trouble. It<lb/>
had been lying for ages ensconced behind its natural<lb/>
barriers, repelling modern enterprise by the precipices<lb/>
of its mountain range, by its shallow harbour opening<lb/>
into the everlasting calms of a gulf full of clouds, by<lb/>
the benighted state of mind of the owners of its fertile<lb/>
territory &mdash; all these aristocratic old Spanish families, all<lb/>
those Don Ambrosios this and Don Fernandos that, who<lb/>
seemed actually to dislike and distrust the coming of the<lb/>
railway over their lands. It had happened that some of<lb/>
the surveying parties scattered all over the province had<lb/>
been warned off with threats of violence. In other cases<lb/>
outrageous pretensions as to price had been raised.<lb/>
But the man of railways prided himself on being equal to<lb/>
every emergency. Since he was met by the inimical<lb/>
sentiment of blind conservatism in Sulaco he would<lb/>
meet it by sentiment, too, before taking his stand on his<lb/>
right alone. The Government was bound to carry out<lb/>
its part of the contract with the board of the new<lb/>
railway company, even if it had to use force for the<lb/>
purpose. But he desired nothing less than an armed<lb/>


<pb n="38"/>

disturbance in the smooth working of his plans. They<lb/>
were much too vast and far-reaching, and too promising<lb/>
to leave a stone unturned; and so he imagined to get<lb/>
the President-Dictator over there on a tour of ceremonies<lb/>
and speeches, culminating in a great function<lb/>
at the turning of the first sod by the harbour shore.<lb/>
After all he was their own creature &mdash; that Don Vincente.<lb/>
He was the embodied triumph of the best elements in<lb/>
the State. These were facts, and, unless facts meant<lb/>
nothing, Sir John argued to himself, such a man's influence<lb/>
must be real, and his personal action would<lb/>
produce the conciliatory effect he required. He had<lb/>
succeeded in arranging the trip with the help of a very<lb/>
clever advocate, who was known in Sta. Marta as the<lb/>
agent of the Gould silver mine, the biggest thing in<lb/>
Sulaco, and even in the whole Republic. It was indeed<lb/>
a fabulously rich mine. Its so-called agent, evidently a<lb/>
man of culture and ability, seemed, without official<lb/>
position, to possess an extraordinary influence in the<lb/>
highest Government spheres. He was able to assure<lb/>
Sir John that the President-Dictator would make the<lb/>
journey. He regretted, however, in the course of the<lb/>
same conversation, that General Montero insisted upon<lb/>
going, too.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     General Montero, whom the beginning of the struggle<lb/>
had found an obscure army captain employed on the<lb/>
wild eastern frontier of the State, had thrown in his lot<lb/>
with the Ribiera party at a moment when special<lb/>
circumstances had given that small adhesion a fortuitous<lb/>
importance. The fortunes of war served him<lb/>
marvellously, and the victory of Rio Seco (after a day<lb/>
of desperate fighting) put a seal to his success. At the<lb/>
end he emerged General, Minister of War, and the<lb/>
military head of the Blanco party, although there was<lb/>
nothing aristocratic in his descent. Indeed, it was said<lb/>


<pb n="39"/>

that he and his brother, orphans, had been brought up<lb/>
by the munificence of a famous European traveller, in<lb/>
whose service their father had lost his life. Another<lb/>
story was that their father had been nothing but a charcoal<lb/>
burner in the woods, and their mother a baptised<lb/>
Indian woman from the far interior.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     However that might be, the Costaguana Press was in<lb/>
the habit of styling Montero's forest march from his<lb/>
commandancia to join the Blanco forces at the beginning<lb/>
of the troubles, the "most heroic military exploit<lb/>
of modern times." About the same time, too, his<lb/>
brother had turned up from Europe, where he had gone<lb/>
apparently as secretary to a consul. Having, however,<lb/>
collected a small band of outlaws, he showed some<lb/>
talent as guerilla chief and had been rewarded at the<lb/>
pacification by the post of Military Commandant of the<lb/>
capital.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Minister of War, then, accompanied the Dictator.<lb/>
The board of the O.S.N. Company, working hand-<lb/>
in-hand with the railway people for the good of the Republic,<lb/>
had on this important occasion instructed<lb/>
Captain Mitchell to put the mail-boat <hi rend="italic">Juno</hi> at the<lb/>
disposal of the distinguished party. Don Vincente,<lb/>
journeying south from Sta. Marta, had embarked at<lb/>
Cayta, the principal port of Costaguana, and came to<lb/>
Sulaco by sea. But the chairman of the railway<lb/>
company had courageously crossed the mountains in a<lb/>
ramshackle diligencia, mainly for the purpose of meeting<lb/>
his engineer-in-chief engaged in the final survey of the<lb/>
road.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     For all the indifference of a man of affairs to nature,<lb/>
whose hostility can always be overcome by the resources<lb/>
of finance, he could not help being impressed<lb/>
by his surroundings during his halt at the surveying<lb/>
camp established at the highest point his railway was to<lb/>


<pb n="40"/>

reach. He spent the night there, arriving just too late<lb/>
to see the last dying glow of sunlight upon the snowy<lb/>
flank of Higuerota. Pillared masses of black basalt<lb/>
framed like an open portal a portion of the white field<lb/>
lying aslant against the west. In the transparent air<lb/>
of the high altitudes everything seemed very near,<lb/>
steeped in a clear stillness as in an imponderable liquid;<lb/>
and with his ear ready to catch the first sound of the<lb/>
expected diligencia the engineer-in-chief, at the door of a<lb/>
hut of rough stones, had contemplated the changing<lb/>
hues on the enormous side of the mountain, thinking<lb/>
that in this sight, as in a piece of inspired music, there<lb/>
could be found together the utmost delicacy of shaded<lb/>
expression and a stupendous magnificence of effect.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sir John arrived too late to hear the magnificent and<lb/>
inaudible strain sung by the sunset amongst the high<lb/>
peaks of the Sierra. It had sung itself out into the<lb/>
breathless pause of deep dusk before, climbing down the<lb/>
fore wheel of the diligencia with stiff limbs, he shook<lb/>
hands with the engineer.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     They gave him his dinner in a stone hut like a cubical<lb/>
boulder, with no door or windows in its two openings;<lb/>
a bright fire of sticks (brought on muleback from the<lb/>
first valley below) burning outside, sent in a wavering<lb/>
glare; and two candles in tin candlesticks &mdash; lighted, it<lb/>
was explained to him, in his honour &mdash; stood on a sort of<lb/>
rough camp table, at which he sat on the right hand of<lb/>
the chief. He knew how to be amiable; and the young<lb/>
men of the engineering staff, for whom the surveying of<lb/>
the railway track had the glamour of the first steps on<lb/>
the path of life, sat there, too, listening modestly, with<lb/>
their smooth faces tanned by the weather, and very<lb/>
pleased to witness so much affability in so great a man.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Afterwards, late at night, pacing to and fro outside,<lb/>
he had a long talk with his chief engineer. He knew<lb/>


<pb n="41"/>

him well of old. This was not the first undertaking in<lb/>
which their gifts, as elementally different as fire and<lb/>
water, had worked in conjunction. From the contact<lb/>
of these two personalities, who had not the same vision<lb/>
of the world, there was generated a power for the world's<lb/>
service &mdash; a subtle force that could set in motion mighty<lb/>
machines, men's muscles, and awaken also in human<lb/>
breasts an unbounded devotion to the task. Of the<lb/>
young fellows at the table, to whom the survey of the<lb/>
track was like the tracing of the path of life, more than<lb/>
one would be called to meet death before the work was<lb/>
done. But the work would be done: the force would be<lb/>
almost as strong as a faith. Not quite, however. In<lb/>
the silence of the sleeping camp upon the moonlit<lb/>
plateau forming the top of the pass like the floor of a<lb/>
vast arena surrounded by the basalt walls of precipices,<lb/>
two strolling figures in thick ulsters stood still, and the<lb/>
voice of the engineer pronounced distinctly the words &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "We can't move mountains!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sir John, raising his head to follow the pointing<lb/>
gesture, felt the full force of the words. The white<lb/>
Higuerota soared out of the shadows of rock and earth<lb/>
like a frozen bubble under the moon. All was still, till<lb/>
near by, behind the wall of a corral for the camp animals,<lb/>
built roughly of loose stones in the form of a<lb/>
circle, a pack mule stamped his forefoot and blew<lb/>
heavily twice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The engineer-in-chief had used the phrase in answer<lb/>
to the chairman's tentative suggestion that the tracing<lb/>
of the line could, perhaps, be altered in deference to the<lb/>
prejudices of the Sulaco landowners. The chief engineer<lb/>
believed that the obstinacy of men was the lesser<lb/>
obstacle. Moreover, to combat that they had the great<lb/>
influence of Charles Gould, whereas tunnelling under<lb/>
Higuerota would have been a colossal undertaking.<lb/>


<pb n="42"/>

</p>

<p>     "Ah, yes! Gould. What sort of a man is he?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sir John had heard much of Charles Gould in Sta.<lb/>
Marta, and wanted to know more. The engineer-in-<lb/>
chief assured him that the administrator of the San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; silver mine had an immense influence over all<lb/>
these Spanish Dons. He had also one of the best<lb/>
houses in Sulaco, and the Gould hospitality was beyond<lb/>
all praise.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "They received me as if they had known me for<lb/>
years," he said. "The little lady is kindness personified.<lb/>
I stayed with them for a month. He helped<lb/>
me to organize the surveying parties. His practical<lb/>
ownership of the San Tom&eacute; silver mine gives him a<lb/>
special position. He seems to have the ear of every<lb/>
provincial authority apparently, and, as I said, he can<lb/>
wind all the hidalgos of the province round his little<lb/>
finger. If you follow his advice the difficulties will fall<lb/>
away, because he wants the railway. Of course, you<lb/>
must be careful in what you say. He's English, and<lb/>
besides he must be immensely wealthy. The Holroyd<lb/>
house is in with him in that mine, so you may imagine<lb/>
&mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He interrupted himself as, from before one of the<lb/>
little fires burning outside the low wall of the corral,<lb/>
arose the figure of a man wrapped in a poncho up to the<lb/>
neck. The saddle which he had been using for a pillow<lb/>
made a dark patch on the ground against the red glow of<lb/>
embers.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I shall see Holroyd himself on my way back through<lb/>
the States," said Sir John. "I've ascertained that he,<lb/>
too, wants the railway."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The man who, perhaps disturbed by the proximity of<lb/>
the voices, had arisen from the ground, struck a match<lb/>
to light a cigarette. The flame showed a bronzed,<lb/>
black-whiskered face, a pair of eyes gazing straight;<lb/>


<pb n="43"/>

then, rearranging his wrappings, he sank full length and<lb/>
laid his head again on the saddle.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That's our camp-master, whom I must send back to<lb/>
Sulaco now we are going to carry our survey into the<lb/>
Sta. Marta Valley," said the engineer. "A most useful<lb/>
fellow, lent me by Captain Mitchell of the O.S.N.<lb/>
Company. It was very good of Mitchell. Charles<lb/>
Gould told me I couldn't do better than take advantage<lb/>
of the offer. He seems to know how to rule all these<lb/>
muleteers and peons. We had not the slightest trouble<lb/>
with our people. He shall escort your diligencia right<lb/>
into Sulaco with some of our railway peons. The road<lb/>
is bad. To have him at hand may save you an upset<lb/>
or two. He promised me to take care of your person<lb/>
all the way down as if you were his father."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This camp-master was the Italian sailor whom all the<lb/>
Europeans in Sulaco, following Captain Mitchell's<lb/>
mispronunciation, were in the habit of calling Nostromo.<lb/>
And indeed, taciturn and ready, he did take<lb/>
excellent care of his charge at the bad parts of the road,<lb/>
as Sir John himself acknowledged to Mrs. Gould afterwards.<lb/>
</p>

<head>CHAPTER SIX</head>

<pb n="44"/>


<p>     AT THAT time Nostromo had been already long enough<lb/>
in the country to raise to the highest pitch Captain<lb/>
Mitchell's opinion of the extraordinary value of his<lb/>
discovery. Clearly he was one of those invaluable<lb/>
subordinates whom to possess is a legitimate cause of<lb/>
boasting. Captain Mitchell plumed himself upon his<lb/>
eye for men &mdash; but he was not selfish &mdash; and in the innocence<lb/>
of his pride was already developing that mania<lb/>
for "lending you my Capataz de Cargadores" which<lb/>
was to bring Nostromo into personal contact, sooner or<lb/>
later, with every European in Sulaco, as a sort of universal<lb/>
factotum &mdash; a prodigy of efficiency in his own sphere<lb/>
of life.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The fellow is devoted to me, body and soul!"<lb/>
Captain Mitchell was given to affirm; and though nobody,<lb/>
perhaps, could have explained why it should be<lb/>
so, it was impossible on a survey of their relation to<lb/>
throw doubt on that statement, unless, indeed, one<lb/>
were a bitter, eccentric character like Dr. Monygham &mdash;<lb/>
for instance &mdash; whose short, hopeless laugh expressed<lb/>
somehow an immense mistrust of mankind. Not that<lb/>
Dr. Monygham was a prodigal either of laughter or of<lb/>
words. He was bitterly taciturn when at his best. At<lb/>
his worst people feared the open scornfulness of his<lb/>
tongue. Only Mrs. Gould could keep his unbelief in<lb/>
men's motives within due bounds; but even to her<lb/>
(on an occasion not connected with Nostromo, and in a<lb/>
tone which for him was gentle), even to her, he had said<lb/>
once, "Really, it is most unreasonable to demand that a<lb/>




<pb n="45"/>

man should think of other people so much better than<lb/>
he is able to think of himself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And Mrs. Gould had hastened to drop the subject.<lb/>
There were strange rumours of the English doctor.<lb/>
Years ago, in the time of Guzman Bento, he had been<lb/>
mixed up, it was whispered, in a conspiracy which was<lb/>
betrayed and, as people expressed it, drowned in blood.<lb/>
His hair had turned grey, his hairless, seamed face was<lb/>
of a brick-dust colour; the large check pattern of his<lb/>
flannel shirt and his old stained Panama hat were an<lb/>
established defiance to the conventionalities of Sulaco.<lb/>
Had it not been for the immaculate cleanliness of his<lb/>
apparel he might have been taken for one of those<lb/>
shiftless Europeans that are a moral eyesore to the<lb/>
respectability of a foreign colony in almost every exotic<lb/>
part of the world. The young ladies of Sulaco, adorning<lb/>
with clusters of pretty faces the balconies along the<lb/>
Street of the Constitution, when they saw him pass,<lb/>
with his limping gait and bowed head, a short linen<lb/>
jacket drawn on carelessly over the flannel check shirt,<lb/>
would remark to each other, "Here is the Se&ntilde;or doctor<lb/>
going to call on Do&ntilde;a Emilia. He has got his little<lb/>
coat on." The inference was true. Its deeper meaning<lb/>
was hidden from their simple intelligence. Moreover,<lb/>
they expended no store of thought on the doctor. He<lb/>
was old, ugly, learned &mdash; and a little "loco" &mdash; mad, if not<lb/>
a bit of a sorcerer, as the common people suspected him<lb/>
of being. The little white jacket was in reality a concession<lb/>
to Mrs. Gould's humanizing influence. The<lb/>
doctor, with his habit of sceptical, bitter speech, had<lb/>
no other means of showing his profound respect for<lb/>
the character of the woman who was known in the<lb/>
country as the English Se&ntilde;ora. He presented this<lb/>
tribute very seriously indeed; it was no trifle for a man<lb/>
of his habits. Mrs. Gould felt that, too, perfectly.<lb/>


<pb n="46"/>

She would never have thought of imposing upon him<lb/>
this marked show of deference.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She kept her old Spanish house (one of the finest<lb/>
specimens in Sulaco) open for the dispensation of the<lb/>
small graces of existence. She dispensed them with<lb/>
simplicity and charm because she was guided by an<lb/>
alert perception of values. She was highly gifted in the<lb/>
art of human intercourse which consists in delicate<lb/>
shades of self-forgetfulness and in the suggestion of<lb/>
universal comprehension. Charles Gould (the Gould<lb/>
family, established in Costaguana for three generations,<lb/>
always went to England for their education and for<lb/>
their wives) imagined that he had fallen in love with a<lb/>
girl's sound common sense like any other man, but these<lb/>
were not exactly the reasons why, for instance, the<lb/>
whole surveying camp, from the youngest of the young<lb/>
men to their mature chief, should have found occasion<lb/>
to allude to Mrs. Gould's house so frequently amongst<lb/>
the high peaks of the Sierra. She would have protested<lb/>
that she had done nothing for them, with a low<lb/>
laugh and a surprised widening of her grey eyes, had<lb/>
anybody told her how convincingly she was remembered<lb/>
on the edge of the snow-line above Sulaco. But<lb/>
directly, with a little capable air of setting her wits to<lb/>
work, she would have found an explanation. "Of<lb/>
course, it was such a surprise for these boys to find any<lb/>
sort of welcome here. And I suppose they are home-<lb/>
sick. I suppose everybody must be always just a little<lb/>
homesick."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She was always sorry for homesick people.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Born in the country, as his father before him, spare<lb/>
and tall, with a flaming moustache, a neat chin, clear<lb/>
blue eyes, auburn hair, and a thin, fresh, red face,<lb/>
Charles Gould looked like a new arrival from over the<lb/>
sea. His grandfather had fought in the cause of<lb/>


<pb n="47"/>

independence under Bolivar, in that famous English<lb/>
legion which on the battlefield of Carabobo had been<lb/>
saluted by the great Liberator as Saviours of his<lb/>
country. One of Charles Gould's uncles had been the<lb/>
elected President of that very province of Sulaco (then<lb/>
called a State) in the days of Federation, and afterwards<lb/>
had been put up against the wall of a church and<lb/>
shot by the order of the barbarous Unionist general,<lb/>
Guzman Bento. It was the same Guzman Bento who,<lb/>
becoming later Perpetual President, famed for his ruthless<lb/>
and cruel tyranny, readied his apotheosis in the<lb/>
popular legend of a sanguinary land-haunting spectre<lb/>
whose body had been carried off by the devil in person<lb/>
from the brick mausoleum in the nave of the Church of<lb/>
Assumption in Sta. Marta. Thus, at least, the priests<lb/>
explained its disappearance to the barefooted multitude<lb/>
that streamed in, awestruck, to gaze at the hole in<lb/>
the side of the ugly box of bricks before the great altar.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Guzman Bento of cruel memory had put to death<lb/>
great numbers of people besides Charles Gould's uncle;<lb/>
but with a relative martyred in the cause of aristocracy,<lb/>
the Sulaco Oligarchs (this was the phraseology of Guzman<lb/>
Bento's time; now they were called Blancos, and<lb/>
had given up the federal idea), which meant the families<lb/>
of pure Spanish descent, considered Charles as one of<lb/>
themselves. With such a family record, no one could<lb/>
be more of a Costaguanero than Don Carlos Gould; but<lb/>
his aspect was so characteristic that in the talk of<lb/>
common people he was just the Inglez &mdash; the Englishman<lb/>
of Sulaco. He looked more English than a casual<lb/>
tourist, a sort of heretic pilgrim, however, quite unknown<lb/>
in Sulaco. He looked more English than the<lb/>
last arrived batch of young railway engineers, than<lb/>
anybody out of the hunting-field pictures in the numbers<lb/>
of <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> reaching his wife's drawing-room two<lb/>


<pb n="48"/>

months or so after date. It astonished you to hear him<lb/>
talk Spanish (Castillan, as the natives say) or the<lb/>
Indian dialect of the country-people so naturally. His<lb/>
accent had never been English; but there was something<lb/>
so indelible in all these ancestral Goulds &mdash; liberators,<lb/>
explorers, coffee planters, merchants, revolutionists &mdash;<lb/>
of Costaguana, that he, the only representative of the<lb/>
third generation in a continent possessing its own style<lb/>
of horsemanship, went on looking thoroughly English<lb/>
even on horseback. This is not said of him in the<lb/>
mocking spirit of the Llaneros &mdash; men of the great plains<lb/>
&mdash; who think that no one in the world knows how to sit<lb/>
a horse but themselves. Charles Gould, to use the<lb/>
suitably lofty phrase, rode like a centaur. Riding<lb/>
for him was not a special form of exercise; it was a<lb/>
natural faculty, as walking straight is to all men sound<lb/>
of mind and limb; but, all the same, when cantering<lb/>
beside the rutty ox-cart track to the mine he looked in<lb/>
his English clothes and with his imported saddlery as<lb/>
though he had come this moment to Costaguana at his<lb/>
easy swift <hi rend="italic">pasotrote</hi>, straight out of some green meadow<lb/>
at the other side of the world.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His way would lie along the old Spanish road &mdash; the<lb/>
Camino Real of popular speech &mdash; the only remaining<lb/>
vestige of a fact and name left by that royalty old<lb/>
Giorgio Viola hated, and whose very shadow had departed<lb/>
from the land; for the big equestrian statue of<lb/>
Charles IV at the entrance of the Alameda, towering<lb/>
white against the trees, was only known to the folk<lb/>
from the country and to the beggars of the town that<lb/>
slept on the steps around the pedestal, as the Horse<lb/>
of Stone. The other Carlos, turning off to the left<lb/>
with a rapid clatter of hoofs on the disjointed pavement<lb/>
&mdash; Don Carlos Gould, in his English clothes, looked<lb/>
as incongruous, but much more at home than the kingly<lb/>


<pb n="49"/>

cavalier reining in his steed on the pedestal above the<lb/>
sleeping leperos, with his marble arm raised towards<lb/>
the marble rim of a plumed hat.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The weather-stained effigy of the mounted king, with<lb/>
its vague suggestion of a saluting gesture, seemed to<lb/>
present an inscrutable breast to the political changes<lb/>
which had robbed it of its very name; but neither did<lb/>
the other horseman, well known to the people, keen<lb/>
and alive on his well-shaped, slate-coloured beast with<lb/>
a white eye, wear his heart on the sleeve of his English<lb/>
coat. His mind preserved its steady poise as if sheltered<lb/>
in the passionless stability of private and public<lb/>
decencies at home in Europe. He accepted with a like<lb/>
calm the shocking manner in which the Sulaco ladies<lb/>
smothered their faces with pearl powder till they<lb/>
looked like white plaster casts with beautiful living eyes,<lb/>
the peculiar gossip of the town, and the continuous<lb/>
political changes, the constant "saving of the country,"<lb/>
which to his wife seemed a puerile and bloodthirsty<lb/>
game of murder and rapine played with terrible earnestness<lb/>
by depraved children. In the early days of her<lb/>
Costaguana life, the little lady used to clench her hands<lb/>
with exasperation at not being able to take the public<lb/>
affairs of the country as seriously as the incidental<lb/>
atrocity of methods deserved. She saw in them a<lb/>
comedy of na&iuml;ve pretences, but hardly anything genuine<lb/>
except her own appalled indignation. Charles, very<lb/>
quiet and twisting his long moustaches, would decline to<lb/>
discuss them at all. Once, however, he observed to<lb/>
her gently &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "My dear, you seem to forget that I was born here."<lb/>
These few words made her pause as if they had been<lb/>
a sudden revelation. Perhaps the mere fact of being<lb/>
born in the country did make a difference. She had a<lb/>
great confidence in her husband; it had always been<lb/>


<pb n="50"/>

very great. He had struck her imagination from the<lb/>
first by his unsentimentalism, by that very quietude of<lb/>
mind which she had erected in her thought for a sign of<lb/>
perfect competency in the business of living. Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute; Avellanos, their neighbour across the street, a<lb/>
statesman, a poet, a man of culture, who had represented<lb/>
his country at several European Courts (and<lb/>
had suffered untold indignities as a state prisoner in the<lb/>
time of the tyrant Guzman Bento), used to declare in<lb/>
Do&ntilde;a Emilia's drawing-room that Carlos had all the<lb/>
English qualities of character with a truly patriotic<lb/>
heart.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould, raising her eyes to her husband's thin,<lb/>
red and tan face, could not detect the slightest quiver of<lb/>
a feature at what he must have heard said of his<lb/>
patriotism. Perhaps he had just dismounted on his<lb/>
return from the mine; he was English enough to disregard<lb/>
the hottest hours of the day. Basilio, in a livery<lb/>
of white linen and a red sash, had squatted for a moment<lb/>
behind his heels to unstrap the heavy, blunt spurs in<lb/>
the patio; and then the Se&ntilde;or Administrator would go<lb/>
up the staircase into the gallery. Rows of plants in<lb/>
pots, ranged on the balustrade between the pilasters<lb/>
of the arches, screened the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi> with their leaves and<lb/>
flowers from the quadrangle below, whose paved space<lb/>
is the true hearthstone of a South American house,<lb/>
where the quiet hours of domestic life are marked by<lb/>
the shifting of light and shadow on the flagstones.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Se&ntilde;or Avellanos was in the habit of crossing the patio<lb/>
at five o'clock almost every day. Don Jos&eacute; chose to<lb/>
come over at tea-time because the English rite at Do&ntilde;a<lb/>
Emilia's house reminded him of the time he lived in<lb/>
London as Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of<lb/>
St. James. He did not like tea; and, usually, rocking<lb/>
his American chair, his neat little shiny boots crossed on<lb/>


<pb n="51"/>

the foot-rest, he would talk on and on with a sort of<lb/>
complacent virtuosity wonderful in a man of his age,<lb/>
while he held the cup in his hands for a long time. His<lb/>
close-cropped head was perfectly white; his eyes coal-<lb/>
black.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On seeing Charles Gould step into the sala he would<lb/>
nod provisionally and go on to the end of the oratorial<lb/>
period. Only then he would say &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Carlos, my friend, you have ridden from San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
in the heat of the day. Always the true English activity.<lb/>
No? What?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He drank up all the tea at once in one draught. This<lb/>
performance was invariably followed by a slight shudder<lb/>
and a low, involuntary "br-r-r-r," which was not covered<lb/>
by the hasty exclamation, "Excellent!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Then giving up the empty cup into his young friend's<lb/>
hand, extended with a smile, he continued to expatiate<lb/>
upon the patriotic nature of the San Tom&eacute; mine for the<lb/>
simple pleasure of talking fluently, it seemed, while his<lb/>
reclining body jerked backwards and forwards in a<lb/>
rocking-chair of the sort exported from the United<lb/>
States. The ceiling of the largest drawing-room of the<lb/>
Casa Gould extended its white level far above his head.<lb/>
The loftiness dwarfed the mixture of heavy, straight-<lb/>
backed Spanish chairs of brown wood with leathern<lb/>
seats, and European furniture, low, and cushioned all<lb/>
over, like squat little monsters gorged to bursting with<lb/>
steel springs and horsehair. There were knick-knacks<lb/>
on little tables, mirrors let into the wall above marble<lb/>
consoles, square spaces of carpet under the two groups<lb/>
of armchairs, each presided over by a deep sofa; smaller<lb/>
rugs scattered all over the floor of red tiles; three windows<lb/>
from the ceiling down to the ground, opening on a<lb/>
balcony, and flanked by the perpendicular folds of the<lb/>
dark hangings. The stateliness of ancient days lingered<lb/>


<pb n="52"/>

between the four high, smooth walls, tinted a delicate<lb/>
primrose-colour; and Mrs. Gould, with her little head<lb/>
and shining coils of hair, sitting in a cloud of muslin and<lb/>
lace before a slender mahogany table, resembled a fairy<lb/>
posed lightly before dainty philtres dispensed out of<lb/>
vessels of silver and porcelain.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould knew the history of the San Tom&eacute; mine.<lb/>
Worked in the early days mostly by means of lashes on<lb/>
the backs of slaves, its yield had been paid for in its own<lb/>
weight of human bones. Whole tribes of Indians had<lb/>
perished in the exploitation; and then the mine was<lb/>
abandoned, since with this primitive method it had<lb/>
ceased to make a profitable return, no matter how many<lb/>
corpses were thrown into its maw. Then it became forgotten.<lb/>
It was rediscovered after the War of Independence.<lb/>
An English company obtained the right to<lb/>
work it, and found so rich a vein that neither the exactions<lb/>
of successive governments, nor the periodical<lb/>
raids of recruiting officers upon the population of paid<lb/>
miners they had created, could discourage their perseverance.<lb/>
But in the end, during the long turmoil of<lb/>
pronunciamentos that followed the death of the famous<lb/>
Guzman Bento, the native miners, incited to revolt by<lb/>
the emissaries sent out from the capital, had risen upon<lb/>
their English chiefs and murdered them to a man. The<lb/>
decree of confiscation which appeared immediately<lb/>
afterwards in the <hi rend="italic">Diario Official</hi>, published in Sta.<lb/>
Marta, began with the words: "Justly incensed at the<lb/>
grinding oppression of foreigners, actuated by sordid<lb/>
motives of gain rather than by love for a country where<lb/>
they come impoverished to seek their fortunes, the<lb/>
mining population of San Tom&eacute;, etc. . . ." and<lb/>
ended with the declaration: "The chief of the State has<lb/>
resolved to exercise to the full his power of clemency.<lb/>
The mine, which by every law, international, human,<lb/>


<pb n="53"/>

and divine, reverts now to the Government as national<lb/>
property, shall remain closed till the sword drawn for<lb/>
the sacred defence of liberal principles has accomplished<lb/>
its mission of securing the happiness of our beloved<lb/>
country."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And for many years this was the last of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mine. What advantage that Government had expected<lb/>
from the spoliation, it is impossible to tell now.<lb/>
Costaguana was made with difficulty to pay a beggarly<lb/>
money compensation to the families of the victims, and<lb/>
then the matter dropped out of diplomatic despatches.<lb/>
But afterwards another Government bethought itself of<lb/>
that valuable asset. It was an ordinary Costaguana<lb/>
Government &mdash; the fourth in six years &mdash; but it judged of<lb/>
its opportunities sanely. It remembered the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mine with a secret conviction of its worthlessness in<lb/>
their own hands, but with an ingenious insight into the<lb/>
various uses a silver mine can be put to, apart from the<lb/>
sordid process of extracting the metal from under the<lb/>
ground. The father of Charles Gould, for a long<lb/>
time one of the most wealthy merchants of Costaguana,<lb/>
had already lost a considerable part of his fortune in<lb/>
forced loans to the successive Governments. He was<lb/>
a man of calm judgment, who never dreamed of pressing<lb/>
his claims; and when, suddenly, the perpetual concession<lb/>
of the San Tom&eacute; mine was offered to him in full<lb/>
settlement, his alarm became extreme. He was versed<lb/>
in the ways of Governments. Indeed, the intention of<lb/>
this affair, though no doubt deeply meditated in the<lb/>
closet, lay open on the surface of the document presented<lb/>
urgently for his signature. The third and most<lb/>
important clause stipulated that the concession-holder<lb/>
should pay at once to the Government five years'<lb/>
royalties on the estimated output of the mine.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mr. Gould, senior, defended himself from this fatal<lb/>


<pb n="54"/>

favour with many arguments and entreaties, but without<lb/>
success. He knew nothing of mining; he had no<lb/>
means to put his concession on the European market;<lb/>
the mine as a working concern did not exist. The<lb/>
buildings had been burnt down, the mining plant had<lb/>
been destroyed, the mining population had disappeared<lb/>
from the neighbourhood years and years ago; the very<lb/>
road had vanished under a flood of tropical vegetation<lb/>
as effectually as if swallowed by the sea; and the main<lb/>
gallery had fallen in within a hundred yards from the<lb/>
entrance. It was no longer an abandoned mine; it was<lb/>
a wild, inaccessible, and rocky gorge of the Sierra, where<lb/>
vestiges of charred timber, some heaps of smashed<lb/>
bricks, and a few shapeless pieces of rusty iron could<lb/>
have been found under the matted mass of thorny<lb/>
creepers covering the ground. Mr. Gould, senior, did<lb/>
not desire the perpetual possession of that desolate<lb/>
locality; in fact, the mere vision of it arising before his<lb/>
mind in the still watches of the night had the power to<lb/>
exasperate him into hours of hot and agitated insomnia.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It so happened, however, that the Finance Minister of<lb/>
the time was a man to whom, in years gone by, Mr.<lb/>
Gould had, unfortunately, declined to grant some small<lb/>
pecuniary assistance, basing his refusal on the ground<lb/>
that the applicant was a notorious gambler and cheat,<lb/>
besides being more than half suspected of a robbery<lb/>
with violence on a wealthy ranchero in a remote country<lb/>
district, where he was actually exercising the function<lb/>
of a judge. Now, after reaching his exalted position,<lb/>
that politician had proclaimed his intention to repay<lb/>
evil with good to Se&ntilde;or Gould &mdash; the poor man. He<lb/>
affirmed and reaffirmed this resolution in the drawing-<lb/>
rooms of Sta. Marta, in a soft and implacable voice, and<lb/>
with such malicious glances that Mr. Gould's best<lb/>
friends advised him earnestly to attempt no bribery<lb/>


<pb n="55"/>

to get the matter dropped. It would have been useless.<lb/>
Indeed, it would not have been a very safe proceeding.<lb/>
Such was also the opinion of a stout, loud-voiced lady of<lb/>
French extraction, the daughter, she said, of an officer<lb/>
of high rank (<hi rend="italic">officier sup&eacute;rieur de l'arm&eacute;e</hi>), who was<lb/>
accommodated with lodgings within the walls of a<lb/>
secularized convent next door to the Ministry of<lb/>
Finance. That florid person, when approached on behalf<lb/>
of Mr. Gould in a proper manner, and with a<lb/>
suitable present, shook her head despondently. She<lb/>
was good-natured, and her despondency was genuine.<lb/>
She imagined she could not take money in consideration<lb/>
of something she could not accomplish. The friend of<lb/>
Mr. Gould, charged with the delicate mission, used to<lb/>
say afterwards that she was the only honest person<lb/>
closely or remotely connected with the Government<lb/>
he had ever met. "No go," she had said with a cavalier,<lb/>
husky intonation which was natural to her, and using<lb/>
turns of expression more suitable to a child of parents<lb/>
unknown than to the orphaned daughter of a general<lb/>
officer. "No; it's no go. <hi rend="italic">Pas moyen, mon gar&ccedil;on.<lb/>
C'est dommage, tout de m&ecirc;me. Ah! zut! Je ne vole<lb/>
pas mon monde. Je ne suis pas ministre &mdash; moi! Vous<lb/>
pouvez emporter votre petit sac</hi>."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     For a moment, biting her carmine lip, she deplored<lb/>
inwardly the tyranny of the rigid principles governing<lb/>
the sale of her influence in high places. Then, significantly,<lb/>
and with a touch of impatience, <hi rend="italic">"Allez</hi>," she<lb/>
added, <hi rend="italic">"et dites bien &agrave; votre bonhomme &mdash;<lb/>
entendez-vous? &mdash;<lb/>
qu'il faut avaler la pilule</hi>."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     After such a warning there was nothing for it but to<lb/>
sign and pay. Mr. Gould had swallowed the pill, and<lb/>
it was as though it had been compounded of some subtle<lb/>
poison that acted directly on his brain. He became at<lb/>
once mine-ridden, and as he was well read in light<lb/>


<pb n="56"/>

literature it took to his mind the form of the Old Man<lb/>
of the Sea fastened upon his shoulders. He also began<lb/>
to dream of vampires. Mr. Gould exaggerated to himself<lb/>
the disadvantages of his new position, because he<lb/>
viewed it emotionally. His position in Costaguana<lb/>
was no worse than before. But man is a desperately<lb/>
conservative creature, and the extravagant novelty of<lb/>
this outrage upon his purse distressed his sensibilities.<lb/>
Everybody around him was being robbed by the<lb/>
grotesque and murderous bands that played their game<lb/>
of governments and revolutions after the death of<lb/>
Guzman Bento. His experience had taught him that,<lb/>
however short the plunder might fall of their legitimate<lb/>
expectations, no gang in possession of the Presidential<lb/>
Palace would be so incompetent as to suffer itself to be<lb/>
baffled by the want of a pretext. The first casual<lb/>
colonel of the barefooted army of scarecrows that came<lb/>
along was able to expose with force and precision to any<lb/>
mere civilian his titles to a sum of 10,000 dollars; the<lb/>
while his hope would be immutably fixed upon a<lb/>
gratuity, at any rate, of no less than a thousand. Mr.<lb/>
Gould knew that very well, and, armed with resignation,<lb/>
had waited for better times. But to be robbed<lb/>
under the forms of legality and business was intolerable<lb/>
to his imagination. Mr. Gould, the father, had one<lb/>
fault in his sagacious and honourable character: he<lb/>
attached too much importance to form. It is a failing<lb/>
common to mankind, whose views are tinged by prejudices.<lb/>
There was for him in that affair a malignancy of<lb/>
perverted justice which, by means of a moral shock,<lb/>
attacked his vigorous physique. "It will end by<lb/>
killing me," he used to affirm many times a day. And,<lb/>
in fact, since that time he began to suffer from fever,<lb/>
from liver pains, and mostly from a worrying inability<lb/>
to think of anything else. The Finance Minister could<lb/>


<pb n="57"/>

have formed no conception of the profound subtlety of<lb/>
his revenge. Even Mr. Gould's letters to his fourteen-<lb/>
year-old boy Charles, then away in England for his<lb/>
education, came at last to talk of practically nothing but<lb/>
the mine. He groaned over the injustice, the persecution,<lb/>
the outrage of that mine; he occupied whole pages<lb/>
in the exposition of the fatal consequences attaching to<lb/>
the possession of that mine from every point of view,<lb/>
with every dismal inference, with words of horror at the<lb/>
apparently eternal character of that curse. For the<lb/>
Concession had been granted to him and his descendants<lb/>
for ever. He implored his son never to return to<lb/>
Costaguana, never to claim any part of his inheritance<lb/>
there, because it was tainted by the infamous Concession;<lb/>
never to touch it, never to approach it, to forget<lb/>
that America existed, and pursue a mercantile<lb/>
career in Europe. And each letter ended with bitter<lb/>
self-reproaches for having stayed too long in that<lb/>
cavern of thieves, intriguers, and brigands.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     To be told repeatedly that one's future is blighted<lb/>
because of the possession of a silver mine is not, at the<lb/>
age of fourteen, a matter of prime importance as to its<lb/>
main statement; but in its form it is calculated to excite<lb/>
a certain amount of wonder and attention. In course<lb/>
of time the boy, at first only puzzled by the angry<lb/>
jeremiads, but rather sorry for his dad, began to turn<lb/>
the matter over in his mind in such moments as he<lb/>
could spare from play and study. In about a year he<lb/>
had evolved from the lecture of the letters a definite<lb/>
conviction that there was a silver mine in the Sulaco<lb/>
province of the Republic of Costaguana, where poor<lb/>
Uncle Harry had been shot by soldiers a great many<lb/>
years before. There was also connected closely with<lb/>
that mine a thing called the "iniquitous Gould Concession,"<lb/>
apparently written on a paper which his<lb/>


<pb n="58"/>

father desired ardently to "tear and fling into the<lb/>
faces" of presidents, members of judicature, and<lb/>
ministers of State. And this desire persisted, though<lb/>
the names of these people, he noticed, seldom remained<lb/>
the same for a whole year together. This desire (since<lb/>
the thing was iniquitous) seemed quite natural to the<lb/>
boy, though why the affair was iniquitous he did not<lb/>
know. Afterwards, with advancing wisdom, he managed<lb/>
to clear the plain truth of the business from the<lb/>
fantastic intrusions of the Old Man of the Sea, vampires,<lb/>
and ghouls, which had lent to his father's correspondence<lb/>
the flavour of a gruesome Arabian Nights tale.<lb/>
In the end, the growing youth attained to as close an<lb/>
intimacy with the San Tom&eacute; mine as the old man who<lb/>
wrote these plaintive and enraged letters on the other<lb/>
side of the sea. He had been made several times already<lb/>
to pay heavy fines for neglecting to work the<lb/>
mine, he reported, besides other sums extracted from<lb/>
him on account of future royalties, on the ground that a<lb/>
man with such a valuable concession in his pocket could<lb/>
not refuse his financial assistance to the Government of<lb/>
the Republic. The last of his fortune was passing<lb/>
away from him against worthless receipts, he wrote, in a<lb/>
rage, whilst he was being pointed out as an individual<lb/>
who had known how to secure enormous advantages<lb/>
from the necessities of his country. And the young<lb/>
man in Europe grew more and more interested in that<lb/>
thing which could provoke such a tumult of words and<lb/>
passion.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He thought of it every day; but he thought of it<lb/>
without bitterness. It might have been an unfortunate<lb/>
affair for his poor dad, and the whole story threw a<lb/>
queer light upon the social and political life of Costaguana.<lb/>
The view he took of it was sympathetic to his<lb/>
father, yet calm and reflective. His personal feelings<lb/>


<pb n="59"/>

had not been outraged, and it is difficult to resent with<lb/>
proper and durable indignation the physical or mental<lb/>
anguish of another organism, even if that other organism<lb/>
is one's own father. By the time he was twenty<lb/>
Charles Gould had, in his turn, fallen under the spell<lb/>
of the San Tom&eacute; mine. But it was another form of<lb/>
enchantment, more suitable to his youth, into whose<lb/>
magic formula there entered hope, vigour, and self-<lb/>
confidence, instead of weary indignation and despair.<lb/>
Left after he was twenty to his own guidance (except<lb/>
for the severe injunction not to return to Costaguana),<lb/>
he had pursued his studies in Belgium and France with<lb/>
the idea of qualifying for a mining engineer. But this<lb/>
scientific aspect of his labours remained vague and<lb/>
imperfect in his mind. Mines had acquired for him a<lb/>
dramatic interest. He studied their peculiarities from<lb/>
a personal point of view, too, as one would study the<lb/>
varied characters of men.   He visited them as one<lb/>
goes with curiosity to call upon remarkable persons.<lb/>
He visited mines in Germany, in Spain, in Cornwall.<lb/>
Abandoned workings had for him strong fascination.<lb/>
Their desolation appealed to him like the sight of human<lb/>
misery, whose causes are varied and profound.<lb/>
They might have been worthless, but also they might<lb/>
have been misunderstood. His future wife was the<lb/>
first, and perhaps the only person to detect this secret<lb/>
mood which governed the profoundly sensible, almost<lb/>
voiceless attitude of this man towards the world of<lb/>
material things. And at once her delight in him, lingering<lb/>
with half-open wings like those birds that cannot rise<lb/>
easily from a flat level, found a pinnacle from which to<lb/>
soar up into the skies.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     They had become acquainted in Italy, where the<lb/>
future Mrs. Gould was staying with an old and pale<lb/>
aunt who, years before, had married a middle-aged,<lb/>


<pb n="60"/>

impoverished Italian marquis. She now mourned that<lb/>
man, who had known how to give up his life to the<lb/>
independence and unity of his country, who had known<lb/>
how to be as enthusiastic in his generosity as the youngest<lb/>
of those who fell for that very cause of which old<lb/>
Giorgio Viola was a drifting relic, as a broken spar is<lb/>
suffered to float away disregarded after a naval victory.<lb/>
The Marchesa led a still, whispering existence, nun-like<lb/>
in her black robes and a white band over the forehead,<lb/>
in a corner of the first floor of an ancient and ruinous<lb/>
palace, whose big, empty halls downstairs sheltered<lb/>
under their painted ceilings the harvests, the fowls, and<lb/>
even the cattle, together with the whole family of the<lb/>
tenant farmer.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The two young people had met in Lucca. After that<lb/>
meeting Charles Gould visited no mines, though they<lb/>
went together in a carriage, once, to see some marble<lb/>
quarries, where the work resembled mining in so far<lb/>
that it also was the tearing of the raw material of<lb/>
treasure from the earth. Charles Gould did not open<lb/>
his heart to her in any set speeches. He simply went<lb/>
on acting and thinking in her sight. This is the true<lb/>
method of sincerity. One of his frequent remarks<lb/>
was, "I think sometimes that poor father takes a<lb/>
wrong view of that San Tom&eacute; business." And they<lb/>
discussed that opinion long and earnestly, as if they<lb/>
could influence a mind across half the globe; but in<lb/>
reality they discussed it because the sentiment of love<lb/>
can enter into any subject and live ardently in remote<lb/>
phrases. For this natural reason these discussions were<lb/>
precious to Mrs. Gould in her engaged state. Charles<lb/>
feared that Mr. Gould, senior, was wasting his strength<lb/>
and making himself ill by his efforts to get rid of the<lb/>
Concession. "I fancy that this is not the kind of<lb/>
handling it requires," he mused aloud, as if to himself.<lb/>


<pb n="61"/>

And when she wondered frankly that a man of character<lb/>
should devote his energies to plotting and intrigues,<lb/>
Charles would remark, with a gentle concern that<lb/>
understood her wonder, "You must not forget that he<lb/>
was born there."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She would set her quick mind to work upon that, and<lb/>
then make the inconsequent retort, which he accepted<lb/>
as perfectly sagacious, because, in fact, it was so &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well, and you? You were born there, too."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He knew his answer.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That's different. I've been away ten years. Dad<lb/>
never had such a long spell; and it was more than thirty<lb/>
years ago."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She was the first person to whom he opened his lips<lb/>
after receiving the news of his father's death.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It has killed him!" he said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He had walked straight out of town with the news,<lb/>
straight out before him in the noonday sun on the white<lb/>
road, and his feet had brought him face to face with<lb/>
her in the hall of the ruined palazzo, a room magnificent<lb/>
and naked, with here and there a long strip of<lb/>
damask, black with damp and age, hanging down on a<lb/>
bare panel of the wall. It was furnished with exactly<lb/>
one gilt armchair, with a broken back, and an octagon<lb/>
columnar stand bearing a heavy marble vase ornamented<lb/>
with sculptured masks and garlands of flowers,<lb/>
and cracked from top to bottom. Charles Gould was<lb/>
dusty with the white dust of the road lying on his boots,<lb/>
on his shoulders, on his cap with two peaks. Water<lb/>
dripped from under it all over his face, and he grasped a<lb/>
thick oaken cudgel in his bare right hand.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She went very pale under the roses of her big straw<lb/>
hat, gloved, swinging a clear sunshade, caught just as<lb/>
she was going out to meet him at the bottom of the hill,<lb/>
where three poplars stand near the wall of a vineyard.<lb/>


<pb n="62"/>

</p>

<p>     "It has killed him!" he repeated. "He ought to<lb/>
have had many years yet. We are a long-lived family."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She was too startled to say anything; he was contemplating<lb/>
with a penetrating and motionless stare the<lb/>
cracked marble urn as though he had resolved to fix its<lb/>
shape for ever in his memory. It was only when, turning<lb/>
suddenly to her, he blurted out twice, "I've come<lb/>
to you &mdash; I've come straight to you &mdash;," without<lb/>
being able to finish his phrase, that the great pitifulness<lb/>
of that lonely and tormented death in Costaguana came<lb/>
to her with the full force of its misery. He caught hold<lb/>
of her hand, raised it to his lips, and at that she dropped<lb/>
her parasol to pat him on the cheek, murmured "Poor<lb/>
boy," and began to dry her eyes under the downward<lb/>
curve of her hat-brim, very small in her simple, white<lb/>
frock, almost like a lost child crying in the degraded<lb/>
grandeur of the noble hall, while he stood by her, again<lb/>
perfectly motionless in the contemplation of the marble<lb/>
urn.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Afterwards they went out for a long walk, which was<lb/>
silent till he exclaimed suddenly &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. But if he had only grappled with it in a<lb/>
proper way!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And then they stopped. Everywhere there were<lb/>
long shadows lying on the hills, on the roads, on the<lb/>
enclosed fields of olive trees; the shadows of poplars, of<lb/>
wide chestnuts, of farm buildings, of stone walls; and in<lb/>
mid-air the sound of a bell, thin and alert, was like the<lb/>
throbbing pulse of the sunset glow. Her lips were<lb/>
slightly parted as though in surprise that he should not<lb/>
be looking at her with his usual expression. His usual<lb/>
expression was unconditionally approving and attentive.<lb/>
He was in his talks with her the most anxious and<lb/>
deferential of dictators, an attitude that pleased her<lb/>
immensely. It affirmed her power without detracting<lb/>


<pb n="63"/>

from his dignity. That slight girl, with her little feet,<lb/>
little hands, little face attractively overweighted by<lb/>
great coils of hair; with a rather large mouth, whose<lb/>
mere parting seemed to breathe upon you the fragrance<lb/>
of frankness and generosity, had the fastidious soul of<lb/>
an experienced woman. She was, before all things and<lb/>
all flatteries, careful of her pride in the object of her<lb/>
choice. But now he was actually not looking at her at<lb/>
all; and his expression was tense and irrational, as is<lb/>
natural in a man who elects to stare at nothing past a<lb/>
young girl's head.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well, yes. It was iniquitous. They corrupted<lb/>
him thoroughly, the poor old boy. Oh! why wouldn't<lb/>
he let me go back to him? But now I shall know how<lb/>
to grapple with this."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     After pronouncing these words with immense assurance,<lb/>
he glanced down at her, and at once fell a prey<lb/>
to distress, incertitude, and fear.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The only thing he wanted to know now, he said, was<lb/>
whether she did love him enough &mdash; whether she would<lb/>
have the courage to go with him so far away? He put<lb/>
these questions to her in a voice that trembled with<lb/>
anxiety &mdash; for he was a determined man.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She did. She would. And immediately the future<lb/>
hostess of all the Europeans in Sulaco had the physical<lb/>
experience of the earth falling away from under her. It<lb/>
vanished completely, even to the very sound of the bell.<lb/>
When her feet touched the ground again, the bell was<lb/>
still ringing in the valley; she put her hands up to her<lb/>
hair, breathing quickly, and glanced up and down the<lb/>
stony lane. It was reassuringly empty. Meantime,<lb/>
Charles, stepping with one foot into a dry and dusty<lb/>
ditch, picked up the open parasol, which had bounded<lb/>
away from them with a martial sound of drum taps.<lb/>
He handed it to her soberly, a little crestfallen.<lb/>


<pb n="64"/>

</p>

<p>     They turned back, and after she had slipped her hand<lb/>
on his arm, the first words he pronounced were &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It's lucky that we shall be able to settle in a coast<lb/>
town. You've heard its name. It is Sulaco. I am so<lb/>
glad poor father did get that house. He bought a big<lb/>
house there years ago, in order that there should always<lb/>
be a Casa Gould in the principal town of what used to be<lb/>
called the Occidental Province. I lived there once, as a<lb/>
small boy, with my dear mother, for a whole year, while<lb/>
poor father was away in the United States on business.<lb/>
You shall be the new mistress of the Casa Gould."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And later, in the inhabited corner of the Palazzo<lb/>
above the vineyards, the marble hills, the pines and<lb/>
olives of Lucca, he also said &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The name of Gould has been always highly respected<lb/>
in Sulaco. My uncle Harry was chief of the<lb/>
State for some time, and has left a great name amongst<lb/>
the first families. By this I mean the pure Creole<lb/>
families, who take no part in the miserable farce of<lb/>
governments. Uncle Harry was no adventurer. In<lb/>
Costaguana we Goulds are no adventurers. He was of<lb/>
the country, and he loved it, but he remained essentially<lb/>
an Englishman in his ideas. He made use of the<lb/>
political cry of his time. It was Federation. But he<lb/>
was no politician. He simply stood up for social order<lb/>
out of pure love for rational liberty and from his hate of<lb/>
oppression. There was no nonsense about him. He<lb/>
went to work in his own way because it seemed right,<lb/>
just as I feel I must lay hold of that mine."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In such words he talked to her because his memory<lb/>
was very full of the country of his childhood, his heart<lb/>
of his life with that girl, and his mind of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
Concession. He added that he would have to leave her<lb/>
for a few days to find an American, a man from San<lb/>
Francisco, who was still somewhere in Europe. A few<lb/>


<pb n="65"/>

months before he had made his acquaintance in an old<lb/>
historic German town, situated in a mining district.<lb/>
The American had his womankind with him, but seemed<lb/>
lonely while they were sketching all day long the old<lb/>
doorways and the turreted corners of the medi&aelig;val<lb/>
houses. Charles Gould had with him the inseparable<lb/>
companionship of the mine. The other man was<lb/>
interested in mining enterprises, knew something of<lb/>
Costaguana, and was no stranger to the name of Gould.<lb/>
They had talked together with some intimacy which was<lb/>
made possible by the difference of their ages. Charles<lb/>
wanted now to find that capitalist of shrewd mind and<lb/>
accessible character. His father's fortune in Costaguana,<lb/>
which he had supposed to be still considerable,<lb/>
seemed to have melted in the rascally crucible of<lb/>
revolutions. Apart from some ten thousand pounds<lb/>
deposited in England, there appeared to be nothing<lb/>
left except the house in Sulaco, a vague right of forest<lb/>
exploitation in a remote and savage district, and the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; Concession, which had attended his poor<lb/>
father to the very brink of the grave.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He explained those things. It was late when they<lb/>
parted. She had never before given him such a<lb/>
fascinating vision of herself. All the eagerness of youth<lb/>
for a strange life, for great distances, for a future in<lb/>
which there was an air of adventure, of combat &mdash; a<lb/>
subtle thought of redress and conquest, had filled her<lb/>
with an intense excitement, which she returned to the<lb/>
giver with a more open and exquisite display of tenderness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    He left her to walk down the hill, and directly he<lb/>
found himself alone he became sober. That irreparable<lb/>
change a death makes in the course of our daily thoughts<lb/>
can be felt in a vague and poignant discomfort of mind.<lb/>
It hurt Charles Gould to feel that never more, by no<lb/>


<pb n="66"/>

effort of will, would he be able to think of his father in<lb/>
the same way he used to think of him when the poor<lb/>
man was alive. His breathing image was no longer<lb/>
in his power. This consideration, closely affecting his<lb/>
own identity, filled his breast with a mournful and angry<lb/>
desire for action. In this his instinct was unerring.<lb/>
Action is consolatory. It is the enemy of thought and<lb/>
the friend of flattering illusions. Only in the conduct<lb/>
of our action can we find the sense of mastery over the<lb/>
Fates. For his action, the mine was obviously the only<lb/>
field. It was imperative sometimes to know how to<lb/>
disobey the solemn wishes of the dead. He resolved<lb/>
firmly to make his disobedience as thorough (by way<lb/>
of atonement) as it well could be. The mine had been<lb/>
the cause of an absurd moral disaster; its working must<lb/>
be made a serious and moral success. He owed it to<lb/>
the dead man's memory. Such were the &mdash; properly<lb/>
speaking &mdash; emotions of Charles Gould. His thoughts<lb/>
ran upon the means of raising a large amount of capital<lb/>
in San Francisco or elsewhere; and incidentally there<lb/>
occurred to him also the general reflection that the<lb/>
counsel of the departed must be an unsound guide.<lb/>
Not one of them could be aware beforehand what<lb/>
enormous changes the death of any given individual<lb/>
may produce in the very aspect of the world.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The latest phase in the history of the mine Mrs.<lb/>
Gould knew from personal experience. It was in<lb/>
essence the history of her married life. The mantle of<lb/>
the Goulds' hereditary position in Sulaco had descended<lb/>
amply upon her little person; but she would not allow<lb/>
the peculiarities of the strange garment to weigh down<lb/>
the vivacity of her character, which was the sign of no<lb/>
mere mechanical sprightliness, but of an eager intelligence.<lb/>
It must not be supposed that Mrs. Gould's<lb/>
mind was masculine. A woman with a masculine mind<lb/>


<pb n="67"/>

is not a being of superior efficiency; she is simply a<lb/>
phenomenon of imperfect differentiation &mdash; interestingly<lb/>
barren and without importance. Do&ntilde;a Emilia's intelligence<lb/>
being feminine led her to achieve the conquest<lb/>
of Sulaco, simply by lighting the way for her unselfishness<lb/>
and sympathy. She could converse charmingly,<lb/>
but she was not talkative. The wisdom of the<lb/>
heart having no concern with the erection or demolition<lb/>
of theories any more than with the defence of prejudices,<lb/>
has no random words at its command. The<lb/>
words it pronounces have the value of acts of integrity,<lb/>
tolerance, and compassion. A woman's true tenderness,<lb/>
like the true virility of man, is expressed in action<lb/>
of a conquering kind. The ladies of Sulaco adored<lb/>
Mrs. Gould. "They still look upon me as something of<lb/>
a monster," Mrs. Gould had said pleasantly to one of<lb/>
the three gentlemen from San Francisco she had to<lb/>
entertain in her new Sulaco house just about a year<lb/>
after her marriage.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     They were her first visitors from abroad, and they<lb/>
had come to look at the San Tom&eacute; mine. She jested<lb/>
most agreeably, they thought; and Charles Gould, besides<lb/>
knowing thoroughly what he was about, had<lb/>
shown himself a real hustler. These facts caused them<lb/>
to be well disposed towards his wife. An unmistakable<lb/>
enthusiasm, pointed by a slight flavour of irony, made<lb/>
her talk of the mine absolutely fascinating to her<lb/>
visitors, and provoked them to grave and indulgent<lb/>
smiles in which there was a good deal of deference.<lb/>
Perhaps had they known how much she was inspired<lb/>
by an idealistic view of success they would have been<lb/>
amazed at the state of her mind as the Spanish-American<lb/>
ladies had been amazed at the tireless activity of<lb/>
her body. She would &mdash; in her own words &mdash; have been<lb/>
for them "something of a monster." However, the<lb/>


<pb n="68"/>

Goulds were in essentials a reticent couple, and their<lb/>
guests departed without the suspicion of any other purpose<lb/>
but simple profit in the working of a silver mine.<lb/>
Mrs. Gould had out her own carriage, with two white<lb/>
mules, to drive them down to the harbour, whence the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Ceres</hi> was to carry them off into the Olympus of plutocrats.<lb/>
Captain Mitchell had snatched at the occasion<lb/>
of leave-taking to remark to Mrs. Gould, in a low, confidential<lb/>
mutter, "This marks an epoch."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould loved the patio of her Spanish house. A<lb/>
broad flight of stone steps was overlooked silently from<lb/>
a niche in the wall by a Madonna in blue robes with the<lb/>
crowned child sitting on her arm. Subdued voices<lb/>
ascended in the early mornings from the paved well<lb/>
of the quadrangle, with the stamping of horses and<lb/>
mules led out in pairs to drink at the cistern. A tangle<lb/>
of slender bamboo stems drooped its narrow, blade-like<lb/>
leaves over the square pool of water, and the fat coachman<lb/>
sat muffled up on the edge, holding lazily the ends<lb/>
of halters in his hand. Barefooted servants passed to<lb/>
and fro, issuing from dark, low doorways below; two<lb/>
laundry girls with baskets of washed linen; the baker<lb/>
with the tray of bread made for the day; Leonarda &mdash;<lb/>
her own camerista &mdash; bearing high up, swung from her<lb/>
hand raised above her raven black head, a bunch of<lb/>
starched under-skirts dazzlingly white in the slant of<lb/>
sunshine. Then the old porter would hobble in, sweeping<lb/>
the flagstones, and the house was ready for the day.<lb/>
All the lofty rooms on three sides of the quadrangle<lb/>
opened into each other and into the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>, with its<lb/>
wrought-iron railings and a border of flowers, whence,<lb/>
like the lady of the medi&aelig;val castle, she could witness<lb/>
from above all the departures and arrivals of the Casa,<lb/>
to which the sonorous arched gateway lent an air of<lb/>
stately importance.<lb/>


<pb n="69"/>

</p>

<p>     She had watched her carriage roll away with the<lb/>
three guests from the north. She smiled. Their three<lb/>
arms went up simultaneously to their three hats. Captain<lb/>
Mitchell, the fourth, in attendance, had already<lb/>
begun a pompous discourse. Then she lingered. She<lb/>
lingered, approaching her face to the clusters of flowers<lb/>
here and there as if to give time to her thoughts to<lb/>
catch up with her slow footsteps along the straight<lb/>
vista of the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A fringed Indian hammock from Aroa, gay with<lb/>
coloured featherwork, had been swung judiciously in a<lb/>
corner that caught the early sun; for the mornings are<lb/>
cool in Sulaco. The cluster of <hi rend="italic">flor de noche buena</hi><lb/>
blazed in great masses before the open glass doors of the<lb/>
reception rooms. A big green parrot, brilliant like an<lb/>
emerald in a cage that flashed like gold, screamed out<lb/>
ferociously, "Viva Costaguana!" then called twice<lb/>
mellifluously, "Leonarda! Leonarda!" in imitation of<lb/>
Mrs. Gould's voice, and suddenly took refuge in immobility<lb/>
and silence. Mrs. Gould reached the end of<lb/>
the gallery and put her head through the door of her<lb/>
husband's room.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould, with one foot on a low wooden stool,<lb/>
was already strapping his spurs. He wanted to hurry<lb/>
back to the mine. Mrs. Gould, without coming in,<lb/>
glanced about the room. One tall, broad bookcase,<lb/>
with glass doors, was full of books; but in the other,<lb/>
without shelves, and lined with red baize, were arranged<lb/>
firearms: Winchester carbines, revolvers, a couple of<lb/>
shot-guns, and even two pairs of double-barrelled holster<lb/>
pistols. Between them, by itself, upon a strip of<lb/>
scarlet velvet, hung an old cavalry sabre, once the<lb/>
property of Don Enrique Gould, the hero of the Occidental<lb/>
Province, presented by Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos, the<lb/>
hereditary friend of the family.<lb/>


<pb n="70"/>

</p>

<p>     Otherwise, the plastered white walls were completely<lb/>
bare, except for a water-colour sketch of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mountain &mdash; the work of Do&ntilde;a Emilia herself. In the<lb/>
middle of the red-tiled floor stood two long tables<lb/>
littered with plans and papers, a few chairs, and a glass<lb/>
show-case containing specimens of ore from the mine.<lb/>
Mrs. Gould, looking at all these things in turn, wondered<lb/>
aloud why the talk of these wealthy and enterprising<lb/>
men discussing the prospects, the working, and<lb/>
the safety of the mine rendered her so impatient and uneasy,whereas<lb/>
she could talk of the mine by the hour with<lb/>
her husband with unwearied interest and satisfaction.<lb/>
And dropping her eyelids expressively, she added &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> feel about it, Charley?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Then, surprised at her husband's silence, she raised<lb/>
her eyes, opened wide, as pretty as pale flowers. He<lb/>
had done with the spurs, and, twisting his moustache<lb/>
with both hands, horizontally, he contemplated her<lb/>
from the height of his long legs with a visible appreciation<lb/>
of her appearance. The consciousness of being<lb/>
thus contemplated pleased Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "They are considerable men," he said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I know. But have you listened to their conversation?<lb/>
They don't seem to have understood anything<lb/>
they have seen here."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "They have seen the mine. They have understood<lb/>
that to some purpose," Charles Gould interjected, in<lb/>
defence of the visitors; and then his wife mentioned the<lb/>
name of the most considerable of the three. He was<lb/>
considerable in finance and in industry. His name was<lb/>
familiar to many millions of people. He was so considerable<lb/>
that he would never have travelled so far<lb/>
away from the centre of his activity if the doctors had<lb/>
not insisted, with veiled menaces, on his taking a long<lb/>
holiday.<lb/>


<pb n="71"/>

</p>

<p>     "Mr. Holroyd's sense of religion," Mrs. Gould pursued,<lb/>
"was shocked and disgusted at the tawdriness of<lb/>
the dressed-up saints in the cathedral &mdash; the worship, he<lb/>
called it, of wood and tinsel. But it seemed to me that<lb/>
he looked upon his own God as a sort of influential<lb/>
partner, who gets his share of profits in the endowment<lb/>
of churches. That's a sort of idolatry. He told me he<lb/>
endowed churches every year, Charley."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No end of them," said Mr. Gould, marvelling inwardly<lb/>
at the mobility of her physiognomy. "All over<lb/>
the country. He's famous for that sort of munificence."<lb/>
"Oh, he didn't boast," Mrs. Gould declared, scrupulously.<lb/>
"I believe he's really a good man, but so stupid!<lb/>
A poor Chulo who offers a little silver arm or leg to<lb/>
thank his god for a cure is as rational and more touching."<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "He's at the head of immense silver and iron interests,"<lb/>
Charles Gould observed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, yes! The religion of silver and iron. He's a<lb/>
very civil man, though he looked awfully solemn when<lb/>
he first saw the Madonna on the staircase, who's only<lb/>
wood and paint; but he said nothing to me. My dear<lb/>
Charley, I heard those men talk among themselves.<lb/>
Can it be that they really wish to become, for an immense<lb/>
consideration, drawers of water and hewers of<lb/>
wood to all the countries and nations of the earth?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A man must work to some end," Charles Gould said,<lb/>
vaguely.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould, frowning, surveyed him from head to<lb/>
foot. With his riding breeches, leather leggings (an<lb/>
article of apparel never before seen in Costaguana), a<lb/>
Norfolk coat of grey flannel, and those great flaming<lb/>
moustaches, he suggested an officer of cavalry turned<lb/>
gentleman farmer. This combination was gratifying to<lb/>
Mrs. Gould's tastes. "How thin the poor boy is!" she<lb/>


<pb n="72"/>

thought. "He overworks himself." But there was no<lb/>
denying that his fine-drawn, keen red face, and his<lb/>
whole, long-limbed, lank person had an air of breeding<lb/>
and distinction. And Mrs. Gould relented.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I only wondered what you felt," she murmured,<lb/>
gently.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     During the last few days, as it happened, Charles<lb/>
Gould had been kept too busy thinking twice before he<lb/>
spoke to have paid much attention to the state of his<lb/>
feelings. But theirs was a successful match, and he<lb/>
had no difficulty in finding his answer.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The best of my feelings are in your keeping, my<lb/>
dear," he said, lightly; and there was so much truth in<lb/>
that obscure phrase that he experienced towards her<lb/>
at the moment a great increase of gratitude and tenderness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    Mrs. Gould, however, did not seem to find this answer<lb/>
in the least obscure. She brightened up delicately;<lb/>
already he had changed his tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But there are facts. The worth of the mine &mdash; as a<lb/>
mine &mdash; is beyond doubt. It shall make us very wealthy.<lb/>
The mere working of it is a matter of technical knowledge,<lb/>
which I have &mdash; which ten thousand other men in<lb/>
the world have. But its safety, its continued existence<lb/>
as an enterprise, giving a return to men &mdash; to strangers,<lb/>
comparative strangers &mdash; who invest money in it, is left<lb/>
altogether in my hands. I have inspired confidence in<lb/>
a man of wealth and position. You seem to think this<lb/>
perfectly natural &mdash; do you? Well, I don't know. I<lb/>
don't know why I have; but it is a fact. This fact<lb/>
makes everything possible, because without it I would<lb/>
never have thought of disregarding my father's wishes.<lb/>
I would never have disposed of the Concession as a<lb/>
speculator disposes of a valuable right to a company &mdash;<lb/>
for cash and shares, to grow rich eventually if possible,<lb/>


<pb n="73"/>

but at any rate to put some money at once in his pocket.<lb/>
No. Even if it had been feasible &mdash; which I doubt &mdash; I<lb/>
would not have done so. Poor father did not understand.<lb/>
He was afraid I would hang on to the ruinous<lb/>
thing, waiting for just some such chance, and waste my<lb/>
life miserably. That was the true sense of his prohibition,<lb/>
which we have deliberately set aside."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     They were walking up and down the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>. Her<lb/>
head just reached to his shoulder. His arm, extended<lb/>
downwards, was about her waist. His spurs jingled<lb/>
slightly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He had not seen me for ten years. He did not know<lb/>
me. He parted from me for my sake, and he would<lb/>
never let me come back. He was always talking in his<lb/>
letters of leaving Costaguana, of abandoning everything<lb/>
and making his escape. But he was too valuable a<lb/>
prey. They would have thrown him into one of their<lb/>
prisons at the first suspicion."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His spurred feet clinked slowly. He was bending<lb/>
over his wife as they walked. The big parrot, turning<lb/>
its head askew, followed their pacing figures with a<lb/>
round, unblinking eye.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He was a lonely man. Ever since I was ten years<lb/>
old he used to talk to me as if I had been grown up.<lb/>
When I was in Europe he wrote to me every month.<lb/>
Ten, twelve pages every month of my life for ten years.<lb/>
And, after all, he did not know me! Just think of it &mdash;<lb/>
ten whole years away; the years I was growing up into a<lb/>
man. He could not know me. Do you think he<lb/>
could?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould shook her head negatively; which was just<lb/>
what her husband had expected from the strength of the<lb/>
argument. But she shook her head negatively only<lb/>
because she thought that no one could know her Charles<lb/>
&mdash; really know him for what he was but herself. The<lb/>


<pb n="74"/>

thing was obvious. It could be felt. It required no<lb/>
argument. And poor Mr. Gould, senior, who had died<lb/>
too soon to ever hear of their engagement, remained too<lb/>
shadowy a figure for her to be credited with knowledge<lb/>
of any sort whatever.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, he did not understand. In my view this mine<lb/>
could never have been a thing to sell. Never! After<lb/>
all his misery I simply could not have touched it for<lb/>
money alone," Charles Gould pursued: and she pressed<lb/>
her head to his shoulder approvingly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     These two young people remembered the life which<lb/>
had ended wretchedly just when their own lives had<lb/>
come together in that splendour of hopeful love, which<lb/>
to the most sensible minds appears like a triumph of<lb/>
good over all the evils of the earth. A vague idea of<lb/>
rehabilitation had entered the plan of their life. That<lb/>
it was so vague as to elude the support of argument<lb/>
made it only the stronger. It had presented itself to<lb/>
them at the instant when the woman's instinct of devotion<lb/>
and the man's instinct of activity receive from<lb/>
the strongest of illusions their most powerful impulse.<lb/>
The very prohibition imposed the necessity of success.<lb/>
It was as if they had been morally bound to make good<lb/>
their vigorous view of life against the unnatural error of<lb/>
weariness and despair. If the idea of wealth was<lb/>
present to them it was only in so far as it was bound with<lb/>
that other success. Mrs. Gould, an orphan from early<lb/>
childhood and without fortune, brought up in an<lb/>
atmosphere of intellectual interests, had never considered<lb/>
the aspects of great wealth. They were too<lb/>
remote, and she had not learned that they were desirable.<lb/>
On the other hand, she had not known anything<lb/>
of absolute want. Even the very poverty of her<lb/>
aunt, the Marchesa, had nothing intolerable to a refined<lb/>
mind; it seemed in accord with a great grief: it had<lb/>


<pb n="75"/>

the austerity of a sacrifice offered to a noble ideal.<lb/>
Thus even the most legitimate touch of materialism<lb/>
was wanting in Mrs. Gould's character. The dead man<lb/>
of whom she thought with tenderness (because he was<lb/>
Charley's father) and with some impatience (because he<lb/>
had been weak), must be put completely in the wrong.<lb/>
Nothing else would do to keep their prosperity without a<lb/>
stain on its only real, on its immaterial side!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould, on his part, had been obliged to keep<lb/>
the idea of wealth well to the fore; but he brought it<lb/>
forward as a means, not as an end. Unless the mine<lb/>
was good business it could not be touched. He had to<lb/>
insist on that aspect of the enterprise. It was his lever<lb/>
to move men who had capital. And Charles Gould believed<lb/>
in the mine. He knew everything that could be<lb/>
known of it. His faith in the mine was contagious,<lb/>
though it was not served by a great eloquence; but business<lb/>
men are frequently as sanguine and imaginative<lb/>
as lovers. They are affected by a personality much<lb/>
oftener than people would suppose; and Charles Gould,<lb/>
in his unshaken assurance, was absolutely convincing.<lb/>
Besides, it was a matter of common knowledge to the<lb/>
men to whom he addressed himself that mining in<lb/>
Costaguana was a game that could be made considably<lb/>
more than worth the candle. The men of affairs<lb/>
knew that very well. The real difficulty in touching it<lb/>
was elsewhere. Against that there was an implication<lb/>
of calm and implacable resolution in Charles Gould's<lb/>
very voice. Men of affairs venture sometimes on acts<lb/>
that the common judgment of the world would pronounce<lb/>
absurd; they make their decisions on apparently<lb/>
impulsive and human grounds. "Very well," had said<lb/>
the considerable personage to whom Charles Gould on<lb/>
his way out through San Francisco had lucidly exposed<lb/>
his point of view. "Let us suppose that the mining<lb/>


<pb n="76"/>

affairs of Sulaco are taken in hand. There would<lb/>
then be in it: first, the house of Holroyd, which is all<lb/>
right; then, Mr. Charles Gould, a citizen of Costaguana,<lb/>
who is also all right; and, lastly, the Government of the<lb/>
Republic. So far this resembles the first start of the<lb/>
Atacama nitrate fields, where there was a financing<lb/>
house, a gentleman of the name of Edwards, and &mdash; a<lb/>
Government; or, rather, two Governments &mdash; two South<lb/>
American Governments. And you know what came of<lb/>
it. War came of it; devastating and prolonged war<lb/>
came of it, Mr. Gould. However, here we possess the<lb/>
advantage of having only one South American Government<lb/>
hanging around for plunder out of the deal. It is<lb/>
an advantage; but then there are degrees of badness,<lb/>
and that Government is the Costaguana Government."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Thus spoke the considerable personage, the millionaire<lb/>
endower of churches on a scale befitting the greatness<lb/>
of his native land &mdash; the same to whom the doctors<lb/>
used the language of horrid and veiled menaces. He<lb/>
was a big-limbed, deliberate man, whose quiet burliness<lb/>
lent to an ample silk-faced frock-coat a superfine<lb/>
dignity. His hair was iron grey, his eyebrows were<lb/>
still black, and his massive profile was the profile of a<lb/>
C&aelig;sar's head on an old Roman coin. But his parentage<lb/>
was German and Scotch and English, with remote<lb/>
strains of Danish and French blood, giving him the<lb/>
temperament of a Puritan and an insatiable imagination<lb/>
of conquest. He was completely unbending to his<lb/>
visitor, because of the warm introduction the visitor had<lb/>
brought from Europe, and because of an irrational<lb/>
liking for earnestness and determination wherever met,<lb/>
to whatever end directed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The Costaguana Government shall play its hand<lb/>
for all it's worth &mdash; and don't you forget it, Mr. Gould.<lb/>
Now, what is Costaguana? It is the bottomless pit of<lb/>


<pb n="77"/>

<pb n="10"/>
pean capital has been flung into it with both hands for<lb/>
years. Not ours, though. We in this country know<lb/>
just about enough to keep indoors when it rains. We<lb/>
can sit and watch. Of course, some day we shall step<lb/>
in. We are bound to. But there's no hurry. Time<lb/>
itself has got to wait on the greatest country in the<lb/>
whole of God's Universe. We shall be giving the word<lb/>
for everything: industry, trade, law, journalism, art,<lb/>
politics, and religion, from Cape Horn clear over to<lb/>
Smith's Sound, and beyond, too, if anything worth<lb/>
taking hold of turns up at the North Pole. And then<lb/>
we shall have the leisure to take in hand the outlying<lb/>
islands and continents of the earth. We shall run the<lb/>
world's business whether the world likes it or not. The<lb/>
world can't help it &mdash; and neither can we, I guess."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     By this he meant to express his faith in destiny in<lb/>
words suitable to his intelligence, which was unskilled<lb/>
in the presentation of general ideas. His intelligence<lb/>
was nourished on facts; and Charles Gould, whose<lb/>
imagination had been permanently affected by the one<lb/>
great fact of a silver mine, had no objection to this<lb/>
theory of the world's future. If it had seemed distasteful<lb/>
for a moment it was because the sudden statement<lb/>
of such vast eventualities dwarfed almost to<lb/>
nothingness the actual matter in hand. He and his<lb/>
plans and all the mineral wealth of the Occidental<lb/>
Province appeared suddenly robbed of every vestige<lb/>
of magnitude. The sensation was disagreeable; but<lb/>
Charles Gould was not dull. Already he felt that he<lb/>
was producing a favourable impression; the consciousness<lb/>
of that flattering fact helped him to a vague smile,<lb/>
which his big interlocutor took for a smile of discreet<lb/>
and admiring assent. He smiled quietly, too; and<lb/>
immediately Charles Gould, with that mental agility<lb/>


<pb n="78"/>

mankind will display in defence of a cherished hope,<lb/>
reflected that the very apparent insignificance of his<lb/>
aim would help him to success. His personality and his<lb/>
mine would be taken up because it was a matter of no<lb/>
great consequence, one way or another, to a man who<lb/>
referred his action to such a prodigious destiny. And<lb/>
Charles Gould was not humiliated by this consideration,<lb/>
because the thing remained as big as ever for him. Nobody<lb/>
else's vast conceptions of destiny could diminish<lb/>
the aspect of his desire for the redemption of the San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; mine. In comparison to the correctness of<lb/>
his aim, definite in space and absolutely attainable<lb/>
within a limited time, the other man appeared for an<lb/>
instant as a dreamy idealist of no importance.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The great man, massive and benignant, had been<lb/>
looking at him thoughtfully; when he broke the short<lb/>
silence it was to remark that concessions flew about<lb/>
thick in the air of Costaguana. Any simple soul that<lb/>
just yearned to be taken in could bring down a concession<lb/>
at the first shot.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Our consuls get their mouths stopped with them," he<lb/>
continued, with a twinkle of genial scorn in his eyes.<lb/>
But in a moment he became grave. "A conscientious,<lb/>
upright man, that cares nothing for boodle, and keeps<lb/>
clear of their intrigues, conspiracies, and factions, soon<lb/>
gets his passports. See that, Mr. Gould? <hi rend="italic">Persona non<lb/>
grata</hi>. That's the reason our Government is never<lb/>
properly informed. On the other hand, Europe must<lb/>
be kept out of this continent, and for proper interference<lb/>
on our part the time is not yet ripe, I dare say.<lb/>
But we here &mdash; we are not this country's Government,<lb/>
neither are we simple souls. Your affair is all right.<lb/>
The main question for us is whether the second partner,<lb/>
and that's you, is the right sort to hold his own against<lb/>
the third and unwelcome partner, which is one or<lb/>


<pb n="79"/>

another of the high and mighty robber gangs that run<lb/>
the Costaguana Government. What do you think,<lb/>
Mr. Gould, eh?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He bent forward to look steadily into the unflinching<lb/>
eyes of Charles Gould, who, remembering the large box<lb/>
full of his father's letters, put the accumulated scorn<lb/>
and bitterness of many years into the tone of his<lb/>
answer &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "As far as the knowledge of these men and their<lb/>
methods and their politics is concerned, I can answer<lb/>
for myself. I have been fed on that sort of knowledge<lb/>
since I was a boy. I am not likely to fall into mistakes<lb/>
from excess of optimism."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Not likely, eh? That's all right. Tact and a stiff<lb/>
upper lip is what you'll want; and you could bluff a<lb/>
little on the strength of your backing. Not too much,<lb/>
though. We will go with you as long as the thing runs<lb/>
straight. But we won't be drawn into any large<lb/>
trouble. This is the experiment which I am willing to<lb/>
make. There is some risk, and we will take it; but if<lb/>
you can't keep up your end, we will stand our loss, of<lb/>
course, and then &mdash; we'll let the thing go. This mine<lb/>
can wait; it has been shut up before, as you know. You<lb/>
must understand that under no circumstances will we<lb/>
consent to throw good money after bad."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Thus the great personage had spoken then, in his<lb/>
own private office, in a great city where other men<lb/>
(very considerable in the eyes of a vain populace)<lb/>
waited with alacrity upon a wave of his hand. And<lb/>
rather more than a year later, during his unexpected<lb/>
appearance in Sulaco, he had emphasized his uncompromising<lb/>
attitude with a freedom of sincerity permitted<lb/>
to his wealth and influence. He did this with<lb/>
the less reserve, perhaps, because the inspection of<lb/>
what had been done, and more still the way in which<lb/>


<pb n="80"/>

successive steps had been taken, had impressed him<lb/>
with the conviction that Charles Gould was perfectly<lb/>
capable of keeping up his end.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "This young fellow," he thought to himself, "may<lb/>
yet become a power in the land."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This thought flattered him, for hitherto the only<lb/>
account of this young man he could give to his intimates<lb/>
was &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "My brother-in-law met him in one of these one-<lb/>
horse old German towns, near some mines, and sent<lb/>
him on to me with a letter. He's one of the Costaguana<lb/>
Goulds, pure-bred Englishmen, but all born in the<lb/>
country. His uncle went into politics, was the last<lb/>
Provincial President of Sulaco, and got shot after a<lb/>
battle. His father was a prominent business man in<lb/>
Sta. Marta, tried to keep clear of their politics, and died<lb/>
ruined after a lot of revolutions. And that's your<lb/>
Costaguana in a nutshell."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Of course, he was too great a man to be questioned<lb/>
as to his motives, even by his intimates. The outside<lb/>
world was at liberty to wonder respectfully at the<lb/>
hidden meaning of his actions. He was so great a man<lb/>
that his lavish patronage of the "purer forms of Christianity"<lb/>
(which in its na&iuml;ve form of church-building<lb/>
amused Mrs. Gould) was looked upon by his fellow-<lb/>
citizens as the manifestation of a pious and humble<lb/>
spirit. But in his own circles of the financial world the<lb/>
taking up of such a thing as the San Tom&eacute; mine was<lb/>
regarded with respect, indeed, but rather as a subject<lb/>
for discreet jocularity. It was a great man's caprice.<lb/>
In the great Holroyd building (an enormous pile of<lb/>
iron, glass, and blocks of stone at the corner of two<lb/>
streets, cobwebbed aloft by the radiation of telegraph<lb/>
wires) the heads of principal departments exchanged<lb/>
humorous glances, which meant that they were not let<lb/>


<pb n="81"/>

into the secrets of the San Tom&eacute; business. The<lb/>
Costaguana mail (it was never large &mdash; one fairly heavy<lb/>
envelope) was taken unopened straight into the great<lb/>
man's room, and no instructions dealing with it had<lb/>
ever been issued thence. The office whispered that he<lb/>
answered personally &mdash; and not by dictation either, but<lb/>
actually writing in his own hand, with pen and ink,<lb/>
and, it was to be supposed, taking a copy in his own<lb/>
private press copy-book, inaccessible to profane eyes.<lb/>
Some scornful young men, insignificant pieces of minor<lb/>
machinery in that eleven-storey-high workshop of great<lb/>
affairs, expressed frankly their private opinion that the<lb/>
great chief had done at last something silly, and was<lb/>
ashamed of his folly; others, elderly and insignificant,<lb/>
but full of romantic reverence for the business that had<lb/>
devoured their best years, used to mutter darkly and<lb/>
knowingly that this was a portentous sign; that the<lb/>
Holroyd connection meant by-and-by to get hold of the<lb/>
whole Republic of Costaguana, lock, stock, and barrel.<lb/>
But, in fact, the hobby theory was the right one. It<lb/>
interested the great man to attend personally to the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mine; it interested him so much that he<lb/>
allowed this hobby to give a direction to the first complete<lb/>
holiday he had taken for quite a startling number<lb/>
of years. He was not running a great enterprise there;<lb/>
no mere railway board or industrial corporation. He<lb/>
was running a man! A success would have pleased him<lb/>
very much on refreshingly novel grounds; but, on the<lb/>
other side of the same feeling, it was incumbent upon<lb/>
him to cast it off utterly at the first sign of failure. A<lb/>
man may be thrown off. The papers had unfortunately<lb/>
trumpeted all over the land his journey to Costaguana.<lb/>
If he was pleased at the way Charles Gould was going<lb/>
on, he infused an added grimness into his assurances of<lb/>
support. Even at the very last interview, half an hour<lb/>


<pb n="82"/>

or so before he rolled out of the patio, hat in hand, behind<lb/>
Mrs. Gould's white mules, he had said in Charles's<lb/>
room &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You go ahead in your own way, and I shall know<lb/>
how to help you as long as you hold your own. But you<lb/>
may rest assured that in a given case we shall know how<lb/>
to drop you in time."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     To this Charles Gould's only answer had been: "You<lb/>
may begin sending out the machinery as soon as you<lb/>
like."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And the great man had liked this imperturbable<lb/>
assurance. The secret of it was that to Charles<lb/>
Gould's mind these uncompromising terms were agreeable.<lb/>
Like this the mine preserved its identity, with<lb/>
which he had endowed it as a boy; and it remained<lb/>
dependent on himself alone. It was a serious affair,<lb/>
and he, too, took it grimly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Of course," he said to his wife, alluding to this last<lb/>
conversation with the departed guest, while they<lb/>
walked slowly up and down the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>, followed by<lb/>
the irritated eye of the parrot &mdash; "of course, a man of<lb/>
that sort can take up a thing or drop it when he likes.<lb/>
He will suffer from no sense of defeat. He may have<lb/>
to give in, or he may have to die to-morrow, but the<lb/>
great silver and iron interests will survive, and some<lb/>
day will get hold of Costaguana along with the rest of<lb/>
the world."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     They had stopped near the cage. The parrot,<lb/>
catching the sound of a word belonging to his vocabulary,<lb/>
was moved to interfere. Parrots are very human.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Viva Costaguana!" he shrieked, with intense self-<lb/>
assertion, and, instantly ruffling up his feathers, assumed<lb/>
an air of puffed-up somnolence behind the<lb/>
glittering wires.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And do you believe that, Charley?" Mrs. Gould<lb/>


<pb n="83"/>

asked. "This seems to me most awful materialism,<lb/>
and &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "My dear, it's nothing to me," interrupted her husband,<lb/>
in a reasonable tone. "I make use of what I see.<lb/>
What's it to me whether his talk is the voice of destiny<lb/>
or simply a bit of clap-trap eloquence? There's a good<lb/>
deal of eloquence of one sort or another produced in<lb/>
both Americas. The air of the New World seems<lb/>
favourable to the art of declamation. Have you forgotten<lb/>
how dear Avellanos can hold forth for hours<lb/>
here &mdash;?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Oh, but that's different," protested Mrs. Gould,<lb/>
almost shocked. The allusion was not to the point.<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute; was a dear good man, who talked very well,<lb/>
and was enthusiastic about the greatness of the San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; mine. "How can you compare them, Charles?"<lb/>
she exclaimed, reproachfully. "He has suffered &mdash; and yet<lb/>
he hopes."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The working competence of men &mdash; which she never<lb/>
questioned &mdash; was very surprising to Mrs. Gould, because<lb/>
upon so many obvious issues they showed themselves<lb/>
strangely muddle-headed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould, with a careworn calmness which<lb/>
secured for him at once his wife's anxious sympathy,<lb/>
assured her that he was not comparing. He was an<lb/>
American himself, after all, and perhaps he could understand<lb/>
both kinds of eloquence &mdash; "if it were worth while<lb/>
to try," he added, grimly. But he had breathed the air<lb/>
of England longer than any of his people had done for<lb/>
three generations, and really he begged to be excused.<lb/>
His poor father could be eloquent, too. And he asked<lb/>
his wife whether she remembered a passage in one of<lb/>
his father's last letters where Mr. Gould had expressed<lb/>
the conviction that "God looked wrathfully<lb/>
at these countries, or else He would let some ray of hope<lb/>


<pb n="84"/>

fall through a rift in the appalling darkness of intrigue,<lb/>
bloodshed, and crime that hung over the Queen of<lb/>
Continents."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould had not forgotten. "You read it to me,<lb/>
Charley," she murmured. "It was a striking pronouncement.<lb/>
How deeply your father must have felt<lb/>
its terrible sadness!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He did not like to be robbed. It exasperated him,"<lb/>
said Charles Gould. "But the image will serve well<lb/>
enough. What is wanted here is law, good faith, order,<lb/>
security. Any one can declaim about these things, but<lb/>
I pin my faith to material interests. Only let the<lb/>
material interests once get a firm footing, and they are<lb/>
bound to impose the conditions on which alone they<lb/>
can continue to exist. That's how your money-making<lb/>
is justified here in the face of lawlessness and disorder.<lb/>
It is justified because the security which it<lb/>
demands must be shared with an oppressed people. A<lb/>
better justice will come afterwards. That's your ray of<lb/>
hope." His arm pressed her slight form closer to his<lb/>
side for a moment. "And who knows whether in that<lb/>
sense even the San Tom&eacute; mine may not become that<lb/>
little rift in the darkness which poor father despaired of<lb/>
ever seeing?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She glanced up at him with admiration. He was<lb/>
competent; he had given a vast shape to the vagueness<lb/>
of her unselfish ambitions.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Charley," she said, "you are splendidly disobedient."<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    He left her suddenly in the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi> to go and get his<lb/>
hat, a soft, grey sombrero, an article of national costume<lb/>
which combined unexpectedly well with his<lb/>
English get-up. He came back, a riding-whip under<lb/>
his arm, buttoning up a dogskin glove; his face reflected<lb/>
the resolute nature of his thoughts. His wife<lb/>


<pb n="85"/>

had waited for him at the head of the stairs, and before<lb/>
he gave her the parting kiss he finished the conversation<lb/>
&mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What should be perfectly clear to us," he said, "is<lb/>
the fact that there is no going back. Where could we<lb/>
begin life afresh? We are in now for all that there is<lb/>
in us."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He bent over her upturned face very tenderly and a<lb/>
little remorsefully. Charles Gould was competent<lb/>
because he had no illusions. The Gould Concession<lb/>
had to fight for life with such weapons as could be found<lb/>
at once in the mire of a corruption that was so universal<lb/>
as almost to lose its significance. He was prepared to<lb/>
stoop for his weapons. For a moment he felt as if the<lb/>
silver mine, which had killed his father, had decoyed<lb/>
him further than he meant to go; and with the round-<lb/>
about logic of emotions, he felt that the worthiness of<lb/>
his life was bound up with success. There was no<lb/>
going back.<lb/>

<p>     "MRS. GOULD was too intelligently sympathetic not<lb/>
to share that feeling. It made life exciting, and she<lb/>
was too much of a woman not to like excitement. But<lb/>
it frightened her, too, a little; and when Don Jos&eacute;<lb/>
Avellanos, rocking in the American chair, would go so<lb/>
far as to say, "Even, my dear Carlos, if you had failed;<lb/>
even if some untoward event were yet to destroy your<lb/>
work &mdash; which God forbid! &mdash; you would have deserved<lb/>
well of your country," Mrs. Gould would look up from<lb/>
the tea-table profoundly at her unmoved husband<lb/>
stirring the spoon in the cup as though he had not heard<lb/>
a word.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Not that Don Jos&eacute; anticipated anything of the sort.<lb/>
He could not praise enough dear Carlos's tact and<lb/>
courage. His English, rock-like quality of character<lb/>
was his best safeguard, Don Jos&eacute; affirmed; and, turning<lb/>
to Mrs. Gould, "As to you, Emilia, my soul" &mdash; he would<lb/>
address her with the familiarity of his age and old<lb/>
friendship &mdash; "you are as true a patriot as though you<lb/>
had been born in our midst."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This might have been less or more than the truth.<lb/>
Mrs. Gould, accompanying her husband all over the<lb/>
province in the search for labour, had seen the land<lb/>
with a deeper glance than a trueborn Costaguanera<lb/>
could have done. In her travel-worn riding habit, her<lb/>
face powdered white like a plaster cast, with a further<lb/>
protection of a small silk mask during the heat of the<lb/>
day, she rode on a well-shaped, light-footed pony in the<lb/>
centre of a little cavalcade. Two <hi rend="italic">mozos de campo</hi>,<lb/>




<pb n="87"/>

picturesque in great hats, with spurred bare heels,<lb/>
in white embroidered calzoneras, leather jackets and<lb/>
striped ponchos, rode ahead with carbines across their<lb/>
shoulders, swaying in unison to the pace of the horses.<lb/>
A tropilla of pack mules brought up the rear in charge of<lb/>
a thin brown muleteer, sitting his long-eared beast very<lb/>
near the tail, legs thrust far forward, the wide brim of<lb/>
his hat set far back, making a sort of halo for his head.<lb/>
An old Costaguana officer, a retired senior major of<lb/>
humble origin, but patronized by the first families on<lb/>
account of his Blanco opinions, had been recommended<lb/>
by Don Jos&eacute; for commissary and organizer of that<lb/>
expedition. The points of his grey moustache hung far<lb/>
below his chin, and, riding on Mrs. Gould's left hand,<lb/>
he looked about with kindly eyes, pointing out the<lb/>
features of the country, telling the names of the little<lb/>
pueblos and of the estates, of the smooth-walled<lb/>
haciendas like long fortresses crowning the knolls above<lb/>
the level of the Sulaco Valley. It unrolled itself, with<lb/>
green young crops, plains, woodland, and gleams of<lb/>
water, park-like, from the blue vapour of the distant<lb/>
sierra to an immense quivering horizon of grass and sky,<lb/>
where big white clouds seemed to fall slowly into the<lb/>
darkness of their own shadows.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Men ploughed with wooden ploughs and yoked oxen,<lb/>
small on a boundless expanse, as if attacking immensity<lb/>
itself. The mounted figures of vaqueros galloped in<lb/>
the distance, and the great herds fed with all their<lb/>
horned heads one way, in one single wavering line as far<lb/>
as eye could reach across the broad <hi rend="italic">potreros</hi>. A spreading<lb/>
cotton-wool tree shaded a thatched ranche by the<lb/>
road; the trudging files of burdened Indians taking off<lb/>
their hats, would lift sad, mute eyes to the cavalcade<lb/>
raising the dust of the crumbling <hi rend="italic">camino real</hi> made by<lb/>
the hands of their enslaved forefathers. And Mrs.<lb/>


<pb n="88"/>

Gould, with each day's journey, seemed to come nearer<lb/>
to the soul of the land in the tremendous disclosure<lb/>
of this interior unaffected by the slight European veneer<lb/>
of the coast towns, a great land of plain and mountain<lb/>
and people, suffering and mute, waiting for the future<lb/>
in a pathetic immobility of patience.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She knew its sights and its hospitality, dispensed with<lb/>
a sort of slumbrous dignity in those great houses presenting<lb/>
long, blind walls and heavy portals to the wind-<lb/>
swept pastures. She was given the head of the tables,<lb/>
where masters and dependants sat in a simple and<lb/>
patriarchal state. The ladies of the house would talk<lb/>
softly in the moonlight under the orange trees of the<lb/>
courtyards, impressing upon her the sweetness of their<lb/>
voices and the something mysterious in the quietude<lb/>
of their lives. In the morning the gentlemen, well<lb/>
mounted in braided sombreros and embroidered riding<lb/>
suits, with much silver on the trappings of their horses,<lb/>
would ride forth to escort the departing guests before<lb/>
committing them, with grave good-byes, to the care of<lb/>
God at the boundary pillars of their estates. In all<lb/>
these households she could hear stories of political<lb/>
outrage; friends, relatives, ruined, imprisoned, killed in<lb/>
the battles of senseless civil wars, barbarously executed<lb/>
in ferocious proscriptions, as though the government of<lb/>
the country had been a struggle of lust between bands<lb/>
of absurd devils let loose upon the land with sabres and<lb/>
uniforms and grandiloquent phrases. And on all the<lb/>
lips she found a weary desire for peace, the dread of<lb/>
officialdom with its nightmarish parody of administration<lb/>
without law, without security, and without justice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She bore a whole two months of wandering very well;<lb/>
she had that power of resistance to fatigue which one<lb/>
discovers here and there in some quite frail-looking<lb/>
women with surprise &mdash; like a state of possession by a<lb/>


<pb n="89"/>

remarkably stubborn spirit. Don P&eacute;p&eacute; &mdash; the old Costaguana<lb/>
major &mdash; after much display of solicitude for the<lb/>
delicate lady, had ended by conferring upon her the<lb/>
name of the "Never-tired Se&ntilde;ora." Mrs. Gould was<lb/>
indeed becoming a Costaguanera. Having acquired<lb/>
in Southern Europe a knowledge of true peasantry, she<lb/>
was able to appreciate the great worth of the people. She<lb/>
saw the man under the silent, sad-eyed beast of burden.<lb/>
She saw them on the road carrying loads, lonely figures<lb/>
upon the plain, toiling under great straw hats, with<lb/>
their white clothing flapping about their limbs in the<lb/>
wind; she remembered the villages by some group of<lb/>
Indian women at the fountain impressed upon her<lb/>
memory, by the face of some young Indian girl with a<lb/>
melancholy and sensual profile, raising an earthenware<lb/>
vessel of cool water at the door of a dark hut with a<lb/>
wooden porch cumbered with great brown jars. The<lb/>
solid wooden wheels of an ox-cart, halted with its shafts<lb/>
in the dust, showed the strokes of the axe; and a party<lb/>
of charcoal carriers, with each man's load resting above<lb/>
his head on the top of the low mud wall, slept stretched<lb/>
in a row within the strip of shade.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The heavy stonework of bridges and churches left<lb/>
by the conquerors proclaimed the disregard of human<lb/>
labour, the tribute-labour of vanished nations. The<lb/>
power of king and church was gone, but at the sight of<lb/>
some heavy ruinous pile overtopping from a knoll the<lb/>
low mud walls of a village, Don P&eacute;p&eacute; would interrupt<lb/>
the tale of his campaigns to exclaim &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Poor Costaguana! Before, it was everything for<lb/>
the Padres, nothing for the people; and now it is everything<lb/>
for those great politicos in Sta. Marta, for negroes<lb/>
and thieves."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles talked with the alcaldes, with the fiscales,<lb/>
with the principal people in towns, and with the<lb/>


<pb n="90"/>

caballeros on the estates. The commandantes of the<lb/>
districts offered him escorts &mdash; for he could show an<lb/>
authorization from the Sulaco political chief of the day.<lb/>
How much the document had cost him in gold twenty-<lb/>
dollar pieces was a secret between himself, a great man<lb/>
in the United States (who condescended to answer the<lb/>
Sulaco mail with his own hand), and a great man of<lb/>
another sort, with a dark olive complexion and shifty<lb/>
eyes, inhabiting then the Palace of the Intendencia in<lb/>
Sulaco, and who piqued himself on his culture and<lb/>
Europeanism generally in a rather French style because<lb/>
he had lived in Europe for some years &mdash; in exile,<lb/>
he said. However, it was pretty well known that just<lb/>
before this exile he had incautiously gambled away all<lb/>
the cash in the Custom House of a small port where a<lb/>
friend in power had procured for him the post of sub-<lb/>
collector. That youthful indiscretion had, amongst<lb/>
other inconveniences, obliged him to earn his living<lb/>
for a time as a <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi> waiter in Madrid; but his talents<lb/>
must have been great, after all, since they had enabled<lb/>
him to retrieve his political fortunes so splendidly.<lb/>
Charles Gould, exposing his business with an imperturbable<lb/>
steadiness, called him Excellency.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The provincial Excellency assumed a weary superiority,<lb/>
tilting his chair far back near an open window<lb/>
in the true Costaguana manner. The military band<lb/>
happened to be braying operatic selections on the plaza<lb/>
just then, and twice he raised his hand imperatively for<lb/>
silence in order to listen to a favourite passage.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Exquisite, delicious!" he murmured; while Charles<lb/>
Gould waited, standing by with inscrutable patience.<lb/>
"Lucia, Lucia di Lammermoor! I am passionate for<lb/>
music. It transports me. Ha! the divine &mdash; ha! &mdash;<lb/>
Mozart. Si! divine . . . What is it you were<lb/>
saying?"<lb/>


<pb n="91"/>

</p>

<p>     Of course, rumours had reached him already of the<lb/>
newcomer's intentions. Besides, he had received an<lb/>
official warning from Sta. Marta. His manner was<lb/>
intended simply to conceal his curiosity and impress<lb/>
his visitor. But after he had locked up something<lb/>
valuable in the drawer of a large writing-desk in a distant<lb/>
part of the room, he became very affable, and<lb/>
walked back to his chair smartly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "If you intend to build villages and assemble a<lb/>
population near the mine, you shall require a decree<lb/>
of the Minister of the Interior for that," he suggested<lb/>
in a business-like manner.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I have already sent a memorial," said Charles<lb/>
Gould, steadily, "and I reckon now confidently upon<lb/>
your Excellency's favourable conclusions."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Excellency was a man of many moods. With<lb/>
the receipt of the money a great mellowness had descended<lb/>
upon his simple soul. Unexpectedly he fetched<lb/>
a deep sigh.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, Don Carlos! What we want is advanced men<lb/>
like you in the province. The lethargy &mdash; the lethargy<lb/>
of these aristocrats! The want of public spirit! The<lb/>
absence of all enterprise! I, with my profound studies<lb/>
in Europe, you understand &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With one hand thrust into his swelling bosom, he<lb/>
rose and fell on his toes, and for ten minutes, almost<lb/>
without drawing breath, went on hurling himself<lb/>
intellectually to the assault of Charles Gould's polite<lb/>
silence; and when, stopping abruptly, he fell back into<lb/>
his chair, it was as though he had been beaten off from<lb/>
a fortress. To save his dignity he hastened to dismiss<lb/>
this silent man with a solemn inclination of the head<lb/>
and the words, pronounced with moody, fatigued condescension<lb/>
&mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You may depend upon my enlightened goodwill<lb/>


<pb n="92"/>

as long as your conduct as a good citizen deserves<lb/>
it."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He took up a paper fan and began to cool himself with<lb/>
a consequential air, while Charles Gould bowed and<lb/>
withdrew. Then he dropped the fan at once, and<lb/>
stared with an appearance of wonder and perplexity at<lb/>
the closed door for quite a long time. At last he<lb/>
shrugged his shoulders as if to assure himself of his disdain.<lb/>
Cold, dull. No intellectuality. Red hair. A<lb/>
true Englishman. He despised him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His face darkened. What meant this unimpressed<lb/>
and frigid behaviour? He was the first of the successive<lb/>
politicians sent out from the capital to rule the<lb/>
Occidental Province whom the manner of Charles<lb/>
Gould in official intercourse was to strike as offensively<lb/>
independent.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould assumed that if the appearance of<lb/>
listening to deplorable balderdash must form part of the<lb/>
price he had to pay for being left unmolested, the obligation<lb/>
of uttering balderdash personally was by no means<lb/>
included in the bargain. He drew the line there. To<lb/>
these provincial autocrats, before whom the peaceable<lb/>
population of all classes had been accustomed to<lb/>
tremble, the reserve of that English-looking engineer<lb/>
caused an uneasiness which swung to and fro between<lb/>
cringing and truculence. Gradually all of them discovered<lb/>
that, no matter what party was in power, that<lb/>
man remained in most effective touch with the higher<lb/>
authorities in Sta. Marta.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This was a fact, and it accounted perfectly for the<lb/>
Goulds being by no means so wealthy as the engineer-in-<lb/>
chief on the new railway could legitimately suppose.<lb/>
Following the advice of Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos, who was a<lb/>
man of good counsel (though rendered timid by his<lb/>
horrible experiences of Guzman Bento's time), Charles<lb/>


<pb n="93"/>

Gould had kept clear of the capital; but in the current<lb/>
gossip of the foreign residents there he was known<lb/>
(with a good deal of seriousness underlying the irony)<lb/>
by the nickname of "King of Sulaco." An advocate of<lb/>
the Costaguana Bar, a man of reputed ability and good<lb/>
character, member of the distinguished Moraga family<lb/>
possessing extensive estates in the Sulaco Valley, was<lb/>
pointed out to strangers, with a shade of mystery and<lb/>
respect, as the agent of the San Tom&eacute; mine &mdash; "political,<lb/>
you know." He was tall, black-whiskered, and discreet.<lb/>
It was known that he had easy access to ministers,<lb/>
and that the numerous Costaguana generals were<lb/>
always anxious to dine at his house. Presidents<lb/>
granted him audience with facility. He corresponded<lb/>
actively with his maternal uncle, Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos;<lb/>
but his letters &mdash; unless those expressing formally his<lb/>
dutiful affection &mdash; were seldom entrusted to the Costaguana<lb/>
Post Office. There the envelopes are opened,<lb/>
indiscriminately, with the frankness of a brazen and<lb/>
childish impudence characteristic of some Spanish-<lb/>
American Governments. But it must be noted that at<lb/>
about the time of the re-opening of the San Tom&eacute; mine<lb/>
the muleteer who had been employed by Charles Gould<lb/>
in his preliminary travels on the Campo added his small<lb/>
train of animals to the thin stream of traffic carried<lb/>
over the mountain passes between the Sta. Marta upland<lb/>
and the Valley of Sulaco. There are no travellers<lb/>
by that arduous and unsafe route unless under very<lb/>
exceptional circumstances, and the state of inland<lb/>
trade did not visibly require additional transport<lb/>
facilities; but the man seemed to find his account in it.<lb/>
A few packages were always found for him whenever he<lb/>
took the road. Very brown and wooden, in goatskin<lb/>
breeches with the hair outside, he sat near the tail of<lb/>
his own smart mule, his great hat turned against the<lb/>


<pb n="94"/>

sun, an expression of blissful vacancy on his long face,<lb/>
humming day after day a love-song in a plaintive key,<lb/>
or, without a change of expression, letting out a yell at<lb/>
his small tropilla in front. A round little guitar hung<lb/>
high up on his back; and there was a place scooped out<lb/>
artistically in the wood of one of his pack-saddles where<lb/>
a tightly rolled piece of paper could be slipped in, the<lb/>
wooden plug replaced, and the coarse canvas nailed on<lb/>
again. When in Sulaco it was his practice to smoke and<lb/>
doze all day long (as though he had no care in the world)<lb/>
on a stone bench outside the doorway of the Casa<lb/>
Gould and facing the windows of the Avellanos house.<lb/>
Years and years ago his mother had been chief laundry-<lb/>
woman in that family &mdash; very accomplished in the matter<lb/>
of clear-starching. He himself had been born on<lb/>
one of their haciendas. His name was Bonifacio, and<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute;, crossing the street about five o'clock to call on<lb/>
Do&ntilde;a Emilia, always acknowledged his humble salute<lb/>
by some movement of hand or head. The porters of<lb/>
both houses conversed lazily with him in tones of grave<lb/>
intimacy. His evenings he devoted to gambling and<lb/>
to calls in a spirit of generous festivity upon the <hi rend="italic">peyne<lb/>
d'oro</hi> girls in the more remote side-streets of the town.<lb/>
But he, too, was a discreet man.<lb/>
</p>

<head>CHAPTER EIGHT</head>

<pb n="95"/>


<p>     THOSE of us whom business or curiosity took to<lb/>
Sulaco in these years before the first advent of the railway<lb/>
can remember the steadying effect of the San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; mine upon the life of that remote province. The<lb/>
outward appearances had not changed then as they<lb/>
have changed since, as I am told, with cable cars<lb/>
running along the streets of the Constitution, and<lb/>
carriage roads far into the country, to Rincon and other<lb/>
villages, where the foreign merchants and the Ricos<lb/>
generally have their modern villas, and a vast rail-way<lb/>
goods yard by the harbour, which has a quay-side, a<lb/>
long range of warehouses, and quite serious, organized<lb/>
labour troubles of its own.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nobody had ever heard of labour troubles then. The<lb/>
Cargadores of the port formed, indeed, an unruly<lb/>
brotherhood of all sorts of scum, with a patron saint<lb/>
of their own. They went on strike regularly (every<lb/>
bull-fight day), a form of trouble that even Nostromo<lb/>
at the height of his prestige could never cope with<lb/>
efficiently; but the morning after each fiesta, before the<lb/>
Indian market-women had opened their mat parasols<lb/>
on the plaza, when the snows of Higuerota gleamed<lb/>
pale over the town on a yet black sky, the appearance<lb/>
of a phantom-like horseman mounted on a silver-grey<lb/>
mare solved the problem of labour without fail. His<lb/>
steed paced the lanes of the slums and the weed-grown<lb/>
enclosures within the old ramparts, between the black,<lb/>
lightless cluster of huts, like cow-byres, like dog-<lb/>
kennels. The horseman hammered with the butt of a<lb/>




<pb n="96"/>

heavy revolver at the doors of low pulperias, of obscene<lb/>
lean-to sheds sloping against the tumble-down<lb/>
piece of a noble wall, at the wooden sides of dwellings so<lb/>
flimsy that the sound of snores and sleepy mutters<lb/>
within could be heard in the pauses of the thundering<lb/>
clatter of his blows. He called out men's names<lb/>
menacingly from the saddle, once, twice. The drowsy<lb/>
answers &mdash; grumpy, conciliating, savage, jocular, or<lb/>
deprecating &mdash; came out into the silent darkness in which<lb/>
the horseman sat still, and presently a dark figure would<lb/>
flit out coughing in the still air. Sometimes a low-<lb/>
toned woman cried through the window-hole softly,<lb/>
"He's coming directly, se&ntilde;or," and the horseman waited<lb/>
silent on a motionless horse. But if perchance he had<lb/>
to dismount, then, after a while, from the door of that<lb/>
hovel or of that pulperia, with a ferocious scuffle and<lb/>
stifled imprecations, a cargador would fly out head<lb/>
first and hands abroad, to sprawl under the forelegs of<lb/>
the silver-grey mare, who only pricked forward her<lb/>
sharp little ears. She was used to that work; and the<lb/>
man, picking himself up, would walk away hastily from<lb/>
Nostromo's revolver, reeling a little along the street<lb/>
and snarling low curses. At sunrise Captain Mitchell,<lb/>
coming out anxiously in his night attire on to the<lb/>
wooden balcony running the whole length of the O.S.N.<lb/>
Company's lonely building by the shore, would see<lb/>
the lighters already under way, figures moving busily<lb/>
about the cargo cranes, perhaps hear the invaluable<lb/>
Nostromo, now dismounted and in the checked shirt<lb/>
and red sash of a Mediterranean sailor, bawling orders<lb/>
from the end of the jetty in a stentorian voice. A<lb/>
fellow in a thousand!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The material apparatus of perfected civilization<lb/>
which obliterates the individuality of old towns under<lb/>
the stereotyped conveniences of modern life had not<lb/>


<pb n="97"/>

intruded as yet; but over the worn-out antiquity of<lb/>
Sulaco, so characteristic with its stuccoed houses and<lb/>
barred windows, with the great yellowy-white walls of<lb/>
abandoned convents behind the rows of sombre green<lb/>
cypresses, that fact &mdash; very modern in its spirit &mdash; the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mine had already thrown its subtle influence.<lb/>
It had altered, too, the outward character of the<lb/>
crowds on feast days on the plaza before the open portal<lb/>
of the cathedral, by the number of white ponchos with a<lb/>
green stripe affected as holiday wear by the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
miners. They had also adopted white hats with green<lb/>
cord and braid &mdash; articles of good quality, which could<lb/>
be obtained in the storehouse of the administration for<lb/>
very little money. A peaceable Cholo wearing these<lb/>
colours (unusual in Costaguana) was somehow very<lb/>
seldom beaten to within an inch of his life on a charge of<lb/>
disrespect to the town police; neither ran he much risk<lb/>
of being suddenly lassoed on the road by a recruiting<lb/>
party of lanceros &mdash; a method of voluntary enlistment<lb/>
looked upon as almost legal in the Republic. Whole<lb/>
villages were known to have volunteered for the army<lb/>
in that way; but, as Don P&eacute;p&eacute; would say with a hopeless<lb/>
shrug to Mrs. Gould, "What would you! Poor<lb/>
people! Pobrecitos! Pobrecitos! But the State must<lb/>
have its soldiers."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Thus professionally spoke Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, the fighter, with<lb/>
pendent moustaches, a nut-brown, lean face, and a<lb/>
clean run of a cast-iron jaw, suggesting the type of a<lb/>
cattle-herd horseman from the great Llanos of the<lb/>
South. "If you will listen to an old officer of Paez,<lb/>
se&ntilde;ores," was the exordium of all his speeches in the<lb/>
Aristocratic Club of Sulaco, where he was admitted on<lb/>
account of his past services to the extinct cause of<lb/>
Federation. The club, dating from the days of the<lb/>
proclamation of Costaguana's independence, boasted<lb/>


<pb n="98"/>

many names of liberators amongst its first founders.<lb/>
Suppressed arbitrarily innumerable times by various<lb/>
Governments, with memories of proscriptions and of at<lb/>
least one wholesale massacre of its members, sadly<lb/>
assembled for a banquet by the order of a zealous<lb/>
military commandante (their bodies were afterwards<lb/>
stripped naked and flung into the plaza out of the windows<lb/>
by the lowest scum of the populace), it was again<lb/>
flourishing, at that period, peacefully. It extended to<lb/>
strangers the large hospitality of the cool, big rooms of<lb/>
its historic quarters in the front part of a house, once the<lb/>
residence of a high official of the Holy Office. The two<lb/>
wings, shut up, crumbled behind the nailed doors, and<lb/>
what may be described as a grove of young orange trees<lb/>
grown in the unpaved patio concealed the utter ruin of<lb/>
the back part facing the gate. You turned in from the<lb/>
street, as if entering a secluded orchard, where you came<lb/>
upon the foot of a disjointed staircase, guarded by a<lb/>
moss-stained effigy of some saintly bishop, mitred and<lb/>
staffed, and bearing the indignity of a broken nose<lb/>
meekly, with his fine stone hands crossed on his breast.<lb/>
The chocolate-coloured faces of servants with mops of<lb/>
black hair peeped at you from above; the click of<lb/>
billiard balls came to your ears, and ascending the<lb/>
steps, you would perhaps see in the first sala, very stiff<lb/>
upon a straight-backed chair, in a good light, Don P&eacute;p&eacute;<lb/>
moving his long moustaches as he spelt his way, at arm's<lb/>
length, through an old Sta. Marta newspaper. His<lb/>
horse &mdash; a stony-hearted but persevering black brute<lb/>
with a hammer head &mdash; you would have seen in the<lb/>
street dozing motionless under an immense saddle, with<lb/>
its nose almost touching the curbstone of the sidewalk.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, when "down from the mountain," as the<lb/>
phrase, often heard in Sulaco, went, could also be seen<lb/>
in the drawing-room of the Casa Gould. He sat with<lb/>


<pb n="99"/>

modest assurance at some distance from the tea-table.<lb/>
With his knees close together, and a kindly twinkle of<lb/>
drollery in his deep-set eyes, he would throw his small<lb/>
and ironic pleasantries into the current of conversation.<lb/>
There was in that man a sort of sane, humorous shrewdness,<lb/>
and a vein of genuine humanity so often found in<lb/>
simple old soldiers of proved courage who have seen<lb/>
much desperate service. Of course he knew nothing<lb/>
whatever of mining, but his employment was of a special<lb/>
kind. He was in charge of the whole population in the<lb/>
territory of the mine, which extended from the head of<lb/>
the gorge to where the cart track from the foot of the<lb/>
mountain enters the plain, crossing a stream over a<lb/>
little wooden bridge painted green &mdash; green, the colour of<lb/>
hope, being also the colour of the mine.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was reported in Sulaco that up there "at the mountain"<lb/>
Don P&eacute;p&eacute; walked about precipitous paths, girt<lb/>
with a great sword and in a shabby uniform with<lb/>
tarnished bullion epaulettes of a senior major. Most<lb/>
miners being Indians, with big wild eyes, addressed him<lb/>
as Taita (father), as these barefooted people of Costaguana<lb/>
will address anybody who wears shoes; but it was<lb/>
Basilio, Mr. Gould's own mozo and the head servant of<lb/>
the Casa, who, in all good faith and from a sense of<lb/>
propriety, announced him once in the solemn words,<lb/>
"El Se&ntilde;or Gobernador has arrived."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos, then in the drawing-room, was<lb/>
delighted beyond measure at the aptness of the title,<lb/>
with which he greeted the old major banteringly as<lb/>
soon as the latter's soldierly figure appeared in the doorway.<lb/>
Don P&eacute;p&eacute; only smiled in his long moustaches, as<lb/>
much as to say, "You might have found a worse name<lb/>
for an old soldier."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And El Se&ntilde;or Gobernador he had remained, with his<lb/>
small jokes upon his function and upon his domain,<lb/>


<pb n="100"/>

where he affirmed with humorous exaggeration to Mrs.<lb/>
Gould &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No two stones could come together anywhere without<lb/>
the Gobernador hearing the click, se&ntilde;ora."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And he would tap his ear with the tip of his forefinger<lb/>
knowingly. Even when the number of the miners alone<lb/>
rose to over six hundred he seemed to know each of them<lb/>
individually, all the innumerable Jos&eacute;s, Manuels,<lb/>
Ignacios, from the villages primero &mdash; segundo &mdash; or<lb/>
tercero (there were three mining villages) under his<lb/>
government. He could distinguish them not only by<lb/>
their flat, joyless faces, which to Mrs. Gould looked all<lb/>
alike, as if run into the same ancestral mould of suffering<lb/>
and patience, but apparently also by the infinitely<lb/>
graduated shades of reddish-brown, of blackish-brown,<lb/>
of coppery-brown backs, as the two shifts, stripped to<lb/>
linen drawers and leather skull-caps, mingled together<lb/>
with a confusion of naked limbs, of shouldered picks,<lb/>
swinging lamps, in a great shuffle of sandalled feet on<lb/>
the open plateau before the entrance of the main<lb/>
tunnel. It was a time of pause. The Indian boys<lb/>
leaned idly against the long line of little cradle wagons<lb/>
standing empty; the screeners and ore-breakers squatted<lb/>
on their heels smoking long cigars; the great wooden<lb/>
shoots slanting over the edge of the tunnel plateau were<lb/>
silent; and only the ceaseless, violent rush of water in<lb/>
the open flumes could be heard, murmuring fiercely,<lb/>
with the splash and rumble of revolving turbine-<lb/>
wheels, and the thudding march of the stamps pounding<lb/>
to powder the treasure rock on the plateau below.<lb/>
The heads of gangs, distinguished by brass medals<lb/>
hanging on their bare breasts, marshalled their squads;<lb/>
and at last the mountain would swallow one-half of the<lb/>
silent crowd, while the other half would move off in long<lb/>
files down the zigzag paths leading to the bottom of the<lb/>


<pb n="101"/>

gorge. It was deep; and, far below, a thread of vegetation<lb/>
winding between the blazing rock faces resembled<lb/>
a slender green cord, in which three lumpy knots of<lb/>
banana patches, palm-leaf roots, and shady trees<lb/>
marked the Village One, Village Two, Village Three,<lb/>
housing the miners of the Gould Concession.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Whole families had been moving from the first<lb/>
towards the spot in the Higuerota range, whence the<lb/>
rumour of work and safety had spread over the pastoral<lb/>
Campo, forcing its way also, even as the waters of a high<lb/>
flood, into the nooks and crannies of the distant blue<lb/>
walls of the Sierras. Father first, in a pointed straw<lb/>
hat, then the mother with the bigger children, generally<lb/>
also a diminutive donkey, all under burdens, except the<lb/>
leader himself, or perhaps some grown girl, the pride of<lb/>
the family, stepping barefooted and straight as an<lb/>
arrow, with braids of raven hair, a thick, haughty profile,<lb/>
and no load to carry but the small guitar of the<lb/>
country and a pair of soft leather sandals tied together<lb/>
on her back. At the sight of such parties strung out on<lb/>
the cross trails between the pastures, or camped by the<lb/>
side of the royal road, travellers on horseback would<lb/>
remark to each other &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "More people going to the San Tom&eacute; mine. We<lb/>
shall see others to-morrow."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And spurring on in the dusk they would discuss the<lb/>
great news of the province, the news of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mine. A rich Englishman was going to work it &mdash; and<lb/>
perhaps not an Englishman, <hi rend="italic">Quien sabe!</hi> A foreigner<lb/>
with much money. Oh, yes, it had begun. A party of<lb/>
men who had been to Sulaco with a herd of black bulls<lb/>
for the next corrida had reported that from the porch<lb/>
of the posada in Rincon, only a short league from the<lb/>
town, the lights on the mountain were visible, twinkling<lb/>
above the trees. And there was a woman seen riding<lb/>


<pb n="103"/>

a horse sideways, not in the chair seat, but upon a sort<lb/>
of saddle, and a man's hat on her head. She walked<lb/>
about, too, on foot up the mountain paths. A woman<lb/>
engineer, it seemed she was.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What an absurdity! Impossible, se&ntilde;or!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Si! Si! Una Americana del Norte</hi>."<lb/>
</p>

<p> "Ah, well! if your worship is informed. <hi rend="italic">Una Americana;</hi><lb/>
it need be something of that sort."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And they would laugh a little with astonishment and<lb/>
scorn, keeping a wary eye on the shadows of the road,<lb/>
for one is liable to meet bad men when travelling late on<lb/>
the Campo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And it was not only the men that Don P&eacute;p&eacute; knew so<lb/>
well, but he seemed able, with one attentive, thoughtful<lb/>
glance, to classify each woman, girl, or growing youth<lb/>
of his domain. It was only the small fry that puzzled<lb/>
him sometimes. He and the padre could be seen<lb/>
frequently side by side, meditative and gazing across the<lb/>
street of a village at a lot of sedate brown children, trying<lb/>
to sort them out, as it were, in low, consulting tones,<lb/>
or else they would together put searching questions as<lb/>
to the parentage of some small, staid urchin met<lb/>
wandering, naked and grave, along the road with a<lb/>
cigar in his baby mouth, and perhaps his mother's<lb/>
rosary, purloined for purposes of ornamentation, hanging<lb/>
in a loop of beads low down on his rotund little<lb/>
stomach. The spiritual and temporal pastors of the<lb/>
mine flock were very good friends. With Dr. Monygham,<lb/>
the medical pastor, who had accepted the charge<lb/>
from Mrs. Gould, and lived in the hospital building,<lb/>
they were on not so intimate terms. But no one could<lb/>
be on intimate terms with El Se&ntilde;or Doctor, who, with<lb/>
his twisted shoulders, drooping head, sardonic mouth,<lb/>
and side-long bitter glance, was mysterious and uncanny.<lb/>
The other two authorities worked in harmony.<lb/>


<pb n="103"/>

Father Roman, dried-up, small, alert, wrinkled,<lb/>
with big round eyes, a sharp chin, and a great snuff-<lb/>
taker, was an old campaigner, too; he had shriven<lb/>
many simple souls on the battlefields of the Republic,<lb/>
kneeling by the dying on hillsides, in the long grass,<lb/>
in the gloom of the forests, to hear the last confession<lb/>
with the smell of gunpowder smoke in his nostrils, the<lb/>
rattle of muskets, the hum and spatter of bullets in his<lb/>
ears. And where was the harm if, at the presbytery,<lb/>
they had a game with a pack of greasy cards in the<lb/>
early evening, before Don P&eacute;p&eacute; went his last rounds to<lb/>
see that all the watchmen of the mine &mdash; a body organized<lb/>
by himself &mdash; were at their posts? For that last<lb/>
duty before he slept Don P&eacute;p&eacute; did actually gird his old<lb/>
sword on the verandah of an unmistakable American<lb/>
white frame house, which Father Roman called the<lb/>
presbytery. Near by, a long, low, dark building,<lb/>
steeple-roofed, like a vast barn with a wooden cross<lb/>
over the gable, was the miners' chapel. There Father<lb/>
Roman said Mass every day before a sombre altar-<lb/>
piece representing the Resurrection, the grey slab of the<lb/>
tombstone balanced on one corner, a figure soaring upwards,<lb/>
long-limbed and livid, in an oval of pallid light,<lb/>
and a helmeted brown legionary smitten down, right<lb/>
across the bituminous foreground. "This picture, my<lb/>
children, <hi rend="italic">muy linda e maravillosa</hi>," Father Roman would<lb/>
say to some of his flock, "which you behold here through<lb/>
the munificence of the wife of our Se&ntilde;or Administrador,<lb/>
has been painted in Europe, a country of saints and<lb/>
miracles, and much greater than our Costaguana."<lb/>
And he would take a pinch of snuff with unction. But<lb/>
when once an inquisitive spirit desired to know in what<lb/>
direction this Europe was situated, whether up or down<lb/>
the coast, Father Roman, to conceal his perplexity, became<lb/>
very reserved and severe. "No doubt it is<lb/>


<pb n="104"/>

extremely far away. But ignorant sinners like you of<lb/>
the San Tom&eacute; mine should think earnestly of ever-<lb/>
lasting punishment instead of inquiring into the<lb/>
magnitude of the earth, with its countries and populations<lb/>
altogether beyond your understanding."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With a "Good-night, Padre," "Good-night, Don<lb/>
P&eacute;p&eacute;," the Gobernador would go off, holding up his<lb/>
sabre against his side, his body bent forward, with a<lb/>
long, plodding stride in the dark. The jocularity<lb/>
proper to an innocent card game for a few cigars or a<lb/>
bundle of yerba was replaced at once by the stern duty<lb/>
mood of an officer setting out to visit the outposts of an<lb/>
encamped army. One loud blast of the whistle that<lb/>
hung from his neck provoked instantly a great shrilling<lb/>
of responding whistles, mingled with the barking of<lb/>
dogs, that would calm down slowly at last, away up at<lb/>
the head of the gorge; and in the stillness two serenos,<lb/>
on guard by the bridge, would appear walking noiselessly<lb/>
towards him. On one side of the road a long<lb/>
frame building &mdash; the store &mdash; would be closed and barricaded<lb/>
from end to end; facing it another white frame<lb/>
house, still longer, and with a verandah &mdash; the hospital &mdash;<lb/>
would have lights in the two windows of Dr. Monygham's<lb/>
quarters. Even the delicate foliage of a clump of<lb/>
pepper trees did not stir, so breathless would be the<lb/>
darkness warmed by the radiation of the over-heated<lb/>
rocks. Don P&eacute;p&eacute; would stand still for a moment with<lb/>
the two motionless serenos before him, and, abruptly,<lb/>
high up on the sheer face of the mountain, dotted with<lb/>
single torches, like drops of fire fallen from the two great<lb/>
blazing clusters of lights above, the ore shoots would<lb/>
begin to rattle. The great clattering, shuffling noise,<lb/>
gathering speed and weight, would be caught up by the<lb/>
walls of the gorge, and sent upon the plain in a growl of<lb/>
thunder. The pasadero in Rincon swore that on calm<lb/>


<pb n="103"/>

nights, by listening intently, he could catch the sound<lb/>
in his doorway as of a storm in the mountains.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     To Charles Gould's fancy it seemed that the sound<lb/>
must reach the uttermost limits of the province. Riding<lb/>
at night towards the mine, it would meet him at the<lb/>
edge of a little wood just beyond Rincon. There was<lb/>
no mistaking the growling mutter of the mountain<lb/>
pouring its stream of treasure under the stamps; and it<lb/>
came to his heart with the peculiar force of a proclamation<lb/>
thundered forth over the land and the marvellousness<lb/>
of an accomplished fact fulfilling an audacious<lb/>
desire. He had heard this very sound in his imagination<lb/>
on that far-off evening when his wife and himself,<lb/>
after a tortuous ride through a strip of forest,<lb/>
had reined in their horses near the stream, and had<lb/>
gazed for the first time upon the jungle-grown solitude<lb/>
of the gorge. The head of a palm rose here<lb/>
and there. In a high ravine round the corner of the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mountain (which is square like a block-<lb/>
house) the thread of a slender waterfall flashed bright<lb/>
and glassy through the dark green of the heavy fronds<lb/>
of tree-ferns. Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, in attendance, rode up,<lb/>
and, stretching his arm up the gorge, had declared<lb/>
with mock solemnity, "Behold the very paradise of<lb/>
snakes, se&ntilde;ora."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And then they had wheeled their horses and ridden<lb/>
back to sleep that night at Rincon. The alcalde &mdash; an<lb/>
old, skinny Moreno, a sergeant of Guzman Bento's<lb/>
time &mdash; had cleared respectfully out of his house with his<lb/>
three pretty daughters, to make room for the foreign<lb/>
se&ntilde;ora and their worships the Caballeros. All he asked<lb/>
Charles Gould (whom he took for a mysterious and<lb/>
official person) to do for him was to remind the supreme<lb/>
Government &mdash; El Gobierno supreme &mdash; of a pension<lb/>
(amounting to about a dollar a month) to which he<lb/>


<pb n="106"/>

believed himself entitled. It had been promised to<lb/>
him, he affirmed, straightening his bent back martially,<lb/>
"many years ago, for my valour in the wars with the<lb/>
wild Indios when a young man, se&ntilde;or."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The waterfall existed no longer. The tree-ferns that<lb/>
had luxuriated in its spray had died around the dried-<lb/>
up pool, and the high ravine was only a big trench half<lb/>
filled up with the refuse of excavations and tailings.<lb/>
The torrent, dammed up above, sent its water rushing<lb/>
along the open flumes of scooped tree trunks striding on<lb/>
trestle-legs to the turbines working the stamps on the<lb/>
lower plateau &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">mesa grande</hi> of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mountain. Only the memory of the waterfall, with its<lb/>
amazing fernery, like a hanging garden above the rocks<lb/>
of the gorge, was preserved in Mrs. Gould's water-<lb/>
colour sketch; she had made it hastily one day from a<lb/>
cleared patch in the bushes, sitting in the shade of a<lb/>
roof of straw erected for her on three rough poles under<lb/>
Don P&eacute;p&eacute;'s direction.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould had seen it all from the beginning: the<lb/>
clearing of the wilderness, the making of the road, the<lb/>
cutting of new paths up the cliff face of San Tom&eacute;. For<lb/>
weeks together she had lived on the spot with her husband;<lb/>
and she was so little in Sulaco during that year<lb/>
that the appearance of the Gould carriage on the<lb/>
Alameda would cause a social excitement. From the<lb/>
heavy family coaches full of stately se&ntilde;oras and black-<lb/>
eyed se&ntilde;oritas rolling solemnly in the shaded alley white<lb/>
hands were waved towards her with animation in a<lb/>
flutter of greetings. Do&ntilde;a Emilia was "down from the<lb/>
mountain."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But not for long. Do&ntilde;a Emilia would be gone "up to<lb/>
the mountain" in a day or two, and her sleek carriage<lb/>
mules would have an easy time of it for another long<lb/>
spell. She had watched the erection of the first frame-<lb/>


<pb n="107"/>

house put up on the lower mesa for an office and Don<lb/>
P&eacute;p&eacute;'s quarters; she heard with a thrill of thankful<lb/>
emotion the first wagon load of ore rattle down the then<lb/>
only shoot; she had stood by her husband's side perfectly<lb/>
silent, and gone cold all over with excitement at<lb/>
the instant when the first battery of only fifteen stamps<lb/>
was put in motion for the first time. On the occasion<lb/>
when the fires under the first set of retorts in their shed<lb/>
had glowed far into the night she did not retire to rest<lb/>
on the rough cadre set up for her in the as yet bare<lb/>
frame-house till she had seen the first spongy lump of<lb/>
silver yielded to the hazards of the world by the dark<lb/>
depths of the Gould Concession; she had laid her unmercenary<lb/>
hands, with an eagerness that made them<lb/>
tremble, upon the first silver ingot turned out still warm<lb/>
from the mould; and by her imaginative estimate of its<lb/>
power she endowed that lump of metal with a justificative<lb/>
conception, as though it were not a mere fact,<lb/>
but something far-reaching and impalpable, like the<lb/>
true expression of an emotion or the emergence of a<lb/>
principle.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, extremely interested, too, looked over her<lb/>
shoulder with a smile that, making longitudinal folds<lb/>
on his face, caused it to resemble a leathern mask with a<lb/>
benignantly diabolic expression.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Would not the muchachos of Hernandez like to get<lb/>
hold of this insignificant object, that looks, por Dios,<lb/>
very much like a piece of tin?" he remarked, jocularly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Hernandez, the robber, had been an inoffensive, small<lb/>
ranchero, kidnapped with circumstances of peculiar<lb/>
atrocity from his home during one of the civil wars, and<lb/>
forced to serve in the army. There his conduct as<lb/>
soldier was exemplary, till, watching his chance, he<lb/>
killed his colonel, and managed to get clear away. With<lb/>
a band of deserters, who chose him for their chief, he had<lb/>


<pb n="108"/>

taken refuge beyond the wild and waterless Bolson de<lb/>
Tonoro. The haciendas paid him blackmail in cattle<lb/>
and horses; extraordinary stories were told of his powers<lb/>
and of his wonderful escapes from capture. He used<lb/>
to ride, single-handed, into the villages and the little<lb/>
towns on the Campo, driving a pack mule before him,<lb/>
with two revolvers in his belt, go straight to the shop or<lb/>
store, select what he wanted, and ride away unopposed<lb/>
because of the terror his exploits and his audacity inspired.<lb/>
Poor country people he usually left alone; the<lb/>
upper class were often stopped on the roads and robbed;<lb/>
but any unlucky official that fell into his hands was sure<lb/>
to get a severe flogging. The army officers did not like<lb/>
his name to be mentioned in their presence. His<lb/>
followers, mounted on stolen horses, laughed at the pursuit<lb/>
of the regular cavalry sent to hunt them down, and<lb/>
whom they took pleasure to ambush most scientifically<lb/>
in the broken ground of their own fastness. Expeditions<lb/>
had been fitted out; a price had been put upon his<lb/>
head; even attempts had been made, treacherously of<lb/>
course, to open negotiations with him, without in the<lb/>
slightest way affecting the even tenor of his career. At<lb/>
last, in true Costaguana fashion, the Fiscal of Tonoro,<lb/>
who was ambitious of the glory of having reduced the<lb/>
famous Hernandez, offered him a sum of money and a<lb/>
safe conduct out of the country for the betrayal of his<lb/>
band. But Hernandez evidently was not of the stuff<lb/>
of which the distinguished military politicians and<lb/>
conspirators of Costaguana are made. This clever but<lb/>
common device (which frequently works like a charm<lb/>
in putting down revolutions) failed with the chief of<lb/>
vulgar Salteadores. It promised well for the Fiscal at<lb/>
first, but ended very badly for the squadron of lanceros<lb/>
posted (by the Fiscal's directions) in a fold of the ground<lb/>
into which Hernandez had promised to lead his unsuspecting<lb/>


<pb n="109"/>

followers  They came, indeed, at the appointed<lb/>
time, but creeping on their hands and knees<lb/>
through the bush, and only let their presence be known<lb/>
by a general discharge of firearms, which emptied<lb/>
many saddles. The troopers who escaped came riding<lb/>
very hard into Tonoro. It is said that their commanding<lb/>
officer (who, being better mounted, rode far ahead of the<lb/>
rest) afterwards got into a state of despairing intoxication<lb/>
and beat the ambitious Fiscal severely with<lb/>
the flat of his sabre in the presence of his wife and<lb/>
daughters, for bringing this disgrace upon the National<lb/>
Army. The highest civil official of Tonoro, falling to<lb/>
the ground in a swoon, was further kicked all over the<lb/>
body and rowelled with sharp spurs about the neck and<lb/>
face because of the great sensitiveness of his military<lb/>
colleague. This gossip of the inland Campo, so<lb/>
characteristic of the rulers of the country with its<lb/>
story of oppression, inefficiency, fatuous methods,<lb/>
treachery, and savage brutality, was perfectly known<lb/>
to Mrs. Gould. That it should be accepted with no<lb/>
indignant comment by people of intelligence, refinement,<lb/>
and character as something inherent in the nature of<lb/>
things was one of the symptoms of degradation that had<lb/>
the power to exasperate her almost to the verge of<lb/>
despair. Still looking at the ingot of silver, she shook<lb/>
her head at Don P&eacute;p&eacute;'s remark &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "If it had not been for the lawless tyranny of your<lb/>
Government, Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, many an outlaw now with<lb/>
Hernandez would be living peaceably and happy by the<lb/>
honest work of his hands."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Se&ntilde;ora," cried Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, with enthusiasm, "it is<lb/>
true! It is as if God had given you the power to look<lb/>
into the very breasts of people. You have seen them<lb/>
working round you, Do&ntilde;a Emilia &mdash; meek as lambs,<lb/>
patient like their own burros, brave like lions. I have<lb/>


<pb n="110"/>

led them to the very muzzles of guns &mdash; I, who stand<lb/>
here before you, se&ntilde;ora &mdash; in the time of Paez, who was<lb/>
full of generosity, and in courage only approached by<lb/>
the uncle of Don Carlos here, as far as I know. No<lb/>
wonder there are bandits in the Campo when there are<lb/>
none but thieves, swindlers, and sanguinary macaques<lb/>
to rule us in Sta. Marta. However, all the same, a<lb/>
bandit is a bandit, and we shall have a dozen good<lb/>
straight Winchesters to ride with the silver down to<lb/>
Sulaco."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould's ride with the first silver escort to Sulaco<lb/>
was the closing episode of what she called "my camp<lb/>
life" before she had settled in her town-house permanently,<lb/>
as was proper and even necessary for the wife<lb/>
of the administrator of such an important institution as<lb/>
the San Tom&eacute; mine. For the San Tom&eacute; mine was to<lb/>
become an institution, a rallying point for everything<lb/>
in the province that needed order and stability to live.<lb/>
Security seemed to flow upon this land from the<lb/>
mountain-gorge. The authorities of Sulaco had learned<lb/>
that the San Tom&eacute; mine could make it worth their while<lb/>
to leave things and people alone. This was the nearest<lb/>
approach to the rule of common-sense and justice<lb/>
Charles Gould felt it possible to secure at first. In fact,<lb/>
the mine, with its organization, its population growing<lb/>
fiercely attached to their position of privileged safety,<lb/>
with its armoury, with its Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, with its armed<lb/>
body of serenos (where, it was said, many an outlaw and<lb/>
deserter &mdash; and even some members of Hernandez's<lb/>
band &mdash; had found a place), the mine was a power in the<lb/>
land. As a certain prominent man in Sta. Marta had<lb/>
exclaimed with a hollow laugh, once, when discussing<lb/>
the line of action taken by the Sulaco authorities at a<lb/>
time of political crisis &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You call these men Government officials? They?<lb/>


<pb n="111"/>

Never! They are officials of the mine &mdash;
officials of the<lb/>
Concession &mdash; I tell you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The prominent man (who was then a person in power,<lb/>
with a lemon-coloured face and a very short and curly,<lb/>
not to say woolly, head of hair) went so far in his<lb/>
temporary discontent as to shake his yellow fist under<lb/>
the nose of his interlocutor, and shriek &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes! All! Silence! All! I tell you! The political<lb/>
G&eacute;f&eacute;, the chief of the police, the chief of the customs, the<lb/>
general, all, all, are the officials of that Gould."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Thereupon an intrepid but low and argumentative<lb/>
murmur would flow on for a space in the ministerial<lb/>
cabinet, and the prominent man's passion would end<lb/>
in a cynical shrug of the shoulders. After all, he seemed<lb/>
to say, what did it matter as long as the minister himself<lb/>
was not forgotten during his brief day of authority?<lb/>
But all the same, the unofficial agent of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mine, working for a good cause, had his moments of<lb/>
anxiety, which were reflected in his letters to Don Jos&eacute;<lb/>
Avellanos, his maternal uncle.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No sanguinary macaque from Sta. Marta shall set<lb/>
foot on that part of Costaguana which lies beyond the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; bridge," Don P&eacute;p&eacute; used to assure Mrs.<lb/>
Gould. "Except, of course, as an honoured guest &mdash;<lb/>
for our Se&ntilde;or Administrador is a deep politico." But<lb/>
to Charles Gould, in his own room, the old Major would<lb/>
remark with a grim and soldierly cheeriness, "We are<lb/>
all playing our heads at this game."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos would mutter "Imperium in<lb/>
imperio, Emilia, my soul," with an air of profound self-<lb/>
satisfaction which, somehow, in a curious way, seemed<lb/>
to contain a queer admixture of bodily discomfort.<lb/>
But that, perhaps, could only be visible to the initiated.<lb/>
And for the initiated it was a wonderful place, this<lb/>
drawing-room of the Casa Gould, with its momentary<lb/>


<pb n="112"/>

glimpses of the master &mdash; El Se&ntilde;or Administrador &mdash;<lb/>
older, harder, mysteriously silent, with the lines<lb/>
deepened on his English, ruddy, out-of-doors complexion;<lb/>
flitting on his thin cavalryman's legs across the<lb/>
doorways, either just "back from the mountain"<lb/>
or with jingling spurs and riding-whip under his arm, on<lb/>
the point of starting "for the mountain."   Then<lb/>
Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, modestly martial in his chair, the llanero<lb/>
who seemed somehow to have found his martial<lb/>
jocularity, his knowledge of the world, and his manner<lb/>
perfect for his station, in the midst of savage armed<lb/>
contests with his kind; Avellanos, polished and<lb/>
familiar, the diplomatist with his loquacity covering<lb/>
much caution and wisdom in delicate advice, with his<lb/>
manuscript of a historical work on Costaguana,<lb/>
entitled "Fifty Years of Misrule," which, at present, he<lb/>
thought it was not prudent (even if it were possible)<lb/>
"to give to the world"; these three, and also Do&ntilde;a<lb/>
Emilia amongst them, gracious, small, and fairy-like,<lb/>
before the glittering tea-set, with one common master-<lb/>
thought in their heads, with one common feeling of a<lb/>
tense situation, with one ever-present aim to preserve<lb/>
the inviolable character of the mine at every cost.<lb/>
And there was also to be seen Captain Mitchell, a<lb/>
little apart, near one of the long windows, with an air<lb/>
of old-fashioned neat old bachelorhood about him,<lb/>
slightly pompous, in a white waistcoat, a little disregarded<lb/>
and unconscious of it; utterly in the dark, and<lb/>
imagining himself to be in the thick of things. The<lb/>
good man, having spent a clear thirty years of his life<lb/>
on the high seas before getting what he called a "shore<lb/>
billet," was astonished at the importance of transactions<lb/>
(other than relating to shipping) which take<lb/>
place on dry land. Almost every event out of the<lb/>
usual daily course "marked an epoch" for him or else<lb/>


<pb n="113"/>

was "history"; unless with his pomposity struggling<lb/>
with a discomfited droop of his rubicund, rather handsome<lb/>
face, set off by snow-white close hair and short<lb/>
whiskers, he would mutter &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, that! That, sir, was a mistake."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The reception of the first consignment of San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
silver for shipment to San Francisco in one of the O.S.N.<lb/>
Co.'s mail-boats had, of course, "marked an epoch" for<lb/>
Captain Mitchell. The ingots packed in boxes of stiff<lb/>
ox-hide with plaited handles, small enough to be carried<lb/>
easily by two men, were brought down by the serenos of<lb/>
the mine walking in careful couples along the half-<lb/>
mile or so of steep, zigzag paths to the foot of the<lb/>
mountain. There they would be loaded into a string<lb/>
of two-wheeled carts, resembling roomy coffers with a<lb/>
door at the back, and harnessed tandem with two<lb/>
mules each, waiting under the guard of armed and<lb/>
mounted serenos. Don P&eacute;p&eacute; padlocked each door in<lb/>
succession, and at the signal of his whistle the string of<lb/>
carts would move off, closely surrounded by the clank<lb/>
of spur and carbine, with jolts and cracking of whips,<lb/>
with a sudden deep rumble over the boundary bridge<lb/>
("into the land of thieves and sanguinary macaques,"<lb/>
Don P&eacute;p&eacute; defined that crossing); hats bobbing in the<lb/>
first light of the dawn, on the heads of cloaked figures;<lb/>
Winchesters on hip; bridle hands protruding lean and<lb/>
brown from under the falling folds of the ponchos. The<lb/>
convoy skirting a little wood, along the mine trail, between<lb/>
the mud huts and low walls of Rincon, increased<lb/>
its pace on the <hi rend="italic">camino real</hi>, mules urged to speed, escort<lb/>
galloping, Don Carlos riding alone ahead of a dust storm<lb/>
affording a vague vision of long ears of mules, of fluttering<lb/>
little green and white flags stuck upon each cart;<lb/>
of raised arms in a mob of sombreros with the white<lb/>
gleam of ranging eyes; and Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, hardly visible in<lb/>


<pb n="114"/>

the rear of that rattling dust trail, with a stiff seat and<lb/>
impassive face, rising and falling rhythmically on an<lb/>
ewe-necked silver-bitted black brute with a hammer<lb/>
head.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The sleepy people in the little clusters of huts, in the<lb/>
small ranches near the road, recognized by the headlong<lb/>
sound the charge of the San Tom&eacute; silver escort towards<lb/>
the crumbling wall of the city on the Campo side.<lb/>
They came to the doors to see it dash by over ruts and<lb/>
stones, with a clatter and clank and cracking of whips,<lb/>
with the reckless rush and precise driving of a field<lb/>
battery hurrying into action, and the solitary English<lb/>
figure of the Se&ntilde;or Administrador riding far ahead in<lb/>
the lead.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the fenced roadside paddocks loose horses galloped<lb/>
wildly for a while; the heavy cattle stood up breast deep<lb/>
in the grass, lowing mutteringly at the flying noise; a<lb/>
meek Indian villager would glance back once and<lb/>
hasten to shove his loaded little donkey bodily against<lb/>
a wall, out of the way of the San Tom&eacute; silver escort<lb/>
going to the sea; a small knot of chilly leperos under the<lb/>
Stone Horse of the Alameda would mutter: "Caramba!"<lb/>
on seeing it take a wide curve at a gallop and dart into<lb/>
the empty Street of the Constitution; for it was considered<lb/>
the correct thing, the only proper style by the<lb/>
mule-drivers of the San Tom&eacute; mine to go through the<lb/>
waking town from end to end without a check in the<lb/>
speed as if chased by a devil.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The early sunshine glowed on the delicate primrose,<lb/>
pale pink, pale blue fronts of the big houses with all<lb/>
their gates shut yet, and no face behind the iron bars<lb/>
of the windows. In the whole sunlit range of empty<lb/>
balconies along the street only one white figure would be<lb/>
visible high up above the clear pavement &mdash; the wife of<lb/>
the Se&ntilde;or Administrador &mdash; leaning over to see the escort<lb/>


<pb n="115"/>

go by to the harbour, a mass of heavy, fair hair twisted<lb/>
up negligently on her little head, and a lot of lace about<lb/>
the neck of her muslin wrapper. With a smile to her<lb/>
husband's single, quick, upward glance, she would watch<lb/>
the whole thing stream past below her feet with an<lb/>
orderly uproar, till she answered by a friendly sign the<lb/>
salute of the galloping Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, the stiff, deferential<lb/>
inclination with a sweep of the hat below the knee.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The string of padlocked carts lengthened, the size of<lb/>
the escort grew bigger as the years went on. Every<lb/>
three months an increasing stream of treasure swept<lb/>
through the streets of Sulaco on its way to the strong<lb/>
room in the O.S.N. Co.'s building by the harbour,<lb/>
there to await shipment for the North. Increasing in<lb/>
volume, and of immense value also; for, as Charles<lb/>
Gould told his wife once with some exultation, there had<lb/>
never been seen anything in the world to approach the<lb/>
vein of the Gould Concession. For them both, each<lb/>
passing of the escort under the balconies of the Casa<lb/>
Gould was like another victory gained in the conquest<lb/>
of peace for Sulaco.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     No doubt the initial action of Charles Gould had been<lb/>
helped at the beginning by a period of comparative<lb/>
peace which occurred just about that time; and also by<lb/>
the general softening of manners as compared with the<lb/>
epoch of civil wars whence had emerged the iron<lb/>
tyranny of Guzman Bento of fearful memory. In the<lb/>
contests that broke out at the end of his rule (which had<lb/>
kept peace in the country for a whole fifteen years)<lb/>
there was more fatuous imbecility, plenty of cruelty and<lb/>
suffering still, but much less of the old-time fierce and<lb/>
blindly ferocious political fanaticism. It was all more<lb/>
vile, more base, more contemptible, and infinitely more<lb/>
manageable in the very outspoken cynicism of motives.<lb/>
It was more clearly a brazen-faced scramble for a constantly<lb/>


<pb n="116"/>

diminishing quantity of booty; since all enterprise<lb/>
had been stupidly killed in the land. Thus it<lb/>
came to pass that the province of Sulaco, once the field<lb/>
of cruel party vengeances, had become in a way one of<lb/>
the considerable prizes of political career. The great of<lb/>
the earth (in Sta. Marta) reserved the posts in the old<lb/>
Occidental State to those nearest and dearest to them:<lb/>
nephews, brothers, husbands of favourite sisters, bosom<lb/>
friends, trusty supporters &mdash; or prominent supporters of<lb/>
whom perhaps they were afraid. It was the blessed<lb/>
province of great opportunities and of largest salaries;<lb/>
for the San Tom&eacute; mine had its own unofficial pay list,<lb/>
whose items and amounts, fixed in consultation by<lb/>
Charles Gould and Se&ntilde;or Avellanos, were known to a<lb/>
prominent business man in the United States, who for<lb/>
twenty minutes or so in every month gave his undivided<lb/>
attention to Sulaco affairs. At the same time the<lb/>
material interests of all sorts, backed up by the influence<lb/>
of the San Tom&eacute; mine, were quietly gathering<lb/>
substance in that part of the Republic. If, for instance,<lb/>
the Sulaco Collectorship was generally understood, in<lb/>
the political world of the capital, to open the way to the<lb/>
Ministry of Finance, and so on for every official post,<lb/>
then, on the other hand, the despondent business circles<lb/>
of the Republic had come to consider the Occidental<lb/>
Province as the promised land of safety, especially if a<lb/>
man managed to get on good terms with the administration<lb/>
of the mine. "Charles Gould; excellent fellow!<lb/>
Absolutely necessary to make sure of him before taking<lb/>
a single step. Get an introduction to him from Moraga<lb/>
if you can &mdash; the agent of the King of Sulaco, don't you<lb/>
know."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     No wonder, then, that Sir John, coming from Europe<lb/>
to smooth the path for his railway, had been meeting the<lb/>
name (and even the nickname) of Charles Gould at<lb/>


<pb n="117"/>

every turn in Costaguana. The agent of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
Administration in Sta. Marta (a polished, well-informed<lb/>
gentleman, Sir John thought him) had certainly helped<lb/>
so greatly in bringing about the presidential tour that he<lb/>
began to think that there was something in the faint<lb/>
whispers hinting at the immense occult influence of<lb/>
the Gould Concession. What was currently whispered<lb/>
was this &mdash; that the San Tom&eacute; Administration had, in<lb/>
part, at least, financed the last revolution, which had<lb/>
brought into a five-year dictatorship Don Vincente<lb/>
Ribiera, a man of culture and of unblemished character,<lb/>
invested with a mandate of reform by the best elements<lb/>
of the State. Serious, well-informed men seemed to<lb/>
believe the fact, to hope for better things, for the<lb/>
establishment of legality, of good faith and order in<lb/>
public life. So much the better, then, thought Sir John.<lb/>
He worked always on a great scale; there was a loan to<lb/>
the State, and a project for systematic colonization of<lb/>
the Occidental Province, involved in one vast scheme<lb/>
with the construction of the National Central Railway.<lb/>
Good faith, order, honesty, peace, were badly wanted<lb/>
for this great development of material interests. Anybody<lb/>
on the side of these things, and especially if able<lb/>
to help, had an importance in Sir John's eyes. He had<lb/>
not been disappointed in the "King of Sulaco." The<lb/>
local difficulties had fallen away, as the engineer-in-chief<lb/>
had foretold they would, before Charles Gould's mediation.<lb/>
Sir John had been extremely f&ecirc;ted in Sulaco,<lb/>
next to the President-Dictator, a fact which might have<lb/>
accounted for the evident ill-humour General Montero<lb/>
displayed at lunch given on board the <hi rend="italic">Juno</hi> just before<lb/>
she was to sail, taking away from Sulaco the President-<lb/>
Dictator and the distinguished foreign guests in his<lb/>
train.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Excellentissimo ("the hope of honest men," as<lb/>


<pb n="118"/>

Don Jos&eacute; had addressed him in a public speech delivered<lb/>
in the name of the Provincial Assembly of Sulaco) sat at<lb/>
the head of the long table; Captain Mitchell, positively<lb/>
stony-eyed and purple in the face with the solemnity of<lb/>
this "historical event," occupied the foot as the representative<lb/>
of the O.S.N. Company in Sulaco, the hosts of<lb/>
that informal function, with the captain of the ship and<lb/>
some minor officials from the shore around him. Those<lb/>
cheery, swarthy little gentlemen cast jovial side-glances<lb/>
at the bottles of champagne beginning to pop behind<lb/>
the guests' backs in the hands of the ship's stewards.<lb/>
The amber wine creamed up to the rims of the glasses.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould had his place next to a foreign envoy,<lb/>
who, in a listless undertone, had been talking to him<lb/>
fitfully of hunting and shooting. The well-nourished,<lb/>
pale face, with an eyeglass and drooping yellow moustache,<lb/>
made the Se&ntilde;or Administrador appear by contrast<lb/>
twice as sunbaked, more flaming red, a hundred<lb/>
times more intensely and silently alive. Don Jos&eacute;<lb/>
Avellanos touched elbows with the other foreign diplomat,<lb/>
a dark man with a quiet, watchful, self-confident<lb/>
demeanour, and a touch of reserve. All etiquette being<lb/>
laid aside on the occasion, General Montero was the<lb/>
only one there in full uniform, so stiff with embroideries<lb/>
in front that his broad chest seemed protected by a<lb/>
cuirass of gold. Sir John at the beginning had got<lb/>
away from high places for the sake of sitting near Mrs.<lb/>
Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The great financier was trying to express to her his<lb/>
grateful sense of her hospitality and of his obligation to<lb/>
her husband's "enormous influence in this part of the<lb/>
country," when she interrupted him by a low "Hush!"<lb/>
The President was going to make an informal pronouncement.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    The Excellentissimo was on his legs. He said only a<lb/>


<pb n="119"/>

few words, evidently deeply felt, and meant perhaps<lb/>
mostly for Avellanos &mdash; his old friend &mdash; as to the necessity<lb/>
of unremitting effort to secure the lasting welfare of the<lb/>
country emerging after this last struggle, he hoped, into<lb/>
a period of peace and material prosperity.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould, listening to the mellow, slightly mournful<lb/>
voice, looking at this rotund, dark, spectacled face,<lb/>
at the short body, obese to the point of infirmity,<lb/>
thought that this man of delicate and melancholy mind,<lb/>
physically almost a cripple, coming out of his retirement<lb/>
into a dangerous strife at the call of his fellows,<lb/>
had the right to speak with the authority of his self-<lb/>
sacrifice. And yet she was made uneasy. He was<lb/>
more pathetic than promising, this first civilian Chief of<lb/>
the State Costaguana had ever known, pronouncing,<lb/>
glass in hand, his simple watchwords of honesty, peace,<lb/>
respect for law, political good faith abroad and at<lb/>
home &mdash; the safeguards of national honour.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He sat down. During the respectful, appreciative<lb/>
buzz of voices that followed the speech, General<lb/>
Montero raised a pair of heavy, drooping eyelids and<lb/>
rolled his eyes with a sort of uneasy dullness from face<lb/>
to face. The military backwoods hero of the party,<lb/>
though secretly impressed by the sudden novelties and<lb/>
splendours of his position (he had never been on board a<lb/>
ship before, and had hardly ever seen the sea except<lb/>
from a distance), understood by a sort of instinct the<lb/>
advantage his surly, unpolished attitude of a savage<lb/>
fighter gave him amongst all these refined Blanco<lb/>
aristocrats. But why was it that nobody was looking<lb/>
at him? he wondered to himself angrily. He was able<lb/>
to spell out the print of newspapers, and knew that he<lb/>
had performed the "greatest military exploit of modern<lb/>
times."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "My husband wanted the railway," Mrs. Gould said<lb/>


<pb n="120"/>

to Sir John in the general murmur of resumed conversations.<lb/>
"All this brings nearer the sort of future we<lb/>
desire for the country, which has waited for it in sorrow<lb/>
long enough, God knows. But I will confess that the<lb/>
other day, during my afternoon drive when I suddenly<lb/>
saw an Indian boy ride out of a wood with the red flag of<lb/>
a surveying party in his hand, I felt something of a<lb/>
shock. The future means change &mdash; an utter change.<lb/>
And yet even here there are simple and picturesque<lb/>
things that one would like to preserve."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sir John listened, smiling. But it was his turn now<lb/>
to hush Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "General Montero is going to speak," he whispered,<lb/>
and almost immediately added, in comic alarm, "Heavens!<lb/>
he's going to propose my own health, I believe."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     General Montero had risen with a jingle of steel<lb/>
scabbard and a ripple of glitter on his gold-embroidered<lb/>
breast; a heavy sword-hilt appeared at his side above<lb/>
the edge of the table. In this gorgeous uniform, with<lb/>
his bull neck, his hooked nose flattened on the tip upon<lb/>
a blue-black, dyed moustache, he looked like a disguised<lb/>
and sinister vaquero. The drone of his voice had a<lb/>
strangely rasping, soulless ring. He floundered, lowering,<lb/>
through a few vague sentences; then suddenly<lb/>
raising his big head and his voice together, burst out<lb/>
harshly &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The honour of the country is in the hands of the<lb/>
army. I assure you I shall be faithful to it." He<lb/>
hesitated till his roaming eyes met Sir John's face upon<lb/>
which he fixed a lurid, sleepy glance; and the figure of<lb/>
the lately negotiated loan came into his mind. He<lb/>
lifted his glass. "I drink to the health of the man who<lb/>
brings us a million and a half of pounds."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He tossed off his champagne, and sat down heavily<lb/>
with a half-surprised, half-bullying look all round the<lb/>


<pb n="121"/>

faces in the profound, as if appalled, silence which<lb/>
succeeded the felicitous toast. Sir John did not move.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I don't think I am called upon to rise," he murmured<lb/>
to Mrs. Gould. "That sort of thing speaks for<lb/>
itself." But Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos came to the rescue<lb/>
with a short oration, in which he alluded pointedly to<lb/>
England's goodwill towards Costaguana &mdash; "a goodwill,"<lb/>
he continued, significantly, "of which I, having been in<lb/>
my time accredited to the Court of St. James, am able<lb/>
to speak with some knowledge."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Only then Sir John thought fit to respond, which he<lb/>
did gracefully in bad French, punctuated by bursts of<lb/>
applause and the "Hear! Hears!" of Captain Mitchell,<lb/>
who was able to understand a word now and then.<lb/>
Directly he had done, the financier of railways turned to<lb/>
Mrs. Gould &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You were good enough to say that you intended to<lb/>
ask me for something," he reminded her, gallantly.<lb/>
"What is it? Be assured that any request from you<lb/>
would be considered in the light of a favour to myself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She thanked him by a gracious smile. Everybody<lb/>
was rising from the table.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Let us go on deck," she proposed, "where I'll be<lb/>
able to point out to you the very object of my request."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     An enormous national flag of Costaguana, diagonal<lb/>
red and yellow, with two green palm trees in the middle,<lb/>
floated lazily at the mainmast head of the <hi rend="italic">Juno</hi>. A<lb/>
multitude of fireworks being let off in their thousands<lb/>
at the water's edge in honour of the President kept up a<lb/>
mysterious crepitating noise half round the harbour.<lb/>
Now and then a lot of rockets, swishing upwards invisibly,<lb/>
detonated overhead with only a puff of smoke<lb/>
in the bright sky. Crowds of people could be seen<lb/>
between the town gate and the harbour, under the<lb/>
bunches of multicoloured flags fluttering on tall poles.<lb/>


<pb n="122"/>

Faint bursts of military music would be heard suddenly,<lb/>
and the remote sound of shouting. A knot of ragged<lb/>
negroes at the end of the wharf kept on loading and<lb/>
firing a small iron cannon time after time. A greyish<lb/>
haze of dust hung thin and motionless against the sun.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Vincente Ribiera made a few steps under the<lb/>
deck-awning, leaning on the arm of Se&ntilde;or Avellanos; a<lb/>
wide circle was formed round him, where the mirthless<lb/>
smile of his dark lips and the sightless glitter of his<lb/>
spectacles could be seen turning amiably from side to<lb/>
side. The informal function arranged on purpose on<lb/>
board the <hi rend="italic">Juno</hi> to give the President-Dictator an opportunity<lb/>
to meet intimately some of his most notable<lb/>
adherents in Sulaco was drawing to an end. On one<lb/>
side, General Montero, his bald head covered now by a<lb/>
plumed cocked hat, remained motionless on a skylight<lb/>
seat, a pair of big gauntleted hands folded on the hilt<lb/>
of the sabre standing upright between his legs. The<lb/>
white plume, the coppery tint of his broad face, the<lb/>
blue-black of the moustaches under the curved beak,<lb/>
the mass of gold on sleeves and breast, the high shining<lb/>
boots with enormous spurs, the working nostrils, the<lb/>
imbecile and domineering stare of the glorious victor<lb/>
of Rio Seco had in them something ominous and incredible;<lb/>
the exaggeration of a cruel caricature, the<lb/>
fatuity of solemn masquerading, the atrocious grotesqueness<lb/>
of some military idol of Aztec conception and<lb/>
European bedecking, awaiting the homage of worshippers.<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute; approached diplomatically this<lb/>
weird and inscrutable portent, and Mrs. Gould turned<lb/>
her fascinated eyes away at last.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles, coming up to take leave of Sir John, heard<lb/>
him say, as he bent over his wife's hand, "Certainly.<lb/>
Of course, my dear Mrs. Gould, for a <hi rend="italic">prot&eacute;g&eacute;</hi> of yours!<lb/>
Not the slightest difficulty. Consider it done."<lb/>


<pb n="123"/>

</p>

<p>     Going ashore in the same boat with the Goulds, Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute; Avellanos was very silent. Even in the Gould<lb/>
carriage he did not open his lips for a long time. The<lb/>
mules trotted slowly away from the wharf between the<lb/>
extended hands of the beggars, who for that day seemed<lb/>
to have abandoned in a body the portals of churches.<lb/>
Charles Gould sat on the back seat and looked away<lb/>
upon the plain. A multitude of booths made of green<lb/>
boughs, of rushes, of odd pieces of plank eked out with<lb/>
bits of canvas had been erected all over it for the sale of<lb/>
cana, of dulces, of fruit, of cigars. Over little heaps of<lb/>
glowing charcoal Indian women, squatting on mats,<lb/>
cooked food in black earthen pots, and boiled the water<lb/>
for the mat&eacute; gourds, which they offered in soft, caressing<lb/>
voices to the country people. A racecourse had been<lb/>
staked out for the vaqueros; and away to the left, from<lb/>
where the crowd was massed thickly about a huge<lb/>
temporary erection, like a circus tent of wood with a<lb/>
conical grass roof, came the resonant twanging of harp<lb/>
strings, the sharp ping of guitars, with the grave drumming<lb/>
throb of an Indian gombo pulsating steadily<lb/>
through the shrill choruses of the dancers.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould said presently &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "All this piece of land belongs now to the Railway<lb/>
Company. There will be no more popular feasts held<lb/>
here."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould was rather sorry to think so. She took<lb/>
this opportunity to mention how she had just obtained<lb/>
from Sir John the promise that the house occupied by<lb/>
Giorgio Viola should not be interfered with. She<lb/>
declared she could never understand why the survey<lb/>
engineers ever talked of demolishing that old building.<lb/>
It was not in the way of the projected harbour branch<lb/>
of the line in the least.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She stopped the carriage before the door to reassure at<lb/>


<pb n="124"/>

once the old Genoese, who came out bare-headed and<lb/>
stood by the carriage step. She talked to him in<lb/>
Italian, of course, and he thanked her with calm dignity.<lb/>
An old Garibaldino was grateful to her from the bottom<lb/>
of his heart for keeping the roof over the heads of his<lb/>
wife and children. He was too old to wander any more.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And is it for ever, signora?" he asked.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "For as long as you like."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Bene. Then the place must be named, It was not<lb/>
worth while before."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He smiled ruggedly, with a running together of<lb/>
wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. "I shall set about<lb/>
the painting of the name to-morrow."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And what is it going to be, Giorgio?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Albergo d'Italia Una," said the old Garibaldino,<lb/>
looking away for a moment. "More in memory of<lb/>
those who have died," he added, "than for the country<lb/>
stolen from us soldiers of liberty by the craft of that<lb/>
accursed Piedmontese race of kings and ministers."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould smiled slightly, and, bending over a<lb/>
little, began to inquire about his wife and children. He<lb/>
had sent them into town on that day. The padrona<lb/>
was better in health; many thanks to the signora for<lb/>
inquiring.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     People were passing in twos and threes, in whole<lb/>
parties of men and women attended by trotting children.<lb/>
A horseman mounted on a silver-grey mare drew<lb/>
rein quietly in the shade of the house after taking off his<lb/>
hat to the party in the carriage, who returned smiles<lb/>
and familiar nods. Old Viola, evidently very pleased<lb/>
with the news he had just heard, interrupted himself for<lb/>
a moment to tell him rapidly that the house was secured,<lb/>
by the kindness of the English signora, for as long as he<lb/>
liked to keep it. The other listened attentively, but<lb/>
made no response.<lb/>


<pb n="125"/>

</p>

<p>     When the carriage moved on he took off his hat again,<lb/>
a grey sombrero with a silver cord and tassels. The<lb/>
bright colours of a Mexican serape twisted on the cantle,<lb/>
the enormous silver buttons on the embroidered leather<lb/>
jacket, the row of tiny silver buttons down the seam of the<lb/>
trousers, the snowy linen, a silk sash with embroidered<lb/>
ends, the silver plates on headstall and saddle, proclaimed<lb/>
the unapproachable style of the famous Capataz de<lb/>
Cargadores &mdash; a Mediterranean sailor &mdash; got up with more<lb/>
finished splendour than any well-to-do young ranchero<lb/>
of the Campo had ever displayed on a high holiday.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is a great thing for me," murmured old Giorgio,<lb/>
still thinking of the house, for now he had grown weary<lb/>
of change. "The signora just said a word to the<lb/>
Englishman."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The old Englishman who has enough money to pay<lb/>
for a railway? He is going off in an hour," remarked<lb/>
Nostromo, carelessly.   "Buon viaggio, then.  I've<lb/>
guarded his bones all the way from the Entrada pass<lb/>
down to the plain and into Sulaco, as though he had<lb/>
been my own father."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Old Giorgio only moved his head sideways absently.<lb/>
Nostromo pointed after the Goulds' carriage, nearing<lb/>
the grass-grown gate in the old town wall that was like<lb/>
a wall of matted jungle.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And I have sat alone at night with my revolver in<lb/>
the Company's warehouse time and again by the side of<lb/>
that other Englishman's heap of silver, guarding it as<lb/>
though it had been my own."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Viola seemed lost in thought. "It is a great thing for<lb/>
me," he repeated again, as if to himself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is," agreed the magnificent Capataz de Cargadores,<lb/>
calmly. "Listen, Vecchio &mdash; go in and bring me,<lb/>
out a cigar, but don't look for it in my room. There's<lb/>
nothing there."<lb/>


<pb n="126"/>

Viola stepped into the <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi> and came out directly,<lb/>
still absorbed in his idea, and tendered him a cigar,<lb/>
mumbling thoughtfully in his moustache, "Children<lb/>
growing up &mdash; and girls, too! Girls!" He sighed and<lb/>
fell silent.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What, only one?" remarked Nostromo, looking<lb/>
down with a sort of comic inquisitiveness at the unconscious<lb/>
old man. "No matter," he added, with lofty<lb/>
negligence; "one is enough till another is wanted."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He lit it and let the match drop from his passive<lb/>
fingers. Giorgio Viola looked up, and said abruptly &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "My son would have been just such a fine young man<lb/>
as you, Gian' Battista, if he had lived."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What? Your son? But you are right, padrone.<lb/>
If he had been like me he would have been a man."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He turned his horse slowly, and paced on between the<lb/>
booths, checking the mare almost to a standstill now<lb/>
and then for children, for the groups of people from the<lb/>
distant Campo, who stared after him with admiration.<lb/>
The Company's lightermen saluted him from afar; and<lb/>
the greatly envied Capataz de Cargadores advanced,<lb/>
amongst murmurs of recognition and obsequious greetings,<lb/>
towards the huge circus-like erection. The throng<lb/>
thickened; the guitars tinkled louder; other horsemen<lb/>
sat motionless, smoking calmly above the heads of the<lb/>
crowd; it eddied and pushed before the doors of the<lb/>
high-roofed building, whence issued a shuffle and<lb/>
thumping of feet in time to the dance music vibrating<lb/>
and shrieking with a racking rhythm, overhung by the<lb/>
tremendous, sustained, hollow roar of the gombo. The<lb/>
barbarous and imposing noise of the big drum, that<lb/>
can madden a crowd, and that even Europeans cannot<lb/>
hear without a strange emotion, seemed to draw<lb/>
Nostromo on to its source, while a man, wrapped up in<lb/>
a faded, torn poncho, walked by his stirrup, and,<lb/>


<pb n="127"/>

buffeted right and left, begged "his worship" insistently<lb/>
for employment on the wharf. He whined,<lb/>
offering the Se&ntilde;or Capataz half his daily pay for the<lb/>
privilege of being admitted to the swaggering fraternity<lb/>
of Cargadores; the other half would be enough for him,<lb/>
he protested. But Captain Mitchell's right-hand man &mdash;<lb/>
"invaluable for our work &mdash; a perfectly incorruptible<lb/>
fellow" &mdash; after looking down critically at the ragged<lb/>
mozo, shook his head without a word in the uproar<lb/>
going on around.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The man fell back; and a little further on Nostromo<lb/>
had to pull up. From the doors of the dance hall men<lb/>
and women emerged tottering, streaming with sweat,<lb/>
trembling in every limb, to lean, panting, with staring<lb/>
eyes and parted lips, against the wall of the structure,<lb/>
where the harps and guitars played on with mad speed<lb/>
in an incessant roll of thunder. Hundreds of hands<lb/>
clapped in there; voices shrieked, and then all at once<lb/>
would sink low, chanting in unison the refrain of a love<lb/>
song, with a dying fall. A red flower, flung with a good<lb/>
aim from somewhere in the crowd, struck the resplendent<lb/>
Capataz on the cheek.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He caught it as it fell, neatly, but for some time did<lb/>
not turn his head. When at last he condescended to<lb/>
look round, the throng near him had parted to make<lb/>
way for a pretty Morenita, her hair held up by a small<lb/>
golden comb, who was walking towards him in the open<lb/>
space.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Her arms and neck emerged plump and bare from a<lb/>
snowy chemisette; the blue woollen skirt, with all the<lb/>
fullness gathered in front, scanty on the hips and tight<lb/>
across the back, disclosed the provoking action of her<lb/>
walk. She came straight on and laid her hand on the<lb/>
mare's neck with a timid, coquettish look upwards out<lb/>
of the corner of her eyes.<lb/>


<pb n="128"/>

</p>

<p>     "Querido," she murmured, caressingly, "why do you<lb/>
pretend not to see me when I pass?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Because I don't love thee any more," said Nostromo,<lb/>
deliberately, after a moment of reflective silence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The hand on the mare's neck trembled suddenly.<lb/>
She dropped her head before all the eyes in the wide<lb/>
circle formed round the generous, the terrible, the inconstant<lb/>
Capataz de Cargadores, and his Morenita.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo, looking down, saw tears beginning to<lb/>
fall down her face.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Has it come, then, ever beloved of my heart?" she<lb/>
whispered. "Is it true?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No," said Nostromo, looking away carelessly. "It<lb/>
was a lie. I love thee as much as ever."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Is that true?" she cooed, joyously, her cheeks still<lb/>
wet with tears.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is true."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "True on the life?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "As true as that; but thou must not ask me to swear<lb/>
it on the Madonna that stands in thy room." And the<lb/>
Capataz laughed a little in response to the grins of the<lb/>
crowd.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She pouted &mdash; very pretty &mdash; a little uneasy.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, I will not ask for that. I can see love in your<lb/>
eyes." She laid her hand on his knee. "Why are you<lb/>
trembling like this? From love?" she continued,<lb/>
while the cavernous thundering of the gombo went on<lb/>
without a pause. "But if you love her as much as that,<lb/>
you must give your Paquita a gold-mounted rosary of<lb/>
beads for the neck of her Madonna."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No," said Nostromo, looking into her uplifted,<lb/>
begging eyes, which suddenly turned stony with surprise.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No? Then what else will your worship give me on<lb/>
the day of the fiesta?" she asked, angrily; "so as not to<lb/>
shame me before all these people."<lb/>


<pb n="129"/>

</p>

<p>     "There is no shame for thee in getting nothing from<lb/>
thy lover for once."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "True! The shame is your worship's &mdash; my poor<lb/>
lover's," she flared up, sarcastically.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Laughs were heard at her anger, at her retort. What<lb/>
an audacious spitfire she was! The people aware of<lb/>
this scene were calling out urgently to others in the<lb/>
crowd. The circle round the silver-grey mare narrowed<lb/>
slowly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The girl went off a pace or two, confronting the mocking<lb/>
curiosity of the eyes, then flung back to the stirrup,<lb/>
tiptoeing, her enraged face turned up to Nostromo with<lb/>
a pair of blazing eyes. He bent low to her in the saddle.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "Juan," she hissed, "I could stab thee to the heart!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The dreaded Capataz de Cargadores, magnificent and<lb/>
carelessly public in his amours, flung his arm round her<lb/>
neck and kissed her spluttering lips. A murmur went<lb/>
round.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A knife!" he demanded at large, holding her firmly<lb/>
by the shoulder.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Twenty blades flashed out together in the circle. A<lb/>
young man in holiday attire, bounding in, thrust one in<lb/>
Nostromo's hand and bounded back into the ranks, very<lb/>
proud of himself. Nostromo had not even looked at<lb/>
him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Stand on my foot," he commanded the girl, who,<lb/>
suddenly subdued, rose lightly, and when he had her up,<lb/>
encircling her waist, her face near to his, he pressed the<lb/>
knife into her little hand.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, Morenita! You shall not put me to shame,"<lb/>
he said. "You shall have your present; and so that<lb/>
everyone should know who is your lover to-day, you<lb/>
may cut all the silver buttons off my coat."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There were shouts of laughter and applause at this<lb/>


<pb n="130"/>

witty freak, while the girl passed the keen blade, and<lb/>
the impassive rider jingled in his palm the increasing<lb/>
hoard of silver buttons. He eased her to the ground<lb/>
with both her hands full. After whispering for a while<lb/>
with a very strenuous face, she walked away, staring<lb/>
haughtily, and vanished into the crowd.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The circle had broken up, and the lordly Capataz de<lb/>
Cargadores, the indispensable man, the tried and trusty<lb/>
Nostromo, the Mediterranean sailor come ashore<lb/>
casually to try his luck in Costaguana, rode slowly<lb/>
towards the harbour. The <hi rend="italic">Juno</hi> was just then swinging<lb/>
round; and even as Nostromo reined up again to<lb/>
look on, a flag ran up on the improvised flagstaff erected<lb/>
in an ancient and dismantled little fort at the harbour<lb/>
entrance. Half a battery of field guns had been hurried<lb/>
over there from the Sulaco barracks for the<lb/>
purpose of firing the regulation salutes for the President-<lb/>
Dictator and the War Minister. As the mail-boat<lb/>
headed through the pass, the badly timed reports<lb/>
announced the end of Don Vincente Ribiera's first<lb/>
official visit to Sulaco, and for Captain Mitchell the end<lb/>
of another "historic occasion." Next time when the<lb/>
"Hope of honest men" was to come that way, a year<lb/>
and a half later, it was unofficially, over the mountain<lb/>
tracks, fleeing after a defeat on a lame mule, to be only<lb/>
just saved by Nostromo from an ignominious death at<lb/>
the hands of a mob. It was a very different event, of<lb/>
which Captain Mitchell used to say &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It was history &mdash; history, sir! And that fellow of<lb/>
mine, Nostromo, you know, was right in it. Absolutely<lb/>
making history, sir."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But this event, creditable to Nostromo, was to lead<lb/>
immediately to another, which could not be classed<lb/>
either as "history" or as "a mistake" in Captain<lb/>
Mitchell's phraseology. He had another word for it.<lb/>


<pb n="131"/>

</p>

<p>     "Sir" he used to say afterwards, "that was no mistake.<lb/>
It was a fatality. A misfortune, pure and<lb/>
simple, sir. And that poor fellow of mine was right in<lb/>
it &mdash; right in the middle of it! A fatality, if ever there<lb/>
was one &mdash; and to my mind he has never been the same<lb/>
man since."<lb/>

<p>     THROUGH good and evil report in the varying fortune<lb/>
of that struggle which Don Jos&eacute; had characterized in<lb/>
the phrase, "the fate of national honesty trembles in the<lb/>
balance," the Gould Concession, "Imperium in Imperio,"<lb/>
had gone on working; the square mountain had<lb/>
gone on pouring its treasure down the wooden shoots<lb/>
to the unresting batteries of stamps; the lights of San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; had twinkled night after night upon the great,<lb/>
limitless shadow of the Campo; every three months<lb/>
the silver escort had gone down to the sea as if neither<lb/>
the war nor its consequences could ever affect the<lb/>
ancient Occidental State secluded beyond its high<lb/>
barrier of the Cordillera. All the fighting took place<lb/>
on the other side of that mighty wall of serrated peaks<lb/>
lorded over by the white dome of Higuerota and as yet<lb/>
unbreached by the railway, of which only the first part,<lb/>
the easy Campo part from Sulaco to the Ivie Valley at<lb/>
the foot of the pass, had been laid. Neither did the<lb/>
telegraph line cross the mountains yet; its poles, like<lb/>
slender beacons on the plain, penetrated into the forest<lb/>
fringe of the foot-hills cut by the deep avenue of the<lb/>
track; and its wire ended abruptly in the construction<lb/>
camp at a white deal table supporting a Morse apparatus,<lb/>
in a long hut of planks with a corrugated iron<lb/>
roof overshadowed by gigantic cedar trees &mdash; the quarters<lb/>
of the engineer in charge of the advance section.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The harbour was busy, too, with the traffic in railway<lb/>
material, and with the movements of troops along<lb/>
the coast. The O.S.N. Company found much occupation<lb/>




<pb n="136"/>

for its fleet. Costaguana had no navy, and, apart<lb/>
from a few coastguard cutters, there were no national<lb/>
ships except a couple of old merchant steamers used as<lb/>
transports.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Captain Mitchell, feeling more and more in the thick<lb/>
of history, found time for an hour or so during an<lb/>
afternoon in the drawing-room of the Casa Gould,<lb/>
where, with a strange ignorance of the real forces at<lb/>
work around him, he professed himself delighted to get<lb/>
away from the strain of affairs. He did not know what<lb/>
he would have done without his invaluable Nostromo,<lb/>
he declared. Those confounded Costaguana politics<lb/>
gave him more work &mdash; he confided to Mrs. Gould &mdash;<lb/>
than he had bargained for.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos had displayed in the service of the<lb/>
endangered Ribiera Government an organizing activity<lb/>
and an eloquence of which the echoes reached even<lb/>
Europe. For, after the new loan to the Ribiera Government,<lb/>
Europe had become interested in Costaguana.<lb/>
The Sala of the Provincial Assembly (in the Municipal<lb/>
Buildings of Sulaco), with its portraits of the Liberators<lb/>
on the walls and an old flag of Cortez preserved in a<lb/>
glass case above the President's chair, had heard all<lb/>
these speeches &mdash; the early one containing the impassioned<lb/>
declaration "Militarism is the enemy," the<lb/>
famous one of the "trembling balance" delivered on<lb/>
the occasion of the vote for the raising of a second<lb/>
Sulaco regiment in the defence of the reforming Government;<lb/>
and when the provinces again displayed their<lb/>
old flags (proscribed in Guzman Bento's time) there<lb/>
was another of those great orations, when Don Jos&eacute;<lb/>
greeted these old emblems of the war of Independence,<lb/>
brought out again in the name of new Ideals. The<lb/>
old idea of Federalism had disappeared. For his part<lb/>
he did not wish to revive old political doctrines. They<lb/>


<pb n="137"/>

were perishable. They died. But the doctrine of<lb/>
political rectitude was immortal. The second Sulaco<lb/>
regiment, to whom he was presenting this flag, was going<lb/>
to show its valour in a contest for order, peace, progress;<lb/>
for the establishment of national self-respect without<lb/>
which &mdash; he declared with energy &mdash; "we are a reproach<lb/>
and a byword amongst the powers of the world."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos loved his country. He had<lb/>
served it lavishly with his fortune during his diplomatic<lb/>
career, and the later story of his captivity and barbarous<lb/>
ill-usage under Guzman Bento was well known<lb/>
to his listeners. It was a wonder that he had not been<lb/>
a victim of the ferocious and summary executions which<lb/>
marked the course of that tyranny; for Guzman had<lb/>
ruled the country with the sombre imbecility of political<lb/>
fanaticism. The power of Supreme Government had<lb/>
become in his dull mind an object of strange worship, as<lb/>
if it were some sort of cruel deity. It was incarnated in<lb/>
himself, and his adversaries, the Federalists, were the<lb/>
supreme sinners, objects of hate, abhorrence, and fear,<lb/>
as heretics would be to a convinced Inquisitor. For<lb/>
years he had carried about at the tail of the Army of<lb/>
Pacification, all over the country, a captive band of<lb/>
such atrocious criminals, who considered themselves<lb/>
most unfortunate at not having been summarily executed.<lb/>
It was a diminishing company of nearly naked<lb/>
skeletons, loaded with irons, covered with dirt, with<lb/>
vermin, with raw wounds, all men of position, of education,<lb/>
of wealth, who had learned to fight amongst themselves<lb/>
for scraps of rotten beef thrown to them by<lb/>
soldiers, or to beg a negro cook for a drink of muddy<lb/>
water in pitiful accents. Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos, clanking<lb/>
his chains amongst the others, seemed only to exist in<lb/>
order to prove how much hunger, pain, degradation,<lb/>
and cruel torture a human body can stand without<lb/>


<pb n="138"/>

parting with the last spark of life. Sometimes interrogatories,<lb/>
backed by some primitive method of torture,<lb/>
were administered to them by a commission of officers<lb/>
hastily assembled in a hut of sticks and branches, and<lb/>
made pitiless by the fear for their own lives. A lucky<lb/>
one or two of that spectral company of prisoners would<lb/>
perhaps be led tottering behind a bush to be shot by a<lb/>
file of soldiers. Always an army chaplain &mdash; some unshaven,<lb/>
dirty man, girt with a sword and with a tiny<lb/>
cross embroidered in white cotton on the left breast of a<lb/>
lieutenant's uniform &mdash; would follow, cigarette in the<lb/>
corner of the mouth, wooden stool in hand, to hear the<lb/>
confession and give absolution; for the Citizen Saviour<lb/>
of the Country (Guzman Bento was called thus officially<lb/>
in petitions) was not averse from the exercise of rational<lb/>
clemency. The irregular report of the firing squad<lb/>
would be heard, followed sometimes by a single finishing<lb/>
shot; a little bluish cloud of smoke would float up<lb/>
above the green bushes, and the Army of Pacification<lb/>
would move on over the savannas, through the forests,<lb/>
crossing rivers, invading rural pueblos, devastating the<lb/>
haciendas of the horrid aristocrats, occupying the inland<lb/>
towns in the fulfilment of its patriotic mission, and<lb/>
leaving behind a united land wherein the evil taint of<lb/>
Federalism could no longer be detected in the smoke of<lb/>
burning houses and the smell of spilt blood.<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos had survived that time.<lb/>
Perhaps, when contemptuously signifying to him his<lb/>
release, the Citizen Saviour of the Country might have<lb/>
thought this benighted aristocrat too broken in health<lb/>
and spirit and fortune to be any longer dangerous. Or,<lb/>
perhaps, it may have been a simple caprice. Guzman<lb/>
Bento, usually full of fanciful fears and brooding suspicions,<lb/>
had sudden accesses of unreasonable self-<lb/>
confidence when he perceived himself elevated on a<lb/>


<pb n="139"/>

pinnacle of power and safety beyond the reach of mere<lb/>
mortal plotters. At such times he would impulsively<lb/>
command the celebration of a solemn Mass of thanksgiving,<lb/>
which would be sung in great pomp in the<lb/>
cathedral of Sta. Marta by the trembling, subservient<lb/>
Archbishop of his creation. He heard it sitting in a<lb/>
gilt armchair placed before the high altar, surrounded<lb/>
by the civil and military heads of his Government.<lb/>
The unofficial world of Sta. Marta would crowd into<lb/>
the cathedral, for it was not quite safe for anybody of<lb/>
mark to stay away from these manifestations of presidential<lb/>
piety. Having thus acknowledged the only<lb/>
power he was at all disposed to recognize as above himself,<lb/>
he would scatter acts of political grace in a sardonic<lb/>
wantonness of clemency. There was no other way left<lb/>
now to enjoy his power but by seeing his crushed<lb/>
adversaries crawl impotently into the light of day out of<lb/>
the dark, noisome cells of the Collegio. Their harmlessness<lb/>
fed his insatiable vanity, and they could always be<lb/>
got hold of again. It was the rule for all the women of<lb/>
their families to present thanks afterwards in a special<lb/>
audience. The incarnation of that strange god, El<lb/>
Gobierno Supremo, received them standing, cocked<lb/>
hat on head, and exhorted them in a menacing mutter<lb/>
to show their gratitude by bringing up their children in<lb/>
fidelity to the democratic form of government, "which<lb/>
I have established for the happiness of our country."<lb/>
His front teeth having been knocked out in some accident<lb/>
of his former herdsman's life, his utterance was<lb/>
spluttering and indistinct. He had been working for<lb/>
Costaguana alone in the midst of treachery and opposition.<lb/>
Let it cease now lest he should become<lb/>
weary of forgiving!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos had known this forgiveness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He was broken in health and fortune deplorably<lb/>


<pb n="140"/>

enough to present a truly gratifying spectacle to the<lb/>
supreme chief of democratic institutions. He retired<lb/>
to Sulaco. His wife had an estate in that province, and<lb/>
she nursed him back to life out of the house of death and<lb/>
captivity. When she died, their daughter, an only<lb/>
child, was old enough to devote herself to "poor papa."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Miss Avellanos, born in Europe and educated partly<lb/>
in England, was a tall, grave girl, with a self-possessed<lb/>
manner, a wide, white forehead, a wealth of rich brown<lb/>
hair, and blue eyes.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The other young ladies of Sulaco stood in awe of her<lb/>
character and accomplishments. She was reputed to<lb/>
be terribly learned and serious. As to pride, it was<lb/>
well known that all the Corbel&agrave;ns were proud, and her<lb/>
mother was a Corbel&agrave;n. Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos depended<lb/>
very much upon the devotion of his beloved Antonia.<lb/>
He accepted it in the benighted way of men, who,<lb/>
though made in God's image, are like stone idols without<lb/>
sense before the smoke of certain burnt offerings. He<lb/>
was ruined in every way, but a man possessed of passion<lb/>
is not a bankrupt in life. Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos<lb/>
desired passionately for his country: peace, prosperity,<lb/>
and (as the end of the preface to "Fifty Years of Misrule"<lb/>
has it) "an honourable place in the comity of<lb/>
civilized nations." In this last phrase the Minister<lb/>
Plenipotentiary, cruelly humiliated by the bad faith<lb/>
of his Government towards the foreign bondholders,<lb/>
stands disclosed in the patriot.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The fatuous turmoil of greedy factions succeeding the<lb/>
tyranny of Guzman Bento seemed to bring his desire to<lb/>
the very door of opportunity. He was too old to<lb/>
descend personally into the centre of the arena at Sta.<lb/>
Marta. But the men who acted there sought his advice<lb/>
at every step. He himself thought that he could<lb/>
be most useful at a distance, in Sulaco. His name, his<lb/>


<pb n="141"/>

connections, his former position, his experience commanded<lb/>
the respect of his class. The discovery that<lb/>
this man, living in dignified poverty in the Corbel&agrave;n<lb/>
town residence (opposite the Casa Gould), could dispose<lb/>
of material means towards the support of the<lb/>
cause increased his influence. It was his open letter of<lb/>
appeal that decided the candidature of Don Vincente<lb/>
Ribiera for the Presidency. Another of these informal<lb/>
State papers drawn up by Don Jos&eacute; (this time in the<lb/>
shape of an address from the Province) induced that<lb/>
scrupulous constitutionalist to accept the extraordinary<lb/>
powers conferred upon him for five years by an overwhelming<lb/>
vote of congress in Sta. Marta. It was a<lb/>
specific mandate to establish the prosperity of the<lb/>
people on the basis of firm peace at home, and to redeem<lb/>
the national credit by the satisfaction of all just claims<lb/>
abroad.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On the afternoon the news of that vote had reached<lb/>
Sulaco by the usual roundabout postal way through<lb/>
Cayta, and up the coast by steamer. Don Jos&eacute;, who<lb/>
had been waiting for the mail in the Goulds' drawing-<lb/>
room, got out of the rocking-chair, letting his hat fall<lb/>
off his knees. He rubbed his silvery, short hair with<lb/>
both hands, speechless with the excess of joy.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Emilia, my soul," he had burst out, "let me embrace<lb/>
you! Let me &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Captain Mitchell, had he been there, would no doubt<lb/>
have made an apt remark about the dawn of a new era;<lb/>
but if Don Jos&eacute; thought something of the kind, his<lb/>
eloquence failed him on this occasion. The inspirer of<lb/>
that revival of the Blanco party tottered where he<lb/>
stood. Mrs. Gould moved forward quickly and, as she<lb/>
offered her cheek with a smile to her old friend, managed<lb/>
very cleverly to give him the support of her arm he<lb/>
really needed.<lb/>


<pb n="142"/>

</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; had recovered himself at once, but for a<lb/>
time he could do no more than murmur, "Oh, you two<lb/>
patriots! Oh, you two patriots!" &mdash; looking from one to<lb/>
the other. Vague plans of another historical work,<lb/>
wherein all the devotions to the regeneration of the<lb/>
country he loved would be enshrined for the reverent<lb/>
worship of posterity, flitted through his mind. The<lb/>
historian who had enough elevation of soul to write of<lb/>
Guzman Bento: "Yet this monster, imbrued in the<lb/>
blood of his countrymen, must not be held unreservedly<lb/>
to the execration of future years. It appears to be<lb/>
true that he, too, loved his country. He had given it<lb/>
twelve years of peace; and, absolute master of lives and<lb/>
fortunes as he was, he died poor. His worst fault, perhaps,<lb/>
was not his ferocity, but his ignorance;" the man<lb/>
who could write thus of a cruel persecutor (the passage<lb/>
occurs in his "History of Misrule") felt at the foreshadowing<lb/>
of success an almost boundless affection for<lb/>
his two helpers, for these two young people from over<lb/>
the sea.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Just as years ago, calmly, from the conviction of<lb/>
practical necessity, stronger than any abstract political<lb/>
doctrine, Henry Gould had drawn the sword, so now,<lb/>
the times being changed, Charles Gould had flung the<lb/>
silver of the San Tom&eacute; into the fray. The Inglez of<lb/>
Sulaco, the "Costaguana Englishman" of the third<lb/>
generation, was as far from being a political intriguer as<lb/>
his uncle from a revolutionary swashbuckler. Springing<lb/>
from the instinctive uprightness of their natures<lb/>
their action was reasoned. They saw an opportunity<lb/>
and used the weapon to hand.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould's position &mdash; a commanding position in<lb/>
the background of that attempt to retrieve the peace<lb/>
and the credit of the Republic &mdash; was very clear. At the<lb/>
beginning he had had to accommodate himself to existing<lb/>


<pb n="143"/>

circumstances of corruption so na&iuml;vely brazen as to<lb/>
disarm the hate of a man courageous enough not to be<lb/>
afraid of its irresponsible potency to ruin everything it<lb/>
touched. It seemed to him too contemptible for hot<lb/>
anger even. He made use of it with a cold, fearless<lb/>
scorn, manifested rather than concealed by the forms<lb/>
of stony courtesy which did away with much of the<lb/>
ignominy of the situation. At bottom, perhaps, he<lb/>
suffered from it, for he was not a man of cowardly<lb/>
illusions, but he refused to discuss the ethical view with<lb/>
his wife. He trusted that, though a little disenchanted,<lb/>
she would be intelligent enough to understand that his<lb/>
character safeguarded the enterprise of their lives<lb/>
as much or more than his policy. The extraordinary<lb/>
development of the mine had put a great power into his<lb/>
hands. To feel that prosperity always at the mercy of<lb/>
unintelligent greed had grown irksome to him. To<lb/>
Mrs. Gould it was humiliating. At any rate, it was<lb/>
dangerous. In the confidential communications passing<lb/>
between Charles Gould, the King of Sulaco, and the<lb/>
head of the silver and steel interests far away in California,<lb/>
the conviction was growing that any attempt<lb/>
made by men of education and integrity ought to be<lb/>
discreetly supported. "You may tell your friend<lb/>
Avellanos that I think so," Mr. Holroyd had written<lb/>
at the proper moment from his inviolable sanctuary<lb/>
within the eleven-storey high factory of great affairs.<lb/>
And shortly afterwards, with a credit opened by the<lb/>
Third Southern Bank (located next door but one to the<lb/>
Holroyd Building), the Ribierist party in Costaguana<lb/>
took a practical shape under the eye of the administrator<lb/>
of the San Tom&eacute; mine. And Don Jos&eacute;, the hereditary<lb/>
friend of the Gould family, could say: "Perhaps,<lb/>
my dear Carlos, I shall not have believed in vain."<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="144"/>


<p>     AFTER another armed struggle, decided by Montero's<lb/>
victory of Rio Seco, had been added to the tale of civil<lb/>
wars, the "honest men," as Don Jos&eacute; called them, could<lb/>
breathe freely for the first time in half a century. The<lb/>
Five-Year-Mandate law became the basis of that regeneration,<lb/>
the passionate desire and hope for which had<lb/>
been like the elixir of everlasting youth for Don Jos&eacute;<lb/>
Avellanos.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And when it was suddenly &mdash; and not quite unexpectedly<lb/>
&mdash; endangered by that "brute Montero," it was a<lb/>
passionate indignation that gave him a new lease of<lb/>
life, as it were. Already, at the time of the President-<lb/>
Dictator's visit to Sulaco, Moraga had sounded a note<lb/>
of warning from Sta. Marta about the War Minister.<lb/>
Montero and his brother made the subject of an earnest<lb/>
talk between the Dictator-President and the Nestor-<lb/>
inspirer of the party. But Don Vincente, a doctor of<lb/>
philosophy from the Cordova University, seemed to<lb/>
have an exaggerated respect for military ability, whose<lb/>
mysteriousness &mdash; since it appeared to be altogether<lb/>
independent of intellect &mdash; imposed upon his imagination.<lb/>
The victor of Rio Seco was a popular hero. His<lb/>
services were so recent that the President-Dictator<lb/>
quailed before the obvious charge of political ingratitude.<lb/>
Great regenerating transactions were being<lb/>
initiated &mdash; the fresh loan, a new railway line, a vast<lb/>
colonization scheme. Anything that could unsettle<lb/>
the public opinion in the capital was to be avoided.<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute; bowed to these arguments and tried to dismiss<lb/>




<pb n="145"/>

from his mind the gold-laced portent in boots, and with<lb/>
a sabre, made meaningless now at last, he hoped, in the<lb/>
new order of things.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Less than six months after the President-Dictator's<lb/>
visit, Sulaco learned with stupefaction of the military<lb/>
revolt in the name of national honour. The Minister<lb/>
of War, in a barrack-square allocution to the officers of<lb/>
the artillery regiment he had been inspecting, had<lb/>
declared the national honour sold to foreigners. The<lb/>
Dictator, by his weak compliance with the demands of<lb/>
the European powers &mdash; for the settlement of long outstanding<lb/>
money claims &mdash; had showed himself unfit to<lb/>
rule. A letter from Moraga explained afterwards that<lb/>
the initiative, and even the very text, of the incendiary<lb/>
allocution came, in reality, from the other Montero, the<lb/>
ex-guerillero, the Commandante de Plaza. The energetic<lb/>
treatment of Dr. Monygham, sent for in haste "to<lb/>
the mountain," who came galloping three leagues in the<lb/>
dark, saved Don Jos&eacute; from a dangerous attack of<lb/>
jaundice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     After getting over the shock, Don Jos&eacute; refused to let<lb/>
himself be prostrated. Indeed, better news succeeded<lb/>
at first. The revolt in the capital had been suppressed<lb/>
after a night of fighting in the streets. Unfortunately,<lb/>
both the Monteros had been able to make their escape<lb/>
south, to their native province of Entre-Montes. The<lb/>
hero of the forest march, the victor of Rio Seco, had<lb/>
been received with frenzied acclamations in Nicoya, the<lb/>
provincial capital. The troops in garrison there had<lb/>
gone to him in a body. The brothers were organizing<lb/>
an army, gathering malcontents, sending emissaries<lb/>
primed with patriotic lies to the people, and with<lb/>
promises of plunder to the wild llaneros. Even a<lb/>
Monterist press had come into existence, speaking<lb/>
oracularly of the secret promises of support given by<lb/>


<pb n="146"/>

"our great sister Republic of the North" against the<lb/>
sinister land-grabbing designs of European powers,<lb/>
cursing in every issue the "miserable Ribiera," who<lb/>
had plotted to deliver his country, bound hand and foot,<lb/>
for a prey to foreign speculators.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sulaco, pastoral and sleepy, with its opulent Campo<lb/>
and the rich silver mine, heard the din of arms fitfully<lb/>
in its fortunate isolation. It was nevertheless in the<lb/>
very forefront of the defence with men and money; but<lb/>
the very rumours reached it circuitously &mdash; from abroad<lb/>
even, so much was it cut off from the rest of the Republic,<lb/>
not only by natural obstacles, but also by the<lb/>
vicissitudes of the war. The Monteristos were besieging<lb/>
Cayta, an important postal link. The overland<lb/>
couriers ceased to come across the mountains, and<lb/>
no muleteer would consent to risk the journey at last;<lb/>
even Bonifacio on one occasion failed to return from<lb/>
Sta. Marta, either not daring to start, or perhaps<lb/>
captured by the parties of the enemy raiding the<lb/>
country between the Cordillera and the capital. Monterist<lb/>
publications, however, found their way into the<lb/>
province, mysteriously enough; and also Monterist<lb/>
emissaries preaching death to aristocrats in the villages<lb/>
and towns of the Campo. Very early, at the beginning<lb/>
of the trouble, Hernandez, the bandit, had proposed<lb/>
(through the agency of an old priest of a village in the<lb/>
wilds) to deliver two of them to the Ribierist authorities<lb/>
in Tonoro. They had come to offer him a free<lb/>
pardon and the rank of colonel from General Montero<lb/>
in consideration of joining the rebel army with his<lb/>
mounted band. No notice was taken at the time of the<lb/>
proposal. It was joined, as an evidence of good faith,<lb/>
to a petition praying the Sulaco Assembly for permission<lb/>
to enlist, with all his followers, in the forces<lb/>
being then raised in Sulaco for the defence of the Five-<lb/>


<pb n="147"/>

Year Mandate of regeneration. The petition, like<lb/>
everything else, had found its way into Don Jos&eacute;'s<lb/>
hands. He had showed to Mrs. Gould these pages of<lb/>
dirty-greyish rough paper (perhaps looted in some<lb/>
village store), covered with the crabbed, illiterate handwriting<lb/>
of the old padre, carried off from his hut by the<lb/>
side of a mud-walled church to be the secretary of the<lb/>
dreaded Salteador. They had both bent in the lamp-<lb/>
light of the Gould drawing-room over the document<lb/>
containing the fierce and yet humble appeal of the man<lb/>
against the blind and stupid barbarity turning an honest<lb/>
ranchero into a bandit. A postscript of the priest<lb/>
stated that, but for being deprived of his liberty for<lb/>
ten days, he had been treated with humanity and the<lb/>
respect due to his sacred calling. He had been, it appears,<lb/>
confessing and absolving the chief and most of<lb/>
the band, and he guaranteed the sincerity of their good<lb/>
disposition. He had distributed heavy penances, no<lb/>
doubt in the way of litanies and fasts; but he argued<lb/>
shrewdly that it would be difficult for them to make<lb/>
their peace with God durably till they had made peace<lb/>
with men.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Never before, perhaps, had Hernandez's head been<lb/>
in less jeopardy than when he petitioned humbly for<lb/>
permission to buy a pardon for himself and his gang of<lb/>
deserters by armed service. He could range afar from<lb/>
the waste lands protecting his fastness, unchecked, because<lb/>
there were no troops left in the whole province.<lb/>
The usual garrison of Sulaco had gone south to the<lb/>
war, with its brass band playing the Bolivar march on<lb/>
the bridge of one of the O.S.N. Company's steamers.<lb/>
The great family coaches drawn up along the shore of the<lb/>
harbour were made to rock on the high leathern springs<lb/>
by the enthusiasm of the se&ntilde;oras and the se&ntilde;oritas<lb/>
standing up to wave their lace handkerchiefs, as lighter<lb/>


<pb n="148"/>

after lighter packed full of troops left the end of the<lb/>
jetty.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo directed the embarkation, under the super-<lb/>
intendendence of Captain Mitchell, red-faced in the<lb/>
sun, conspicuous in a white waistcoat, representing the<lb/>
allied and anxious goodwill of all the material interests<lb/>
of civilization. General Barrios, who commanded the<lb/>
troops, assured Don Jos&eacute; on parting that in three weeks<lb/>
he would have Montero in a wooden cage drawn by<lb/>
three pair of oxen ready for a tour through all the towns<lb/>
of the Republic.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And then, se&ntilde;ora," he continued, baring his curly<lb/>
iron-grey head to Mrs. Gould in her landau &mdash; "and<lb/>
then, se&ntilde;ora, we shall convert our swords into ploughshares<lb/>
and grow rich. Even I, myself, as soon as this<lb/>
little business is settled, shall open a fundacion on some<lb/>
land I have on the llanos and try to make a little money<lb/>
in peace and quietness. Se&ntilde;ora, you know, all Costaguana<lb/>
knows &mdash; what do I say? &mdash; this whole South<lb/>
American continent knows, that Pablo Barrios has had<lb/>
his fill of military glory."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould was not present at the anxious and<lb/>
patriotic send-off. It was not his part to see the soldiers<lb/>
embark. It was neither his part, nor his inclination,<lb/>
nor his policy. His part, his inclination, and his policy<lb/>
were united in one endeavour to keep unchecked the<lb/>
flow of treasure he had started single-handed from the<lb/>
re-opened scar in the flank of the mountain. As the<lb/>
mine developed he had trained for himself some native<lb/>
help. There were foremen, artificers and clerks, with<lb/>
Don P&eacute;p&eacute; for the gobernador of the mining population.<lb/>
For the rest his shoulders alone sustained the whole<lb/>
weight of the "Imperium in Imperio," the great Gould<lb/>
Concession whose mere shadow had been enough to<lb/>
crush the life out of his father.<lb/>


<pb n="149"/>

</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould had no silver mine to look after. In the<lb/>
general life of the Gould Concession she was represented<lb/>
by her two lieutenants, the doctor and the priest, but<lb/>
she fed her woman's love of excitement on events whose<lb/>
significance was purified to her by the fire of her<lb/>
imaginative purpose. On that day she had brought the<lb/>
Avellanos, father and daughter, down to the harbour<lb/>
with her.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Amongst his other activities of that stirring time,<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute; had become the chairman of a Patriotic Committee<lb/>
which had armed a great proportion of troops in<lb/>
the Sulaco command with an improved model of a military<lb/>
rifle. It had been just discarded for something<lb/>
still more deadly by one of the great European powers.<lb/>
How much of the market-price for second-hand weapons<lb/>
was covered by the voluntary contributions of the<lb/>
principal families, and how much came from those<lb/>
funds Don Jos&eacute; was understood to command abroad,<lb/>
remained a secret which he alone could have disclosed;<lb/>
but the Ricos, as the populace called them, had contributed<lb/>
under the pressure of their Nestor's eloquence.<lb/>
Some of the more enthusiastic ladies had been moved to<lb/>
bring offerings of jewels into the hands of the man who<lb/>
was the life and soul of the party.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There were moments when both his life and his soul<lb/>
seemed overtaxed by so many years of undiscouraged<lb/>
belief in regeneration. He appeared almost inanimate,<lb/>
sitting rigidly by the side of Mrs. Gould in the landau,<lb/>
with his fine, old, clean-shaven face of a uniform tint as<lb/>
if modelled in yellow wax, shaded by a soft felt hat,<lb/>
the dark eyes looking out fixedly. Antonia, the<lb/>
beautiful Antonia, as Miss Avellanos was called in<lb/>
Sulaco, leaned back, facing them; and her full figure, the<lb/>
grave oval of her face with full red lips, made her look<lb/>
more mature than Mrs. Gould, with her mobile expression<lb/>


<pb n="150"/>

and small, erect person under a slightly swaying<lb/>
sunshade.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Whenever possible Antonia attended her father; her<lb/>
recognized devotion weakened the shocking effect of her<lb/>
scorn for the rigid conventions regulating the life of<lb/>
Spanish-American girlhood. And, in truth, she was no<lb/>
longer girlish. It was said that she often wrote State<lb/>
papers from her father's dictation, and was allowed to<lb/>
read all the books in his library. At the receptions &mdash;<lb/>
where the situation was saved by the presence of a very<lb/>
decrepit old lady (a relation of the Corbel&agrave;ns), quite<lb/>
deaf and motionless in an armchair &mdash; Antonia could<lb/>
hold her own in a discussion with two or three men at a<lb/>
time. Obviously she was not the girl to be content<lb/>
with peeping through a barred window at a cloaked<lb/>
figure of a lover ensconced in a doorway opposite &mdash;<lb/>
which is the correct form of Costaguana courtship. It<lb/>
was generally believed that with her foreign upbringing<lb/>
and foreign ideas the learned and proud Antonia would<lb/>
never marry &mdash; unless, indeed, she married a foreigner<lb/>
from Europe or North America, now that Sulaco seemed<lb/>
on the point of being invaded by all the world.<lb/>
</p>


</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="3" id="d20">
<head>CHAPTER THREE</head>

<pb n="151"/>


<p>     WHEN General Barrios stopped to address Mrs.<lb/>
Gould, Antonia raised negligently her hand holding an<lb/>
open fan, as if to shade from the sun her head, wrapped<lb/>
in a light lace shawl. The clear gleam of her blue eyes<lb/>
gliding behind the black fringe of eyelashes paused for a<lb/>
moment upon her father, then travelled further to the<lb/>
figure of a young man of thirty at most, of medium<lb/>
height, rather thick-set, wearing a light overcoat.<lb/>
Bearing down with the open palm of his hand upon the<lb/>
knob of a flexible cane, he had been looking on from a<lb/>
distance; but directly he saw himself noticed, he approached<lb/>
quietly and put his elbow over the door of the<lb/>
landau.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The shirt collar, cut low in the neck, the big bow of<lb/>
his cravat, the style of his clothing, from the round hat<lb/>
to the varnished shoes, suggested an idea of French<lb/>
elegance; but otherwise he was the very type of a fair<lb/>
Spanish creole. The fluffy moustache and the short,<lb/>
curly, golden beard did not conceal his lips, rosy, fresh,<lb/>
almost pouting in expression. His full, round face was<lb/>
of that warm, healthy creole white which is never<lb/>
tanned by its native sunshine. Martin Decoud was<lb/>
seldom exposed to the Costaguana sun under which he<lb/>
was born. His people had been long settled in Paris,<lb/>
where he had studied law, had dabbled in literature, had<lb/>
hoped now and then in moments of exaltation to become<lb/>
a poet like that other foreigner of Spanish blood,<lb/>
Jos&eacute; Maria Her&eacute;dia. In other moments he had, to pass<lb/>
the time, condescended to write articles on European<lb/>




<pb n="152"/>

affairs for the <hi rend="italic">Semenario</hi>, the principal newspaper in<lb/>
Sta. Marta, which printed them under the heading<lb/>
"From our special correspondent," though the authorship<lb/>
was an open secret. Everybody in Costaguana,<lb/>
where the tale of compatriots in Europe is jealously<lb/>
kept, knew that it was "the son Decoud," a talented<lb/>
young man, supposed to be moving in the higher<lb/>
spheres of Society. As a matter of fact, he was an idle<lb/>
boulevardier, in touch with some smart journalists,<lb/>
made free of a few newspaper offices, and welcomed in<lb/>
the pleasure haunts of pressmen. This life, whose<lb/>
dreary superficiality is covered by the glitter of universal<lb/>
blague, like the stupid clowning of a harlequin by<lb/>
the spangles of a motley costume, induced in him a<lb/>
Frenchified &mdash; but most un-French &mdash; cosmopolitanism, in<lb/>
reality a mere barren indifferentism posing as intellectual<lb/>
superiority. Of his own country he used to say to<lb/>
his French associates: "Imagine an atmosphere of<lb/>
opera-bouffe in which all the comic business of stage<lb/>
statesmen, brigands, etc., etc., all their farcical stealing,<lb/>
intriguing, and stabbing is done in dead earnest. It is<lb/>
screamingly funny, the blood flows all the time, and<lb/>
the actors believe themselves to be influencing the fate<lb/>
of the universe. Of course, government in general, any<lb/>
government anywhere, is a thing of exquisite comicality<lb/>
to a discerning mind; but really we Spanish-Americans<lb/>
do overstep the bounds. No man of ordinary intelligence<lb/>
can take part in the intrigues of <hi rend="italic">une farce macabre</hi>.<lb/>
However, these Ribierists, of whom we hear so much<lb/>
just now, are really trying in their own comical way to<lb/>
make the country habitable, and even to pay some of<lb/>
its debts. My friends, you had better write up Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Ribiera all you can in kindness to your own bondholders.<lb/>
Really, if what I am told in my letters is true, there is<lb/>
some chance for them at last."<lb/>


<pb n="153"/>

</p>

<p>     And he would explain with railing verve what Don<lb/>
Vincente Ribiera stood for &mdash; a mournful little man oppressed<lb/>
by his own good intentions, the significance of<lb/>
battles won, who Montero was (<hi rend="italic">un grotesque vaniteux et<lb/>
f&eacute;roce</hi>), and the manner of the new loan connected with<lb/>
railway development, and the colonization of vast<lb/>
tracts of land in one great financial scheme.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And his French friends would remark that evidently<lb/>
this little fellow Decoud <hi rend="italic">connaissait la question &agrave; fond</hi>.<lb/>
An important Parisian review asked him for an article<lb/>
on the situation. It was composed in a serious tone and<lb/>
in a spirit of levity. Afterwards he asked one of his<lb/>
intimates &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Have you read my thing about the regeneration of<lb/>
Costaguana &mdash; <hi rend="italic">une bonne blague, hein?"</hi><lb/>
</p>

<p>     He imagined himself Parisian to the tips of his fingers.<lb/>
But far from being that he was in danger of remaining a<lb/>
sort of nondescript dilettante all his life. He had<lb/>
pushed the habit of universal raillery to a point where it<lb/>
blinded him to the genuine impulses of his own nature.<lb/>
To be suddenly selected for the executive member of<lb/>
the patriotic small-arms committee of Sulaco seemed to<lb/>
him the height of the unexpected, one of those fantastic<lb/>
moves of which only his "dear countrymen" were<lb/>
capable.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
"It's like a tile falling on my head. I &mdash;I &mdash; executive<lb/>
member! It's the first I hear of it! What do I know<lb/>
of military rifles? <hi rend="italic">C'est funambulesque!"</hi> he had exclaimed<lb/>
to his favourite sister; for the Decoud family &mdash;<lb/>
except the old father and mother &mdash; used the French<lb/>
language amongst themselves. "And you should see<lb/>
the explanatory and confidential letter! Eight pages<lb/>
of it &mdash; no less!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This letter, in Antonia's handwriting, was signed by<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute;, who appealed to the "young and gifted<lb/>


<pb n="154"/>

Costaguanero" on public grounds, and privately opened<lb/>
his heart to his talented god-son, a man of wealth and<lb/>
leisure, with wide relations, and by his parentage and<lb/>
bringing-up worthy of all confidence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Which means," Martin commented, cynically, to<lb/>
his sister, "that I am not likely to misappropriate<lb/>
the funds, or go blabbing to our Charg&eacute; d'Affaires<lb/>
here."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The whole thing was being carried out behind the<lb/>
back of the War Minister, Montero, a mistrusted<lb/>
member of the Ribiera Government, but difficult to<lb/>
get rid of at once. He was not to know anything of it<lb/>
till the troops under Barrios's command had the new<lb/>
rifle in their hands. The President-Dictator, whose<lb/>
position was very difficult, was alone in the secret.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "How funny!" commented Martin's sister and confidante;<lb/>
to which the brother, with an air of best Parisian<lb/>
blague, had retorted:<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It's immense! The idea of that Chief of the State<lb/>
engaged, with the help of private citizens, in digging a<lb/>
mine under his own indispensable War Minister. No!<lb/>
We are unapproachable!" And he laughed immoderately.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    Afterwards his sister was surprised at the earnestness<lb/>
and ability he displayed in carrying out his mission,<lb/>
which circumstances made delicate, and his want of<lb/>
special knowledge rendered difficult. She had never<lb/>
seen Martin take so much trouble about anything in his<lb/>
whole life.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It amuses me," he had explained, briefly. "I am<lb/>
beset by a lot of swindlers trying to sell all sorts of gas-<lb/>
pipe weapons. They are charming; they invite me to<lb/>
expensive luncheons; I keep up their hopes; it's extremely<lb/>
entertaining. Meanwhile, the real affair is<lb/>
being carried through in quite another quarter."<lb/>


<pb n="155"/>

</p>

<p>     When the business was concluded he declared suddenly<lb/>
his intention of seeing the precious consignment<lb/>
delivered safely in Sulaco. The whole burlesque business,<lb/>
he thought, was worth following up to the end.<lb/>
He mumbled his excuses, tugging at his golden beard,<lb/>
before the acute young lady who (after the first wide<lb/>
stare of astonishment) looked at him with narrowed<lb/>
eyes, and pronounced slowly &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I believe you want to see Antonia."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What Antonia?" asked the Costaguana boulevardier,<lb/>
in a vexed and disdainful tone. He shrugged<lb/>
his shoulders, and spun round on his heel. His sister<lb/>
called out after him joyously &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The Antonia you used to know when she wore her<lb/>
hair in two plaits down her back."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He had known her some eight years since, shortly before<lb/>
the Avellanos had left Europe for good, as a tall<lb/>
girl of sixteen, youthfully austere, and of a character<lb/>
already so formed that she ventured to treat slightingly<lb/>
his pose of disabused wisdom. On one occasion, as<lb/>
though she had lost all patience, she flew out at him<lb/>
about the aimlessness of his life and the levity of his<lb/>
opinions. He was twenty then, an only son, spoiled by<lb/>
his adoring family. This attack disconcerted him so<lb/>
greatly that he had faltered in his affectation of amused<lb/>
superiority before that insignificant chit of a school-girl.<lb/>
But the impression left was so strong that ever since all<lb/>
the girl friends of his sisters recalled to him Antonia<lb/>
Avellanos by some faint resemblance, or by the great<lb/>
force of contrast. It was, he told himself, like a<lb/>
ridiculous fatality. And, of course, in the news the<lb/>
Decouds received regularly from Costaguana, the<lb/>
name of their friends, the Avellanos, cropped up frequently<lb/>
&mdash; the arrest and the abominable treatment of<lb/>
the ex-Minister, the dangers and hardships endured by<lb/>


<pb n="156"/>

the family, its withdrawal in poverty to Sulaco, the<lb/>
death of the mother.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Monterist pronunciamento had taken place before<lb/>
Martin Decoud reached Costaguana. He came<lb/>
out in a roundabout way, through Magellan's Straits by<lb/>
the main line and the West Coast Service of the O.S.N.<lb/>
Company. His precious consignment arrived just in<lb/>
time to convert the first feelings of consternation into a<lb/>
mood of hope and resolution. Publicly he was made<lb/>
much of by the <hi rend="italic">familias principales</hi>. Privately Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute;, still shaken and weak, embraced him with tears<lb/>
in his eyes.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have come out yourself! No less could be expected<lb/>
from a Decoud. Alas! our worst fears have been<lb/>
realized," he moaned, affectionately. And again he<lb/>
hugged his god-son. This was indeed the time for men<lb/>
of intellect and conscience to rally round the endangered<lb/>
cause.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was then that Martin Decoud, the adopted child of<lb/>
Western Europe, felt the absolute change of atmosphere.<lb/>
He submitted to being embraced and talked to<lb/>
without a word. He was moved in spite of himself by<lb/>
that note of passion and sorrow unknown on the more<lb/>
refined stage of European politics. But when the tall<lb/>
Antonia, advancing with her light step in the dimness<lb/>
of the big bare Sala of the Avellanos house, offered him<lb/>
her hand (in her emancipated way), and murmured, "I<lb/>
am glad to see you here, Don Martin," he felt how impossible<lb/>
it would be to tell these two people that he had<lb/>
intended to go away by the next month's packet. Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute;, meantime, continued his praises. Every accession<lb/>
added to public confidence, and, besides, what an<lb/>
example to the young men at home from the brilliant<lb/>
defender of the country's regeneration, the worthy expounder<lb/>
of the party's political faith before the world!<lb/>


<pb n="157"/>

Everybody had read the magnificent article in the<lb/>
famous Parisian Review. The world was now informed:<lb/>
and the author's appearance at this moment<lb/>
was like a public act of faith. Young Decoud felt overcome<lb/>
by a feeling of impatient confusion. His plan had<lb/>
been to return by way of the United States through<lb/>
California, visit Yellowstone Park, see Chicago,<lb/>
Niagara, have a look at Canada, perhaps make a short<lb/>
stay in New York, a longer one in Newport, use his<lb/>
letters of introduction. The pressure of Antonia's hand<lb/>
was so frank, the tone of her voice was so unexpectedly<lb/>
unchanged in its approving warmth, that all he found to<lb/>
say after his low bow was &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am inexpressibly grateful for your welcome; but<lb/>
why need a man be thanked for returning to his native<lb/>
country? I am sure Do&ntilde;a Antonia does not think so."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Certainly not, se&ntilde;or," she said, with that perfectly<lb/>
calm openness of manner which characterized all her<lb/>
utterances. "But when he returns, as you return, one<lb/>
may be glad &mdash; for the sake of both."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Martin Decoud said nothing of his plans. He not<lb/>
only never breathed a word of them to any one, but only<lb/>
a fortnight later asked the mistress of the Casa Gould<lb/>
(where he had of course obtained admission at once),<lb/>
leaning forward in his chair with an air of well-bred<lb/>
familiarity, whether she could not detect in him that<lb/>
day a marked change &mdash; an air, he explained, of more<lb/>
excellent gravity. At this Mrs. Gould turned her face<lb/>
full towards him with the silent inquiry of slightly<lb/>
widened eyes and the merest ghost of a smile, an<lb/>
habitual movement with her, which was very fascinating<lb/>
to men by something subtly devoted, finely self-<lb/>
forgetful in its lively readiness of attention. Because,<lb/>
Decoud continued imperturbably, he felt no longer<lb/>
an idle cumberer of the earth. She was, he assured<lb/>


<pb n="158"/>

her, actually beholding at that moment the Journalist<lb/>
of Sulaco. At once Mrs. Gould glanced towards Antonia,<lb/>
posed upright in the corner of a high, straight-<lb/>
backed Spanish sofa, a large black fan waving slowly<lb/>
against the curves of her fine figure, the tips of crossed<lb/>
feet peeping from under the hem of the black skirt.<lb/>
Decoud's eyes also remained fixed there, while in an<lb/>
undertone he added that Miss Avellanos was quite<lb/>
aware of his new and unexpected vocation, which in<lb/>
Costaguana was generally the speciality of half-<lb/>
educated negroes and wholly penniless lawyers. Then,<lb/>
confronting with a sort of urbane effrontery Mrs.<lb/>
Gould's gaze, now turned sympathetically upon himself,<lb/>
he breathed out the words, "Pro Patria!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     What had happened was that he had all at once<lb/>
yielded to Don Jos&eacute;'s pressing entreaties to take the<lb/>
direction of a newspaper that would "voice the aspirations<lb/>
of the province." It had been Don Jos&eacute;'s old and<lb/>
cherished idea. The necessary plant (on a modest<lb/>
scale) and a large consignment of paper had been received<lb/>
from America some time before; the right man<lb/>
alone was wanted. Even Se&ntilde;or Moraga in Sta. Marta<lb/>
had not been able to find one, and the matter was now<lb/>
becoming pressing; some organ was absolutely needed<lb/>
to counteract the effect of the lies disseminated by the<lb/>
Monterist press: the atrocious calumnies, the appeals<lb/>
to the people calling upon them to rise with their knives<lb/>
in their hands and put an end once for all to the Blancos,<lb/>
to these Gothic remnants, to these sinister mummies,<lb/>
these impotent paraliticos, who plotted with foreigners<lb/>
for the surrender of the lands and the slavery of the<lb/>
people.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The clamour of this <hi rend="italic">Negro Liberalism</hi> frightened<lb/>
Se&nacute;or Avellanos. A newspaper was the only remedy.<lb/>
And now that the right man had been found in Decoud,<lb/>


<pb n="159"/>

great black letters appeared painted between the windows<lb/>
above the arcaded ground floor of a house on the<lb/>
Plaza. It was next to Anzani's great emporium of<lb/>
boots, silks, ironware, muslins, wooden toys, tiny silver<lb/>
arms, legs, heads, hearts (for ex-voto offerings), rosaries,<lb/>
champagne, women's hats, patent medicines, even a few<lb/>
dusty books in paper covers and mostly in the French<lb/>
language. The big black letters formed the words,<lb/>
"Offices of the <hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi>." From these offices a single<lb/>
folded sheet of Martin's journalism issued three times a<lb/>
week; and the sleek yellow Anzani prowling in a suit of<lb/>
ample black and carpet slippers, before the many doors<lb/>
of his establishment, greeted by a deep, side-long inclination<lb/>
of his body the Journalist of Sulaco going to and<lb/>
fro on the business of his august calling.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     PERHAPS it was in the exercise of his calling that he<lb/>
had come to see the troops depart. The <hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi> of the<lb/>
day after next would no doubt relate the event, but its<lb/>
editor, leaning his side against the landau, seemed to<lb/>
look at nothing. The front rank of the company of<lb/>
infantry drawn up three deep across the shore end of the<lb/>
jetty when pressed too close would bring their bayonets<lb/>
to the charge ferociously, with an awful rattle; and then<lb/>
the crowd of spectators swayed back bodily, even under<lb/>
the noses of the big white mules. Notwithstanding the<lb/>
great multitude there was only a low, muttering noise;<lb/>
the dust hung in a brown haze, in which the horsemen,<lb/>
wedged in the throng here and there, towered from the<lb/>
hips upwards, gazing all one way over the heads. Almost<lb/>
every one of them had mounted a friend, who<lb/>
steadied himself with both hands grasping his shoulders<lb/>
from behind; and the rims of their hats touching, made<lb/>
like one disc sustaining the cones of two pointed crowns<lb/>
with a double face underneath. A hoarse mozo would<lb/>
bawl out something to an acquaintance in the ranks, or<lb/>
a woman would shriek suddenly the word <hi rend="italic">Adios!</hi><lb/>
followed by the Christian name of a man.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     General Barrios, in a shabby blue tunic and white<lb/>
peg-top trousers falling upon strange red boots, kept his<lb/>
head uncovered and stooped slightly, propping himself<lb/>
up with a thick stick. No! He had earned enough<lb/>
military glory to satiate any man, he insisted to Mrs.<lb/>
Gould, trying at the same time to put an air of gallantry<lb/>
into his attitude. A few jetty hairs hung sparsely from<lb/>




<pb n="161"/>

his upper lip, he had a salient nose, a thin, long jaw, and<lb/>
a black silk patch over one eye. His other eye, small<lb/>
and deep-set, twinkled erratically in all directions,<lb/>
aimlessly affable. The few European spectators, all<lb/>
men, who had naturally drifted into the neighbourhood<lb/>
of the Gould carriage, betrayed by the solemnity of their<lb/>
faces their impression that the general must have had too<lb/>
much punch (Swedish punch, imported in bottles by<lb/>
Anzani) at the Amarilla Club before he had started with<lb/>
his Staff on a furious ride to the harbour. But Mrs.<lb/>
Gould bent forward, self-possessed, and declared her<lb/>
conviction that still more glory awaited the general in<lb/>
the near future.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Se&ntilde;ora!" he remonstrated, with great feeling, "in<lb/>
the name of God, reflect! How can there be any glory<lb/>
for a man like me in overcoming that bald-headed<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">embustero</hi> with the dyed moustaches?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Pablo Ignacio Barrios, son of a village alcalde, general<lb/>
of division, commanding in chief the Occidental Military<lb/>
district, did not frequent the higher society of the<lb/>
town. He preferred the unceremonious gatherings of<lb/>
men where he could tell jaguar-hunt stories, boast of<lb/>
his powers with the lasso, with which he could perform<lb/>
extremely difficult feats of the sort "no married man<lb/>
should attempt," as the saying goes amongst the<lb/>
llaneros; relate tales of extraordinary night rides, encounters<lb/>
with wild bulls, struggles with crocodiles,<lb/>
adventures in the great forests, crossings of swollen<lb/>
rivers. And it was not mere boastfulness that prompted<lb/>
the general's reminiscences, but a genuine love of that<lb/>
wild life which he had led in his young days before he<lb/>
turned his back for ever on the thatched roof of the<lb/>
parental tolderia in the woods. Wandering away as<lb/>
far as Mexico he had fought against the French by the<lb/>
side (as he said) of Juarez, and was the only military<lb/>


<pb n="162"/>

man of Costaguana who had ever encountered European<lb/>
troops in the field. That fact shed a great lustre upon<lb/>
his name till it became eclipsed by the rising star of<lb/>
Montero. All his life he had been an inveterate gambler.<lb/>
He alluded himself quite openly to the current<lb/>
story how once, during some campaign (when in command<lb/>
of a brigade), he had gambled away his horses,<lb/>
pistols, and accoutrements, to the very epaulettes,<lb/>
playing <hi rend="italic">monte</hi> with his colonels the night before the<lb/>
battle. Finally, he had sent under escort his sword<lb/>
(a presentation sword, with a gold hilt) to the town in<lb/>
the rear of his position to be immediately pledged for<lb/>
five hundred pesetas with a sleepy and frightened<lb/>
shop-keeper. By daybreak he had lost the last of that<lb/>
money, too, when his only remark, as he rose calmly,<lb/>
was, "Now let us go and fight to the death." From<lb/>
that time he had become aware that a general could<lb/>
lead his troops into battle very well with a simple stick<lb/>
in his hand. "It has been my custom ever since," he<lb/>
would say.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He was always overwhelmed with debts; even during<lb/>
the periods of splendour in his varied fortunes of a<lb/>
Costaguana general, when he held high military commands,<lb/>
his gold-laced uniforms were almost always in<lb/>
pawn with some tradesman. And at last, to avoid the<lb/>
incessant difficulties of costume caused by the anxious<lb/>
lenders, he had assumed a disdain of military trappings,<lb/>
an eccentric fashion of shabby old tunics, which had<lb/>
become like a second nature. But the faction Barrios<lb/>
joined needed to fear no political betrayal. He was<lb/>
too much of a real soldier for the ignoble traffic of buying<lb/>
and selling victories. A member of the foreign<lb/>
diplomatic body in Sta. Marta had once passed a<lb/>
judgment upon him: "Barrios is a man of perfect<lb/>
honesty and even of some talent for war, <hi rend="italic">mais il manque</hi><lb/>


<pb n="163"/>

<hi rend="italic">de tenue</hi>." After the triumph of the Ribierists he had<lb/>
obtained the reputedly lucrative Occidental command,<lb/>
mainly through the exertions of his creditors (the Sta.<lb/>
Marta shopkeepers, all great politicians), who moved<lb/>
heaven and earth in his interest publicly, and privately<lb/>
besieged Se&ntilde;or Moraga, the influential agent of the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mine, with the exaggerated lamentations<lb/>
that if the general were passed over, "We shall all be<lb/>
ruined." An incidental but favourable mention of his<lb/>
name in Mr. Gould senior's long correspondence with<lb/>
his son had something to do with his appointment, too;<lb/>
but most of all undoubtedly his established political<lb/>
honesty. No one questioned the personal bravery of<lb/>
the Tiger-killer, as the populace called him. He was,<lb/>
however, said to be unlucky in the field &mdash; but this was<lb/>
to be the beginning of an era of peace. The soldiers<lb/>
liked him for his humane temper, which was like a<lb/>
strange and precious flower unexpectedly blooming on<lb/>
the hotbed of corrupt revolutions; and when he rode<lb/>
slowly through the streets during some military display,<lb/>
the contemptuous good humour of his solitary eye roaming<lb/>
over the crowds extorted the acclamations of the<lb/>
populace. The women of that class especially seemed<lb/>
positively fascinated by the long drooping nose, the<lb/>
peaked chin, the heavy lower lip, the black silk eye-<lb/>
patch and band slanting rakishly over the forehead.<lb/>
His high rank always procured an audience of Caballeros<lb/>
for his sporting stories, which he detailed very<lb/>
well with a simple, grave enjoyment. As to the society<lb/>
of ladies, it was irksome by the restraints it imposed<lb/>
without any equivalent, as far as he could see. He had<lb/>
not, perhaps, spoken three times on the whole to Mrs.<lb/>
Gould since he had taken up his high command; but he<lb/>
had observed her frequently riding with the Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Administrador, and had pronounced that there was<lb/>


<pb n="164"/>

more sense in her little bridle-hand than in all the female<lb/>
heads in Sulaco. His impulse had been to be very<lb/>
civil on parting to a woman who did not wobble in the<lb/>
saddle, and happened to be the wife of a personality<lb/>
very important to a man always short of money. He<lb/>
even pushed his attentions so far as to desire the aide-de-<lb/>
camp at his side (a thick-set, short captain with a Tartar<lb/>
physiognomy) to bring along a corporal with a file of<lb/>
men in front of the carriage, lest the crowd in its backward<lb/>
surges should "incommode the mules of the<lb/>
se&ntilde;ora." Then, turning to the small knot of silent<lb/>
Europeans looking on within earshot, he raised his<lb/>
voice protectingly &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Se&ntilde;ores, have no apprehension. Go on quietly<lb/>
making your Ferro Carril &mdash; your railways, your telegraphs.<lb/>
Your &mdash; There's enough wealth in Costaguana<lb/>
to pay for everything &mdash; or else you would not be<lb/>
here. Ha! ha! Don't mind this little picardia of my<lb/>
friend Montero. In a little while you shall behold his<lb/>
dyed moustaches through the bars of a strong wooden<lb/>
cage. Si, se&ntilde;ores! Fear nothing, develop the country,<lb/>
work, work!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The little group of engineers received this exhortation<lb/>
without a word, and after waving his hand at them<lb/>
loftily, he addressed himself again to Mrs. Gould &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That is what Don Jos&eacute; says we must do. Be enterprising!<lb/>
Work! Grow rich! To put Montero in a<lb/>
cage is my work; and when that insignificant piece of<lb/>
business is done, then, as Don Jos&eacute; wishes us, we shall<lb/>
grow rich, one and all, like so many Englishmen, because<lb/>
it is money that saves a country, and &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But a young officer in a very new uniform, hurrying<lb/>
up from the direction of the jetty, interrupted his<lb/>
interpretation of Se&ntilde;or Avellanos's ideals. The general<lb/>
made a movement of impatience; the other went on<lb/>


<pb n="165"/>

talking to him insistently, with an air of respect. The<lb/>
horses of the Staff had been embarked, the steamer's<lb/>
gig was awaiting the general at the boat steps; and<lb/>
Barrios, after a fierce stare of his one eye, began to take<lb/>
leave. Don Jos&eacute; roused himself for an appropriate<lb/>
phrase pronounced mechanically. The terrible strain<lb/>
of hope and fear was telling on him, and he seemed to<lb/>
husband the last sparks of his fire for those oratorical<lb/>
efforts of which even the distant Europe was to hear.<lb/>
Antonia, her red lips firmly closed, averted her head<lb/>
behind the raised fan; and young Decoud, though he<lb/>
felt the girl's eyes upon him, gazed away persistently,<lb/>
hooked on his elbow, with a scornful and complete detachment.<lb/>
Mrs. Gould heroically concealed her dismay<lb/>
at the appearance of men and events so remote<lb/>
from her racial conventions, dismay too deep to be<lb/>
uttered in words even to her husband. She understood<lb/>
his voiceless reserve better now. Their confidential<lb/>
intercourse fell, not in moments of privacy, but precisely<lb/>
in public, when the quick meeting of their glances<lb/>
would comment upon some fresh turn of events. She<lb/>
had gone to his school of uncompromising silence, the<lb/>
only one possible, since so much that seemed shocking,<lb/>
weird, and grotesque in the working out of their purposes<lb/>
had to be accepted as normal in this country.<lb/>
Decidedly, the stately Antonia looked more mature and<lb/>
infinitely calm; but she would never have known how<lb/>
to reconcile the sudden sinkings of her heart with an<lb/>
amiable mobility of expression.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould smiled a good-bye at Barrios, nodded<lb/>
round to the Europeans (who raised their hats simultaneously)<lb/>
with an engaging invitation, "I hope to<lb/>
see you all presently, at home"; then said nervously to<lb/>
Decoud, "Get in, Don Martin," and heard him mutter<lb/>
to himself in French, as he opened the carriage door,<lb/>

<pb n="166"/>

<hi rend="italic">"Le sort en est jet&eacute;</hi>." She heard him with a sort of<lb/>
exasperation. Nobody ought to have known better<lb/>
than himself that the first cast of dice had been already<lb/>
thrown long ago in a most desperate game. Distant<lb/>
acclamations, words of command yelled out, and a roll<lb/>
of drums on the jetty greeted the departing general.<lb/>
Something like a slight faintness came over her, and she<lb/>
looked blankly at Antonia's still face, wondering what<lb/>
would happen to Charley if that absurd man failed.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"A la casa, Ignacio</hi>," she cried at the motionless broad<lb/>
back of the coachman, who gathered the reins without<lb/>
haste, mumbling to himself under his breath, <hi rend="italic">"Si,<lb/>
la casa. Si, si ni&ntilde;a</hi>."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The carriage rolled noiselessly on the soft track, the<lb/>
shadows fell long on the dusty little plain interspersed<lb/>
with dark bushes, mounds of turned-up earth, low<lb/>
wooden buildings with iron roofs of the Railway<lb/>
Company; the sparse row of telegraph poles strode<lb/>
obliquely clear of the town, bearing a single, almost invisible<lb/>
wire far into the great campo &mdash; like a slender,<lb/>
vibrating feeler of that progress waiting outside for a<lb/>
moment of peace to enter and twine itself about the<lb/>
weary heart of the land.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute;</hi> window of the Albergo d'ltalia Una was full<lb/>
of sunburnt, whiskered faces of railway men. But at<lb/>
the other end of the house, the end of the Signori<lb/>
Inglesi, old Giorgio, at the door with one of his girls on<lb/>
each side, bared his bushy head, as white as the snows of<lb/>
Higuerota. Mrs. Gould stopped the carriage. She<lb/>
seldom failed to speak to her <hi rend="italic">prot&eacute;g&eacute;</hi>; moreover, the<lb/>
excitement, the heat, and the dust had made her<lb/>
thirsty. She asked for a glass of water. Giorgio sent<lb/>
the children indoors for it, and approached with pleasure<lb/>
expressed in his whole rugged countenance. It was not<lb/>
often that he had occasion to see his benefactress,<lb/>


<pb n="167"/>

who was also an Englishwoman &mdash; another title to his<lb/>
regard. He offered some excuses for his wife. It<lb/>
was a bad day with her; her oppressions &mdash; he tapped his<lb/>
own broad chest. She could not move from her chair<lb/>
that day.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud, ensconced in the corner of his seat, observed<lb/>
gloomily Mrs. Gould's old revolutionist, then, offhand &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well, and what do you think of it all, Garibaldino?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Old Giorgio, looking at him with some curiosity, said<lb/>
civilly that the troops had marched very well. One-<lb/>
eyed Barrios and his officers had done wonders with the<lb/>
recruits in a short time. Those Indios, only caught the<lb/>
other day, had gone swinging past in double quick time,<lb/>
like bersaglieri; they looked well fed, too, and had whole<lb/>
uniforms. "Uniforms!" he repeated with a half-smile<lb/>
of pity. A look of grim retrospect stole over his piercing,<lb/>
steady eyes. It had been otherwise in his time<lb/>
when men fought against tyranny, in the forests of<lb/>
Brazil, or on the plains of Uruguay, starving on half-<lb/>
raw beef without salt, half naked, with often only a<lb/>
knife tied to a stick for a weapon. "And yet we<lb/>
used to prevail against the oppressor," he concluded,<lb/>
proudly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His animation fell; the slight gesture of his hand<lb/>
expressed discouragement; but he added that he had<lb/>
asked one of the sergeants to show him the new rifle.<lb/>
There was no such weapon in his fighting days; and if<lb/>
Barrios could not &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes, yes," broke in Don Jos&eacute;, almost trembling<lb/>
with eagerness. "We are safe. The good Se&ntilde;or Viola<lb/>
is a man of experience. Extremely deadly &mdash; is it not<lb/>
so? You have accomplished your mission admirably,<lb/>
my dear Martin."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud, lolling back moodily, contemplated old<lb/>
Viola.<lb/>


<pb n="168"/>

</p>

<p>     "Ah! Yes. A man of experience. But who are<lb/>
you for, really, in your heart?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould leaned over to the children. Linda had<lb/>
brought out a glass of water on a tray, with extreme<lb/>
care; Giselle presented her with a bunch of flowers<lb/>
gathered hastily.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "For the people," declared old Viola, sternly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "We are all for the people &mdash; in the end."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes," muttered old Viola, savagely. "And meantime<lb/>
they fight for you. Blind. Esclavos!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     At that moment young Scarfe of the railway staff<lb/>
emerged from the door of the part reserved for the<lb/>
Signori Inglesi. He had come down to headquarters<lb/>
from somewhere up the line on a light engine, and had<lb/>
had just time to get a bath and change his clothes. He<lb/>
was a nice boy, and Mrs. Gould welcomed him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It's a delightful surprise to see you, Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
I've just come down. Usual luck. Missed everything,<lb/>
of course. This show is just over, and I hear there has<lb/>
been a great dance at Don Juste Lopez's last night. Is<lb/>
it true?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The young patricians," Decoud began suddenly in<lb/>
his precise English, "have indeed been dancing before<lb/>
they started off to the war with the Great Pompey."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Young Scarfe stared, astounded. "You haven't<lb/>
met before," Mrs. Gould intervened. "Mr. Decoud &mdash;<lb/>
Mr. Scarfe."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! But we are not going to Pharsalia," protested<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute;, with nervous haste, also in English.<lb/>
"You should not jest like this, Martin."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Antonia's breast rose and fell with a deeper breath.<lb/>
The young engineer was utterly in the dark. "Great<lb/>
what?" he muttered, vaguely.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Luckily, Montero is not a C&aelig;sar," Decoud continued.<lb/>
"Not the two Monteros put together would<lb/>


<pb n="169"/>

make a decent parody of a C&aelig;sar." He crossed his<lb/>
arms on his breast, looking at Se&ntilde;or Avellanos, who<lb/>
had returned to his immobility. "It is only you, Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute;, who are a genuine old Roman &mdash; vir Romanus &mdash;<lb/>
eloquent and inflexible."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Since he had heard the name of Montero pronounced,<lb/>
young Scarfe had been eager to express his simple feelings.<lb/>
In a loud and youthful tone he hoped that this<lb/>
Montero was going to be licked once for all and done<lb/>
with. There was no saying what would happen to the<lb/>
railway if the revolution got the upper hand. Perhaps<lb/>
it would have to be abandoned. It would not be the<lb/>
first railway gone to pot in Costaguana. "You know,<lb/>
it's one of their so-called national things," he ran on,<lb/>
wrinkling up his nose as if the word had a suspicious<lb/>
flavour to his profound experience of South American<lb/>
affairs. And, of course, he chatted with animation, it<lb/>
had been such an immense piece of luck for him at his<lb/>
age to get appointed on the staff "of a big thing like<lb/>
that &mdash; don't you know." It would give him the pull<lb/>
over a lot of chaps all through life, he asserted. "Therefore<lb/>
&mdash; down with Montero! Mrs. Gould." His artless<lb/>
grin disappeared slowly before the unanimous gravity<lb/>
of the faces turned upon him from the carriage; only<lb/>
that "old chap," Don Jos&eacute;, presenting a motionless,<lb/>
waxy profile, stared straight on as if deaf. Scarfe did<lb/>
not know the Avellanos very well. They did not give<lb/>
balls, and Antonia never appeared at a ground-floor<lb/>
window, as some other young ladies used to do attended<lb/>
by elder women, to chat with the caballeros on<lb/>
horseback in the Calle. The stares of these creoles did<lb/>
not matter much; but what on earth had come to Mrs.<lb/>
Gould? She said, "Go on, Ignacio," and gave him a<lb/>
slow inclination of the head. He heard a short laugh<lb/>
from that round-faced, Frenchified fellow. He coloured<lb/>


<pb n="170"/>

up to the eyes, and stared at Giorgio Viola, who had<lb/>
fallen back with the children, hat in hand.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I shall want a horse presently," he said with some<lb/>
asperity to the old man.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Si, se&ntilde;or. There are plenty of horses," murmured<lb/>
the Garibaldino, smoothing absently, with his brown<lb/>
hands, the two heads, one dark with bronze glints, the<lb/>
other fair with a coppery ripple, of the two girls by his<lb/>
side. The returning stream of sightseers raised a<lb/>
great dust on the road. Horsemen noticed the group.<lb/>
"Go to your mother," he said. "They are growing up<lb/>
as I am growing older, and there is nobody &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He looked at the young engineer and stopped, as if<lb/>
awakened from a dream; then, folding his arms on his<lb/>
breast, took up his usual position, leaning back in the<lb/>
doorway with an upward glance fastened on the white<lb/>
shoulder of Higuerota far away.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the carriage Martin Decoud, shifting his position<lb/>
as though he could not make himself comfortable, muttered<lb/>
as he swayed towards Antonia, "I suppose you<lb/>
hate me." Then in a loud voice he began to congratulate<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute; upon all the engineers being convinced<lb/>
Ribierists. The interest of all those foreigners<lb/>
was gratifying. "You have heard this one. He is an<lb/>
enlightened well-wisher. It is pleasant to think that<lb/>
the prosperity of Costaguana is of some use to the<lb/>
world."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He is very young," Mrs. Gould remarked, quietly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And so very wise for his age," retorted Decoud.<lb/>
"But here we have the naked truth from the mouth of<lb/>
that child. You are right, Don Jos&eacute;. The natural<lb/>
treasures of Costaguana are of importance to the progressive<lb/>
Europe represented by this youth, just as three<lb/>
hundred years ago the wealth of our Spanish fathers<lb/>
was a serious object to the rest of Europe &mdash; as represented<lb/>


<pb n="171"/>

by the bold buccaneers. There is a curse of<lb/>
futility upon our character: Don Quixote and Sancho<lb/>
Panza, chivalry and materialism, high-sounding sentiments<lb/>
and a supine morality, violent efforts for an idea<lb/>
and a sullen acquiescence in every form of corruption.<lb/>
We convulsed a continent for our independence only to<lb/>
become the passive prey of a democratic parody, the<lb/>
helpless victims of scoundrels and cut-throats, our<lb/>
institutions a mockery, our laws a farce &mdash; a Guzman<lb/>
Bento our master! And we have sunk so low that when<lb/>
a man like you has awakened our conscience, a stupid<lb/>
barbarian of a Montero &mdash; Great Heavens! a Montero! &mdash;<lb/>
becomes a deadly danger, and an ignorant, boastful<lb/>
Indio, like Barrios, is our defender."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But Don Jos&eacute;, disregarding the general indictment as<lb/>
though he had not heard a word of it, took up the defence<lb/>
of Barrios. The man was competent enough for<lb/>
his special task in the plan of campaign. It consisted<lb/>
in an offensive movement, with Cayta as base, upon the<lb/>
flank of the Revolutionist forces advancing from the<lb/>
south against Sta. Marta, which was covered by another<lb/>
army with the President-Dictator in its midst. Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute; became quite animated with a great flow of speech,<lb/>
bending forward anxiously under the steady eyes of his<lb/>
daughter. Decoud, as if silenced by so much ardour,<lb/>
did not make a sound. The bells of the city were striking<lb/>
the hour of Oracion when the carriage rolled under<lb/>
the old gateway facing the harbour like a shapeless<lb/>
monument of leaves and stones. The rumble of wheels<lb/>
under the sonorous arch was traversed by a strange,<lb/>
piercing shriek, and Decoud, from his back seat, had a<lb/>
view of the people behind the carriage trudging along<lb/>
the road outside, all turning their heads, in sombreros<lb/>
and rebozos, to look at a locomotive which rolled<lb/>
quickly out of sight behind Giorgio Viola's house, under<lb/>


<pb n="172"/>

a white trail of steam that seemed to vanish in the<lb/>
breathless, hysterically prolonged scream of warlike<lb/>
triumph. And it was all like a fleeting vision, the<lb/>
shrieking ghost of a railway engine fleeing across the<lb/>
frame of the archway, behind the startled movement<lb/>
of the people streaming back from a military spectacle<lb/>
with silent footsteps on the dust of the road. It was a<lb/>
material train returning from the Campo to the palisaded<lb/>
yards. The empty cars rolled lightly on the<lb/>
single track; there was no rumble of wheels, no tremor<lb/>
of the ground.   The engine-driver, running past the<lb/>
Casa Viola with the salute of an uplifted arm, checked<lb/>
his speed smartly before entering the yard; and when<lb/>
the ear-splitting screech of the steam-whistle for the<lb/>
brakes had stopped, a series of hard, battering shocks,<lb/>
mingled with the clanking of chain-couplings, made a<lb/>
tumult of blows and shaken fetters under the vault of<lb/>
the gate.<lb/>
</p>

<head>CHAPTER FIVE</head>

<pb n="173"/>


<p>     THE Gould carriage was the first to return from the<lb/>
harbour to the empty town. On the ancient pavement,<lb/>
laid out in patterns, sunk into ruts and holes, the portly<lb/>
Ignacio, mindful of the springs of the Parisian-built<lb/>
landau, had pulled up to a walk, and Decoud in his<lb/>
corner contemplated moodily the inner aspect of the<lb/>
gate. The squat turreted sides held up between them<lb/>
a mass of masonry with bunches of grass growing at the<lb/>
top, and a grey, heavily scrolled, armorial shield of stone<lb/>
above the apex of the arch with the arms of Spain nearly<lb/>
smoothed out as if in readiness for some new device<lb/>
typical of the impending progress.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The explosive noise of the railway trucks seemed to<lb/>
augment Decoud's irritation. He muttered something<lb/>
to himself, then began to talk aloud in curt, angry<lb/>
phrases thrown at the silence of the two women. They<lb/>
did not look at him at all; while Don Jos&eacute;, with his semi-<lb/>
translucent, waxy complexion, overshadowed by the<lb/>
soft grey hat, swayed a little to the jolts of the carriage<lb/>
by the side of Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "This sound puts a new edge on a very old<lb/>
truth."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud spoke in French, perhaps because of Ignacio<lb/>
on the box above him; the old coachman, with his broad<lb/>
back filling a short, silver-braided jacket, had a big<lb/>
pair of ears, whose thick rims stood well away from his<lb/>
cropped head.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes, the noise outside the city wall is new, but the<lb/>
principle is old."<lb/>




<pb n="174"/>

</p>

<p>     He ruminated his discontent for a while, then began<lb/>
afresh with a sidelong glance at Antonia &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, but just imagine our forefathers in morions and<lb/>
corselets drawn up outside this gate, and a band of<lb/>
adventurers just landed from their ships in the harbour<lb/>
there. Thieves, of course. Speculators, too. Their<lb/>
expeditions, each one, were the speculations of grave<lb/>
and reverend persons in England. That is history, as<lb/>
that absurd sailor Mitchell is always saying."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Mitchell's arrangements for the embarkation of the<lb/>
troops were excellent!" exclaimed Don Jos&eacute;.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
"That! &mdash; that! oh, that's really the work of that<lb/>
Genoese seaman! But to return to my noises; there<lb/>
used to be in the old days the sound of trumpets outside<lb/>
that gate. War trumpets! I'm sure they were trumpets.<lb/>
I have read somewhere that Drake, who was<lb/>
the greatest of these men, used to dine alone in his<lb/>
cabin on board ship to the sound of trumpets. In<lb/>
those days this town was full of wealth. Those men<lb/>
came to take it. Now the whole land is like a treasure-<lb/>
house, and all these people are breaking into it, whilst<lb/>
we are cutting each other's throats. The only thing<lb/>
that keeps them out is mutual jealousy. But they'll<lb/>
come to an agreement some day &mdash; and by the time we've<lb/>
settled our quarrels and become decent and honourable,<lb/>
there'll be nothing left for us. It has always been the<lb/>
same. We are a wonderful people, but it has always<lb/>
been our fate to be" &mdash; he did not say "robbed," but<lb/>
added, after a pause &mdash; "exploited!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould said, "Oh, this is unjust!" And Antonia<lb/>
interjected, "Don't answer him, Emilia. He is attacking<lb/>
me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You surely do not think I was attacking Don Carlos!"<lb/>
Decoud answered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And then the carriage stopped before the door of the<lb/>


<pb n="175"/>

Casa Gould. The young man offered his hand to the<lb/>
ladies. They went in first together; Don Jos&eacute; walked<lb/>
by the side of Decoud, and the gouty old porter tottered<lb/>
after them with some light wraps on his arm.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; slipped his hand under the arm of the<lb/>
journalist of Sulaco.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The <hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi> must have a long and confident article<lb/>
upon Barrios and the irresistibleness of his army of<lb/>
Cayta! The moral effect should be kept up in the<lb/>
country. We must cable encouraging extracts to<lb/>
Europe and the United States to maintain a favourable<lb/>
impression abroad."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud muttered, "Oh, yes, we must comfort our<lb/>
friends, the speculators."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The long open gallery was in shadow, with its screen<lb/>
of plants in vases along the balustrade, holding out<lb/>
motionless blossoms, and all the glass doors of the<lb/>
reception-rooms thrown open. A jingle of spurs died<lb/>
out at the further end.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Basilio, standing aside against the wall, said in a soft<lb/>
tone to the passing ladies, "The Se&ntilde;or Administrador is<lb/>
just back from the mountain."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the great sala, with its groups of ancient Spanish<lb/>
and modern European furniture making as if different<lb/>
centres under the high white spread of the ceiling, the<lb/>
silver and porcelain of the tea-service gleamed among<lb/>
a cluster of dwarf chairs, like a bit of a lady's<lb/>
boudoir, putting in a note of feminine and intimate<lb/>
delicacy.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; in his rocking-chair placed his hat on his<lb/>
lap, and Decoud walked up and down the whole length<lb/>
of the room, passing between tables loaded with knickknacks<lb/>
and almost disappearing behind the high backs<lb/>
of leathern sofas. He was thinking of the angry face of<lb/>
Antonia; he was confident that he would make his<lb/>


<pb n="176"/>

peace with her. He had not stayed in Sulaco to quarrel<lb/>
with Antonia.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Martin Decoud was angry with himself. All he saw<lb/>
and heard going on around him exasperated the preconceived<lb/>
views of his European civilization. To<lb/>
contemplate revolutions from the distance of the<lb/>
Parisian Boulevards was quite another matter. Here<lb/>
on the spot it was not possible to dismiss their tragic<lb/>
comedy with the expression, <hi rend="italic">"Quelle farce!"</hi><lb/>
</p>

<p>     The reality of the political action, such as it was,<lb/>
seemed closer, and acquired poignancy by Antonia's<lb/>
belief in the cause. Its crudeness hurt his feelings. He<lb/>
was surprised at his own sensitiveness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I suppose I am more of a Costaguanero than I would<lb/>
have believed possible," he thought to himself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His disdain grew like a reaction of his scepticism<lb/>
against the action into which he was forced by his<lb/>
infatuation for Antonia. He soothed himself by saying<lb/>
he was not a patriot, but a lover.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The ladies came in bareheaded, and Mrs. Gould sank<lb/>
low before the little tea-table. Antonia took up her<lb/>
usual place at the reception hour &mdash; the corner of a<lb/>
leathern couch, with a rigid grace in her pose and a fan<lb/>
in her hand. Decoud, swerving from the straight line of<lb/>
his march, came to lean over the high back of her seat.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     For a long time he talked into her ear from behind,<lb/>
softly, with a half smile and an air of apologetic familiarity.<lb/>
Her fan lay half grasped on her knees. She<lb/>
never looked at him. His rapid utterance grew more<lb/>
and more insistent and caressing. At last he ventured<lb/>
a slight laugh.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, really. You must forgive me. One must be<lb/>
serious sometimes." He paused. She turned her<lb/>
head a little; her blue eyes glided slowly towards him,<lb/>
slightly upwards, mollified and questioning.<lb/>


<pb n="177"/>

</p>

<p>     "You can't think I am serious when I call Montero a<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">gran' bestia</hi> every second day in the <hi rend="italic">Porvenir?</hi> That<lb/>
is not a serious occupation. No occupation is serious,<lb/>
not even when a bullet through the heart is the penalty<lb/>
of failure!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Her hand closed firmly on her fan.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Some reason, you understand, I mean some sense,<lb/>
may creep into thinking; some glimpse of truth. I<lb/>
mean some effective truth, for which there is no room<lb/>
in politics or journalism. I happen to have said what<lb/>
I thought. And you are angry! If you do me the<lb/>
kindness to think a little you will see that I spoke like a<lb/>
patriot."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She opened her red lips for the first time, not unkindly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "Yes, but you never see the aim. Men must be used<lb/>
as they are. I suppose nobody is really disinterested,<lb/>
unless, perhaps, you, Don Martin."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "God forbid! It's the last thing I should like you to<lb/>
believe of me." He spoke lightly, and paused.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She began to fan herself with a slow movement without<lb/>
raising her hand. After a time he whispered passionately<lb/>
&mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Antonia!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She smiled, and extended her hand after the English<lb/>
manner towards Charles Gould, who was bowing before<lb/>
her; while Decoud, with his elbows spread on the back<lb/>
of the sofa, dropped his eyes and murmured, <hi rend="italic">"Bonjour</hi>."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Se&ntilde;or Administrador of the San Tom&eacute; mine bent<lb/>
over his wife for a moment. They exchanged a few<lb/>
words, of which only the phrase, "The greatest enthusiasm,"<lb/>
pronounced by Mrs. Gould, could be heard.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes," Decoud began in a murmur. "Even he!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "This is sheer calumny," said Antonia, not very<lb/>
severely.<lb/>


<pb n="178"/>

</p>

<p>     "You just ask him to throw his mine into the melting-<lb/>
pot for the great cause," Decoud whispered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; had raised his voice. He rubbed his hands<lb/>
cheerily. The excellent aspect of the troops and the<lb/>
great quantity of new deadly rifles on the shoulders of<lb/>
those brave men seemed to fill him with an ecstatic<lb/>
confidence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould, very tall and thin before his chair,<lb/>
listened, but nothing could be discovered in his face<lb/>
except a kind and deferential attention.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Meantime, Antonia had risen, and, crossing the<lb/>
room, stood looking out of one of the three long windows<lb/>
giving on the street. Decoud followed her. The<lb/>
window was thrown open, and he leaned against the<lb/>
thickness of the wall. The long folds of the damask<lb/>
curtain, falling straight from the broad brass cornice,<lb/>
hid him partly from the room. He folded his arms on<lb/>
his breast, and looked steadily at Antonia's profile.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The people returning from the harbour filled the<lb/>
pavements; the shuffle of sandals and a low murmur of<lb/>
voices ascended to the window. Now and then a coach<lb/>
rolled slowly along the disjointed roadway of the Calle<lb/>
de la Constitucion. There were not many private<lb/>
carriages in Sulaco; at the most crowded hour on the<lb/>
Alameda they could be counted with one glance of the<lb/>
eye. The great family arks swayed on high leathern<lb/>
springs, full of pretty powdered faces in which the eyes<lb/>
looked intensely alive and black. And first Don Juste<lb/>
Lopez, the President of the Provincial Assembly,<lb/>
passed with his three lovely daughters, solemn in a<lb/>
black frock-coat and stiff white tie, as when directing a<lb/>
debate from a high tribune. Though they all raised<lb/>
their eyes, Antonia did not make the usual greeting<lb/>
gesture of a fluttered hand, and they affected not to see<lb/>
the two young people, Costaguaneros with European<lb/>


<pb n="179"/>

manners, whose eccentricities were discussed behind the<lb/>
barred windows of the first families in Sulaco. And<lb/>
then the widowed Se&ntilde;ora Gavilaso de Valdes rolled by,<lb/>
handsome and dignified, in a great machine in which<lb/>
she used to travel to and from her country house, surrounded<lb/>
by an armed retinue in leather suits and big<lb/>
sombreros, with carbines at the bows of their saddles.<lb/>
She was a woman of most distinguished family, proud,<lb/>
rich, and kind-hearted. Her second son, Jaime, had<lb/>
just gone off on the Staff of Barrios. The eldest, a<lb/>
worthless fellow of a moody disposition, filled Sulaco<lb/>
with the noise of his dissipations, and gambled heavily<lb/>
at the club. The two youngest boys, with yellow Ribierist<lb/>
cockades in their caps, sat on the front seat.<lb/>
She, too, affected not to see the Se&ntilde;or Decoud talking<lb/>
publicly with Antonia in defiance of every convention.<lb/>
And he not even her <hi rend="italic">novio</hi> as far as the world knew!<lb/>
Though, even in that case, it would have been scandal<lb/>
enough. But the dignified old lady, respected and<lb/>
admired by the first families, would have been still<lb/>
more shocked if she could have heard the words they<lb/>
were exchanging.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Did you say I lost sight of the aim? I have only<lb/>
one aim in the world."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She made an almost imperceptible negative movement<lb/>
of her head, still staring across the street at the<lb/>
Avellanos's house, grey, marked with decay, and with<lb/>
iron bars like a prison.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And it would be so easy of attainment," he continued,<lb/>
"this aim which, whether knowingly or not, I<lb/>
have always had in my heart &mdash; ever since the day when<lb/>
you snubbed me so horribly once in Paris, you remember."<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    A slight smile seemed to move the corner of the lip<lb/>
that was on his side.<lb/>


<pb n="180"/>

</p>

<p>     "You know you were a very terrible person, a sort of<lb/>
Charlotte Corday in a schoolgirl's dress; a ferocious<lb/>
patriot. I suppose you would have stuck a knife into<lb/>
Guzman Bento?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She interrupted him. "You do me too much<lb/>
honour."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "At any rate," he said, changing suddenly to a tone of<lb/>
bitter levity, "you would have sent me to stab him<lb/>
without compunction."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, <hi rend="italic">par exemple!"</hi> she murmured in a shocked tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well," he argued, mockingly, "you do keep me here<lb/>
writing deadly nonsense. Deadly to me! It has already<lb/>
killed my self-respect. And you may imagine,"<lb/>
he continued, his tone passing into light banter, "that<lb/>
Montero, should he be successful, would get even with<lb/>
me in the only way such a brute can get even with a<lb/>
man of intelligence who condescends to call him a <hi rend="italic">gran'<lb/>
bestia</hi> three times a week. It's a sort of intellectual<lb/>
death; but there is the other one in the background for<lb/>
a journalist of my ability."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "If he is successful!" said Antonia, thoughtfully.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You seem satisfied to see my life hang on a thread,"<lb/>
Decoud replied, with a broad smile. "And the other<lb/>
Montero, the 'my trusted brother' of the proclamations,<lb/>
the guerrillero &mdash; haven't I written that he was taking<lb/>
the guests' overcoats and changing plates in Paris at<lb/>
our Legation in the intervals of spying on our refugees<lb/>
there, in the time of Rojas? He will wash out that<lb/>
sacred truth in blood. In my blood! Why do you<lb/>
look annoyed? This is simply a bit of the biography of<lb/>
one of our great men. What do you think he will do to<lb/>
me? There is a certain convent wall round the corner<lb/>
of the Plaza, opposite the door of the Bull Ring. You<lb/>
know? Opposite the door with the inscription, Intrada<lb/>
de la Sombra.' Appropriate, perhaps! That's where<lb/>


<pb n="181"/>

the uncle of our host gave up his Anglo-South-American<lb/>
soul. And, note, he might have run away. A man<lb/>
who has fought with weapons may run away. You<lb/>
might have let me go with Barrios if you had cared for<lb/>
me. I would have carried one of those rifles, in which<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute; believes, with the greatest satisfaction, in the<lb/>
ranks of poor peons and Indios, that know nothing<lb/>
either of reason or politics. The most forlorn hope in<lb/>
the most forlorn army on earth would have been safer<lb/>
than that for which you made me stay here. When you<lb/>
make war you may retreat, but not when you spend<lb/>
your time in inciting poor ignorant fools to kill and to<lb/>
die."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His tone remained light, and as if unaware of his<lb/>
presence she stood motionless, her hands clasped<lb/>
lightly, the fan hanging down from her interlaced<lb/>
fingers. He waited for a while, and then &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I shall go to the wall," he said, with a sort of jocular<lb/>
desperation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Even that declaration did not make her look at him.<lb/>
Her head remained still, her eyes fixed upon the house<lb/>
of the Avellanos, whose chipped pilasters, broken<lb/>
cornices, the whole degradation of dignity was hidden<lb/>
now by the gathering dusk of the street. In her whole<lb/>
figure her lips alone moved, forming the words &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Martin, you will make me cry."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He remained silent for a minute, startled, as if overwhelmed<lb/>
by a sort of awed happiness, with the lines of<lb/>
the mocking smile still stiffened about his mouth, and<lb/>
incredulous surprise in his eyes. The value of a sentence<lb/>
is in the personality which utters it, for nothing<lb/>
new can be said by man or woman; and those were the<lb/>
last words, it seemed to him, that could ever have been<lb/>
spoken by Antonia. He had never made it up with<lb/>
her so completely in all their intercourse of small encounters;<lb/>


<pb n="182"/>

but even before she had time to turn towards<lb/>
him, which she did slowly with a rigid grace, he had<lb/>
begun to plead &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "My sister is only waiting to embrace you. My<lb/>
father is transported with joy. I won't say anything<lb/>
of my mother! Our mothers were like sisters. There<lb/>
is the mail-boat for the south next week &mdash; let us go.<lb/>
That Moraga is a fool! A man like Montero is<lb/>
bribed. It's the practice of the country. It's tradition<lb/>
&mdash; it's politics. Read 'Fifty Years of Misrule.'"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Leave poor papa alone, Don Martin. He believes<lb/>
&mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I have the greatest tenderness for your father,"<lb/>
he began, hurriedly. "But I love you, Antonia! And<lb/>
Moraga has miserably mismanaged this business. Perhaps<lb/>
your father did, too; I don't know. Montero was<lb/>
bribeable. Why, I suppose he only wanted his share of<lb/>
this famous loan for national development. Why<lb/>
didn't the stupid Sta. Marta people give him a mission<lb/>
to Europe, or something? He would have taken five<lb/>
years' salary in advance, and gone on loafing in Paris,<lb/>
this stupid, ferocious Indio!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The man," she said, thoughtfully, and very calm<lb/>
before this outburst, "was intoxicated with vanity.<lb/>
We had all the information, not from Moraga only;<lb/>
from others, too. There was his brother intriguing,<lb/>
too."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Oh, yes!" he said. "Of course you know. You<lb/>
know everything. You read all the correspondence,<lb/>
you write all the papers &mdash; all those State papers<lb/>
that are inspired here, in this room, in blind deference<lb/>
to a theory of political purity. Hadn't you Charles<lb/>
Gould before your eyes? Rey de Sulaco! He and<lb/>
his mine are the practical demonstration of what<lb/>
could have been done. Do you think he succeeded<lb/>


<pb n="183"/>

by his fidelity to a theory of virtue? And all those<lb/>
railway people, with their honest work! Of course,<lb/>
their work is honest! But what if you cannot work<lb/>
honestly till the thieves are satisfied? Could he not,<lb/>
a gentleman, have told this Sir John what's-his-name<lb/>
that Montero had to be bought off &mdash; he and all his<lb/>
Negro Liberals hanging on to his gold-laced sleeve?<lb/>
He ought to have been bought off with his own stupid<lb/>
weight of gold &mdash; his weight of gold, I tell you, boots,<lb/>
sabre, spurs, cocked hat, and all."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She shook her head slightly. "It was impossible,"<lb/>
she murmured.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He wanted the whole lot? What?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She was facing him now in the deep recess of the<lb/>
window, very close and motionless. Her lips moved<lb/>
rapidly. Decoud, leaning his back against the wall,<lb/>
listened with crossed arms and lowered eyelids. He<lb/>
drank the tones of her even voice, and watched the<lb/>
agitated life of her throat, as if waves of emotion had<lb/>
run from her heart to pass out into the air in her<lb/>
reasonable words. He also had his aspirations, he<lb/>
aspired to carry her away out of these deadly futilities<lb/>
of pronunciamientos and reforms. All this was wrong<lb/>
 &mdash; utterly wrong; but she fascinated him, and sometimes<lb/>
the sheer sagacity of a phrase would break the<lb/>
charm, replace the fascination by a sudden unwilling<lb/>
thrill of interest. Some women hovered, as it were, on<lb/>
the threshold of genius, he reflected. They did not<lb/>
want to know, or think, or understand. Passion stood<lb/>
for all that, and he was ready to believe that some startlingly<lb/>
profound remark, some appreciation of character,<lb/>
or a judgment upon an event, bordered on the miraculous.<lb/>
In the mature Antonia he could see with an<lb/>
extraordinary vividness the austere schoolgirl of the<lb/>
earlier days. She seduced his attention; sometimes he<lb/>


<pb n="184"/>

could not restrain a murmur of assent; now and then he<lb/>
advanced an objection quite seriously. Gradually they<lb/>
began to argue; the curtain half hid them from the<lb/>
people in the sala.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Outside it had grown dark. From the deep trench of<lb/>
shadow between the houses, lit up vaguely by the<lb/>
glimmer of street lamps, ascended the evening silence<lb/>
of Sulaco; the silence of a town with few carriages, of<lb/>
unshod horses, and a softly sandalled population. The<lb/>
windows of the Casa Gould flung their shining parallelograms<lb/>
upon the house of the Avellanos. Now and then<lb/>
a shuffle of feet passed below with the pulsating red<lb/>
glow of a cigarette at the foot of the walls; and the<lb/>
night air, as if cooled by the snows of Higuerota, refreshed<lb/>
their faces.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "We Occidentals," said Martin Decoud, using the<lb/>
usual term the provincials of Sulaco applied to themselves,<lb/>
"have been always distinct and separated. As<lb/>
long as we hold Cayta nothing can reach us. In all our<lb/>
troubles no army has marched over those mountains.<lb/>
A revolution in the central provinces isolates us at once.<lb/>
Look how complete it is now! The news of Barrios'<lb/>
movement will be cabled to the United States, and only<lb/>
in that way will it reach Sta. Marta by the cable from<lb/>
the other seaboard. We have the greatest riches, the<lb/>
greatest fertility, the purest blood in our great families,<lb/>
the most laborious population. The Occidental<lb/>
Province should stand alone. The early Federalism<lb/>
was not bad for us. Then came this union which<lb/>
Don Henrique Gould resisted. It opened the road to<lb/>
tyranny; and, ever since, the rest of Costaguana hangs<lb/>
like a millstone round our necks. The Occidental<lb/>
territory is large enough to make any man's country.<lb/>
Look at the mountains! Nature itself seems to cry<lb/>
to us, 'Separate!'"<lb/>


<pb n="185"/>

</p>

<p>     She made an energetic gesture of negation. A<lb/>
silence fell.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Oh, yes, I know it's contrary to the doctrine laid<lb/>
down in the 'History of Fifty Years' Misrule.' I am<lb/>
only trying to be sensible. But my sense seems always<lb/>
to give you cause for offence. Have I startled you very<lb/>
much with this perfectly reasonable aspiration?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She shook her head. No, she was not startled, but<lb/>
the idea shocked her early convictions. Her patriotism<lb/>
was larger. She had never considered that possibility.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It may yet be the means of saving some of your convictions,"<lb/>
he said, prophetically.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She did not answer. She seemed tired. They<lb/>
leaned side by side on the rail of the little balcony, very<lb/>
friendly, having exhausted politics, giving themselves<lb/>
up to the silent feeling of their nearness, in one of those<lb/>
profound pauses that fall upon the rhythm of passion.<lb/>
Towards the plaza end of the street the glowing coals<lb/>
in the brazeros of the market women cooking their<lb/>
evening meal gleamed red along the edge of the pavement.<lb/>
A man appeared without a sound in the light<lb/>
of a street lamp, showing the coloured inverted triangle<lb/>
of his bordered poncho, square on his shoulders, hanging<lb/>
to a point below his knees. From the harbour end<lb/>
of the Calle a horseman walked his soft-stepping mount,<lb/>
gleaming silver-grey abreast each lamp under the dark<lb/>
shape of the rider.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Behold the illustrious Capataz de Cargadores,"<lb/>
said Decoud, gently, "coming in all his splendour after<lb/>
his work is done. The next great man of Sulaco after<lb/>
Don Carlos Gould. But he is good-natured, and let<lb/>
me make friends with him."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, indeed!" said Antonia. "How did you make<lb/>
friends?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A journalist ought to have his finger on the popular<lb/>


<pb n="186"/>

pulse, and this man is one of the leaders of the populace.<lb/>
A journalist ought to know remarkable men &mdash; and this<lb/>
man is remarkable in his way."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, yes!" said Antonia, thoughtfully. "It is<lb/>
known that this Italian has a great influence."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The horseman had passed below them, with a gleam<lb/>
of dim light on the shining broad quarters of the grey<lb/>
mare, on a bright heavy stirrup, on a long silver spur;<lb/>
but the short flick of yellowish flame in the dusk was<lb/>
powerless against the muffled-up mysteriousness of the<lb/>
dark figure with an invisible face concealed by a great<lb/>
sombrero.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud and Antonia remained leaning over the<lb/>
balcony, side by side, touching elbows, with their heads<lb/>
overhanging the darkness of the street, and the brilliantly<lb/>
lighted sala at their backs. This was a <hi rend="italic">t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</hi><lb/>
of extreme impropriety; something of which in the<lb/>
whole extent of the Republic only the extraordinary<lb/>
Antonia could be capable &mdash; the poor, motherless girl,<lb/>
never accompanied, with a careless father, who had<lb/>
thought only of making her learned. Even Decoud<lb/>
himself seemed to feel that this was as much as he could<lb/>
expect of having her to himself till &mdash; till the revolution<lb/>
was over and he could carry her off to Europe, away<lb/>
from the endlessness of civil strife, whose folly seemed<lb/>
even harder to bear than its ignominy. After one<lb/>
Montero there would be another, the lawlessness of a<lb/>
populace of all colours and races, barbarism, irremediable<lb/>
tyranny. As the great Liberator Bolivar had<lb/>
said in the bitterness of his spirit, "America is ungovernable.<lb/>
Those who worked for her independence<lb/>
have ploughed the sea." He did not care, he declared<lb/>
boldly; he seized every opportunity to tell her that<lb/>
though she had managed to make a Blanco journalist<lb/>
of him, he was no patriot. First of all, the word had<lb/>


<pb n="187"/>

no sense for cultured minds, to whom the narrowness of<lb/>
every belief is odious; and secondly, in connection with<lb/>
the everlasting troubles of this unhappy country it was<lb/>
hopelessly besmirched; it had been the cry of dark<lb/>
barbarism, the cloak of lawlessness, of crimes, of rapacity,<lb/>
of simple thieving.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He was surprised at the warmth of his own utterance.<lb/>
He had no need to drop his voice; it had been low all<lb/>
the time, a mere murmur in the silence of dark houses<lb/>
with their shutters closed early against the night air,<lb/>
as is the custom of Sulaco. Only the sala of the Casa<lb/>
Gould flung out defiantly the blaze of its four windows,<lb/>
the bright appeal of light in the whole dumb obscurity<lb/>
of the street. And the murmur on the little balcony<lb/>
went on after a short pause.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But we are labouring to change all that," Antonia<lb/>
protested. "It is exactly what we desire. It is our<lb/>
object. It is the great cause. And the word you<lb/>
despise has stood also for sacrifice, for courage, for<lb/>
constancy, for suffering. Papa, who &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ploughing the sea," interrupted Decoud, looking<lb/>
down.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There was below the sound of hasty and ponderous<lb/>
footsteps.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Your uncle, the grand-vicar of the cathedral, has<lb/>
just turned under the gate," observed Decoud. "He<lb/>
said Mass for the troops in the Plaza this morning.<lb/>
They had built for him an altar of drums, you know.<lb/>
And they brought outside all the painted blocks to take<lb/>
the air. All the wooden saints stood militarily in a row<lb/>
at the top of the great flight of steps. They looked<lb/>
like a gorgeous escort attending the Vicar-General. I<lb/>
saw the great function from the windows of the <hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi>.<lb/>
He is amazing, your uncle, the last of the<lb/>
Corbel&agrave;ns. He glittered exceedingly in his vestments<lb/>


<pb n="188"/>

with a great crimson velvet cross down his back. And<lb/>
all the time our saviour Barrios sat in the Amarilla<lb/>
Club drinking punch at an open window. <hi rend="italic">Esprit fort</hi> &mdash;<lb/>
our Barrios. I expected every moment your uncle to<lb/>
launch an excommunication there and then at the black<lb/>
eye-patch in the window across the Plaza. But not<lb/>
at all. Ultimately the troops marched off. Later<lb/>
Barrios came down with some of the officers, and stood<lb/>
with his uniform all unbuttoned, discoursing at the<lb/>
edge of the pavement. Suddenly your uncle appeared,<lb/>
no longer glittering, but all black, at the cathedral door<lb/>
with that threatening aspect he has &mdash; you know, like a<lb/>
sort of avenging spirit. He gives one look, strides over<lb/>
straight at the group of uniforms, and leads away the<lb/>
general by the elbow. He walked him for a quarter of<lb/>
an hour in the shade of a wall. Never let go his elbow<lb/>
for a moment, talking all the time with exaltation, and<lb/>
gesticulating with a long black arm. It was a curious<lb/>
scene. The officers seemed struck with astonishment.<lb/>
Remarkable man, your missionary uncle. He hates an<lb/>
infidel much less than a heretic, and prefers a heathen<lb/>
many times to an infidel. He condescends graciously<lb/>
to call me a heathen, sometimes, you know."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Antonia listened with her hands over the balustrade,<lb/>
opening and shutting the fan gently; and Decoud talked<lb/>
a little nervously, as if afraid that she would leave him<lb/>
at the first pause. Their comparative isolation, the<lb/>
precious sense of intimacy, the slight contact of their<lb/>
arms, affected him softly; for now and then a tender<lb/>
inflection crept into the flow of his ironic murmurs.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Any slight sign of favour from a relative of yours is<lb/>
welcome, Antonia. And perhaps he understands me,<lb/>
after all! But I know him, too, our Padre Corbel&agrave;n.<lb/>
The idea of political honour, justice, and honesty for<lb/>
him consists in the restitution of the confiscated Church<lb/>


<pb n="189"/>

property. Nothing else could have drawn that fierce<lb/>
converter of savage Indians out of the wilds to work for<lb/>
the Ribierist cause! Nothing else but that wild hope!<lb/>
He would make a pronunciamiento himself for such an<lb/>
object against any Government if he could only get<lb/>
followers! What does Don Carlos Gould think of<lb/>
that? But, of course, with his English impenetrability,<lb/>
nobody can tell what he thinks. Probably he thinks of<lb/>
nothing apart from his mine; of his 'Imperium in<lb/>
Imperio.' As to Mrs. Gould, she thinks of her schools, of<lb/>
her hospitals, of the mothers with the young babies, of<lb/>
every sick old man in the three villages. If you were to<lb/>
turn your head now you would see her extracting a report<lb/>
from that sinister doctor in a check shirt &mdash; what's<lb/>
his name? Monygham &mdash; or else catechising Don P&eacute;p&eacute;<lb/>
or perhaps listening to Padre Rom&agrave;n. They are all<lb/>
down here to-day &mdash; all her ministers of state. Well,<lb/>
she is a sensible woman, and perhaps Don Carlos is a<lb/>
sensible man. It's a part of solid English sense not to<lb/>
think too much; to see only what may be of practical<lb/>
use at the moment. These people are not like ourselves.<lb/>
We have no political reason; we have political passions<lb/>
&mdash; sometimes. What is a conviction? A particular view<lb/>
of our personal advantage either practical or emotional.<lb/>
No one is a patriot for nothing. The word serves us<lb/>
well. But I am clear-sighted, and I shall not use that<lb/>
word to you, Antonia! I have no patriotic illusions. I<lb/>
have only the supreme illusion of a lover."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He paused, then muttered almost inaudibly, "That<lb/>
can lead one very far, though."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Behind their backs the political tide that once in<lb/>
every twenty-four hours set with a strong flood through<lb/>
the Gould drawing-room could be heard, rising higher<lb/>
in a hum of voices. Men had been dropping in singly,<lb/>
or in twos and threes: the higher officials of the province,<lb/>


<pb n="190"/>

engineers of the railway, sunburnt and in tweeds, with<lb/>
the frosted head of their chief smiling with slow, humorous<lb/>
indulgence amongst the young eager faces. Scarfe,<lb/>
the lover of fandangos, had already slipped out in search<lb/>
of some dance, no matter where, on the outskirts of the<lb/>
town. Don Juste Lopez, after taking his daughters<lb/>
home, had entered solemnly, in a black creased coat<lb/>
buttoned up under his spreading brown beard. The<lb/>
few members of the Provincial Assembly present<lb/>
clustered at once around their President to discuss the<lb/>
news of the war and the last proclamation of the rebel<lb/>
Montero, the miserable Montero, calling in the name of<lb/>
"a justly incensed democracy" upon all the Provincial<lb/>
Assemblies of the Republic to suspend their sittings till<lb/>
his sword had made peace and the will of the people<lb/>
could be consulted. It was practically an invitation to<lb/>
dissolve: an unheard-of audacity of that evil madman.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The indignation ran high in the knot of deputies behind<lb/>
Jos&eacute; Avellanos. Don Jos&eacute;, lifting up his voice,<lb/>
cried out to them over the high back of his chair,<lb/>
"Sulaco has answered by sending to-day an army upon<lb/>
his flank. If all the other provinces show only half as<lb/>
much patriotism as we Occidentals &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A great outburst of acclamations covered the vibrating<lb/>
treble of the life and soul of the party. Yes! Yes!<lb/>
This was true! A great truth! Sulaco was in the forefront,<lb/>
as ever! It was a boastful tumult, the hopefulness<lb/>
inspired by the event of the day breaking out<lb/>
amongst those caballeros of the Campo thinking of their<lb/>
herds, of their lands, of the safety of their families.<lb/>
Everything was at stake. . . . No! It was impossible<lb/>
that Montero should succeed! This criminal,<lb/>
this shameless Indio! The clamour continued for some<lb/>
time, everybody else in the room looking towards the<lb/>
group where Don Juste had put on his air of impartial<lb/>


<pb n="191"/>

solemnity as if presiding at a sitting of the Provincial<lb/>
Assembly. Decoud had turned round at the noise,<lb/>
and, leaning his back on the balustrade, shouted into<lb/>
the room with all the strength of his lungs, <hi rend="italic">"Gran'<lb/>
bestia!"</hi><lb/>
</p>

<p>     This unexpected cry had the effect of stilling the<lb/>
noise. All the eyes were directed to the window with<lb/>
an approving expectation; but Decoud had already<lb/>
turned his back upon the room, and was again leaning<lb/>
out over the quiet street.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "This is the quintessence of my journalism; that is<lb/>
the supreme argument," he said to Antonia. "I have<lb/>
invented this definition, this last word on a great<lb/>
question. But I am no patriot. I am no more of a<lb/>
patriot than the Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores, this<lb/>
Genoese who has done such great things for this harbour<lb/>
&mdash; this active usher-in of the material implements for our<lb/>
progress. You have heard Captain Mitchell confess<lb/>
over and over again that till he got this man he could<lb/>
never tell how long it would take to unload a ship.<lb/>
That is bad for progress. You have seen him pass by<lb/>
after his labours on his famous horse to dazzle the girls<lb/>
in some ballroom with an earthen floor. He is a<lb/>
fortunate fellow! His work is an exercise of personal<lb/>
powers; his leisure is spent in receiving the marks of<lb/>
extraordinary adulation. And he likes it, too. Can<lb/>
anybody be more fortunate? To be feared and admired<lb/>
is &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And are these your highest aspirations, Don<lb/>
Martin?" interrupted Antonia.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I was speaking of a man of that sort," said Decoud,<lb/>
curtly. "The heroes of the world have been feared and<lb/>
admired. What more could he want?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud had often felt his familiar habit of ironic<lb/>
thought fall shattered against Antonia's gravity. She<lb/>


<pb n="192"/>

irritated him as if she, too, had suffered from that inexplicable<lb/>
feminine obtuseness which stands so often<lb/>
between a man and a woman of the more ordinary sort.<lb/>
But he overcame his vexation at once. He was very<lb/>
far from thinking Antonia ordinary, whatever verdict<lb/>
his scepticism might have pronounced upon himself.<lb/>
With a touch of penetrating tenderness in his voice he<lb/>
assured her that his only aspiration was to a felicity so<lb/>
high that it seemed almost unrealizable on this earth.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She coloured invisibly, with a warmth against which<lb/>
the breeze from the sierra seemed to have lost its cooling<lb/>
power in the sudden melting of the snows. His whisper<lb/>
could not have carried so far, though there was enough<lb/>
ardour in his tone to melt a heart of ice. Antonia<lb/>
turned away abruptly, as if to carry his whispered<lb/>
assurance into the room behind, full of light, noisy with<lb/>
voices.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The tide of political speculation was beating high<lb/>
within the four walls of the great sala, as if driven<lb/>
beyond the marks by a great gust of hope. Don Juste's<lb/>
fan-shaped beard was still the centre of loud and<lb/>
animated discussions. There was a self-confident ring<lb/>
in all the voices. Even the few Europeans around<lb/>
Charles Gould &mdash; a Dane, a couple of Frenchmen, a discreet<lb/>
fat German, smiling, with down-cast eyes, the<lb/>
representatives of those material interests that had got<lb/>
a footing in Sulaco under the protecting might of the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mine &mdash; had infused a lot of good humour into<lb/>
their deference. Charles Gould, to whom they were<lb/>
paying their court, was the visible sign of the stability<lb/>
that could be achieved on the shifting ground of revolutions.<lb/>
They felt hopeful about their various undertakings.<lb/>
One of the two Frenchmen, small, black, with<lb/>
glittering eyes lost in an immense growth of bushy<lb/>
beard, waved his tiny brown hands and delicate wrists.<lb/>


<pb n="193"/>

He had been travelling in the interior of the province<lb/>
for a syndicate of European capitalists. His forcible<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"Monsieur l' Administrateur"</hi> returning every minute<lb/>
shrilled above the steady hum of conversations. He<lb/>
was relating his discoveries. He was ecstatic. Charles<lb/>
Gould glanced down at him courteously.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     At a given moment of these necessary receptions it<lb/>
was Mrs. Gould's habit to withdraw quietly into a<lb/>
little drawing-room, especially her own, next to the<lb/>
great sala. She had risen, and, waiting for Antonia,<lb/>
listened with a slightly worried graciousness to the<lb/>
engineer-in-chief of the railway, who stooped over her,<lb/>
relating slowly, without the slightest gesture, something<lb/>
apparently amusing, for his eyes had a humorous<lb/>
twinkle. Antonia, before she advanced into the room<lb/>
to join Mrs. Gould, turned her head over her shoulder<lb/>
towards Decoud, only for a moment.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Why should any one of us think his aspirations<lb/>
unrealizable?" she said, rapidly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am going to cling to mine to the end, Antonia,"<lb/>
he answered, through clenched teeth, then bowed very<lb/>
low, a little distantly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The engineer-in-chief had not finished telling his<lb/>
amusing story. The humours of railway building in<lb/>
South America appealed to his keen appreciation of the<lb/>
absurd, and he told his instances of ignorant prejudice<lb/>
and as ignorant cunning very well. Now, Mrs. Gould<lb/>
gave him all her attention as he walked by her side<lb/>
escorting the ladies out of the room. Finally all three<lb/>
passed unnoticed through the glass doors in the gallery.<lb/>
Only a tall priest stalking silently in the noise of the sala<lb/>
checked himself to look after them. Father Corbel&agrave;n,<lb/>
whom Decoud had seen from the balcony turning into<lb/>
the gateway of the Casa Gould, had addressed no one<lb/>
since coming in. The long, skimpy soutane accentuated<lb/>


<pb n="194"/>

the tallness of his stature; he carried his powerful<lb/>
torso thrown forward; and the straight, black bar of<lb/>
his joined eyebrows, the pugnacious outline of the bony<lb/>
face, the white spot of a scar on the bluish shaven<lb/>
cheeks (a testimonial to his apostolic zeal from a party<lb/>
of unconverted Indians), suggested something unlawful<lb/>
behind his priesthood, the idea of a chaplain of bandits.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He separated his bony, knotted hands clasped behind<lb/>
his back, to shake his finger at Martin.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud had stepped into the room after Antonia.<lb/>
But he did not go far. He had remained just within,<lb/>
against the curtain, with an expression of not quite<lb/>
genuine gravity, like a grown-up person taking part in a<lb/>
game of children. He gazed quietly at the threatening<lb/>
finger.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I have watched your reverence converting General<lb/>
Barrios by a special sermon on the Plaza," he said, without<lb/>
making the slightest movement.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What miserable nonsense!" Father Corbel&agrave;n's<lb/>
deep voice resounded all over the room, making all the<lb/>
heads turn on the shoulders. "The man is a drunkard.<lb/>
Se&ntilde;ores, the God of your General is a bottle!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His contemptuous, arbitrary voice caused an uneasy<lb/>
suspension of every sound, as if the self-confidence of<lb/>
the gathering had been staggered by a blow. But<lb/>
nobody took up Father Corbel&agrave;n's declaration.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was known that Father Corbel&agrave;n had come out of<lb/>
the wilds to advocate the sacred rights of the Church<lb/>
with the same fanatical fearlessness with which he had<lb/>
gone preaching to bloodthirsty savages, devoid of human<lb/>
compassion or worship of any kind. Rumours of<lb/>
legendary proportions told of his successes as a missionary<lb/>
beyond the eye of Christian men. He had baptized<lb/>
whole nations of Indians, living with them like a savage<lb/>
himself. It was related that the padre used to ride with<lb/>


<pb n="195"/>

his Indians for days, half naked, carrying a bullock-hide<lb/>
shield, and, no doubt, a long lance, too &mdash; who knows?<lb/>
That he had wandered clothed in skins, seeking for<lb/>
proselytes somewhere near the snow line of the Cordillera.<lb/>
Of these exploits Padre Corbel&agrave;n himself was<lb/>
never known to talk. But he made no secret of his<lb/>
opinion that the politicians of Sta. Marta had harder<lb/>
hearts and more corrupt minds than the heathen to<lb/>
whom he had carried the word of God. His injudicious<lb/>
zeal for the temporal welfare of the Church was damaging<lb/>
the Ribierist cause. It was common knowledge<lb/>
that he had refused to be made titular bishop of the<lb/>
Occidental diocese till justice was done to a despoiled<lb/>
Church. The political G&eacute;f&eacute; of Sulaco (the same<lb/>
dignitary whom Captain Mitchell saved from the<lb/>
mob afterwards) hinted with na&iacute;ve cynicism that<lb/>
doubtless their Excellencies the Ministers sent the padre<lb/>
over the mountains to Sulaco in the worst season of the<lb/>
year in the hope that he would be frozen to death by<lb/>
the icy blasts of the high paramos. Every year a few<lb/>
hardy muleteers &mdash; men inured to exposure &mdash; were known<lb/>
to perish in that way. But what would you have?<lb/>
Their Excellencies possibly had not realized what a<lb/>
tough priest he was. Meantime, the ignorant were<lb/>
beginning to murmur that the Ribierist reforms meant<lb/>
simply the taking away of the land from the people.<lb/>
Some of it was to be given to foreigners who made the<lb/>
railway; the greater part was to go to the padres.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     These were the results of the Grand Vicar's zeal.<lb/>
Even from the short allocution to the troops on the<lb/>
Plaza (which only the first ranks could have heard) he<lb/>
had not been able to keep out his fixed idea of an<lb/>
outraged Church waiting for reparation from a penitent<lb/>
country. The political G&eacute;f&eacute; had been exasperated.<lb/>
But he could not very well throw the brother-in-law<lb/>


<pb n="196"/>

of Don Jos&eacute; into the prison of the Cabildo. The chief<lb/>
magistrate, an easy-going and popular official, visited<lb/>
the Casa Gould, walking over after sunset from the<lb/>
Intendencia, unattended, acknowledging with dignified<lb/>
courtesy the salutations of high and low alike. That<lb/>
evening he had walked up straight to Charles Gould<lb/>
and had hissed out to him that he would have liked to<lb/>
deport the Grand Vicar out of Sulaco, anywhere, to<lb/>
some desert island, to the Isabels, for instance. "The<lb/>
one without water preferably &mdash; eh, Don Carlos?" he had<lb/>
added in a tone between jest and earnest. This uncontrollable<lb/>
priest, who had rejected his offer of the<lb/>
episcopal palace for a residence and preferred to hang<lb/>
his shabby hammock amongst the rubble and spiders<lb/>
of the sequestrated Dominican Convent, had taken into<lb/>
his head to advocate an unconditional pardon for Hernandez<lb/>
the Robber! And this was not enough; he<lb/>
seemed to have entered into communication with the<lb/>
most audacious criminal the country had known for<lb/>
years. The Sulaco police knew, of course, what was<lb/>
going on. Padre Corbel&agrave;n had got hold of that reckless<lb/>
Italian, the Capataz de Cargadores, the only man fit<lb/>
for such an errand, and had sent a message through him.<lb/>
Father Corbel&agrave;n had studied in Rome, and could<lb/>
speak Italian. The Capataz was known to visit the<lb/>
old Dominican Convent at night. An old woman who<lb/>
served the Grand Vicar had heard the name of Hernandez<lb/>
pronounced; and only last Saturday afternoon<lb/>
the Capataz had been observed galloping out of town.<lb/>
He did not return for two days. The police would have<lb/>
laid the Italian by the heels if it had not been for fear of<lb/>
the Cargadores, a turbulent body of men, quite apt to<lb/>
raise a tumult. Nowadays it was not so easy to govern<lb/>
Sulaco. Bad characters flocked into it, attracted by the<lb/>
money in the pockets of the railway workmen. The<lb/>


<pb n="197"/>

populace was made restless by Father Corbel&agrave;n's discourses.<lb/>
And the first magistrate explained to Charles<lb/>
Gould that now the province was stripped of troops any<lb/>
outbreak of lawlessness would find the authorities with<lb/>
their boots off, as it were.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Then he went away moodily to sit in an armchair,<lb/>
smoking a long, thin cigar, not very far from Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute;, with whom, bending over sideways, he exchanged<lb/>
a few words from time to time. He ignored the entrance<lb/>
of the priest, and whenever Father Corbel&agrave;n's<lb/>
voice was raised behind him, he shrugged his shoulders<lb/>
impatiently.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Father Corbel&agrave;n had remained quite motionless for a<lb/>
time with that something vengeful in his immobility<lb/>
which seemed to characterize all his attitudes. A lurid<lb/>
glow of strong convictions gave its peculiar aspect to the<lb/>
black figure. But its fierceness became softened as the<lb/>
padre, fixing his eyes upon Decoud, raised his long,<lb/>
black arm slowly, impressively &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And you &mdash; you are a perfect heathen," he said, in a<lb/>
subdued, deep voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He made a step nearer, pointing a forefinger at the<lb/>
young man's breast. Decoud, very calm, felt the wall<lb/>
behind the curtain with the back of his head. Then,<lb/>
with his chin tilted well up, he smiled.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Very well," he agreed with the slightly weary nonchalance<lb/>
of a man well used to these passages. "But<lb/>
is it perhaps that you have not discovered yet what is<lb/>
the God of my worship? It was an easier task with our<lb/>
Barrios."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The priest suppressed a gesture of discouragement.<lb/>
"You believe neither in stick nor stone," he said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Nor bottle," added Decoud without stirring.<lb/>
"Neither does the other of your reverence's confidants.<lb/>
I mean the Capataz of the Cargadores. He does not<lb/>


<pb n="198"/>

drink. Your reading of my character does honour to<lb/>
your perspicacity. But why call me a heathen?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "True," retorted the priest. "You are ten times<lb/>
worse. A miracle could not convert you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I certainly do not believe in miracles," said Decoud,<lb/>
quietly. Father Corbel&agrave;n shrugged his high, broad<lb/>
shoulders doubtfully.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A sort of Frenchman &mdash; godless &mdash; a materialist,"<lb/>
he pronounced slowly, as if weighing the terms of a<lb/>
careful analysis. "Neither the son of his own country<lb/>
nor of any other," he continued, thoughtfully.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Scarcely human, in fact," Decoud commented under<lb/>
his breath, his head at rest against the wall, his eyes<lb/>
gazing up at the ceiling.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The victim of this faithless age," Father Corbel&agrave;n<lb/>
resumed in a deep but subdued voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But of some use as a journalist." Decoud changed<lb/>
his pose and spoke in a more animated tone. "Has<lb/>
your worship neglected to read the last number of the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Porvenir?</hi> I assure you it is just like the others. On<lb/>
the general policy it continues to call Montero a <hi rend="italic">gran'<lb/>
bestia</hi>, and stigmatize his brother, the guerrillero, for a<lb/>
combination of lackey and spy. What could be more<lb/>
effective? In local affairs it urges the Provincial<lb/>
Government to enlist bodily into the national army the<lb/>
band of Hernandez the Robber &mdash; who is apparently<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">prot&eacute;g&eacute;</hi> of the Church &mdash; or at least of the Grand<lb/>
Vicar. Nothing could be more sound."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The priest nodded and turned on the heels of his<lb/>
square-toed shoes with big steel buckles. Again, with<lb/>
his hands clasped behind his back, he paced to and fro,<lb/>
planting his feet firmly. When he swung about, the<lb/>
skirt of his soutane was inflated slightly by the brusqueness<lb/>
of his movements.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The great sala had been emptying itself slowly.<lb/>


<pb n="199"/>

When the G&eacute;f&eacute; Pol&iacute;tico rose to go, most of those still<lb/>
remaining stood up suddenly in sign of respect, and Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute; Avellanos stopped the rocking of his chair. But<lb/>
the good-natured First Official made a deprecatory gesture,<lb/>
waved his hand to Charles Gould, and went out<lb/>
discreetly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the comparative peace of the room the screaming<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"Monsieur l'Administrateur"</hi> of the frail, hairy Frenchman<lb/>
seemed to acquire a preternatural shrillness. The<lb/>
explorer of the Capitalist syndicate was still enthusiastic.<lb/>
"Ten million dollars' worth of copper practically in<lb/>
sight, <hi rend="italic">Monsieur l'Administrateur</hi>. Ten millions in sight!<lb/>
And a railway coming &mdash; a railway! They will never<lb/>
believe my report. <hi rend="italic">C'est trop beau</hi>." He fell a prey to<lb/>
a screaming ecstasy, in the midst of sagely nodding<lb/>
heads, before Charles Gould's imperturbable calm.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And only the priest continued his pacing, flinging<lb/>
round the skirt of his soutane at each end of his beat.<lb/>
Decoud murmured to him ironically: "Those gentlemen<lb/>
talk about their gods."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Father Corbel&agrave;n stopped short, looked at the journalist<lb/>
of Sulaco fixedly for a moment, shrugged his<lb/>
shoulders slightly, and resumed his plodding walk of an<lb/>
obstinate traveller.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And now the Europeans were dropping off from the<lb/>
group around Charles Gould till the Administrador of<lb/>
the Great Silver Mine could be seen in his whole lank<lb/>
length, from head to foot, left stranded by the ebbing<lb/>
tide of his guests on the great square of carpet, as it<lb/>
were a multi-coloured shoal of flowers and arabesques<lb/>
under his brown boots. Father Corbel&agrave;n approached<lb/>
the rocking-chair of Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Come, brother," he said, with kindly brusqueness<lb/>
and a touch of relieved impatience a man may feel at the<lb/>
end of a perfectly useless ceremony. <hi rend="italic">"A la Casa! A</hi><lb/>


<pb n="200"/>

<hi rend="italic">la Casa!</hi> This has been all talk. Let us now go and<lb/>
think and pray for guidance from Heaven."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He rolled his black eyes upwards. By the side of the<lb/>
frail diplomatist &mdash; the life and soul of the party &mdash; he<lb/>
seemed gigantic, with a gleam of fanaticism in the<lb/>
glance. But the voice of the party, or, rather, its<lb/>
mouthpiece, the "son Decoud" from Paris, turned<lb/>
journalist for the sake of Antonia's eyes, knew very well<lb/>
that it was not so, that he was only a strenuous priest<lb/>
with one idea, feared by the women and execrated by<lb/>
the men of the people. Martin Decoud, the dilettante<lb/>
in life, imagined himself to derive an artistic pleasure<lb/>
from watching the picturesque extreme of wrong-<lb/>
headedness into which an honest, almost sacred, conviction<lb/>
may drive a man. "It is like madness. It<lb/>
must be &mdash; because it's self-destructive," Decoud had<lb/>
said to himself often. It seemed to him that every<lb/>
conviction, as soon as it became effective, turned into<lb/>
that form of dementia the gods send upon those they<lb/>
wish to destroy. But he enjoyed the bitter flavour of<lb/>
that example with the zest of a connoisseur in the art<lb/>
of his choice. Those two men got on well together, as<lb/>
if each had felt respectively that a masterful conviction,<lb/>
as well as utter scepticism, may lead a man<lb/>
very far on the by-paths of political action.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don Jos&eacute; obeyed the touch of the big hairy hand.<lb/>
Decoud followed out the brothers-in-law. And there<lb/>
remained only one visitor in the vast empty sala,<lb/>
bluishly hazy with tobacco smoke, a heavy-eyed, round-<lb/>
cheeked man, with a drooping moustache, a hide merchant<lb/>
from Esmeralda, who had come overland to<lb/>
Sulaco, riding with a few peons across the coast range.<lb/>
He was very full of his journey, undertaken mostly for<lb/>
the purpose of seeing the Senor Administrador of San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; in relation to some assistance he required in his<lb/>


<pb n="201"/>

hide-exporting business. He hoped to enlarge it greatly<lb/>
now that the country was going to be settled. It was<lb/>
going to be settled, he repeated several times, degrading<lb/>
by a strange, anxious whine the sonority of the<lb/>
Spanish language, which he pattered rapidly, like some<lb/>
sort of cringing jargon. A plain man could carry on his<lb/>
little business now in the country, and even think of<lb/>
enlarging it &mdash; with safety. Was it not so? He seemed<lb/>
to beg Charles Gould for a confirmatory word, a grunt<lb/>
of assent, a simple nod even.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He could get nothing. His alarm increased, and in<lb/>
the pauses he would dart his eyes here and there; then,<lb/>
loth to give up, he would branch off into feeling allusion<lb/>
to the dangers of his journey. The audacious Hernandez,<lb/>
leaving his usual haunts, had crossed the<lb/>
Campo of Sulaco, and was known to be lurking in the<lb/>
ravines of the coast range. Yesterday, when distant<lb/>
only a few hours from Sulaco, the hide merchant and his<lb/>
servants had seen three men on the road arrested suspiciously,<lb/>
with their horses' heads together. Two of<lb/>
these rode off at once and disappeared in a shallow<lb/>
quebrada to the left. "We stopped," continued the<lb/>
man from Esmeralda, "and I tried to hide behind a<lb/>
small bush. But none of my mozos would go forward<lb/>
to find out what it meant, and the third horseman<lb/>
seemed to be waiting for us to come up. It was no use.<lb/>
We had been seen. So we rode slowly on, trembling.<lb/>
He let us pass &mdash; a man on a grey horse with his hat down<lb/>
on his eyes &mdash; without a word of greeting; but by-and-by<lb/>
we heard him galloping after us. We faced about, but<lb/>
that did not seem to intimidate him. He rode up at<lb/>
speed, and touching my foot with the toe of his boot,<lb/>
asked me for a cigar, with a blood-curdling laugh. He<lb/>
did not seem armed, but when he put his hand back to<lb/>
reach for the matches I saw an enormous revolver<lb/>


<pb n="202"/>

strapped to his waist. I shuddered. He had very<lb/>
fierce whiskers, Don Carlos, and as he did not offer to go<lb/>
on we dared not move. At last, blowing the smoke<lb/>
of my cigar into the air through his nostrils, he said,<lb/>
'Se&ntilde;or, it would be perhaps better for you if I rode behind<lb/>
your party. You are not very far from Sulaco<lb/>
now. Go you with God.' What would you? We<lb/>
went on. There was no resisting him. He might have<lb/>
been Hernandez himself; though my servant, who has<lb/>
been many times to Sulaco by sea, assured me that he<lb/>
had recognized him very well for the Capataz of the<lb/>
Steamship Company's Cargadores. Later, that same<lb/>
evening, I saw that very man at the corner of the Plaza<lb/>
talking to a girl, a Morenita, who stood by the stirrup<lb/>
with her hand on the grey horse's mane."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I assure you, Se&ntilde;or Hirsch," murmured Charles<lb/>
Gould, "that you ran no risk on this occasion."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That may be, se&ntilde;or, though I tremble yet. A most<lb/>
fierce man &mdash; to look at. And what does it mean? A<lb/>
person employed by the Steamship Company talking<lb/>
with salteadores &mdash; no less, se&ntilde;or; the other horsemen<lb/>
were salteadores &mdash; in a lonely place, and behaving like<lb/>
a robber himself! A cigar is nothing, but what was<lb/>
there to prevent him asking me for my purse?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, no, Se&ntilde;or Hirsch," Charles Gould murmured,<lb/>
letting his glance stray away a little vacantly from the<lb/>
round face, with its hooked beak upturned towards him<lb/>
in an almost childlike appeal. "If it was the Capataz<lb/>
de Cargadores you met &mdash; and there is no doubt, is there?<lb/>
&mdash; you were perfectly safe."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Thank you. You are very good. A very fierce-<lb/>
looking man, Don Carlos. He asked me for a cigar in a<lb/>
most familiar manner. What would have happened if<lb/>
I had not had a cigar? I shudder yet. What business<lb/>
had he to be talking with robbers in a lonely place?"<lb/>


<pb n="203"/>

</p>

<p>     But Charles Gould, openly preoccupied now, gave<lb/>
not a sign, made no sound. The impenetrability of the<lb/>
embodied Gould Concession had its surface shades. To<lb/>
be dumb is merely a fatal affliction; but the King of<lb/>
Sulaco had words enough to give him all the mysterious<lb/>
weight of a taciturn force. His silences, backed by<lb/>
the power of speech, had as many shades of significance<lb/>
as uttered words in the way of assent, of doubt, of<lb/>
negation &mdash; even of simple comment. Some seemed to<lb/>
say plainly, "Think it over"; others meant clearly,<lb/>
"Go ahead"; a simple, low "I see," with an affirmative<lb/>
nod, at the end of a patient listening half-hour was the<lb/>
equivalent of a verbal contract, which men had learned<lb/>
to trust implicitly, since behind it all there was the<lb/>
great San Tom&eacute; mine, the head and front of the material<lb/>
interests, so strong that it depended on no man's goodwill<lb/>
in the whole length and breadth of the Occidental<lb/>
Province &mdash; that is, on no goodwill which it could not buy<lb/>
ten times over. But to the little hook-nosed man from<lb/>
Esmeralda, anxious about the export of hides, the<lb/>
silence of Charles Gould portended a failure. Evidently<lb/>
this was no time for extending a modest man's<lb/>
business. He enveloped in a swift mental malediction<lb/>
the whole country, with all its inhabitants, partisans of<lb/>
Ribiera and Montero alike; and there were incipient<lb/>
tears in his mute anger at the thought of the innumerable<lb/>
ox-hides going to waste upon the dreamy<lb/>
expanse of the Campo, with its single palms rising like<lb/>
ships at sea within the perfect circle of the horizon, its<lb/>
clumps of heavy timber motionless like solid islands of<lb/>
leaves above the running waves of grass. There were<lb/>
hides there, rotting, with no profit to anybody &mdash; rotting<lb/>
where they had been dropped by men called away to<lb/>
attend the urgent necessities of political revolutions.<lb/>
The practical, mercantile soul of Se&ntilde;or Hirsch rebelled<lb/>


<pb n="204"/>

against all that foolishness, while he was taking a<lb/>
respectful but disconcerted leave of the might and<lb/>
majesty of the San Tom&eacute; mine in the person of Charles<lb/>
Gould. He could not restrain a heart-broken murmur,<lb/>
wrung out of his very aching heart, as it were.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is a great, great foolishness, Don Carlos, all this.<lb/>
The price of hides in Hamburg is gone up &mdash; up. Of<lb/>
course the Ribierist Government will do away with all<lb/>
that &mdash; when it gets established firmly. Meantime &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He sighed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes, meantime," repeated Charles Gould, inscrutably.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    The other shrugged his shoulders. But he was not<lb/>
ready to go yet. There was a little matter he would like<lb/>
to mention very much if permitted. It appeared he had<lb/>
some good friends in Hamburg (he murmured the name<lb/>
of the firm) who were very anxious to do business, in<lb/>
dynamite, he explained. A contract for dynamite with<lb/>
the San Tom&eacute; mine, and then, perhaps, later on, other<lb/>
mines, which were sure to &mdash; The little man from<lb/>
Esmeralda was ready to enlarge, but Charles interrupted<lb/>
him. It seemed as though the patience of the<lb/>
Senor Administrador was giving way at last.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Se&ntilde;or Hirsch," he said, "I have enough dynamite<lb/>
stored up at the mountain to send it down crashing into<lb/>
the valley" &mdash; his voice rose a little &mdash; "to send half<lb/>
Sulaco into the air if I liked."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould smiled at the round, startled eyes of<lb/>
the dealer in hides, who was murmuring hastily, "Just<lb/>
so. Just so." And now he was going. It was impossible<lb/>
to do business in explosives with an Administrador<lb/>
so well provided and so discouraging. He had<lb/>
suffered agonies in the saddle and had exposed himself<lb/>
to the atrocities of the bandit Hernandez for nothing<lb/>
at all. Neither hides nor dynamite &mdash; and the very<lb/>


<pb n="205"/>

shoulders of the enterprising Israelite expressed dejection.<lb/>
At the door he bowed low to the engineer-in-<lb/>
chief. But at the bottom of the stairs in the patio he<lb/>
stopped short, with his podgy hand over his lips in an<lb/>
attitude of meditative astonishment.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What does he want to keep so much dynamite for?"<lb/>
he muttered. "And why does he talk like this to me?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The engineer-in-chief, looking in at the door of the<lb/>
empty sala, whence the political tide had ebbed out to<lb/>
the last insignificant drop, nodded familiarly to the<lb/>
master of the house, standing motionless like a tall<lb/>
beacon amongst the deserted shoals of furniture.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Good-night, I am going. Got my bike downstairs.<lb/>
The railway will know where to go for dynamite should<lb/>
we get short at any time. We have done cutting and<lb/>
chopping for a while now. We shall begin soon to blast<lb/>
our way through."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Don't come to me," said Charles Gould, with perfect<lb/>
serenity. "I shan't have an ounce to spare for<lb/>
anybody. Not an ounce. Not for my own brother, if<lb/>
I had a brother, and he were the engineer-in-chief of<lb/>
the most promising railway in the world."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What's that?" asked the engineer-in-chief, with<lb/>
equanimity. "Unkindness?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No," said Charles Gould, stolidly. "Policy."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Radical, I should think," the engineer-in-chief observed<lb/>
from the doorway.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Is that the right name?" Charles Gould said, from<lb/>
the middle of the room.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I mean, going to the roots, you know," the engineer<lb/>
explained, with an air of enjoyment.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Why, yes," Charles pronounced, slowly. "The<lb/>
Gould Concession has struck such deep roots in this<lb/>
country, in this province, in that gorge of the mountains,<lb/>
that nothing but dynamite shall be allowed to<lb/>


<pb n="206"/>

dislodge it from there. It's my choice. It's my last<lb/>
card to play."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The engineer-in-chief whistled low. "A pretty<lb/>
game," he said, with a shade of discretion. "And have<lb/>
you told Holroyd of that extraordinary trump card you<lb/>
hold in your hand?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Card only when it's played; when it falls at the end<lb/>
of the game. Till then you may call it a &mdash; a &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Weapon," suggested the railway man.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No. You may call it rather an argument," corrected<lb/>
Charles Gould, gently. "And that's how I've<lb/>
presented it to Mr. Holroyd."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And what did he say to it?" asked the engineer, with<lb/>
undisguised interest.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He" &mdash; Charles Gould spoke after a slight pause &mdash;<lb/>
"he said something about holding on like grim death<lb/>
and putting our trust in God.   I should imagine he<lb/>
must have been rather startled. But then" &mdash; pursued<lb/>
the Administrador of the San Tom&eacute; mine &mdash; "but then,<lb/>
he is very far away, you know, and, as they say in this<lb/>
country, God is very high above."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The engineer's appreciative laugh died away down<lb/>
the stairs, where the Madonna with the Child on her<lb/>
arm seemed to look after his shaking broad back from<lb/>
her shallow niche.<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="207"/>


<p>     A PROFOUND stillness reigned in the Casa Gould.<lb/>
The master of the house, walking along the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>,<lb/>
opened the door of his room, and saw his wife sitting in<lb/>
a big armchair &mdash; his own smoking armchair &mdash; thoughtful,<lb/>
contemplating her little shoes. And she did not<lb/>
raise her eyes when he walked in.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Tired?" asked Charles Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A little," said Mrs. Gould. Still without looking<lb/>
up, she added with feeling, "There is an awful sense of<lb/>
unreality about all this."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould, before the long table strewn with<lb/>
papers, on which lay a hunting crop and a pair of spurs,<lb/>
stood looking at his wife: "The heat and dust must<lb/>
have been awful this afternoon by the waterside," he<lb/>
murmured, sympathetically. "The glare on the water<lb/>
must have been simply terrible."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "One could close one's eyes to the glare," said Mrs.<lb/>
Gould. "But, my dear Charley, it is impossible for me<lb/>
to close my eyes to our position; to this awful . . ."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She raised her eyes and looked at her husband's face,<lb/>
from which all sign of sympathy or any other feeling<lb/>
had disappeared. "Why don't you tell me something?<lb/>
" she almost wailed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I thought you had understood me perfectly from<lb/>
the first," Charles Gould said, slowly. "I thought we<lb/>
had said all there was to say a long time ago. There<lb/>
is nothing to say now. There were things to be done.<lb/>
We have done them; we have gone on doing them.<lb/>
There is no going back now. I don't suppose that, even<lb/>




<pb n="208"/>

from the first, there was really any possible way back.<lb/>
And, what's more, we can't even afford to stand still."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, if one only knew how far you mean to go," said<lb/>
his wife. inwardly trembling, but in an almost playful<lb/>
tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Any distance, any length, of course," was the<lb/>
answer, in a matter-of-fact tone, which caused Mrs.<lb/>
Gould to make another effort to repress a shudder.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She stood up, smiling graciously, and her little figure<lb/>
seemed to be diminished still more by the heavy mass of<lb/>
her hair and the long train of her gown.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But always to success," she said, persuasively.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould, enveloping her in the steely blue<lb/>
glance of his attentive eyes, answered without hesitation<lb/>
&mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Oh, there is no alternative."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He put an immense assurance into his tone. As to<lb/>
the words, this was all that his conscience would allow<lb/>
him to say.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould's smile remained a shade too long upon<lb/>
her lips. She murmured &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I will leave you; I've a slight headache. The heat,<lb/>
the dust, were indeed &mdash; I suppose you are going<lb/>
back to the mine before the morning?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "At midnight," said Charles Gould. "We are bringing<lb/>
down the silver to-morrow. Then I shall take three<lb/>
whole days off in town with you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, you are going to meet the escort. I shall be on<lb/>
the balcony at five o'clock to see you pass. Till then,<lb/>
good-bye."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould walked rapidly round the table, and,<lb/>
seizing her hands, bent down, pressing them both to his<lb/>
lips. Before he straightened himself up again to his full<lb/>
height she had disengaged one to smooth his cheek with<lb/>
a light touch, as if he were a little boy.<lb/>


<pb n="209"/>

</p>

<p>     "Try to get some rest for a couple of hours," she murmured,<lb/>
with a glance at a hammock stretched in a<lb/>
distant part of the room. Her long train swished<lb/>
softly after her on the red tiles. At the door she<lb/>
looked back.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Two big lamps with unpolished glass globes bathed in<lb/>
a soft and abundant light the four white walls of the<lb/>
room, with a glass case of arms, the brass hilt of Henry<lb/>
Gould's cavalry sabre on its square of velvet, and the<lb/>
water-colour sketch of the San Tom&eacute; gorge. And Mrs.<lb/>
Gould, gazing at the last in its black wooden frame,<lb/>
sighed out &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, if we had left it alone, Charley!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No," Charles Gould said, moodily; "it was impossible<lb/>
to leave it alone."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Perhaps it was impossible," Mrs. Gould admitted,<lb/>
slowly. Her lips quivered a little, but she smiled with<lb/>
an air of dainty bravado. "We have disturbed a good<lb/>
many snakes in that Paradise, Charley, haven't we?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes, I remember," said Charles Gould, "it was<lb/>
Don P&eacute;p&eacute; who called the gorge the Paradise of snakes.<lb/>
No doubt we have disturbed a great many. But remember,<lb/>
my dear, that it is not now as it was when you<lb/>
made that sketch." He waved his hand towards the<lb/>
small water-colour hanging alone upon the great bare<lb/>
wall. "It is no longer a Paradise of snakes. We have<lb/>
brought mankind into it, and we cannot turn our backs<lb/>
upon them to go and begin a new life elsewhere."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He confronted his wife with a firm, concentrated gaze,<lb/>
which Mrs. Gould returned with a brave assumption of<lb/>
fearlessness before she went out, closing the door gently<lb/>
after her.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In contrast with the white glaring room the dimly<lb/>
lit <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi> had a restful mysteriousness of a forest<lb/>
glade, suggested by the stems and the leaves of the<lb/>


<pb n="210"/>

plants ranged along the balustrade of the open side. In<lb/>
the streaks of light falling through the open doors of the<lb/>
reception-rooms, the blossoms, white and red and pale<lb/>
lilac, came out vivid with the brilliance of flowers in a<lb/>
stream of sunshine; and Mrs. Gould, passing on, had the<lb/>
vividness of a figure seen in the clear patches of sun that<lb/>
chequer the gloom of open glades in the woods. The<lb/>
stones in the rings upon her hand pressed to her forehead<lb/>
glittered in the lamplight abreast of the door of the<lb/>
sala.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Who's there?" she asked, in a startled voice. "Is<lb/>
that you, Basilio?" She looked in, and saw Martin<lb/>
Decoud walking about, with an air of having lost something,<lb/>
amongst the chairs and tables.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Antonia has forgotten her fan in here," said Decoud,<lb/>
with a strange air of distraction; "so I entered<lb/>
to see."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But, even as he said this, he had obviously given up<lb/>
his search, and walked straight towards Mrs. Gould,<lb/>
who looked at him with doubtful surprise.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Se&ntilde;ora," he began, in a low voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What is it, Don Martin?" asked Mrs. Gould. And<lb/>
then she added, with a slight laugh, "I am so nervous<lb/>
to-day," as if to explain the eagerness of the question.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Nothing immediately dangerous," said Decoud,<lb/>
who now could not conceal his agitation. "Pray don't<lb/>
distress yourself. No, really, you must not distress<lb/>
yourself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould, with her candid eyes very wide open,<lb/>
her lips composed into a smile, was steadying herself<lb/>
with a little bejewelled hand against the side of the door.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Perhaps you don't know how alarming you are,<lb/>
appearing like this unexpectedly &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I! Alarming!" he protested, sincerely vexed and<lb/>
surprised. "I assure you that I am not in the least<lb/>


<pb n="211"/>

alarmed myself. A fan is lost; well, it will be found<lb/>
again. But I don't think it is here. It is a fan I<lb/>
am looking for. I cannot understand how Antonia<lb/>
could &mdash; Well! Have you found it, amigo?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, se&ntilde;or," said behind Mrs. Gould the soft voice<lb/>
of Basilio, the head servant of the Casa. "I don't<lb/>
think the se&ntilde;orita could have left it in this house at all."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Go and look for it in the patio again. Go now, my<lb/>
friend; look for it on the steps, under the gate; examine<lb/>
every flagstone; search for it till I come down<lb/>
again. . . . That fellow" &mdash; he addressed himself<lb/>
in English to Mrs. Gould &mdash; "is always stealing up behind<lb/>
one's back on his bare feet. I set him to look for<lb/>
that fan directly I came in to justify my reappearance,<lb/>
my sudden return."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He paused and Mrs. Gould said, amiably, "You are<lb/>
always welcome." She paused for a second, too. "But<lb/>
I am waiting to learn the cause of your return."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud affected suddenly the utmost nonchalance.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I can't bear to be spied upon. Oh, the cause?<lb/>
Yes, there is a cause; there is something else that is lost<lb/>
besides Antonia's favourite fan. As I was walking<lb/>
home after seeing Don Jos&eacute; and Antonia to their house,<lb/>
the Capataz de Cargadores, riding down the street,<lb/>
spoke to me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Has anything happened to the Violas?" inquired<lb/>
Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The Violas? You mean the old Garibaldino who<lb/>
keeps the hotel where the engineers live? Nothing<lb/>
happened there. The Capataz said nothing of them; he<lb/>
only told me that the telegraphist of the Cable Company<lb/>
was walking on the Plaza, bareheaded, looking out<lb/>
for me. There is news from the interior, Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
I should rather say rumours of news."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Good news?" said Mrs. Gould in a low voice.<lb/>


<pb n="212"/>

</p>

<p>     "Worthless, I should think. But if I must define<lb/>
them, I would say bad. They are to the effect that a<lb/>
two days' battle had been fought near Sta. Marta, and<lb/>
that the Ribierists are defeated. It must have happened<lb/>
a few days ago &mdash; perhaps a week. The rumour<lb/>
has just reached Cayta, and the man in charge of the<lb/>
cable station there has telegraphed the news to his<lb/>
colleague here. We might just as well have kept<lb/>
Barrios in Sulaco."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What's to be done now?" murmured Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Nothing. He's at sea with the troops. He will<lb/>
get to Cayta in a couple of days' time and learn the<lb/>
news there. What he will do then, who can say?<lb/>
Hold Cayta? Offer his submission to Montero? Disband<lb/>
his army &mdash; this last most likely, and go himself<lb/>
in one of the O.S.N. Company's steamers, north or<lb/>
south &mdash; to Valparaiso or to San Francisco, no matter<lb/>
where. Our Barrios has a great practice in exiles and<lb/>
repatriations, which mark the points in the political<lb/>
game."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud, exchanging a steady stare with Mrs. Gould,<lb/>
added, tentatively, as it were, "And yet, if we had<lb/>
Barrios with his 2,000 improved rifles here, something<lb/>
could have been done."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Montero victorious, completely victorious!" Mrs.<lb/>
Gould breathed out in a tone of unbelief.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A canard, probably. That sort of bird is hatched<lb/>
in great numbers in such times as these. And even if it<lb/>
were true? Well, let us put things at their worst, let<lb/>
us say it is true."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Then everything is lost," said Mrs. Gould, with the<lb/>
calmness of despair.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Suddenly she seemed to divine, she seemed to see<lb/>
Decoud's tremendous excitement under its cloak of<lb/>
studied carelessness. It was, indeed, becoming visible<lb/>


<pb n="213"/>

in his audacious and watchful stare, in the curve, half-<lb/>
reckless, half-contemptuous, of his lips. And a French<lb/>
phrase came upon them as if, for this Costaguanero of<lb/>
the Boulevard, that had been the only forcible language<lb/>
&mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Non, Madame. Rien n'est perdu</hi>."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It electrified Mrs. Gould out of her benumbed attitude,<lb/>
and she said, vivaciously &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What would you think of doing?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But already there was something of mockery in<lb/>
Decoud's suppressed excitement.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What would you expect a true Costaguanero to do?<lb/>
Another revolution, of course. On my word of honour,<lb/>
Mrs. Gould, I believe I am a true <hi rend="italic">hijo del pays</hi>, a true<lb/>
son of the country, whatever Father Corbel&agrave;n may say.<lb/>
And I'm not so much of an unbeliever as not to have<lb/>
faith in my own ideas, in my own remedies, in my own<lb/>
desires."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes," said Mrs. Gould, doubtfully.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You don't seem convinced," Decoud went on again<lb/>
in French. "Say, then, in my passions."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould received this addition unflinchingly. To<lb/>
understand it thoroughly she did not require to hear<lb/>
his muttered assurance &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "There is nothing I would not do for the sake of<lb/>
Antonia. There is nothing I am not prepared to undertake.<lb/>
There is no risk I am not ready to run."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud seemed to find a fresh audacity in this voicing<lb/>
of his thoughts. "You would not believe me if I were<lb/>
to say that it is the love of the country which &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She made a sort of discouraged protest with her arm,<lb/>
as if to express that she had given up expecting that<lb/>
motive from any one.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A Sulaco revolution," Decoud pursued in a forcible<lb/>
undertone. "The Great Cause may be served here,<lb/>


<pb n="214"/>

on the very spot of its inception, in the place of its<lb/>
birth, Mrs. Gould."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Frowning, and biting her lower lip thoughtfully, she<lb/>
made a step away from the door.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You are not going to speak to your husband?" Decoud<lb/>
arrested her anxiously.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But you will need his help?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No doubt," Decoud admitted without hesitation.<lb/>
"Everything turns upon the San Tom&eacute; mine, but I<lb/>
would rather he didn't know anything as yet of my &mdash;<lb/>
my hopes."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A puzzled look came upon Mrs. Gould's face, and<lb/>
Decoud, approaching, explained confidentially &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Don't you see, he's such an idealist."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould flushed pink, and her eyes grew darker<lb/>
at the same time.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Charley an idealist!" she said, as if to herself,<lb/>
wonderingly. "What on earth do you mean?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes," conceded Decoud, "it's a wonderful thing to<lb/>
say with the sight of the San Tom&eacute; mine, the greatest<lb/>
fact in the whole of South America, perhaps, before our<lb/>
very eyes. But look even at that, he has idealized this<lb/>
fact to a point &mdash;" He paused. "Mrs. Gould, are<lb/>
you aware to what point he has idealized the existence,<lb/>
the worth, the meaning of the San Tom&eacute; mine? Are<lb/>
you aware of it?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He must have known what he was talking about.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The effect he expected was produced. Mrs. Gould,<lb/>
ready to take fire, gave it up suddenly with a low little<lb/>
sound that resembled a moan.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What do you know?" she asked in a feeble voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Nothing," answered Decoud, firmly. "But, then,<lb/>
don't you see, he's an Englishman?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well, what of that?" asked Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Simply that he cannot act or exist without idealizing<lb/>


<pb n="215"/>

every simple feeling, desire, or achievement. He could<lb/>
not believe his own motives if he did not make them<lb/>
first a part of some fairy tale. The earth is not quite<lb/>
good enough for him, I fear. Do you excuse my frankness?<lb/>
Besides, whether you excuse it or not, it is part<lb/>
of the truth of things which hurts the &mdash; what do you call<lb/>
them? &mdash; the Anglo-Saxon's susceptibilities, and at the<lb/>
present moment I don't feel as if I could treat seriously<lb/>
either his conception of things or &mdash; if you allow me to<lb/>
say so &mdash; or yet yours."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould gave no sign of being offended. "I suppose<lb/>
Antonia understands you thoroughly?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Understands? Well, yes. But I am not sure that<lb/>
she approves. That, however, makes no difference. I<lb/>
am honest enough to tell you that, Mrs. Gould."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Your idea, of course, is separation," she said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Separation, of course," declared Martin. "Yes;<lb/>
separation of the whole Occidental Province from the<lb/>
rest of the unquiet body. But my true idea, the only<lb/>
one I care for, is not to be separated from Antonia."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And that is all?" asked Mrs. Gould, without<lb/>
severity.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Absolutely. I am not deceiving myself about my<lb/>
motives. She won't leave Sulaco for my sake, therefore<lb/>
Sulaco must leave the rest of the Republic to its<lb/>
fate. Nothing could be clearer than that. I like<lb/>
a clearly defined situation. I cannot part with Antonia,<lb/>
therefore the one and indivisible Republic of<lb/>
Costaguana must be made to part with its western<lb/>
province. Fortunately it happens to be also a sound<lb/>
policy. The richest, the most fertile part of this land<lb/>
may be saved from anarchy. Personally, I care little,<lb/>
very little; but it's a fact that the establishment of<lb/>
Montero in power would mean death to me. In all the<lb/>
proclamations of general pardon which I have seen,<lb/>


<pb n="216"/>

my name, with a few others, is specially excepted. The<lb/>
brothers hate me, as you know very well, Mrs. Gould;<lb/>
and behold, here is the rumour of them having won a<lb/>
battle. You say that supposing it is true, I have plenty<lb/>
of time to run away."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The slight, protesting murmur on the part of Mrs.<lb/>
Gould made him pause for a moment, while he looked<lb/>
at her with a sombre and resolute glance.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, but I would, Mrs. Gould. I would run away<lb/>
if it served that which at present is my only desire. I<lb/>
am courageous enough to say that, and to do it, too.<lb/>
But women, even our women, are idealists. It is<lb/>
Antonia that won't run away. A novel sort of vanity."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You call it vanity," said Mrs. Gould, in a shocked<lb/>
voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Say pride, then, which. Father Corbel&agrave;n would tell<lb/>
you, is a mortal sin. But I am not proud. I am simply<lb/>
too much in love to run away. At the same time I<lb/>
want to live. There is no love for a dead man. Therefore<lb/>
it is necessary that Sulaco should not recognize the<lb/>
victorious Montero."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And you think my husband will give you his support?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "I think he can be drawn into it, like all idealists,<lb/>
when he once sees a sentimental basis for his action.<lb/>
But I wouldn't talk to him. Mere clear facts won't<lb/>
appeal to his sentiment. It is much better for him to<lb/>
convince himself in his own way. And, frankly, I could<lb/>
not, perhaps, just now pay sufficient respect to either<lb/>
his motives or even, perhaps, to yours, Mrs. Gould."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was evident that Mrs. Gould was very determined<lb/>
not to be offended. She smiled vaguely, while she<lb/>
seemed to think the matter over. As far as she could<lb/>
judge from the girl's half-confidences, Antonia understood<lb/>
that young man. Obviously there was promise of<lb/>


<pb n="217"/>

safety in his plan, or rather in his idea. Moreover,<lb/>
right or wrong, the idea could do no harm. And it was<lb/>
quite possible, also, that the rumour was false.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have some sort of a plan," she said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Simplicity itself. Barrios has started, let him go<lb/>
on then; he will hold Cayta, which is the door of the sea<lb/>
route to Sulaco. They cannot send a sufficient force<lb/>
over the mountains. No; not even to cope with the<lb/>
band of Hernandez. Meantime we shall organize our<lb/>
resistance here. And for that, this very Hernandez<lb/>
will be useful. He has defeated troops as a bandit; he<lb/>
will no doubt accomplish the same thing if he is made a<lb/>
colonel or even a general. You know the country well<lb/>
enough not to be shocked by what I say, Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
I have heard you assert that this poor bandit was the<lb/>
living,breathing example of cruelty, injustice, stupidity,<lb/>
and oppression, that ruin men's souls as well as their<lb/>
fortunes in this country. Well, there would be some<lb/>
poetical retribution in that man arising to crush the evils<lb/>
which had driven an honest ranchero into a life of<lb/>
crime. A fine idea of retribution in that, isn't there?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud had dropped easily into English, which he<lb/>
spoke with precision, very correctly, but with too many<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">z</hi> sounds.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Think also of your hospitals, of your schools, of<lb/>
your ailing mothers and feeble old men, of all that<lb/>
population which you and your husband have brought<lb/>
into the rocky gorge of San Tom&eacute;. Are you not responsible<lb/>
to your conscience for all these people? Is it<lb/>
not worth while to make another effort, which is not at<lb/>
all so desperate as it looks, rather than &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud finished his thought with an upward toss of<lb/>
the arm, suggesting annihilation; and Mrs. Gould<lb/>
turned away her head with a look of horror.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Why don't you say all this to my husband?" she<lb/>


<pb n="218"/>

asked, without looking at Decoud, who stood watching<lb/>
the effect of his words.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! But Don Carlos is so English," he began.<lb/>
Mrs. Gould interrupted &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Leave that alone, Don Martin. He's as much a<lb/>
Costaguanero &mdash; No! He's more of a Costaguanero<lb/>
than yourself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Sentimentalist, sentimentalist," Decoud almost<lb/>
cooed, in a tone of gentle and soothing deference.<lb/>
"Sentimentalist, after the amazing manner of your<lb/>
people. I have been watching El Rey de Sulaco since<lb/>
I came here on a fool's errand, and perhaps impelled by<lb/>
some treason of fate lurking behind the unaccountable<lb/>
turns of a man's life. But I don't matter, I am not a<lb/>
sentimentalist, I cannot endow my personal desires<lb/>
with a shining robe of silk and jewels. Life is not for<lb/>
me a moral romance derived from the tradition of a<lb/>
pretty fairy tale. No, Mrs. Gould; I am practical. I<lb/>
am not afraid of my motives. But, pardon me, I have<lb/>
been rather carried away. What I wish to say is that I<lb/>
have been observing. I won't tell you what I have<lb/>
discovered &mdash; "<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No. That is unnecessary," whispered Mrs. Gould,<lb/>
once more averting her head.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is. Except one little fact, that your husband does<lb/>
not like me. It's a small matter, which, in the circumstances,<lb/>
seems to acquire a perfectly ridiculous importance.<lb/>
Ridiculous and immense; for, clearly, money<lb/>
is required for my plan," he reflected; then added,<lb/>
meaningly, "and we have two sentimentalists to deal<lb/>
with."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I don't know that I understand you, Don Martin,"<lb/>
said Mrs. Gould, coldly, preserving the low key of their<lb/>
conversation. "But, speaking as if I did, who is the<lb/>
other?"<lb/>


<pb n="219"/>

</p>

<p>     "The great Holroyd in San Francisco, of course,"<lb/>
Decoud whispered, lightly. "I think you understand<lb/>
me very well. Women are idealists; but then they are<lb/>
so perspicacious."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But whatever was the reason of that remark, disparaging<lb/>
and complimentary at the same time, Mrs.<lb/>
Gould seemed not to pay attention to it. The name of<lb/>
Holroyd had given a new tone to her anxiety.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The silver escort is coming down to the harbour tomorrow;<lb/>
a whole six months' working, Don Martin!"<lb/>
she cried in dismay.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Let it come down, then," breathed out Decoud,<lb/>
earnestly, almost into her ear.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But if the rumour should get about, and especially<lb/>
if it turned out true, troubles might break out in the<lb/>
town," objected Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud admitted that it was possible.  He knew<lb/>
well the town children of the Sulaco Campo: sullen,<lb/>
thievish, vindictive, and bloodthirsty, whatever great<lb/>
qualities their brothers of the plain might have had.<lb/>
But then there was that other sentimentalist, who<lb/>
attached a strangely idealistic meaning to concrete<lb/>
facts. This stream of silver must be kept flowing<lb/>
north to return in the form of financial backing from the<lb/>
great house of Holroyd. Up at the mountain in the<lb/>
strong room of the mine the silver bars were worth less<lb/>
for his purpose than so much lead, from which at least<lb/>
bullets may be run. Let it come down to the harbour,<lb/>
ready for shipment.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The next north-going steamer would carry it off for<lb/>
the very salvation of the San Tom&eacute; mine, which had<lb/>
produced so much treasure.  And, moreover, the<lb/>
rumour was probably false, he remarked, with much<lb/>
conviction in his hurried tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Besides, se&ntilde;ora," concluded Decoud, "we may<lb/>


<pb n="220"/>

suppress it for many days. I have been talking with<lb/>
the telegraphist in the middle of the Plaza Mayor; thus<lb/>
I am certain that we could not have been overheard.<lb/>
There was not even a bird in the air near us. And also<lb/>
let me tell you something more. I have been making<lb/>
friends with this man called Nostromo, the Capataz.<lb/>
We had a conversation this very evening, I walking by<lb/>
the side of his horse as he rode slowly out of the town<lb/>
just now. He promised me that if a riot took place for<lb/>
any reason &mdash; even for the most political of reasons, you<lb/>
understand &mdash; his Cargadores, an important part of the<lb/>
populace, you will admit, should be found on the side of<lb/>
the Europeans."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He has promised you that?" Mrs. Gould inquired,<lb/>
with interest. "What made him make that promise to<lb/>
you?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Upon my word, I don't know," declared Decoud, in<lb/>
a slightly surprised tone. "He certainly promised me<lb/>
that, but now you ask me why, I could not tell you<lb/>
his reasons. He talked with his usual carelessness,<lb/>
which, if he had been anything else but a common<lb/>
sailor, I would call a pose or an affectation."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud, interrupting himself, looked at Mrs. Gould<lb/>
curiously.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Upon the whole," he continued, "I suppose he<lb/>
expects something to his advantage from it. You<lb/>
mustn't forget that he does not exercise his extraordinary<lb/>
power over the lower classes without a certain<lb/>
amount of personal risk and without a great profusion<lb/>
in spending his money. One must pay in some way or<lb/>
other for such a solid thing as individual prestige. He<lb/>
told me after we made friends at a dance, in a Posada<lb/>
kept by a Mexican just outside the walls, that he had<lb/>
come here to make his fortune. I suppose he looks<lb/>
upon his prestige as a sort of investment."<lb/>


<pb n="221"/>

</p>

<p>     "Perhaps he prizes it for its own sake," Mrs. Gould<lb/>
said in a tone as if she were repelling an undeserved<lb/>
aspersion. "Viola, the Garibaldino, with whom he has<lb/>
lived for some years, calls him the Incorruptible."<lb/>
</p>

<p>
"Ah! he belongs to the group of your <hi rend="italic">prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</hi> out<lb/>
there towards the harbour, Mrs. Gould.   <hi rend="italic">Muy bien</hi>.<lb/>
And Captain Mitchell calls him wonderful. I have<lb/>
heard no end of tales of his strength, his audacity, his<lb/>
fidelity. No end of fine things. H'm! incorruptible!<lb/>
It is indeed a name of honour for the Capataz of the<lb/>
Cargadores of Sulaco. Incorruptible! Fine, but vague.<lb/>
However, I suppose he's sensible, too. And I talked to<lb/>
him upon that sane and practical assumption."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I prefer to think him disinterested, and therefore<lb/>
trustworthy," Mrs. Gould said, with the nearest approach<lb/>
to curtness it was in her nature to assume.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well, if so, then the silver will be still more safe.<lb/>
Let it come down, se&ntilde;ora. Let it come down, so that it<lb/>
may go north and return to us in the shape of credit."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould glanced along the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi> towards the<lb/>
door of her husband's room. Decoud, watching her as<lb/>
if she had his fate in her hands, detected an almost<lb/>
imperceptible nod of assent. He bowed with a smile,<lb/>
and, putting his hand into the breast pocket of his coat,<lb/>
pulled out a fan of light feathers set upon painted leaves<lb/>
of sandal-wood. "I had it in my pocket," he murmured,<lb/>
triumphantly, "for a plausible pretext." He<lb/>
bowed again. "Good-night, se&ntilde;ora."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould continued along the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi> away from<lb/>
her husband's room. The fate of the San Tom&eacute; mine<lb/>
was lying heavy upon her heart. It was a long time<lb/>
now since she had begun to fear it. It had been an<lb/>
idea. She had watched it with misgivings turning into<lb/>
a fetish, and now the fetish had grown into a monstrous<lb/>
and crushing weight. It was as if the inspiration of<lb/>


<pb n="222"/>

their early years had left her heart to turn into a wall of<lb/>
silver-bricks, erected by the silent work of evil spirits,<lb/>
between her and her husband. He seemed to dwell<lb/>
alone within a circumvallation of precious metal, leaving<lb/>
her outside with her school, her hospital, the sick<lb/>
mothers and the feeble old men, mere insignificant<lb/>
vestiges of the initial inspiration.  "Those poor people!"<lb/>
she murmured to herself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Below she heard the voice of Martin Decoud in the<lb/>

<p>     IT WAS part of what Decoud would have called his<lb/>
sane materialism that he did not believe in the possibility<lb/>
of friendship between man and woman.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The one exception he allowed confirmed, he maintained,<lb/>
that absolute rule. Friendship was possible<lb/>
between brother and sister, meaning by friendship the<lb/>
frank unreserve, as before another human being, of<lb/>
thoughts and sensations; all the objectless and necessary<lb/>
sincerity of one's innermost life trying to react<lb/>
upon the profound sympathies of another existence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His favourite sister, the handsome, slightly arbitrary<lb/>
and resolute angel, ruling the father and mother Decoud<lb/>
in the first-floor apartments of a very fine Parisian<lb/>
house, was the recipient of Martin Decoud's confidences<lb/>
as to his thoughts, actions, purposes, doubts,<lb/>
and even failures. . . .<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Prepare our little circle in Paris for the birth of<lb/>
another South American Republic. One more or less,<lb/>
what does it matter? They may come into the world<lb/>
like evil flowers on a hotbed of rotten institutions; but<lb/>
the seed of this one has germinated in your brother's<lb/>
brain, and that will be enough for your devoted assent.<lb/>
I am writing this to you by the light of a single<lb/>
candle, in a sort of inn, near the harbour, kept by an<lb/>
Italian called Viola, a <hi rend="italic">prot&eacute;g&eacute;</hi> of Mrs. Gould. The<lb/>
whole building, which, for all I know, may have been<lb/>
contrived by a Conquistador farmer of the pearl<lb/>
fishery three hundred years ago, is perfectly silent. So<lb/>
is the plain between the town and the harbour; silent,<lb/>




<pb n="224"/>

but not so dark as the house, because the pickets of<lb/>
Italian workmen guarding the railway have lighted little<lb/>
fires all along the line. It was not so quiet around here<lb/>
yesterday. We had an awful riot &mdash; a sudden outbreak<lb/>
of the populace, which was not suppressed till late to-<lb/>
day. Its object, no doubt, was loot, and that was defeated,<lb/>
as you may have learned already from the<lb/>
cablegram sent via San Francisco and New York last<lb/>
night, when the cables were still open. You have read<lb/>
already there that the energetic action of the Europeans<lb/>
of the railway has saved the town from destruction, and<lb/>
you may believe that. I wrote out the cable myself.<lb/>
We have no Reuter's agency man here. I have also<lb/>
fired at the mob from the windows of the club, in company<lb/>
with some other young men of position. Our<lb/>
object was to keep the Calle de la Constitucion clear for<lb/>
the exodus of the ladies and children, who have taken<lb/>
refuge on board a couple of cargo ships now in the harbour<lb/>
here. That was yesterday. You should also<lb/>
have learned from the cable that the missing President,<lb/>
Ribiera, who had disappeared after the battle of Sta.<lb/>
Marta, has turned up here in Sulaco by one of those<lb/>
strange coincidences that are almost incredible, riding<lb/>
on a lame mule into the very midst of the street fighting.<lb/>
It appears that he had fled, in company of a<lb/>
muleteer called Bonifacio, across the mountains from<lb/>
the threats of Montero into the arms of an enraged<lb/>
mob.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The Capataz of Cargadores, that Italian sailor of<lb/>
whom I have written to you before, has saved him from<lb/>
an ignoble death. That man seems to have a particular<lb/>
talent for being on the spot whenever there is something<lb/>
picturesque to be done.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He was with me at four o'clock in the morning at the<lb/>
offices of the <hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi>, where he had turned up so early<lb/>


<pb n="225"/>

in order to warn me of the coming trouble, and also to<lb/>
assure me that he would keep his Cargadores on the<lb/>
side of order. When the full daylight came we were<lb/>
looking together at the crowd on foot and on horseback,<lb/>
demonstrating on the Plaza and shying stones at the<lb/>
windows of the Intendencia. Nostromo (that is the<lb/>
name they call him by here) was pointing out to me<lb/>
his Cargadores interspersed in the mob.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The sun shines late upon Sulaco, for it has first to<lb/>
climb above the mountains. In that clear morning<lb/>
light, brighter than twilight, Nostromo saw right across<lb/>
the vast Plaza, at the end of the street beyond the<lb/>
cathedral, a mounted man apparently in difficulties with<lb/>
a yelling knot of leperos. At once he said to me, 'That's<lb/>
a stranger. What is it they are doing to him?' Then<lb/>
he took out the silver whistle he is in the habit of using<lb/>
on the wharf (this man seems to disdain the use of any<lb/>
metal less precious than silver) and blew into it twice,<lb/>
evidently a preconcerted signal for his Cargadores. He<lb/>
ran out immediately, and they rallied round him. I<lb/>
ran out, too, but was too late to follow them and help<lb/>
in the rescue of the stranger, whose animal had fallen.<lb/>
I was set upon at once as a hated aristocrat, and was<lb/>
only too glad to get into the club, where Don Jaime<lb/>
Berges (you may remember him visiting at our house<lb/>
in Paris some three years ago) thrust a sporting gun into<lb/>
my hands. They were already firing from the windows.<lb/>
There were little heaps of cartridges lying about on the<lb/>
open card-tables. I remember a couple of overturned<lb/>
chairs, some bottles rolling on the floor amongst the<lb/>
packs of cards scattered suddenly as the caballeros<lb/>
rose from their game to open fire upon the mob. Most<lb/>
of the young men had spent the night at the club in the<lb/>
expectation of some such disturbance. In two of the<lb/>
candelabra, on the consoles, the candles were burning<lb/>


<pb n="226"/>

down in their sockets. A large iron nut, probably<lb/>
stolen from the railway workshops, flew in from the<lb/>
street as I entered, and broke one of the large mirrors<lb/>
set in the wall. I noticed also one of the club servants<lb/>
tied up hand and foot with the cords of the curtain and<lb/>
flung in a corner. I have a vague recollection of Don<lb/>
Jaime assuring me hastily that the fellow had been<lb/>
detected putting poison into the dishes at supper. But<lb/>
I remember distinctly he was shrieking for mercy, without<lb/>
stopping at all, continuously, and so absolutely<lb/>
disregarded that nobody even took the trouble to gag<lb/>
him. The noise he made was so disagreeable that I had<lb/>
half a mind to do it myself. But there was no time to<lb/>
waste on such trifles. I took my place at one of the<lb/>
windows and began firing.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I didn't learn till later in the afternoon whom it was<lb/>
that Nostromo, with his Cargadores and some Italian<lb/>
workmen as well, had managed to save from those<lb/>
drunken rascals. That man has a peculiar talent when<lb/>
anything striking to the imagination has to be done. I<lb/>
made that remark to him afterwards when we met after<lb/>
some sort of order had been restored in the town, and<lb/>
the answer he made rather surprised me. He said quite<lb/>
moodily, 'And how much do I get for that, se&ntilde;or?'<lb/>
Then it dawned upon me that perhaps this man's vanity<lb/>
has been satiated by the adulation of the common<lb/>
people and the confidence of his superiors!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud paused to light a cigarette, then, with his<lb/>
head still over his writing, he blew a cloud of smoke,<lb/>
which seemed to rebound from the paper. He took<lb/>
up the pencil again.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That was yesterday evening on the Plaza, while he<lb/>
sat on the steps of the cathedral, his hands between his<lb/>
knees, holding the bridle of his famous silver-grey mare.<lb/>
He had led his body of Cargadores splendidly all day<lb/>


<pb n="227"/>

long. He looked fatigued. I don't know how I<lb/>
looked. Very dirty, I suppose. But I suppose I also<lb/>
looked pleased. From the time the fugitive President<lb/>
had been got off to the S. S. <hi rend="italic">Minerva</hi>, the tide of success<lb/>
had turned against the mob. They had been driven off<lb/>
the harbour, and out of the better streets of the town, into<lb/>
their own maze of ruins and tolderias. You must understand<lb/>
that this riot, whose primary object was undoubtedly<lb/>
the getting hold of the San Tom&eacute; silver<lb/>
stored in the lower rooms of the Custom House (besides<lb/>
the general looting of the Ricos), had acquired a<lb/>
political colouring from the fact of two Deputies to the<lb/>
Provincial Assembly, Se&ntilde;ores Gamacho and Fuentes,<lb/>
both from Bolson, putting themselves at the head of<lb/>
it &mdash; late in the afternoon, it is true, when the mob, disappointed<lb/>
in their hopes of loot, made a stand in the<lb/>
narrow streets to the cries of 'Viva la Libertad! Down<lb/>
with Feudalism!' (I wonder what they imagine<lb/>
feudalism to be?) 'Down with the Goths and Paralytics.'<lb/>
I suppose the Se&ntilde;ores Gamacho and Fuentes<lb/>
knew what they were doing. They are prudent gentlemen.<lb/>
In the Assembly they called themselves Moderates,<lb/>
and opposed every energetic measure with philanthropic<lb/>
pensiveness. At the first rumours of Montero's<lb/>
victory, they showed a subtle change of the pensive<lb/>
temper, and began to defy poor Don Juste Lopez<lb/>
in his Presidential tribune with an effrontery to which<lb/>
the poor man could only respond by a dazed smoothing<lb/>
of his beard and the ringing of the presidential<lb/>
bell. Then, when the downfall of the Ribierist cause<lb/>
became confirmed beyond the shadow of a doubt,<lb/>
they have blossomed into convinced Liberals, acting<lb/>
together as if they were Siamese twins, and ultimately<lb/>
taking charge, as it were, of the riot in the name of<lb/>
Monterist principles.<lb/>


<pb n="228"/>

</p>

<p>     "Their last move of eight o'clock last night was to<lb/>
organize themselves into a Monterist Committee which<lb/>
sits, as far as I know, in a posada kept by a retired<lb/>
Mexican bull-fighter, a great politician, too, whose<lb/>
name I have forgotten. Thence they have issued a<lb/>
communication to us, the Goths and Paralytics of the<lb/>
Amarilla Club (who have our own committee), inviting<lb/>
us to come to some provisional understanding for a<lb/>
truce, in order, they have the impudence to say, that<lb/>
the noble cause of Liberty 'should not be stained by the<lb/>
criminal excesses of Conservative selfishness!' As I<lb/>
came out to sit with Nostromo on the cathedral steps<lb/>
the club was busy considering a proper reply in the<lb/>
principal room, littered with exploded cartridges, with<lb/>
a lot of broken glass, blood smears, candlesticks, and all<lb/>
sorts of wreckage on the floor. But all this is nonsense.<lb/>
Nobody in the town has any real power except<lb/>
the railway engineers, whose men occupy the dismantled<lb/>
houses acquired by the Company for their town station<lb/>
on one side of the Plaza, and Nostromo, whose Cargadores<lb/>
were sleeping under the arcades along the front of<lb/>
Anzani's shops. A fire of broken furniture out of the<lb/>
Intendencia saloons, mostly gilt, was burning on the<lb/>
Plaza, in a high flame swaying right upon the statue of<lb/>
Charles IV. The dead body of a man was lying on the<lb/>
steps of the pedestal, his arms thrown wide open, and<lb/>
his sombrero covering his face &mdash; the attention of some<lb/>
friend, perhaps. The light of the flames touched the<lb/>
foliage of the first trees on the Alameda, and played on<lb/>
the end of a side street near by, blocked up by a jumble<lb/>
of ox-carts and dead bullocks. Sitting on one of the<lb/>
carcasses, a lepero, muffled up, smoked a cigarette. It<lb/>
was a truce, you understand. The only other living<lb/>
being on the Plaza besides ourselves was a Cargador<lb/>
walking to and fro, with a long, bare knife in his hand,<lb/>


<pb n="229"/>

like a sentry before the Arcades, where his friends were<lb/>
sleeping. And the only other spot of light in the dark<lb/>
town were the lighted windows of the club, at the corner<lb/>
of the Calle."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     After having written so far, Don Martin Decoud, the<lb/>
exotic dandy of the Parisian boulevard, got up and<lb/>
walked across the sanded floor of the caf&eacute; at one end of<lb/>
the Albergo of United Italy, kept by Giorgio Viola, the<lb/>
old companion of Garibaldi. The highly coloured<lb/>
lithograph of the Faithful Hero seemed to look dimly,<lb/>
in the light of one candle, at the man with no faith in<lb/>
anything except the truth of his own sensations. Looking<lb/>
out of the window, Decoud was met by a darkness so<lb/>
impenetrable that he could see neither the mountains<lb/>
nor the town, nor yet the buildings near the harbour;<lb/>
and there was not a sound, as if the tremendous obscurity<lb/>
of the Placid Gulf, spreading from the waters<lb/>
over the land, had made it dumb as well as blind.<lb/>
Presently Decoud felt a light tremor of the floor and a<lb/>
distant clank of iron. A bright white light appeared,<lb/>
deep in the darkness, growing bigger with a thundering<lb/>
noise. The rolling stock usually kept on the sidings in<lb/>
Rincon was being run back to the yards for safe keeping.<lb/>
Like a mysterious stirring of the darkness behind the<lb/>
headlight of the engine, the train passed in a gust of<lb/>
hollow uproar, by the end of the house, which seemed to<lb/>
vibrate all over in response. And nothing was clearly<lb/>
visible but, on the end of the last flat car, a negro, in<lb/>
white trousers and naked to the waist, swinging a<lb/>
blazing torch basket incessantly with a circular movement<lb/>
of his bare arm. Decoud did not stir.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Behind him, on the back of the chair from which he<lb/>
had risen, hung his elegant Parisian overcoat, with a<lb/>
pearl-grey silk lining. But when he turned back to<lb/>
come to the table the candlelight fell upon a face that<lb/>


<pb n="230"/>

was grimy and scratched. His rosy lips were blackened<lb/>
with heat, the smoke of gun-powder. Dirt and rust<lb/>
tarnished the lustre of his short beard. His shirt collar<lb/>
and cuffs were crumpled; the blue silken tie hung down<lb/>
his breast like a rag; a greasy smudge crossed his white<lb/>
brow. He had not taken off his clothing nor used<lb/>
water, except to snatch a hasty drink greedily, for some<lb/>
forty hours. An awful restlessness had made him its<lb/>
own, had marked him with all the signs of desperate<lb/>
strife, and put a dry, sleepless stare into his eyes. He<lb/>
murmured to himself in a hoarse voice, "I wonder if<lb/>
there's any bread here," looked vaguely about him, then<lb/>
dropped into the chair and took the pencil up again.<lb/>
He became aware he had not eaten anything for many<lb/>
hours.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It occurred to him that no one could understand him<lb/>
so well as his sister. In the most sceptical heart there<lb/>
lurks at such moments, when the chances of existence<lb/>
are involved, a desire to leave a correct impression of<lb/>
the feelings, like a light by which the action may be<lb/>
seen when personality is gone, gone where no light of<lb/>
investigation can ever reach the truth which every<lb/>
death takes out of the world. Therefore, instead of<lb/>
looking for something to eat, or trying to snatch an hour<lb/>
or so of sleep, Decoud was filling the pages of a large<lb/>
pocket-book with a letter to his sister.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the intimacy of that intercourse he could not keep<lb/>
out his weariness, his great fatigue, the close touch of his<lb/>
bodily sensations. He began again as if he were talking<lb/>
to her. With almost an illusion of her presence, he<lb/>
wrote the phrase, "I am very hungry."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I have the feeling of a great solitude around me,"<lb/>
he continued. "Is it, perhaps, because I am the only<lb/>
man with a definite idea in his head, in the complete<lb/>
collapse of every resolve, intention, and hope about me?<lb/>


<pb n="231"/>

But the solitude is also very real. All the engineers are<lb/>
out, and have been for two days, looking after the<lb/>
property of the National Central Railway, of that<lb/>
great Costaguana undertaking which is to put money<lb/>
into the pockets of Englishmen, Frenchmen, Americans,<lb/>
Germans, and God knows who else. The silence about<lb/>
me is ominous. There is above the middle part of this<lb/>
house a sort of first floor, with narrow openings like<lb/>
loopholes for windows, probably used in old times for<lb/>
the better defence against the savages, when the persistent<lb/>
barbarism of our native continent did not wear the<lb/>
black coats of politicians, but went about yelling, half-<lb/>
naked, with bows and arrows in its hands. The woman<lb/>
of the house is dying up there, I believe, all alone with<lb/>
her old husband. There is a narrow staircase, the sort<lb/>
of staircase one man could easily defend against a mob,<lb/>
leading up there, and I have just heard, through the<lb/>
thickness of the wall, the old fellow going down into<lb/>
their kitchen for something or other. It was a sort of<lb/>
noise a mouse might make behind the plaster of a wall.<lb/>
All the servants they had ran away yesterday and have<lb/>
not returned yet, if ever they do. For the rest, there<lb/>
are only two children here, two girls. The father has<lb/>
sent them downstairs, and they have crept into this<lb/>
caf&eacute;, perhaps because I am here. They huddle together<lb/>
in a corner, in each other's arms; I just noticed them a<lb/>
few minutes ago, and I feel more lonely than ever."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud turned half round in his chair, and asked,<lb/>
"Is there any bread here?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda's dark head was shaken negatively in response,<lb/>
above the fair head of her sister nestling on her breast.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You couldn't get me some bread?" insisted Decoud.<lb/>
The child did not move; he saw her large eyes stare at<lb/>
him very dark from the corner. "You're not afraid<lb/>
of me?" he said.<lb/>


<pb n="232"/>

</p>

<p>     "No," said Linda, "we are not afraid of you. You<lb/>
came here with Gian' Battista."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You mean Nostromo?" said Decoud.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The English call him so, but that is no name either<lb/>
for man or beast," said the girl, passing her hand gently<lb/>
over her sister's hair.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But he lets people call him so," remarked Decoud.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Not in this house," retorted the child.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! well, I shall call him the Capataz then."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Decoud gave up the point, and after writing steadily<lb/>
for a while turned round again.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "When do you expect him back?" he asked.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "After he brought you here he rode off to fetch the<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or Doctor from the town for mother. He will be<lb/>
back soon."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He stands a good chance of getting shot somewhere<lb/>
on the road," Decoud murmured to himself audibly; and<lb/>
Linda declared in her high-pitched voice &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Nobody would dare to fire a shot at Gian' Battista."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You believe that," asked Decoud, "do you?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I know it," said the child, with conviction. "There<lb/>
is no one in this place brave enough to attack Gian'<lb/>
Battista."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It doesn't require much bravery to pull a trigger<lb/>
behind a bush," muttered Decoud to himself. "Fortunately,<lb/>
the night is dark, or there would be but little<lb/>
chance of saving the silver of the mine."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He turned again to his pocket-book, glanced back<lb/>
through the pages, and again started his pencil.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That was the position yesterday, after the <hi rend="italic">Minerva</hi><lb/>
with the fugitive President had gone out of harbour, and<lb/>
the rioters had been driven back into the side lanes of<lb/>
the town. I sat on the steps of the cathedral with<lb/>
Nostromo, after sending out the cable message for<lb/>
the information of a more or less attentive world.<lb/>


<pb n="233"/>

Strangely enough, though the offices of the Cable<lb/>
Company are in the same building as the <hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi>, the<lb/>
mob, which has thrown my presses out of the window<lb/>
and scattered the type all over the Plaza, has been kept<lb/>
from interfering with the instruments on the other side<lb/>
of the courtyard. As I sat talking with Nostromo,<lb/>
Bernhardt, the telegraphist, came out from under the<lb/>
Arcades with a piece of paper in his hand. The little<lb/>
man had tied himself up to an enormous sword and<lb/>
was hung all over with revolvers. He is ridiculous, but<lb/>
the bravest German of his size that ever tapped the<lb/>
key of a Morse transmitter. He had received the<lb/>
message from Cayta reporting the transports with<lb/>
Barrios's army just entering the port, and ending with<lb/>
the words, 'The greatest enthusiasm prevails.' I<lb/>
walked off to drink some water at the fountain, and I<lb/>
was shot at from the Alameda by somebody hiding<lb/>
behind a tree. But I drank, and didn't care; with<lb/>
Barrios in Cayta and the great Cordillera between us<lb/>
and Montero's victorious army I seemed, notwithstanding<lb/>
Messrs. Gamacho and Fuentes, to hold my<lb/>
new State in the hollow of my hand. I was ready to<lb/>
sleep, but when I got as far as the Casa Gould I found<lb/>
the patio full of wounded laid out on straw. Lights<lb/>
were burning, and in that enclosed courtyard on that<lb/>
hot night a faint odour of chloroform and blood hung<lb/>
about. At one end Doctor Monygham, the doctor of<lb/>
the mine, was dressing the wounds; at the other, near<lb/>
the stairs, Father Corbel&agrave;n, kneeling, listened to the<lb/>
confession of a dying Cargador. Mrs. Gould was<lb/>
walking about through these shambles with a large<lb/>
bottle in one hand and a lot of cotton wool in the<lb/>
other. She just looked at me and never even winked.<lb/>
Her camerista was following her, also holding a bottle,<lb/>
and sobbing gently to herself.<lb/>


<pb n="234"/>

</p>

<p>     "I busied myself for some time in fetching water<lb/>
from the cistern for the wounded. Afterwards I<lb/>
wandered upstairs, meeting some of the first ladies of<lb/>
Sulaco, paler than I had ever seen them before, with<lb/>
bandages over their arms. Not all of them had fled to<lb/>
the ships. A good many had taken refuge for the day<lb/>
in the Casa Gould. On the landing a girl, with her hair<lb/>
half down, was kneeling against the wall under the niche<lb/>
where stands a Madonna in blue robes and a gilt crown<lb/>
on her head. I think it was the eldest Miss Lopez;<lb/>
I couldn't see her face, but I remember looking at the<lb/>
high French heel of her little shoe. She did not make a<lb/>
sound, she did not stir, she was not sobbing; she remained<lb/>
there, perfectly still, all black against the<lb/>
white wall, a silent figure of passionate piety. I am<lb/>
sure she was no more frightened than the other white-<lb/>
faced ladies I met carrying bandages. One was sitting<lb/>
on the top step tearing a piece of linen hastily into strips<lb/>
 &mdash;the young wife of an elderly man of fortune here.<lb/>
She interrupted herself to wave her hand to my bow, as<lb/>
though she were in her carriage on the Alameda. The<lb/>
women of our country are worth looking at during a<lb/>
revolution. The rouge and pearl powder fall off, together<lb/>
with that passive attitude towards the outer<lb/>
world which education, tradition, custom impose upon<lb/>
them from the earliest infancy. I thought of your face,<lb/>
which from your infancy had the stamp of intelligence<lb/>
instead of that patient and resigned cast which appears<lb/>
when some political commotion tears down the veil of<lb/>
cosmetics and usage.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "In the great sala upstairs a sort of Junta of Notables<lb/>
was sitting, the remnant of the vanished Provincial<lb/>
Assembly. Don Juste Lopez had had half his beard<lb/>
singed off at the muzzle of a trabuco loaded with slugs,<lb/>
of which every one missed him, providentially. And as<lb/>


<pb n="235"/>

he turned his head from side to side it was exactly<lb/>
as if there had been two men inside his frock-coat, one<lb/>
nobly whiskered and solemn, the other untidy and<lb/>
scared.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "They raised a cry of 'Decoud! Don Martin!' at<lb/>
my entrance. I asked them, 'What are you deliberating<lb/>
upon, gentlemen?' There did not seem to be any<lb/>
president, though Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos sat at the head of<lb/>
the table. They all answered together, 'On the preservation<lb/>
of life and property.' 'Till the new officials<lb/>
arrive,' Don Juste explained to me, with the solemn<lb/>
side of his face offered to my view. It was as if a<lb/>
stream of water had been poured upon my glowing idea<lb/>
of a new State. There was a hissing sound in my ears,<lb/>
and the room grew dim, as if suddenly filled with vapour.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "I walked up to the table blindly, as though I had<lb/>
been drunk. 'You are deliberating upon surrender,'<lb/>
I said. They all sat still, with their noses over the<lb/>
sheet of paper each had before him, God only knows<lb/>
why. Only Don Jos&eacute; hid his face in his hands, muttering,<lb/>
'Never, never!' But as I looked at him, it<lb/>
seemed to me that I could have blown him away with<lb/>
my breath, he looked so frail, so weak, so worn out.<lb/>
Whatever happens, he will not survive. The deception<lb/>
is too great for a man of his age; and hasn't he seen the<lb/>
sheets of 'Fifty Years of Misrule,' which we have begun<lb/>
printing on the presses of the <hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi>, littering the<lb/>
Plaza, floating in the gutters, fired out as wads for<lb/>
trabucos loaded with handfuls of type, blown in the<lb/>
wind, trampled in the mud? I have seen pages floating<lb/>
upon the very waters of the harbour. It would be<lb/>
unreasonable to expect him to survive. It would be<lb/>
cruel.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'Do you know,' I cried, 'what surrender means<lb/>


<pb n="236"/>

to you, to your women, to your children, to your<lb/>
property?'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I declaimed for five minutes without drawing<lb/>
breath, it seems to me, harping on our best chances, on<lb/>
the ferocity of Montero, whom I made out to be as<lb/>
great a beast as I have no doubt he would like to be if he<lb/>
had intelligence enough to conceive a systematic reign<lb/>
of terror. And then for another five minutes or more<lb/>
I poured out an impassioned appeal to their courage<lb/>
and manliness, with all the passion of my love for<lb/>
Antonia. For if ever man spoke well, it would be from<lb/>
a personal feeling, denouncing an enemy, defending himself,<lb/>
or pleading for what really may be dearer than<lb/>
life. My dear girl, I absolutely thundered at them. It<lb/>
seemed as if my voice would burst the walls asunder,<lb/>
and when I stopped I saw all their scared eyes looking<lb/>
at me dubiously. And that was all the effect I had<lb/>
produced! Only Don Jos&eacute;'s head had sunk lower and<lb/>
lower on his breast. I bent my ear to his withered lips,<lb/>
and made out his whisper, something like, 'In God's<lb/>
name, then, Martin, my son!' I don't know exactly.<lb/>
There was the name of God in it, I am certain. It<lb/>
seems to me I have caught his last breath &mdash; the breath<lb/>
of his departing soul on his lips.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He lives yet, it is true. I have seen him since; but<lb/>
it was only a senile body, lying on its back, covered to<lb/>
the chin, with open eyes, and so still that you might<lb/>
have said it was breathing no longer. I left him thus,<lb/>
with Antonia kneeling by the side of the bed, just before<lb/>
I came to this Italian's posada, where the ubiquitous<lb/>
death is also waiting. But I know that Don Jos&eacute;<lb/>
has really died there, in the Casa Gould, with that<lb/>
whisper urging me to attempt what no doubt his soul,<lb/>
wrapped up in the sanctity of diplomatic treaties and<lb/>
solemn declarations, must have abhorred. I had exclaimed<lb/>


<pb n="237"/>

very loud, 'There is never any God in a country<lb/>
where men will not help themselves.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Meanwhile, Don Juste had begun a pondered oration<lb/>
whose solemn effect was spoiled by the ridiculous<lb/>
disaster to his beard. I did not wait to make it out.<lb/>
He seemed to argue that Montero's (he called him The<lb/>
General) intentions were probably not evil, though, he<lb/>
went on, 'that distinguished man' (only a week ago we<lb/>
used to call him a <hi rend="italic">gran' bestia</hi>) 'was perhaps mistaken<lb/>
as to the true means.' As you may imagine, I didn't<lb/>
stay to hear the rest. I know the intentions of Montero's<lb/>
brother, Pedrito, the guerrillero, whom I exposed<lb/>
in Paris, some years ago, in a caf&eacute; frequented by<lb/>
South American students, where he tried to pass himself<lb/>
off for a Secretary of Legation. He used to come in<lb/>
and talk for hours, twisting his felt hat in his hairy<lb/>
paws, and his ambition seemed to become a sort of<lb/>
Duc de Morny to a sort of Napoleon. Already, then,<lb/>
he used to talk of his brother in inflated terms. He<lb/>
seemed fairly safe from being found out, because the<lb/>
students, all of the Blanco families, did not, as you may<lb/>
imagine, frequent the Legation. It was only Decoud,<lb/>
a man without faith and principles, as they used to say,<lb/>
that went in there sometimes for the sake of the fun, as<lb/>
it were to an assembly of trained monkeys. I know his<lb/>
intentions. I have seen him change the plates at table.<lb/>
Whoever is allowed to live on in terror, I must die the<lb/>
death.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, I didn't stay to the end to hear Don Juste Lopez<lb/>
trying to persuade himself in a grave oration of the<lb/>
clemency and justice, and honesty, and purity of the<lb/>
brothers Montero. I went out abruptly to seek<lb/>
Antonia. I saw her in the gallery. As I opened the<lb/>
door, she extended to me her clasped hands.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'What are they doing in there?' she asked.<lb/>


<pb n="238"/>

</p>

<p>     "'Talking,' I said, with my eyes looking into hers.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'Yes, yes, but &mdash;'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'Empty speeches,' I interrupted her. 'Hiding<lb/>
their fears behind imbecile hopes. They are all great<lb/>
Parliamentarians there &mdash; on the English model, as you<lb/>
know.' I was so furious that I could hardly speak.<lb/>
She made a gesture of despair.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Through the door I held a little ajar behind me, we<lb/>
heard Dun Juste's measured mouthing monotone go on<lb/>
from phrase to phrase, like a sort of awful and solemn<lb/>
madness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'After all, the Democratic aspirations have, perhaps,<lb/>
their legitimacy. The ways of human progress are<lb/>
inscrutable, and if the fate of the country is in the hand<lb/>
of Montero, we ought &mdash;'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I crashed the door to on that; it was enough; it was<lb/>
too much. There was never a beautiful face expressing<lb/>
more horror and despair than the face of Antonia. I<lb/>
couldn't bear it; I seized her wrists.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'Have they killed my father in there?' she asked.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Her eyes blazed with indignation, but as I looked<lb/>
on, fascinated, the light in them went out.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'It is a surrender,' I said. And I remember I was<lb/>
shaking her wrists I held apart in my hands. 'But it's<lb/>
more than talk. Your father told me to go on in God's<lb/>
name.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "My dear girl, there is that in Antonia which would<lb/>
make me believe in the feasibility of anything. One<lb/>
look at her face is enough to set my brain on fire. And<lb/>
yet I love her as any other man would &mdash; with the heart,<lb/>
and with that alone. She is more to me than his Church<lb/>
to Father Corbel&agrave;n (the Grand Vicar disappeared last<lb/>
night from the town; perhaps gone to join the band<lb/>
of Hernandez). She is more to me than his precious<lb/>
mine to that sentimental Englishman. I won't speak<lb/>


<pb n="239"/>

of his wife. She may have been sentimental once.<lb/>
The San Tom&eacute; mine stands now between those two people.<lb/>
'Your father himself, Antonia,' I repeated; 'your<lb/>
father, do you understand? has told me to go on.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She averted her face, and in a pained voice &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'He has?' she cried. 'Then, indeed, I fear he will<lb/>
never speak again.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She freed her wrists from my clutch and began to<lb/>
cry in her handkerchief. I disregarded her sorrow; I<lb/>
would rather see her miserable than not see her at all,<lb/>
never any more; for whether I escaped or stayed to die,<lb/>
there was for us no coming together, no future. And<lb/>
that being so, I had no pity to waste upon the passing<lb/>
moments of her sorrow. I sent her off in tears to fetch<lb/>
Do&ntilde;a Emilia and Don Carlos, too. Their sentiment<lb/>
was necessary to the very life of my plan; the sentimentalism<lb/>
of the people that will never do anything for<lb/>
the sake of their passionate desire, unless it comes to<lb/>
them clothed in the fair robes of an idea.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Late at night we formed a small junta of four &mdash; the<lb/>
two women, Don Carlos, and myself &mdash; in Mrs. Gould's<lb/>
blue-and-white boudoir.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "El Rey de Sulaco thinks himself, no doubt, a very<lb/>
honest man. And so he is, if one could look behind his<lb/>
taciturnity. Perhaps he thinks that this alone makes<lb/>
his honesty unstained. Those Englishmen live on<lb/>
illusions which somehow or other help them to get a<lb/>
firm hold of the substance. When he speaks it is by<lb/>
a rare 'yes' or 'no' that seems as impersonal as the<lb/>
words of an oracle. But he could not impose on me by<lb/>
his dumb reserve. I knew what he had in his head; he<lb/>
has his mine in his head; and his wife had nothing in her<lb/>
head but his precious person, which he has bound up<lb/>
with the Gould Concession and tied up to that little<lb/>
woman's neck. No matter. The thing was to make<lb/>


<pb n="240"/>

him present the affair to Holroyd (the Steel and Silver<lb/>
King) in such a manner as to secure his financial support.<lb/>
At that time last night, just twenty-four hours<lb/>
ago, we thought the silver of the mine safe in the<lb/>
Custom House vaults till the north-bound steamer<lb/>
came to take it away. And as long as the treasure<lb/>
flowed north, without a break, that utter sentimentalist,<lb/>
Holroyd, would not drop his idea of introducing, not<lb/>
only justice, industry, peace, to the benighted continents,<lb/>
but also that pet dream of his of a purer form of<lb/>
Christianity. Later on, the principal European really<lb/>
in Sulaco, the engineer-in-chief of the railway, came<lb/>
riding up the Calle, from the harbour, and was admitted<lb/>
to our conclave. Meantime, the Junta of the Notables<lb/>
in the great sala was still deliberating; only, one of them<lb/>
had run out in the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi> to ask the servant whether<lb/>
something to eat couldn't be sent in. The first words<lb/>
the engineer-in-chief said as he came into the boudoir<lb/>
were, 'What is your house, dear Mrs. Gould? A war<lb/>
hospital below, and apparently a restaurant above.  I<lb/>
saw them carrying trays full of good things into the<lb/>
sala.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'And here, in this boudoir,' I said, 'you behold the<lb/>
inner cabinet of the Occidental Republic that is to be.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He was so preoccupied that he didn't smile at that,<lb/>
he didn't even look surprised.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He told us that he was attending to the general<lb/>
dispositions for the defence of the railway property at<lb/>
the railway yards when he was sent for to go into the<lb/>
railway telegraph office.  The engineer of the railhead,<lb/>
at the foot of the mountains, wanted to talk to him from<lb/>
his end of the wire. There was nobody in the office<lb/>
but himself and the operator of the railway telegraph,<lb/>
who read off the clicks aloud as the tape coiled its<lb/>
length upon the floor. And the purport of that talk,<lb/>


<pb n="241"/>

clicked nervously from a wooden shed in the depths of<lb/>
the forests, had informed the chief that President<lb/>
Ribiera had been, or was being, pursued. This was<lb/>
news, indeed, to all of us in Sulaco. Ribiera himself,<lb/>
when rescued, revived, and soothed by us, had been inclined<lb/>
to think that he had not been pursued.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ribiera had yielded to the urgent solicitations of<lb/>
his friends, and had left the headquarters of his discomfited<lb/>
army alone, under the guidance of Bonifacio,<lb/>
the muleteer, who had been willing to take the responsibility<lb/>
with the risk. He had departed at day-<lb/>
break of the third day. His remaining forces had<lb/>
melted away during the night. Bonifacio and he rode<lb/>
hard on horses towards the Cordillera; then they obtained<lb/>
mules, entered the passes, and crossed the<lb/>
Paramo of Ivie just before a freezing blast swept over<lb/>
that stony plateau, burying in a drift of snow the little<lb/>
shelter-hut of stones in which they had spent the night.<lb/>
Afterwards poor Ribiera had many adventures, got<lb/>
separated from his guide, lost his mount, struggled down<lb/>
to the Campo on foot, and if he had not thrown himself<lb/>
on the mercy of a ranchero would have perished a long<lb/>
way from Sulaco. That man, who, as a matter of fact,<lb/>
recognized him at once, let him have a fresh mule, which<lb/>
the fugitive, heavy and unskilful, had ridden to death.<lb/>
And it was true he had been pursued by a party commanded<lb/>
by no less a person than Pedro Montero, the<lb/>
brother of the general. The cold wind of the Paramo<lb/>
luckily caught the pursuers on the top of the pass.<lb/>
Some few men, and all the animals, perished in the icy<lb/>
blast. The stragglers died, but the main body kept on.<lb/>
They found poor Bonifacio lying half-dead at the foot<lb/>
of a snow slope, and bayoneted him promptly in the<lb/>
true Civil War style. They would have had Ribiera,<lb/>
too, if they had not, for some reason or other, turned off<lb/>


<pb n="242"/>

the track of the old Camino Real, only to lose their way<lb/>
in the forests at the foot of the lower slopes.  And<lb/>
there they were at last, having stumbled in unexpectedly<lb/>
upon the construction camp. The engineer at<lb/>
the railhead told his chief by wire that he had Pedro<lb/>
Montero absolutely there, in the very office, listening<lb/>
to the clicks. He was going to take possession of Sulaco<lb/>
in the name of the Democracy. He was very overbearing.<lb/>
His men slaughtered some of the Railway Company's<lb/>
cattle without asking leave, and went to work<lb/>
broiling the meat on the embers. Pedrito made many<lb/>
pointed inquiries as to the silver mine, and what had<lb/>
become of the product of the last six months' working.<lb/>
He had said peremptorily, "Ask your chief up there by<lb/>
wire, he ought to know; tell him that Don Pedro<lb/>
Montero, Chief of the Campo and Minister of the<lb/>
Interior of the new Government, desires to be correctly<lb/>
informed.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He had his feet wrapped up in blood-stained rags, a<lb/>
lean, haggard face, ragged beard and hair, and had<lb/>
walked in limping, with a crooked branch of a tree for<lb/>
a staff. His followers were perhaps in a worse plight,<lb/>
but apparently they had not thrown away their arms,<lb/>
and, at any rate, not all their ammunition. Their lean<lb/>
faces filled the door and the windows of the telegraph<lb/>
hut. As it was at the same time the bedroom of the<lb/>
engineer-in-charge there, Montero had thrown himself<lb/>
on his clean blankets and lay there shivering and dictating<lb/>
requisitions to be transmitted by wire to Sulaco.<lb/>
He demanded a train of cars to be sent down at once to<lb/>
transport his men up.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'To this I answered from my end,' the engineer-in-<lb/>
chief related to us, 'that I dared not risk the rolling-<lb/>
stock in the interior, as there had been attempts to<lb/>
wreck trains all along the line several times. I did that<lb/>


<pb n="243"/>

for your sake, Gould,' said the chief engineer. 'The answer<lb/>
to this was, in the words of my subordinate, "The filthy<lb/>
brute on my bed said, 'Suppose I were to have you<lb/>
shot?'" To which my subordinate, who, it appears,<lb/>
was himself operating, remarked that it would not<lb/>
bring the cars up. Upon that, the other, yawning,<lb/>
said, "Never mind, there is no lack of horses on the<lb/>
Campo." And, turning over, went to sleep on Harris's<lb/>
bed.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "This is why, my dear girl, I am a fugitive to-night.<lb/>
The last wire from railhead says that Pedro Montero<lb/>
and his men left at daybreak, after feeding on asado<lb/>
beef all night. They took all the horses; they will find<lb/>
more on the road; they'll be here in less than thirty<lb/>
hours, and thus Sulaco is no place either for me or the<lb/>
great store of silver belonging to the Gould Concession.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But that is not the worst. The garrison of Esmeralda<lb/>
has gone over to the victorious party. We have<lb/>
heard this by means of the telegraphist of the Cable<lb/>
Company, who came to the Casa Gould in the early<lb/>
morning with the news. In fact, it was so early that<lb/>
the day had not yet quite broken over Sulaco. His<lb/>
colleague in Esmeralda had called him up to say that<lb/>
the garrison, after shooting some of their officers, had<lb/>
taken possession of a Government steamer laid up in<lb/>
the harbour. It is really a heavy blow for me. I<lb/>
thought I could depend on every man in this province.<lb/>
It was a mistake. It was a Monterist Revolution in<lb/>
Esmeralda, just such as was attempted in Sulaco, only<lb/>
that <hi rend="italic">that</hi> one came off. The telegraphist was signalling<lb/>
to Bernhardt all the time, and his last transmitted<lb/>
words were, 'They are bursting in the door, and taking<lb/>
possession of the cable office. You are cut off. Can<lb/>
do no more.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But, as a matter of fact, he managed somehow to<lb/>


<pb n="244"/>

escape the vigilance of his captors, who had tried to<lb/>
stop the communication with the outer world. He did<lb/>
manage it. How it was done I don't know, but a few<lb/>
hours afterwards he called up Sulaco again, and what<lb/>
he said was, 'The insurgent army has taken possession<lb/>
of the Government transport in the bay and are filling<lb/>
her with troops, with the intention of going round the<lb/>
coast to Sulaco. Therefore look out for yourselves.<lb/>
They will be ready to start in a few hours, and may be<lb/>
upon you before daybreak.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "This is all he could say. They drove him away from<lb/>
his instrument this time for good, because Bernhardt<lb/>
has been calling up Esmeralda ever since without getting<lb/>
an answer."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     After setting these words down in the pocket-book<lb/>
which he was filling up for the benefit of his sister, Decoud<lb/>
lifted his head to listen. But there were no sounds,<lb/>
neither in the room nor in the house, except the drip of<lb/>
the water from the filter into the vast earthenware jar<lb/>
under the wooden stand. And outside the house there<lb/>
was a great silence. Decoud lowered his head again<lb/>
over the pocket-book.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am not running away, you understand," he wrote<lb/>
on. "I am simply going away with that great treasure<lb/>
of silver which must be saved at all costs. Pedro<lb/>
Montero from the Campo and the revolted garrison of<lb/>
Esmeralda from the sea are converging upon it. That<lb/>
it is there lying ready for them is only an accident. The<lb/>
real objective is the San Tom&eacute; mine itself, as you may<lb/>
well imagine; otherwise the Occidental Province would<lb/>
have been, no doubt, left alone for many weeks, to be<lb/>
gathered at leisure into the arms of the victorious party.<lb/>
Don Carlos Gould will have enough to do to save his<lb/>
mine, with its organization and its people; this 'Imperium<lb/>
in Imperio,' this wealth-producing thing, to<lb/>


<pb n="245"/>

which his sentimentalism attaches a strange idea of<lb/>
justice. He holds to it as some men hold to the idea of<lb/>
love or revenge. Unless I am much mistaken in the<lb/>
man, it must remain inviolate or perish by an act of his<lb/>
will alone. A passion has crept into his cold and<lb/>
idealistic life. A passion which I can only comprehend<lb/>
intellectually. A passion that is not like the passions<lb/>
we know, we men of another blood. But it is as<lb/>
dangerous as any of ours.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "His wife has understood it, too. That is why she is<lb/>
such a good ally of mine. She seizes upon all my suggestions<lb/>
with a sure instinct that in the end they make<lb/>
for the safety of the Gould Concession. And he defers<lb/>
to her because he trusts her perhaps, but I fancy<lb/>
rather as if he wished to make up for some subtle wrong,<lb/>
for that sentimental unfaithfulness which surrenders<lb/>
her happiness, her life, to the seduction of an idea. The<lb/>
little woman has discovered that he lives for the mine<lb/>
rather than for her. But let them be. To each his<lb/>
fate, shaped by passion or sentiment. The principal<lb/>
thing is that she has backed up my advice to get the<lb/>
silver out of the town, out of the country, at once, at<lb/>
any cost, at any risk. Don Carlos' mission is to preserve<lb/>
unstained the fair fame of his mine; Mrs. Gould's<lb/>
mission is to save him from the effects of that cold and<lb/>
overmastering passion, which she dreads more than if it<lb/>
were an infatuation for another woman. Nostromo's<lb/>
mission is to save the silver. The plan is to load it into<lb/>
the largest of the Company's lighters, and send it across<lb/>
the gulf to a small port out of Costaguana territory just<lb/>
on the other side the Azuera, where the first north-<lb/>
bound steamer will get orders to pick it up. The<lb/>
waters here are calm. We shall slip away into the darkness<lb/>
of the gulf before the Esmeralda rebels arrive; and<lb/>
by the time the day breaks over the ocean we shall be<lb/>


<pb n="246"/>

out of sight, invisible, hidden by Azuera, which itself<lb/>
looks from the Sulaco shore like a faint blue cloud on the<lb/>
horizon.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The incorruptible Capataz de Cargadores is the man<lb/>
for that work; and I, the man with a passion, but without<lb/>
a mission, I go with him to return &mdash; to play my part<lb/>
in the farce to the end, and, if successful, to receive my<lb/>
reward, which no one but Antonia can give me.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I shall not see her again now before I depart. I<lb/>
left her, as I have said, by Don Jos&eacute;'s bedside. The<lb/>
street was dark, the houses shut up, and I walked out<lb/>
of the town in the night. Not a single street-lamp had<lb/>
been lit for two days, and the archway of the gate was<lb/>
only a mass of darkness in the vague form of a tower, in<lb/>
which I heard low, dismal groans, that seemed to answer<lb/>
the murmurs of a man's voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I recognized something impassive and careless in its<lb/>
tone, characteristic of that Genoese sailor who, like me,<lb/>
has come casually here to be drawn into the events for<lb/>
which his scepticism as well as mine seems to entertain<lb/>
a sort of passive contempt. The only thing he seems to<lb/>
care for, as far as I have been able to discover, is to be<lb/>
well spoken of. An ambition fit for noble souls, but<lb/>
also a profitable one for an exceptionally intelligent<lb/>
scoundrel. Yes. His very words, 'To be well spoken<lb/>
of. Si, se&ntilde;or.' He does not seem to make any dif-.<lb/>
ference between speaking and thinking. Is it sheer<lb/>
na&iuml;veness or the practical point of view, I wonder?<lb/>
Exceptional individualities always interest me, because<lb/>
they are true to the general formula expressing the<lb/>
moral state of humanity.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He joined me on the harbour road after I had<lb/>
passed them under the dark archway without stopping.<lb/>
It was a woman in trouble he had been talking to.<lb/>
Through discretion I kept silent while he walked by my<lb/>


<pb n="247"/>

side. After a time he began to talk himself. It was<lb/>
not what I expected. It was only an old woman, an<lb/>
old lace-maker, in search of her son, one of the street-<lb/>
sweepers employed by the municipality. Friends had<lb/>
come the day before at daybreak to the door of their<lb/>
hovel calling him out. He had gone with them, and<lb/>
she had not seen him since; so she had left the food she<lb/>
had been preparing half-cooked on the extinct embers<lb/>
and had crawled out as far as the harbour, where she<lb/>
had heard that some town mozos had been killed on the<lb/>
morning of the riot. One of the Cargadores guarding<lb/>
the Custom House had brought out a lantern, and had<lb/>
helped her to look at the few dead left lying about there.<lb/>
Now she was creeping back, having failed in her search.<lb/>
So she sat down on the stone seat under the arch, moaning,<lb/>
because she was very tired. The Capataz had<lb/>
questioned her, and after hearing her broken and groaning<lb/>
tale had advised her to go and look amongst the<lb/>
wounded in the patio of the Casa Gould. He had also<lb/>
given her a quarter dollar, he mentioned carelessly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'Why did you do that?' I asked. 'Do you know<lb/>
her?'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'No, se&ntilde;or. I don't suppose I have ever seen her<lb/>
before. How should I? She has not probably been<lb/>
out in the streets for years. She is one of those old<lb/>
women that you find in this country at the back of huts,<lb/>
crouching over fireplaces, with a stick on the ground by<lb/>
their side, and almost too feeble to drive away the<lb/>
stray dogs from their cooking-pots. Caramba! I<lb/>
could tell by her voice that death had forgotten her.<lb/>
But, old or young, they like money, and will speak well<lb/>
of the man who gives it to them.' He laughed a little.<lb/>
'Se&ntilde;or, you should have felt the clutch of her paw as I<lb/>
put the piece in her palm.' He paused. 'My last, too,'<lb/>
he added.<lb/>


<pb n="248"/>

</p>

<p>     "I made no comment. He's known for his liberality<lb/>
and his bad luck at the game of monte, which keeps him<lb/>
as poor as when he first came here.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'I suppose, Don Martin,' he began, in a thoughtful,<lb/>
speculative tone, 'that the Se&ntilde;or Administrador of San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; will reward me some day if I save his silver?'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I said that it could not be otherwise, surely. He<lb/>
walked on, muttering to himself. 'Si, si, without doubt,<lb/>
without doubt; and, look you, Se&ntilde;or Martin, what it is<lb/>
to be well spoken of! There is not another man that<lb/>
could have been even thought of for such a thing. I<lb/>
shall get something great for it some day. And let it<lb/>
come soon,' he mumbled. 'Time passes in this country<lb/>
as quick as anywhere else.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "This, <hi rend="italic">s&oelig;ur ch&eacute;rie</hi>, is my companion in the great<lb/>
escape for the sake of the great cause. He is more na&iuml;ve<lb/>
than shrewd, more masterful than crafty, more generous<lb/>
with his personality than the people who make use of<lb/>
him are with their money. At least, that is what he<lb/>
thinks himself with more pride than sentiment. I am<lb/>
glad I have made friends with him. As a companion<lb/>
he acquires more importance than he ever had as a sort<lb/>
of minor genius in his way &mdash; as an original Italian sailor<lb/>
whom I allowed to come in in the small hours and talk<lb/>
familiarly to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi> while the paper<lb/>
was going through the press. And it is curious to have<lb/>
met a man for whom the value of life seems to consist<lb/>
in personal prestige.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am waiting for him here now. On arriving at<lb/>
the posada kept by Viola we found the children alone<lb/>
down below, and the old Genoese shouted to his<lb/>
countryman to go and fetch the doctor. Otherwise we<lb/>
would have gone on to the wharf, where it appears<lb/>
Captain Mitchell with some volunteer Europeans and a<lb/>
few picked Cargadores are loading the lighter with the<lb/>


<pb n="249"/>

silver that must be saved from Montero's clutches in<lb/>
order to be used for Montero's defeat. Nostromo<lb/>
galloped furiously back towards the town. He has<lb/>
been long gone already. This delay gives me time to<lb/>
talk to you. By the time this pocket-book reaches<lb/>
your hands much will have happened. But now it is a<lb/>
pause under the hovering wing of death in this silent<lb/>
house buried in the black night, with this dying woman,<lb/>
the two children crouching without a sound, and that<lb/>
old man whom I can hear through the thickness of the<lb/>
wall passing up and down with a light rubbing noise<lb/>
no louder than a mouse. And I, the only other with<lb/>
them, don't really know whether to count myself with<lb/>
the living or with the dead. '<hi rend="italic">Quien sabe?</hi>' as the people<lb/>
here are prone to say in answer to every question. But<lb/>
no! feeling for you is certainly not dead, and the whole<lb/>
thing, the house, the dark night, the silent children in<lb/>
this dim room, my very presence here &mdash; all this is life,<lb/>
must be life, since it is so much like a dream."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With the writing of the last line there came upon<lb/>
Decoud a moment of sudden and complete oblivion.<lb/>
He swayed over the table as if struck by a bullet. The<lb/>
next moment he sat up, confused, with the idea that he<lb/>
had heard his pencil roll on the floor. The low door of<lb/>
the caf&eacute;, wide open, was filled with the glare of a torch in<lb/>
which was visible half of a horse, switching its tail<lb/>
against the leg of a rider with a long iron spur strapped<lb/>
to the naked heel. The two girls were gone, and<lb/>
Nostromo, standing in the middle of the room, looked<lb/>
at him from under the round brim of the sombrero low<lb/>
down over his brow.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I have brought that sour-faced English doctor in<lb/>
Se&ntilde;ora Gould's carriage," said Nostromo. "I doubt if,<lb/>
with all his wisdom, he can save the Padrona this time.<lb/>
They have sent for the children. A bad sign that."<lb/>


<pb n="250"/>

</p>

<p>     He sat down on the end of a bench. "She wants to<lb/>
give them her blessing, I suppose."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Dazedly Decoud observed that he must have fallen<lb/>
sound asleep, and Nostromo said, with a vague smile,<lb/>
that he had looked in at the window and had seen him<lb/>
lying still across the table with his head on his arms.<lb/>
The English se&ntilde;ora had also come in the carriage, and<lb/>
went upstairs at once with the doctor. She had told<lb/>
him not to wake up Don Martin yet; but when they sent<lb/>
for the children he had come into the caf&eacute;.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The half of the horse with its half of the rider swung<lb/>
round outside the door; the torch of tow and resin in the<lb/>
iron basket which was carried on a stick at the saddle-<lb/>
bow flared right into the room for a moment, and Mrs.<lb/>
Gould entered hastily with a very white, tired face.<lb/>
The hood of her dark, blue cloak had fallen back. Both<lb/>
men rose.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Teresa wants to see you, Nostromo," she said.<lb/>
The Capataz did not move. Decoud, with his back<lb/>
to the table, began to button up his coat.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The silver, Mrs. Gould, the silver," he murmured in<lb/>
English. "Don't forget that the Esmeralda garrison<lb/>
have got a steamer. They may appear at any moment<lb/>
at the harbour entrance."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The doctor says there is no hope," Mrs. Gould spoke<lb/>
rapidly, also in English. "I shall take you down to the<lb/>
wharf in my carriage and then come back to fetch away<lb/>
the girls." She changed swiftly into Spanish to address<lb/>
Nostromo. "Why are you wasting time? Old Giorgio's<lb/>
wife wishes to see you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am going to her, se&ntilde;ora," muttered the Capataz.<lb/>
Dr. Monygham now showed himself, bringing back<lb/>
the children. To Mrs. Gould's inquiring glance he only<lb/>
shook his head and went outside at once, followed by<lb/>
Nostromo.<lb/>


<pb n="251"/>

</p>

<p>     The horse of the torch-bearer, motionless, hung his<lb/>
head low, and the rider had dropped the reins to light<lb/>
a cigarette. The glare of the torch played on the front<lb/>
of the house crossed by the big black letters of its inscription<lb/>
in which only the word ITALIA was lighted<lb/>
fully. The patch of wavering glare reached as far as<lb/>
Mrs. Gould's carriage waiting on the road, with the<lb/>
yellow-faced, portly Ignacio apparently dozing on the<lb/>
box. By his side Basilio, dark and skinny, held a<lb/>
Winchester carbine in front of him, with both hands,<lb/>
and peered fearfully into the darkness. Nostromo<lb/>
touched lightly the doctor's shoulder.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Is she really dying, se&ntilde;or doctor?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes," said the doctor, with a strange twitch of his<lb/>
scarred cheek. "And why she wants to see you I cannot<lb/>
imagine."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She has been like that before," suggested Nostromo,<lb/>
looking away.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well, Capataz, I can assure you she will never be<lb/>
like that again," snarled Dr. Monygham. "You may<lb/>
go to her or stay away. There is very little to be got<lb/>
from talking to the dying. But she told Do&ntilde;a Emilia<lb/>
in my hearing that she has been like a mother to you<lb/>
ever since you first set foot ashore here."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Si! And she never had a good word to say for me<lb/>
to anybody. It is more as if she could not forgive me<lb/>
for being alive, and such a man, too, as she would have<lb/>
liked her son to be."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Maybe!" exclaimed a mournful deep voice near<lb/>
them. "Women have their own ways of tormenting<lb/>
themselves." Giorgio Viola had come out of the house.<lb/>
He threw a heavy black shadow in the torchlight, and<lb/>
the glare fell on his big face, on the great bushy head of<lb/>
white hair. He motioned the Capataz indoors with<lb/>
his extended arm.<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="252"/>

<p>   Dr. Monygham, after busying himself with a little<lb/>
medicament box of polished wood on the seat of the<lb/>
landau, turned to old Giorgio and thrust into his big,<lb/>
trembling hand one of the glass-stoppered bottles out<lb/>
of the case.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Give her a spoonful of this now and then, in water,"<lb/>
he said. "It will make her easier."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "And there is nothing more for her?" asked the old<lb/>
man, patiently.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "No. Not on earth," said the doctor, with his back<lb/>
to him, clicking the lock of the medicine case.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo slowly crossed the large kitchen, all dark<lb/>
but for the glow of a heap of charcoal under the heavy<lb/>
mantel of the cooking-range, where water was boiling in<lb/>
an iron pot with a loud bubbling sound. Between the<lb/>
two walls of a narrow staircase a bright light streamed<lb/>
from the sick-room above; and the magnificent Capataz<lb/>
de Cargadores stepping noiselessly in soft leather<lb/>
sandals, bushy whiskered, his muscular neck and<lb/>
bronzed chest bare in the open check shirt, resembled<lb/>
a Mediterranean sailor just come ashore from some<lb/>
wine or fruit-laden felucca. At the top he paused,<lb/>
broad shouldered, narrow hipped and supple, looking<lb/>
at the large bed, like a white couch of state, with a<lb/>
profusion of snowy linen, amongst which the Padrona<lb/>
sat unpropped and bowed, her handsome, black-browed<lb/>
face bent over her chest. A mass of raven hair with<lb/>
only a few white threads in it covered her shoulders;<lb/>
one thick strand fallen forward half veiled her cheek.<lb/>
Perfectly motionless in that pose, expressing physical<lb/>
anxiety and unrest, she turned her eyes alone towards<lb/>
Nostromo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The Capataz had a red sash wound many times round<lb/>
his waist, and a heavy silver ring on the forefinger of the<lb/>
hand he raised to give a twist to his moustache.<lb/>


<pb n="253"/>

</p>

<p>   "Their revolutions, their revolutions," gasped Se&ntilde;ora<lb/>
Teresa. "Look, Gian' Battista, it has killed me at<lb/>
last!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo said nothing, and the sick woman with an<lb/>
upward glance insisted. "Look, this one has killed<lb/>
me, while you were away fighting for what did not<lb/>
concern you, foolish man."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Why talk like this?" mumbled the Capataz between<lb/>
his teeth. "Will you never believe in my good sense?<lb/>
It concerns me to keep on being what I am: every day<lb/>
alike."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You never change, indeed," she said, bitterly. "Always<lb/>
thinking of yourself and taking your pay out in<lb/>
fine words from those who care nothing for you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   There was between them an intimacy of antagonism<lb/>
as close in its way as the intimacy of accord and affection.<lb/>
He had not walked along the way of Teresa's<lb/>
expectations. It was she who had encouraged him to<lb/>
leave his ship, in the hope of securing a friend and defender<lb/>
for the girls. The wife of old Giorgio was aware<lb/>
of her precarious health, and was haunted by the fear<lb/>
of her aged husband's loneliness and the unprotected<lb/>
state of the children. She had wanted to annex that apparently<lb/>
quiet and steady young man, affectionate and<lb/>
pliable, an orphan from his tenderest age, as he had<lb/>
told her, with no ties in Italy except an uncle, owner<lb/>
and master of a felucca, from whose ill-usage he had<lb/>
run away before he was fourteen. He had seemed to<lb/>
her courageous, a hard worker, determined to make his<lb/>
way in the world. From gratitude and the ties of<lb/>
habit he would become like a son to herself and Giorgio;<lb/>
and then, who knows, when Linda had grown up. . . .<lb/>
Ten years' difference between husband and wife was not<lb/>
so much. Her own great man was nearly twenty years<lb/>
older than herself. Gian' Battista was an attractive<lb/>


<pb n="254"/>

young fellow, besides; attractive to men, women, and<lb/>
children, just by that profound quietness of personality<lb/>
which, like a serene twilight, rendered more seductive<lb/>
the promise of his vigorous form and the resolution of<lb/>
his conduct.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Old Giorgio, in profound ignorance of his wife's views<lb/>
and hopes, had a great regard for his young countryman.<lb/>
"A man ought not to be tame," he used to tell her,<lb/>
quoting the Spanish proverb in defence of the splendid<lb/>
Capataz. She was growing jealous of his success. He<lb/>
was escaping from her, she feared. She was practical,<lb/>
and he seemed to her to be an absurd spendthrift<lb/>
of these qualities which made him so valuable. He got<lb/>
too little for them. He scattered them with both<lb/>
hands amongst too many people, she thought. He laid<lb/>
no money by. She railed at his poverty, his exploits,<lb/>
his adventures, his loves and his reputation; but in her<lb/>
heart she had never given him up, as though, indeed, he<lb/>
had been her son.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Even now, ill as she was, ill enough to feel the chill,<lb/>
black breath of the approaching end, she had wished to<lb/>
see him. It was like putting out her benumbed hand to<lb/>
regain her hold. But she had presumed too much on<lb/>
her strength. She could not command her thoughts;<lb/>
they had become dim, like her vision. The words faltered<lb/>
on her lips, and only the paramount anxiety and<lb/>
desire of her life seemed to be too strong for death.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The Capataz said, "I have heard these things many<lb/>
times. You are unjust, but it does not hurt me. Only<lb/>
now you do not seem to have much strength to talk, and<lb/>
I have but little time to listen. I am engaged in a work<lb/>
of very great moment."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   She made an effort to ask him whether it was true that<lb/>
he had found time to go and fetch a doctor for her.<lb/>
Nostromo nodded affirmatively.<lb/>


<pb n="255"/>

</p>

<p>   She was pleased: it relieved her sufferings to know<lb/>
that the man had condescended to do so much for those<lb/>
who really wanted his help. It was a proof of his<lb/>
friendship. Her voice become stronger.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I want a priest more than a doctor," she said,<lb/>
pathetically.  She did not move her head; only her<lb/>
eyes ran into the corners to watch the Capataz<lb/>
standing by the side of her bed. "Would you go to<lb/>
fetch a priest for me now? Think! A dying woman<lb/>
asks you!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo shook his head resolutely. He did not<lb/>
believe in priests in their sacerdotal character. A<lb/>
doctor was an efficacious person; but a priest, as priest,<lb/>
was nothing, incapable of doing either good or harm.<lb/>
Nostromo did not even dislike the sight of them as old<lb/>
Giorgio did. The utter uselessness of the errand was<lb/>
what struck him most.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Padrona," he said, "you have been like this before,<lb/>
and got better after a few days. I have given you<lb/>
already the very last moments I can spare. Ask<lb/>
Se&ntilde;ora Gould to send you one."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He was feeling uneasy at the impiety of this refusal.<lb/>
The Padrona believed in priests, and confessed herself<lb/>
to them. But all women did that. It could not be of<lb/>
much consequence. And yet his heart felt oppressed<lb/>
for a moment &mdash; at the thought what absolution would<lb/>
mean to her if she believed in it only ever so little. No<lb/>
matter. It was quite true that he had given her already<lb/>
the very last moment he could spare.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You refuse to go?" she gasped. "Ah! you are<lb/>
always yourself, indeed."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Listen to reason, Padrona," he said. "I am needed<lb/>
to save the silver of the mine. Do you hear? A<lb/>
greater treasure than the one which they say is guarded<lb/>
by ghosts and devils on Azuera. It is true. I am resolved<lb/>


<pb n="256"/>

to make this the most desperate affair I was<lb/>
ever engaged on in my whole life."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   She felt a despairing indignation. The supreme test<lb/>
had failed. Standing above her, Nostromo did not<lb/>
see the distorted features of her face, distorted by a<lb/>
paroxysm of pain and anger. Only she began to<lb/>
tremble all over. Her bowed head shook. The broad<lb/>
shoulders quivered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Then God, perhaps, will have mercy upon me!<lb/>
But do you look to it, man, that you get something for<lb/>
yourself out of it, besides the remorse that shall overtake<lb/>
you some day."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   She laughed feebly. "Get riches at least for once,<lb/>
you indispensable, admired Gian' Battista, to whom<lb/>
the peace of a dying woman is less than the praise of<lb/>
people who have given you a silly name &mdash; and nothing<lb/>
besides &mdash; in exchange for your soul and body."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The Capataz de Cargadores swore to himself under<lb/>
his breath.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Leave my soul alone, Padrona, and I shall know<lb/>
how to take care of my body. Where is the harm of<lb/>
people having need of me? What are you envying me<lb/>
that I have robbed you and the children of? Those<lb/>
very people you are throwing in my teeth have done<lb/>
more for old Giorgio than they ever thought of doing<lb/>
for me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He struck his breast with his open palm; his<lb/>
voice had remained low though he had spoken in a<lb/>
forcible tone. He twisted his moustaches one after<lb/>
another, and his eyes wandered a little about the<lb/>
room.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Is it my fault that I am the only man for their purposes?<lb/>
What angry nonsense are you talking, mother?<lb/>
Would you rather have me timid and foolish, selling<lb/>
water-melons on the market-place or rowing a boat for<lb/>


<pb n="257"/>

passengers along the harbour, like a soft Neapolitan without<lb/>
courage or reputation? Would you have a young<lb/>
man live like a monk? I do not believe it. Would you<lb/>
want a monk for your eldest girl? Let her grow. What<lb/>
are you afraid of? You have been angry with me for<lb/>
everything I did for years; ever since you first spoke to<lb/>
me, in secret from old Giorgio, about your Linda. Husband<lb/>
to one and brother to the other, did you say?<lb/>
Well, why not! I like the little ones, and a man must<lb/>
marry some time. But ever since that time you have<lb/>
been making little of me to everyone. Why? Did you<lb/>
think you could put a collar and chain on me as if I were<lb/>
one of the watch-dogs they keep over there in the rail-<lb/>
way yards? Look here, Padrona, I am the same man<lb/>
who came ashore one evening and sat down in the<lb/>
thatched ranche you lived in at that time on the other<lb/>
side of the town and told you all about himself. You<lb/>
were not unjust to me then. What has happened since?<lb/>
I am no longer an insignificant youth. A good name,<lb/>
Giorgio says, is a treasure, Padrona."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "They have turned your head with their praises,"<lb/>
gasped the sick woman. "They have been paying you<lb/>
with words. Your folly shall betray you into poverty,<lb/>
misery, starvation. The very leperos shall laugh at<lb/>
you &mdash; the great Capataz."<lb/>
  Nostromo stood for a time as if struck dumb. She<lb/>
never looked at him. A self-confident, mirthless smile<lb/>
passed quickly from his lips, and then he backed away.<lb/>
His disregarded figure sank down beyond the doorway.<lb/>
He descended the stairs backwards, with the usual sense<lb/>
of having been somehow baffled by this woman's disparagement<lb/>
of this reputation he had obtained and<lb/>
desired to keep.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Downstairs in the big kitchen a candle was burning,<lb/>
surrounded by the shadows of the walls, of the ceiling,<lb/>


<pb n="258"/>

but no ruddy glare filled the open square of the outer<lb/>
door. The carriage with Mrs. Gould and Don Martin,<lb/>
preceded by the horseman bearing the torch, had gone<lb/>
on to the jetty. Dr. Monygham, who had remained,<lb/>
sat on the corner of a hard wood table near the candlestick,<lb/>
his seamed, shaven face inclined sideways, his<lb/>
arms crossed on his breast, his lips pursed up, and his<lb/>
prominent eyes glaring stonily upon the floor of black<lb/>
earth. Near the overhanging mantel of the fireplace,<lb/>
where the pot of water was still boiling violently, old<lb/>
Giorgio held his chin in his hand, one foot advanced, as<lb/>
if arrested by a sudden thought.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   <hi rend="italic">"Adios, viejo</hi>," said Nostromo, feeling the handle of<lb/>
his revolver in the belt and loosening his knife in its<lb/>
sheath. He picked up a blue poncho lined with red<lb/>
from the table, and put it over his head. "Adios, look<lb/>
after the things in my sleeping-room, and if you hear<lb/>
from me no more, give up the box to Paquita. There<lb/>
is not much of value there, except my new serape from<lb/>
Mexico, and a few silver buttons on my best jacket.<lb/>
No matter!  The things will look well enough on the<lb/>
next lover she gets, and the man need not be afraid I<lb/>
shall linger on earth after I am dead, like those Gringos<lb/>
that haunt the Azuera."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Dr. Monygham twisted his lips into a bitter smile.<lb/>
After old Giorgio, with an almost imperceptible nod and<lb/>
without a word, had gone up the narrow stairs, he<lb/>
said &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Why, Capataz! I thought you could never fail in<lb/>
anything."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo, glancing contemptuously at the doctor,<lb/>
lingered in the doorway rolling a cigarette, then struck a<lb/>
match, and, after lighting it, held the burning piece of<lb/>
wood above his head till the flame nearly touched his<lb/>
fingers.<lb/>


<pb n="259"/>

</p>

<p>   "No wind!" he muttered to himself. "Look here,<lb/>
se&ntilde;or &mdash; do you know the nature of my undertaking?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Dr. Monygham nodded sourly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "It is as if I were taking up a curse upon me, se&ntilde;or<lb/>
doctor. A man with a treasure on this coast will have<lb/>
every knife raised against him in every place upon the<lb/>
shore. You see that, se&ntilde;or doctor? I shall float<lb/>
along with a spell upon my life till I meet somewhere the<lb/>
north-bound steamer of the Company, and then indeed<lb/>
they will talk about the Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores<lb/>
from one end of America to another."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Dr. Monygham laughed his short, throaty laugh.<lb/>
Nostromo turned round in the doorway.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "But if your worship can find any other man ready<lb/>
and fit for such business I will stand back. I am not<lb/>
exactly tired of my life, though I am so poor that I can<lb/>
carry all I have with myself on my horse's back."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You gamble too much, and never say 'no' to a pretty<lb/>
face, Capataz," said Dr. Monygham, with sly simplicity.<lb/>
"That's not the way to make a fortune. But<lb/>
nobody that I know ever suspected you of being poor.<lb/>
I hope you have made a good bargain in case you come<lb/>
back safe from this adventure."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "What bargain would your worship have made?"<lb/>
asked Nostromo, blowing the smoke out of his lips<lb/>
through the doorway.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Dr. Monygham listened up the staircase for a moment<lb/>
before he answered, with another of his short,<lb/>
abrupt laughs &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Illustrious Capataz, for taking the curse of death<lb/>
upon my back, as you call it, nothing else but the whole<lb/>
treasure would do."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo vanished out of the doorway with a grunt<lb/>
of discontent at this jeering answer. Dr. Monygham<lb/>
heard him gallop away. Nostromo rode furiously in<lb/>


<pb n="260"/>

the dark. There were lights in the buildings of the<lb/>
O.S.N. Company near the wharf, but before he got<lb/>
there he met the Gould carriage. The horseman preceded<lb/>
it with the torch, whose light showed the white<lb/>
mules trotting, the portly Ignacio driving, and Basilio<lb/>
with the carbine on the box. From the dark body of<lb/>
the landau Mrs. Gould's voice cried, "They are waiting<lb/>
for you, Capataz!" She was returning, chilly and excited,<lb/>
with Decoud's pocket-book still held in her hand.<lb/>
He had confided it to her to send to his sister. "Perhaps<lb/>
my last words to her," he had said, pressing Mrs.<lb/>
Gould's hand.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The Capataz never checked his speed. At the head<lb/>
of the wharf vague figures with rifles leapt to the head of<lb/>
his horse; others closed upon him &mdash; cargadores of the<lb/>
company posted by Captain Mitchell on the watch. At<lb/>
a word from him they fell back with subservient murmurs,<lb/>
recognizing his voice. At the other end of the<lb/>
jetty, near a cargo crane, in a dark group with glowing<lb/>
cigars, his name was pronounced in a tone of relief.<lb/>
Most of the Europeans in Sulaco were there, rallied<lb/>
round Charles Gould, as if the silver of the mine had<lb/>
been the emblem of a common cause, the symbol of the<lb/>
supreme importance of material interests. They had<lb/>
loaded it into the lighter with their own hands. Nostromo<lb/>
recognized Don Carlos Gould, a thin, tall shape<lb/>
standing a little apart and silent, to whom another tall<lb/>
shape, the engineer-in-chief, said aloud, "If it must be<lb/>
lost, it is a million times better that it should go to the<lb/>
bottom of the sea."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Martin Decoud called out from the lighter, "Au<lb/>
revoir, messieurs, till we clasp hands again over the<lb/>
new-born Occidental Republic." Only a subdued murmur<lb/>
responded to his clear, ringing tones; and then it<lb/>
seemed to him that the wharf was floating away into the<lb/>


<pb n="261"/>

night; but it was Nostromo, who was already pushing<lb/>
against a pile with one of the heavy sweeps. Decoud<lb/>
did not move; the effect was that of being launched into<lb/>
space. After a splash or two there was not a sound but<lb/>
the thud of Nostromo's feet leaping about the boat.<lb/>
He hoisted the big sail; a breath of wind fanned<lb/>
Decoud's cheek. Everything had vanished but the light<lb/>
of the lantern Captain Mitchell had hoisted upon the<lb/>
post at the end of the jetty to guide Nostromo out of<lb/>
the harbour.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The two men, unable to see each other, kept silent till<lb/>
the lighter, slipping before the fitful breeze, passed out<lb/>
between almost invisible headlands into the still deeper<lb/>
darkness of the gulf. For a time the lantern on the<lb/>
jetty shone after them. The wind failed, then fanned<lb/>
up again, but so faintly that the big, half-decked boat<lb/>
slipped along with no more noise than if she had been<lb/>
suspended in the air.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "We are out in the gulf now," said the calm voice of<lb/>
Nostromo. A moment after he added, "Se&ntilde;or Mitchell<lb/>
has lowered the light."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes," said Decoud; "nobody can find us now."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   A great recrudescence of obscurity embraced the<lb/>
boat. The sea in the gulf was as black as the clouds<lb/>
above. Nostromo, after striking a couple of matches<lb/>
to get a glimpse of the boat-compass he had with<lb/>
him in the lighter, steered by the feel of the wind on his<lb/>
cheek.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   It was a new experience for Decoud, this mysteriousness<lb/>
of the great waters spread out strangely smooth, as<lb/>
if their restlessness had been crushed by the weight of<lb/>
that dense night. The Placido was sleeping profoundly<lb/>
under its black poncho.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The main thing now for success was to get away from<lb/>
the coast and gain the middle of the gulf before day<lb/>


<pb n="262"/>

broke. The Isabels were somewhere at hand. "On<lb/>
your left as you look forward, se&ntilde;or," said Nostromo,<lb/>
suddenly. When his voice ceased, the enormous stillness,<lb/>
without light or sound, seemed to affect Decoud's<lb/>
senses like a powerful drug. He didn't even know at<lb/>
times whether he were asleep or awake. Like a man<lb/>
lost in slumber, he heard nothing, he saw nothing.<lb/>
Even his hand held before his face did not exist for his<lb/>
eyes. The change from the agitation, the passions and<lb/>
the dangers, from the sights and sounds of the shore,<lb/>
was so complete that it would have resembled death<lb/>
had it not been for the survival of his thoughts. In this<lb/>
foretaste of eternal peace they floated vivid and light,<lb/>
like unearthly clear dreams of earthly things that may<lb/>
haunt the souls freed by death from the misty atmosphere<lb/>
of regrets and hopes. Decoud shook himself,<lb/>
shuddered a bit, though the air that drifted past him<lb/>
was warm. He had the strangest sensation of his soul<lb/>
having just returned into his body from the circumambient<lb/>
darkness in which land, sea, sky, the mountains,<lb/>
and the rocks were as if they had not been.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo's voice was speaking, though he, at the<lb/>
tiller, was also as if he were not. "Have you been<lb/>
asleep, Don Martin? <hi rend="italic">Caramba!</hi> If it were possible I<lb/>
would think that I, too, have dozed off.   I have a<lb/>
strange notion somehow of having dreamt that there<lb/>
was a sound of blubbering, a sound a sorrowing man<lb/>
could make, somewhere near this boat. Something<lb/>
between a sigh and a sob."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Strange!" muttered Decoud, stretched upon the<lb/>
pile of treasure boxes covered by many tarpaulins.<lb/>
"Could it be that there is another boat near us in the<lb/>
gulf? We could not see it, you know."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo laughed a little at the absurdity of the idea.<lb/>
They dismissed it from their minds. The solitude<lb/>


<pb n="263"/>

could almost be felt. And when the breeze ceased, the<lb/>
blackness seemed to weigh upon Decoud like a stone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "This is overpowering," he muttered. "Do we<lb/>
move at all, Capataz?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Not so fast as a crawling beetle tangled in the<lb/>
grass," answered Nostromo, and his voice seemed<lb/>
deadened by the thick veil of obscurity that felt<lb/>
warm and hopeless all about them. There were long<lb/>
periods when he made no sound, invisible and inaudible<lb/>
as if he had mysteriously stepped out of the lighter.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   In the featureless night Nostromo was not even certain<lb/>
which way the lighter headed after the wind had<lb/>
completely died out. He peered for the islands. There<lb/>
was not a hint of them to be seen, as if they had sunk to<lb/>
the bottom of the gulf. He threw himself down by the<lb/>
side of Decoud at last, and whispered into his ear that<lb/>
if daylight caught them near the Sulaco shore through<lb/>
want of wind, it would be possible to sweep the lighter<lb/>
behind the cliff at the high end of the Great Isabel,<lb/>
where she would lie concealed. Decoud was surprised<lb/>
at the grimness of his anxiety. To him the removal<lb/>
of the treasure was a political move. It was necessary<lb/>
for several reasons that it should not fall into the hands<lb/>
of Montero, but here was a man who took another<lb/>
view of this enterprise. The Caballeros over there did<lb/>
not seem to have the slightest idea of what they had<lb/>
given him to do. Nostromo, as if affected by the gloom<lb/>
around, seemed nervously resentful. Decoud was<lb/>
surprised. The Capataz, indifferent to those dangers<lb/>
that seemed obvious to his companion, allowed himself<lb/>
to become scornfully exasperated by the deadly nature<lb/>
of the trust put, as a matter of course, into his hands.<lb/>
It was more dangerous, Nostromo said, with a laugh<lb/>
and a curse, than sending a man to get the treasure<lb/>
that people said was guarded by devils and ghosts in the<lb/>


<pb n="264"/>

deep ravines of Azuera. "Se&ntilde;or," he said, "we must<lb/>
catch the steamer at sea. We must keep out in the<lb/>
open looking for her till we have eaten and drunk all<lb/>
that has been put on board here. And if we miss her by<lb/>
some mischance, we must keep away from the land till<lb/>
we grow weak, and perhaps mad, and die, and drift<lb/>
dead, until one or another of the steamers of the<lb/>
Compania comes upon the boat with the two dead men<lb/>
who have saved the treasure. That, se&ntilde;or, is the only<lb/>
way to save it; for, don't you see? for us to come to the<lb/>
land anywhere in a hundred miles along this coast with<lb/>
this silver in our possession is to run the naked breast<lb/>
against the point of a knife. This thing has been given<lb/>
to me like a deadly disease. If men discover it I am<lb/>
dead, and you, too, se&ntilde;or, since you would come with<lb/>
me. There is enough silver to make a whole province<lb/>
rich, let alone a seaboard pueblo inhabited by thieves<lb/>
and vagabonds. Se&ntilde;or, they would think that heaven<lb/>
itself sent these riches into their hands, and would cut<lb/>
our throats without hesitation. I would trust no fair<lb/>
words from the best man around the shores of this wild<lb/>
gulf. Reflect that, even by giving up the treasure at<lb/>
the first demand, we would not be able to save our lives.<lb/>
Do you understand this, or must I explain?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "No, you needn't explain," said Decoud, a little<lb/>
listlessly. "I can see it well enough myself, that the<lb/>
possession of this treasure is very much like a deadly<lb/>
disease for men situated as we are. But it had to be removed<lb/>
from Sulaco, and you were the man for the task."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I was; but I cannot believe," said Nostromo, "that<lb/>
its loss would have impoverished Don Carlos Gould<lb/>
very much. There is more wealth in the mountain. I<lb/>
have heard it rolling down the shoots on quiet nights<lb/>
when I used to ride to Rincon to see a certain girl,<lb/>
after my work at the harbour was done. For years<lb/>


<pb n="265"/>

the rich rocks have been pouring down with a noise like<lb/>
thunder, and the miners say that there is enough at the<lb/>
heart of the mountain to thunder on for years and years<lb/>
to come. And yet, the day before yesterday, we have<lb/>
been fighting to save it from the mob, and to-night I<lb/>
am sent out with it into this darkness, where there is<lb/>
no wind to get away with; as if it were the last lot of<lb/>
silver on earth to get bread for the hungry with. Ha!<lb/>
ha! Well, I am going to make it the most famous and<lb/>
desperate affair of my life &mdash; wind or no wind. It shall<lb/>
be talked about when the little children are grown up<lb/>
and the grown men are old. Aha! the Monterists must<lb/>
not get hold of it, I am told, whatever happens to Nostromo<lb/>
the Capataz; and they shall not have it, I tell<lb/>
you, since it has been tied for safety round Nostromo's<lb/>
neck."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I see it," murmured Decoud. He saw, indeed, that<lb/>
his companion had his own peculiar view of this enterprise.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
  Nostromo interrupted his reflections upon the way<lb/>
men's qualities are made use of, without any fundamental<lb/>
knowledge of their nature, by the proposal<lb/>
they should slip the long oars out and sweep the<lb/>
lighter in the direction of the Isabels. It wouldn't<lb/>
do for daylight to reveal the treasure floating within a<lb/>
mile or so of the harbour entrance. The denser the<lb/>
darkness generally, the smarter were the puffs of wind<lb/>
on which he had reckoned to make his way; but tonight<lb/>
the gulf, under its poncho of clouds, remained<lb/>
breathless, as if dead rather than asleep.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Don Martin's soft hands suffered cruelly, tugging<lb/>
at the thick handle of the enormous oar. He stuck<lb/>
to it manfully, setting his teeth. He, too, was in the<lb/>
toils of an imaginative existence, and that strange work<lb/>
of pulling a lighter seemed to belong naturally to the<lb/>


<pb n="266"/>

inception of a new state, acquired an ideal meaning<lb/>
from his love for Antonia. For all their efforts, the<lb/>
heavily laden lighter hardly moved. Nostromo could<lb/>
be heard swearing to himself between the regular<lb/>
splashes of the sweeps. "We are making a crooked<lb/>
path," he muttered to himself. "I wish I could see the<lb/>
islands."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   In his unskilfulness Don Martin over-exerted himself.<lb/>
Now and then a sort of muscular faintness would run<lb/>
from the tips of his aching fingers through every fibre<lb/>
of his body, and pass off in a flush of heat. He had<lb/>
fought, talked, suffered mentally and physically,<lb/>
exerting his mind and body for the last forty-eight hours<lb/>
without intermission. He had had no rest, very little<lb/>
food, no pause in the stress of his thoughts and his<lb/>
feelings. Even his love for Antonia, whence he drew<lb/>
his strength and his inspiration, had reached the point<lb/>
of tragic tension during their hurried interview by Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute;'s bedside. And now, suddenly, he was thrown<lb/>
out of all this into a dark gulf, whose very gloom, silence,<lb/>
and breathless peace added a torment to the<lb/>
necessity for physical exertion. He imagined the<lb/>
lighter sinking to the bottom with an extraordinary<lb/>
shudder of delight. "I am on the verge of delirium,"<lb/>
he thought. He mastered the trembling of all his<lb/>
limbs, of his breast, the inward trembling of all his<lb/>
body exhausted of its nervous force.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Shall we rest, Capataz?" he proposed in a careless<lb/>
tone. "There are many hours of night yet before us."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "True. It is but a mile or so, I suppose. Rest your<lb/>
arms, se&ntilde;or, if that is what you mean. You will find<lb/>
no other sort of rest, I can promise you, since you let<lb/>
yourself be bound to this treasure whose loss would<lb/>
make no poor man poorer. No, se&ntilde;or; there is no rest<lb/>
till we find a north-bound steamer, or else some ship<lb/>


<pb n="267"/>

finds us drifting about stretched out dead upon the<lb/>
Englishman's silver. Or rather &mdash; no; <hi rend="italic">por Dios!</hi> I shall<lb/>
cut down the gunwale with the axe right to the water's<lb/>
edge before thirst and hunger rob me of my strength.<lb/>
By all the saints and devils I shall let the sea have the<lb/>
treasure rather than give it up to any stranger. Since<lb/>
it was the good pleasure of the Caballeros to send me off<lb/>
on such an errand, they shall learn I am just the man<lb/>
they take me for."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud lay on the silver boxes panting. All his<lb/>
active sensations and feelings from as far back as he<lb/>
could remember seemed to him the maddest of dreams.<lb/>
Even his passionate devotion to Antonia into which he<lb/>
had worked himself up out of the depths of his scepticism<lb/>
had lost all appearance of reality. For a moment<lb/>
he was the prey of an extremely languid but not unpleasant<lb/>
indifference.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I am sure they didn't mean you to take such a<lb/>
desperate view of this affair," he said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "What was it, then? A joke?" snarled the man, who<lb/>
on the pay-sheets of the O.S.N. Company's establishment<lb/>
in Sulaco was described as "Foreman of the<lb/>
wharf" against the figure of his wages. "Was it for a<lb/>
joke they woke me up from my sleep after two days of<lb/>
street fighting to make me stake my life upon a bad<lb/>
card? Everybody knows, too, that I am not a lucky<lb/>
gambler."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes, everybody knows of your good luck with<lb/>
women, Capataz," Decoud propitiated his companion<lb/>
in a weary drawl.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Look here, se&ntilde;or," Nostromo went on. "I never<lb/>
even remonstrated about this affair. Directly I heard<lb/>
what was wanted I saw what a desperate affair it must<lb/>
be, and I made up my mind to see it out. Every<lb/>
minute was of importance. I had to wait for you first.<lb/>


<pb n="268"/>

Then, when we arrived at the Italia Una, old Giorgio<lb/>
shouted to me to go for the English doctor. Later on,<lb/>
that poor dying woman wanted to see me, as you know.<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or, I was reluctant to go. I felt already this cursed<lb/>
silver growing heavy upon my back, and I was afraid<lb/>
that, knowing herself to be dying, she would ask me to<lb/>
ride off again for a priest. Father Corbel&agrave;n, who is<lb/>
fearless, would have come at a word; but Father Corbel&agrave;n<lb/>
is far away, safe with the band of Hernandez,<lb/>
and the populace, that would have liked to<lb/>
tear him to pieces, are much incensed against the<lb/>
priests. Not a single fat padre would have consented<lb/>
to put his head out of his hiding-place to-night to save a<lb/>
Christian soul, except, perhaps, under my protection.<lb/>
That was in her mind. I pretended I did not believe<lb/>
she was going to die. Se&ntilde;or, I refused to fetch a priest<lb/>
for a dying woman . . ."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud was heard to stir.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You did, Capataz!" he exclaimed. His tone<lb/>
changed. "Well, you know &mdash; it was rather fine."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You do not believe in priests, Don Martin? Neither<lb/>
do I. What was the use of wasting time? But she &mdash;<lb/>
she believes in them. The thing sticks in my throat.<lb/>
She may be dead already, and here we are floating helpless<lb/>
with no wind at all. Curse on all superstition.<lb/>
She died thinking I deprived her of Paradise, I suppose.<lb/>
It shall be the most desperate affair of my life."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud remained lost in reflection. He tried to<lb/>
analyze the sensations awaked by what he had been<lb/>
told. The voice of the Capataz was heard again:<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Now, Don Martin, let us take up the sweeps and try<lb/>
to find the Isabels. It is either that or sinking the<lb/>
lighter if the day overtakes us. We must not forget<lb/>
that the steamer from Esmeralda with the soldiers may<lb/>
be coming along. We will pull straight on now. I have<lb/>


<pb n="269"/>

discovered a bit of a candle here, and we must take the<lb/>
risk of a small light to make a course by the boat compass.<lb/>
There is not enough wind to blow it out &mdash; may<lb/>
the curse of Heaven fall upon this blind gulf!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   A small flame appeared burning quite straight. It<lb/>
showed fragmentarily the stout ribs and planking in the<lb/>
hollow, empty part of the lighter. Decoud could see<lb/>
Nostromo standing up to pull. He saw him as high as<lb/>
the red sash on his waist, with a gleam of a white-<lb/>
handled revolver and the wooden haft of a long knife<lb/>
protruding on his left side. Decoud nerved himself for<lb/>
the effort of rowing. Certainly there was not enough<lb/>
wind to blow the candle out, but its flame swayed a<lb/>
little to the slow movement of the heavy boat. It was<lb/>
so big that with their utmost efforts they could not<lb/>
move it quicker than about a mile an hour. This was<lb/>
sufficient, however, to sweep them amongst the Isabels<lb/>
long before daylight came. There was a good six hours<lb/>
of darkness before them, and the distance from the<lb/>
harbour to the Great Isabel did not exceed two miles.<lb/>
Decoud put this heavy toil to the account of the<lb/>
Capataz's impatience. Sometimes they paused, and<lb/>
then strained their ears to hear the boat from Esmeralda.<lb/>
In this perfect quietness a steamer moving<lb/>
would have been heard from far off. As to seeing anything<lb/>
it was out of the question. They could not see<lb/>
each other. Even the lighter's sail, which remained<lb/>
set, was invisible. Very often they rested.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Caramba!" said Nostromo, suddenly, during one of<lb/>
those intervals when they lolled idly against the heavy<lb/>
handles of the sweeps. "What is it? Are you distressed,<lb/>
Don Martin?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud assured him that he was not distressed in the<lb/>
least. Nostromo for a time kept perfectly still, and<lb/>
then in a whisper invited Martin to come aft.<lb/>


<pb n="270"/>

</p>

<p>   With his lips touching Decoud's ear he declared his<lb/>
belief that there was somebody else besides themselves<lb/>
upon the lighter. Twice now he had heard the sound of<lb/>
stifled sobbing.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Se&ntilde;or," he whispered with awed wonder, "I am<lb/>
certain that there is somebody weeping in this lighter."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud had heard nothing. He expressed his incredulity.<lb/>
However, it was easy to ascertain the truth<lb/>
of the matter.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "It is most amazing," muttered Nostromo. "Could<lb/>
anybody have concealed himself on board while the<lb/>
lighter was lying alongside the wharf?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "And you say it was like sobbing?" asked Decoud,<lb/>
lowering his voice, too. "If he is weeping, whoever he<lb/>
is he cannot be very dangerous."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Clambering over the precious pile in the middle, they<lb/>
crouched low on the foreside of the mast and groped<lb/>
under the half-deck. Right forward, in the narrowest<lb/>
part, their hands came upon the limbs of a man, who<lb/>
remained as silent as death. Too startled themselves<lb/>
to make a sound, they dragged him aft by one arm and<lb/>
the collar of his coat. He was limp &mdash; lifeless.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The light of the bit of candle fell upon a round,<lb/>
hook-nosed face with black moustaches and little side-<lb/>
whiskers. He was extremely dirty. A greasy growth of<lb/>
beard was sprouting on the shaven parts of the cheeks.<lb/>
The thick lips were slightly parted, but the eyes remained<lb/>
closed. Decoud, to his immense astonishment,<lb/>
recognized Se&ntilde;or Hirsch, the hide merchant from<lb/>
Esmeralda. Nostromo, too, had recognized him. And<lb/>
they gazed at each other across the body, lying with its<lb/>
naked feet higher than its head, in an absurd pretence of<lb/>
sleep, faintness, or death.<lb/>
</p>


</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="8" id="d25">
<head>CHAPTER EIGHT</head>

<pb n="271"/>


<p>   FOR a moment, before this extraordinary find, they<lb/>
forgot their own concerns and sensations. Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Hirsch's sensations as he lay there must have been those<lb/>
of extreme terror. For a long time he refused to give a<lb/>
sign of life, till at last Decoud's objurgations, and, perhaps<lb/>
more, Nostromo's impatient suggestion that he<lb/>
should be thrown overboard, as he seemed to be dead,<lb/>
induced him to raise one eyelid first, and then the other.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   It appeared that he had never found a safe opportunity<lb/>
to leave Sulaco. He lodged with Anzani, the<lb/>
universal storekeeper, on the Plaza Mayor. But when<lb/>
the riot broke out he had made his escape from his<lb/>
host's house before daylight, and in such a hurry that<lb/>
he had forgotten to put on his shoes. He had run out<lb/>
impulsively in his socks, and with his hat in his hand,<lb/>
into the garden of Anzani's house. Fear gave him the<lb/>
necessary agility to climb over several low walls, and<lb/>
afterwards he blundered into the overgrown cloisters of<lb/>
the ruined Franciscan convent in one of the by-streets.<lb/>
He forced himself into the midst of matted bushes with<lb/>
the recklessness of desperation, and this accounted for<lb/>
his scratched body and his torn clothing. He lay hidden<lb/>
there all day, his tongue cleaving to the roof of his<lb/>
mouth with all the intensity of thirst engendered by<lb/>
heat and fear. Three times different bands of men invaded<lb/>
the place with shouts and imprecations, looking<lb/>
for Father Corbel&agrave;n; but towards the evening, still lying<lb/>
on his face in the bushes, he thought he would die from<lb/>
the fear of silence. He was not very clear as to what<lb/>




<pb n="272"/>

had induced him to leave the place, but evidently he had<lb/>
got out and slunk successfully out of town along the<lb/>
deserted back lanes. He wandered in the darkness near<lb/>
the railway, so maddened by apprehension that he dared<lb/>
not even approach the fires of the pickets of Italian<lb/>
workmen guarding the line. He had a vague idea<lb/>
evidently of finding refuge in the railway yards, but the<lb/>
dogs rushed upon him, barking; men began to shout;<lb/>
a shot was fired at random. He fled away from the<lb/>
gates. By the merest accident, as it happened, he<lb/>
took the direction of the O.S.N. Company's offices.<lb/>
Twice he stumbled upon the bodies of men killed during<lb/>
the day. But everything living frightened him much<lb/>
more. He crouched, crept, crawled, made dashes,<lb/>
guided by a sort of animal instinct, keeping away from<lb/>
every light and from every sound of voices. His idea<lb/>
was to throw himself at the feet of Captain Mitchell<lb/>
and beg for shelter in the Company's offices. It was<lb/>
all dark there as he approached on his hands and knees,<lb/>
but suddenly someone on guard challenged loudly,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"Quien vive?"</hi> There were more dead men lying about,<lb/>
and he flattened himself down at once by the side of a<lb/>
cold corpse. He heard a voice saying, "Here is one of<lb/>
those wounded rascals crawling about. Shall I go and<lb/>
finish him?" And another voice objected that it was<lb/>
not safe to go out without a lantern upon such an errand;<lb/>
perhaps it was only some negro Liberal looking<lb/>
for a chance to stick a knife into the stomach of an<lb/>
honest man. Hirsch didn't stay to hear any more, but<lb/>
crawling away to the end of the wharf, hid himself<lb/>
amongst a lot of empty casks. After a while some<lb/>
people came along, talking, and with glowing cigarettes.<lb/>
He did not stop to ask himself whether they would<lb/>
be likely to do him any harm, but bolted incontinently<lb/>
along the jetty, saw a lighter lying moored at the end,<lb/>


<pb n="273"/>

and threw himself into it. In his desire to find cover<lb/>
he crept right forward under the half-deck, and he had<lb/>
remained there more dead than alive, suffering agonies<lb/>
of hunger and thirst, and almost fainting with terror,<lb/>
when he heard numerous footsteps and the voices of<lb/>
the Europeans who came in a body escorting the wagon-<lb/>
load of treasure, pushed along the rails by a squad of<lb/>
Cargadores. He understood perfectly what was being<lb/>
done from the talk, but did not disclose his presence<lb/>
from the fear that he would not be allowed to remain.<lb/>
His only idea at the time, overpowering and masterful,<lb/>
was to get away from this terrible Sulaco. And now<lb/>
he regretted it very much. He had heard Nostromo<lb/>
talk to Decoud, and wished himself back on shore.<lb/>
He did not desire to be involved in any desperate affair<lb/>
&mdash; in a situation where one could not run away. The<lb/>
involuntary groans of his anguished spirit had betrayed<lb/>
him to the sharp ears of the Capataz.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   They had propped him up in a sitting posture against<lb/>
the side of the lighter, and he went on with the moaning<lb/>
account of his adventures till his voice broke, his head<lb/>
fell forward. "Water," he whispered, with difficulty.<lb/>
Decoud held one of the cans to his lips. He revived<lb/>
after an extraordinarily short time, and scrambled up to<lb/>
his feet wildly. Nostromo, in an angry and threatening<lb/>
voice, ordered him forward. Hirsch was one of those<lb/>
men whom fear lashes like a whip, and he must have had<lb/>
an appalling idea of the Capataz's ferocity. He displayed<lb/>
an extraordinary agility in disappearing forward<lb/>
into the darkness. They heard him getting over the<lb/>
tarpaulin; then there was the sound of a heavy fall,<lb/>
followed by a weary sigh. Afterwards all was still in<lb/>
the fore-part of the lighter, as though he had killed himself<lb/>
in his headlong tumble. Nostromo shouted in a<lb/>
menacing voice &mdash;<lb/>


<pb n="274"/>

</p>

<p>   "Lie still there! Do not move a limb. If I hear<lb/>
as much as a loud breath from you I shall come over<lb/>
there and put a bullet through your head."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The mere presence of a coward, however passive,<lb/>
brings an element of treachery into a dangerous situation.<lb/>
Nostromo's nervous impatience passed into<lb/>
gloomy thoughtfulness. Decoud, in an undertone, as<lb/>
if speaking to himself, remarked that, after all, this<lb/>
bizarre event made no great difference. He could<lb/>
not conceive what harm the man could do. At most<lb/>
he would be in the way, like an inanimate and useless<lb/>
object &mdash; like a block of wood, for instance.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I would think twice before getting rid of a piece of<lb/>
wood," said Nostromo, calmly. "Something may<lb/>
happen unexpectedly where you could make use of it.<lb/>
But in an affair like ours a man like this ought to be<lb/>
thrown overboard. Even if he were as brave as a lion<lb/>
we would not want him here. We are not running<lb/>
away for our lives. Se&ntilde;or, there is no harm in a brave<lb/>
man trying to save himself with ingenuity and courage;<lb/>
but you have heard his tale, Don Martin. His being<lb/>
here is a miracle of fear &mdash;" Nostromo paused.<lb/>
"There is no room for fear in this lighter," he added<lb/>
through his teeth.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud had no answer to make. It was not a position<lb/>
for argument, for a display of scruples or feelings.<lb/>
There were a thousand ways in which a panic-stricken<lb/>
man could make himself dangerous. It was evident<lb/>
that Hirsch could not be spoken to, reasoned with, or<lb/>
persuaded into a rational line of conduct. The story<lb/>
of his own escape demonstrated that clearly enough.<lb/>
Decoud thought that it was a thousand pities the<lb/>
wretch had not died of fright. Nature, who had made<lb/>
him what he was, seemed to have calculated cruelly<lb/>
how much he could bear in the way of atrocious anguish<lb/>


<pb n="275"/>

without actually expiring. Some compassion was due<lb/>
to so much terror. Decoud, though imaginative enough<lb/>
for sympathy, resolved not to interfere with any action<lb/>
that Nostromo would take. But Nostromo did nothing.<lb/>
And the fate of Se&ntilde;or Hirsch remained suspended<lb/>
in the darkness of the gulf at the mercy of<lb/>
events which could not be foreseen.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The Capataz, extending his hand, put out the candle<lb/>
suddenly. It was to Decoud as if his companion had<lb/>
destroyed, by a single touch, the world of affairs, of<lb/>
loves, of revolution, where his complacent superiority<lb/>
analyzed fearlessly all motives and all passions, including<lb/>
his own.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He gasped a little. Decoud was affected by the<lb/>
novelty of his position. Intellectually self-confident,<lb/>
he suffered from being deprived of the only weapon he<lb/>
could use with effect. No intelligence could penetrate<lb/>
the darkness of the Placid Gulf. There remained only<lb/>
one thing he was certain of, and that was the overweening<lb/>
vanity of his companion. It was direct, uncomplicated,<lb/>
na&iuml;ve, and effectual. Decoud, who had<lb/>
been making use of him, had tried to understand his<lb/>
man thoroughly. He had discovered a complete<lb/>
singleness of motive behind the varied manifestations<lb/>
of a consistent character. This was why the man remained<lb/>
so astonishingly simple in the jealous greatness<lb/>
of his conceit. And now there was a complication. It<lb/>
was evident that he resented having been given a task<lb/>
in which there were so many chances of failure. "I<lb/>
wonder," thought Decoud, "how he would behave if I<lb/>
were not here."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He heard Nostromo mutter again, "No! there is no<lb/>
room for fear on this lighter. Courage itself does not<lb/>
seem good enough. I have a good eye and a steady<lb/>
hand; no man can say he ever saw me tired or uncertain<lb/>


<pb n="276"/>

what to do; but <hi rend="italic">por Dios</hi>, Don Martin, I have been<lb/>
sent out into this black calm on a business where neither<lb/>
a good eye, nor a steady hand, nor judgment are any<lb/>
use. . . ." He swore a string of oaths in Spanish<lb/>
and Italian under his breath. "Nothing but sheer<lb/>
desperation will do for this affair."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   These words were in strange contrast to the prevailing<lb/>
peace &mdash; to this almost solid stillness of the gulf.<lb/>
A shower fell with an abrupt whispering sound all<lb/>
round the boat, and Decoud took off his hat, and, letting<lb/>
his head get wet, felt greatly refreshed. Presently a<lb/>
steady little draught of air caressed his cheek. The<lb/>
lighter began to move, but the shower distanced it. The<lb/>
drops ceased to fall upon his head and hands, the whispering<lb/>
died out in the distance. Nostromo emitted a<lb/>
grunt of satisfaction, and grasping the tiller, chirruped<lb/>
softly, as sailors do, to encourage the wind. Never for<lb/>
the last three days had Decoud felt less the need for<lb/>
what the Capataz would call desperation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I fancy I hear another shower on the water," he observed<lb/>
in a tone of quiet content. "I hope it will catch<lb/>
us up."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo ceased chirruping at once. "You hear<lb/>
another shower?" he said, doubtfully. A sort of thinning<lb/>
of the darkness seemed to have taken place, and<lb/>
Decoud could see now the outline of his companion's<lb/>
figure, and even the sail came out of the night like a<lb/>
square block of dense snow.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The sound which Decoud had detected came along<lb/>
the water harshly. Nostromo recognized that noise<lb/>
partaking of a hiss and a rustle which spreads out on all<lb/>
sides of a steamer making her way through a smooth<lb/>
water on a quiet night. It could be nothing else but<lb/>
the captured transport with troops from Esmeralda.<lb/>
She carried no lights. The noise of her steaming, growing<lb/>


<pb n="277"/>

louder every minute, would stop at times altogether,<lb/>
and then begin again abruptly, and sound startlingly<lb/>
nearer; as if that invisible vessel, whose position could<lb/>
not be precisely guessed, were making straight for the<lb/>
lighter. Meantime, that last kept on sailing slowly and<lb/>
noiselessly before a breeze so faint that it was only by<lb/>
leaning over the side and feeling the water slip through<lb/>
his fingers that Decoud convinced himself they were<lb/>
moving at all. His drowsy feeling had departed. He<lb/>
was glad to know that the lighter was moving. After<lb/>
so much stillness the noise of the steamer seemed uproarious<lb/>
and distracting. There was a weirdness in not<lb/>
being able to see her. Suddenly all was still. She had<lb/>
stopped, but so close to them that the steam, blowing off,<lb/>
sent its rumbling vibration right over their heads.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "They are trying to make out where they are," said<lb/>
Decoud in a whisper. Again he leaned over and put his<lb/>
fingers into the water. "We are moving quite smartly,"<lb/>
he informed Nostromo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "We seem to be crossing her bows," said the Capataz<lb/>
in a cautious tone. "But this is a blind game with<lb/>
death. Moving on is of no use. We mustn't be seen<lb/>
or heard."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   His whisper was hoarse with excitement. Of all his<lb/>
face there was nothing visible but a gleam of white eye-<lb/>
balls. His fingers gripped Decoud's shoulder. "That<lb/>
is the only way to save this treasure from this steamer<lb/>
full of soldiers.  Any other would have carried lights.<lb/>
But you observe there is not a gleam to show us where<lb/>
she is."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud stood as if paralyzed; only his thoughts were<lb/>
wildly active. In the space of a second he remembered<lb/>
the desolate glance of Antonia as he left her at the bedside<lb/>
of her father in the gloomy house of Avellanos, with<lb/>
shuttered windows, but all the doors standing open, and<lb/>


<pb n="278"/>

deserted by all the servants except an old negro at the<lb/>
gate. He remembered the Casa Gould on his last visit,<lb/>
the arguments, the tones of his voice, the impenetrable<lb/>
attitude of Charles, Mrs. Gould's face so blanched with<lb/>
anxiety and fatigue that her eyes seemed to have<lb/>
changed colour, appearing nearly black by contrast.<lb/>
Even whole sentences of the proclamation which he<lb/>
meant to make Barrios issue from his headquarters at<lb/>
Cayta as soon as he got there passed through his mind;<lb/>
the very germ of the new State, the Separationist proclamation<lb/>
which he had tried before he left to read hurriedly<lb/>
to Don Jos&eacute;, stretched out on his bed under the<lb/>
fixed gaze of his daughter. God knows whether the old<lb/>
statesman had understood it; he was unable to speak,<lb/>
but he had certainly lifted his arm off the coverlet; his<lb/>
hand had moved as if to make the sign of the cross in the<lb/>
air, a gesture of blessing, of consent. Decoud had that<lb/>
very draft in his pocket, written in pencil on several<lb/>
loose sheets of paper, with the heavily-printed heading,<lb/>
"Administration of the San Tom&eacute; Silver Mine. Sulaco.<lb/>
Republic of Costaguana." He had written it furiously,<lb/>
snatching page after page on Charles Gould's table.<lb/>
Mrs. Gould had looked several times over his shoulder<lb/>
as he wrote; but the Se&ntilde;or Administrador, standing<lb/>
straddle-legged, would not even glance at it when it was<lb/>
finished. He had waved it away firmly. It must have<lb/>
been scorn, and not caution, since he never made a<lb/>
remark about the use of the Administration's paper<lb/>
for such a compromising document. And that showed<lb/>
his disdain, the true English disdain of common prudence,<lb/>
as if everything outside the range of their own<lb/>
thoughts and feelings were unworthy of serious recognition.<lb/>
Decoud had the time in a second or two to become<lb/>
furiously angry with Charles Gould, and even resentful<lb/>
against Mrs. Gould, in whose care, tacitly it<lb/>


<pb n="279"/>

is true, he had left the safety of Antonia. Better<lb/>
perish a thousand times than owe your preservation to<lb/>
such people, he exclaimed mentally. The grip of<lb/>
Nostromo's fingers never removed from his shoulder,<lb/>
tightening fiercely, recalled him to himself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "The darkness is our friend," the Capataz murmured<lb/>
into his ear. "I am going to lower the sail, and trust<lb/>
our escape to this black gulf. No eyes could make us<lb/>
out lying silent with a naked mast. I will do it now, before<lb/>
this steamer closes still more upon us. The faint<lb/>
creak of a block would betray us and the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
treasure into the hands of those thieves."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He moved about as warily as a cat. Decoud heard<lb/>
no sound; and it was only by the disappearance of the<lb/>
square blotch of darkness that he knew the yard had<lb/>
come down, lowered as carefully as if it had been made<lb/>
of glass. Next moment he heard Nostromo's quiet<lb/>
breathing by his side.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You had better not move at all from where you are,<lb/>
Don Martin," advised the Capataz, earnestly. "You<lb/>
might stumble or displace something which would make<lb/>
a noise. The sweeps and the punting poles are lying<lb/>
about. Move not for your life. <hi rend="italic">Por Dios</hi>, Don Martin,"<lb/>
he went on in a keen but friendly whisper, "I am so<lb/>
desperate that if I didn't know your worship to be a<lb/>
man of courage, capable of standing stock still whatever<lb/>
happens, I would drive my knife into your heart."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   A deathlike stillness surrounded the lighter. It was<lb/>
difficult to believe that there was near a steamer full of<lb/>
men with many pairs of eyes peering from her bridge for<lb/>
some hint of land in the night. Her steam had ceased<lb/>
blowing off, and she remained stopped too far off apparently<lb/>
for any other sound to reach the lighter.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Perhaps you would, Capataz," Decoud began in a<lb/>
whisper. "However, you need not trouble. There<lb/>


<pb n="280"/>

are other things than the fear of your knife to keep my<lb/>
heart steady. It shall not betray you. Only, have you<lb/>
forgotten &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I spoke to you openly as to a man as desperate as<lb/>
myself," explained the Capataz. "The silver must be<lb/>
saved from the Monterists. I told Captain Mitchell<lb/>
three times that I preferred to go alone. I told Don<lb/>
Carlos Gould, too. It was in the Casa Gould. They<lb/>
had sent for me. The ladies were there; and when I<lb/>
tried to explain why I did not wish to have you with me,<lb/>
they promised me, both of them, great rewards for your<lb/>
safety. A strange way to talk to a man you are sending<lb/>
out to an almost certain death. Those gentlefolk do not<lb/>
seem to have sense enough to understand what they<lb/>
are giving one to do. I told them I could do nothing<lb/>
for you. You would have been safer with the bandit<lb/>
Hernandez. It would have been possible to ride out of<lb/>
the town with no greater risk than a chance shot sent<lb/>
after you in the dark. But it was as if they had been<lb/>
deaf. I had to promise I would wait for you under the<lb/>
harbour gate. I did wait. And now because you are a<lb/>
brave man you are as safe as the silver. Neither more<lb/>
nor less."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   At that moment, as if by way of comment upon Nostromo's<lb/>
words, the invisible steamer went ahead at half<lb/>
speed only, as could be judged by the leisurely beat of<lb/>
her propeller. The sound shifted its place markedly,<lb/>
but without coming nearer. It even grew a little more<lb/>
distant right abeam of the lighter, and then ceased<lb/>
again.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "They are trying for a sight of the Isabels," muttered<lb/>
Nostromo, "in order to make for the harbour in a<lb/>
straight line and seize the Custom House with the<lb/>
treasure in it. Have you ever seen the Commandant of<lb/>
Esmeralda, Sotillo? A handsome fellow, with a soft<lb/>


<pb n="281"/>

voice. When I first came here I used to see him in the<lb/>
Calle talking to the se&ntilde;oritas at the windows of the<lb/>
houses, and showing his white teeth all the time. But<lb/>
one of my Cargadores, who had been a soldier, told me<lb/>
that he had once ordered a man to be flayed alive in the<lb/>
remote Campo, where he was sent recruiting amongst<lb/>
the people of the Estancias. It has never entered his<lb/>
head that the Compania had a man capable of baffling<lb/>
his game."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The murmuring loquacity of the Capataz disturbed<lb/>
Decoud like a hint of weakness. And yet, talkative<lb/>
resolution may be as genuine as grim silence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Sotillo is not baffled so far," he said. "Have you<lb/>
forgotten that crazy man forward?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo had not forgotten Se&ntilde;or Hirsch. He reproached<lb/>
himself bitterly for not having visited the<lb/>
lighter carefully before leaving the wharf. He reproached<lb/>
himself for not having stabbed and flung<lb/>
Hirsch overboard at the very moment of discovery without<lb/>
even looking at his face. That would have been<lb/>
consistent with the desperate character of the affair.<lb/>
Whatever happened, Sotillo <hi rend="italic">was</hi> already baffled. Even<lb/>
if that wretch, now as silent as death, did anything to<lb/>
betray the nearness of the lighter, Sotillo &mdash; if Sotillo<lb/>
it was in command of the troops on board &mdash; would be<lb/>
still baffled of his plunder.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I have an axe in my hand," Nostromo whispered,<lb/>
wrathfully, "that in three strokes would cut through<lb/>
the side down to the water's edge. Moreover, each<lb/>
lighter has a plug in the stern, and I know exactly where<lb/>
it is. I feel it under the sole of my foot."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud recognized the ring of genuine determination<lb/>
in the nervous murmurs, the vindictive excitement of<lb/>
the famous Capataz. Before the steamer, guided by a<lb/>
shriek or two (for there could be no more than that,<lb/>


<pb n="282"/>

Nostromo said, gnashing his teeth audibly), could find<lb/>
the lighter there would be plenty of time to sink this<lb/>
treasure tied up round his neck.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The last words he hissed into Decoud's ear. Decoud<lb/>
said nothing.  He was perfectly convinced.  The<lb/>
usual characteristic quietness of the man was gone.<lb/>
It was not equal to the situation as he conceived it.<lb/>
Something deeper, something unsuspected by everyone,<lb/>
had come to the surface. Decoud, with careful movements,<lb/>
slipped off his overcoat and divested himself of<lb/>
his boots; he did not consider himself bound in honour<lb/>
to sink with the treasure. His object was to get down<lb/>
to Barrios, in Cayta, as the Capataz knew very well; and<lb/>
he, too, meant, in his own way, to put into that attempt<lb/>
all the desperation of which he was capable. Nostromo<lb/>
muttered, "True, true! You are a politician, se&ntilde;or.<lb/>
Rejoin the army, and start another revolution." He<lb/>
pointed out, however, that there was a little boat belonging<lb/>
to every lighter fit to carry two men, if not more.<lb/>
Theirs was towing behind.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Of that Decoud had not been aware. Of course, it<lb/>
was too dark to see, and it was only when Nostromo<lb/>
put his hand upon its painter fastened to a cleat in the<lb/>
stern that he experienced a full measure of relief. The<lb/>
prospect of finding himself in the water and swimming,<lb/>
overwhelmed by ignorance and darkness, probably in a<lb/>
circle, till he sank from exhaustion, was revolting. The<lb/>
barren and cruel futility of such an end intimidated his<lb/>
affectation of careless pessimism. In comparison to it,<lb/>
the chance of being left floating in a boat, exposed<lb/>
to thirst, hunger, discovery, imprisonment, execution,<lb/>
presented itself with an aspect of amenity worth securing<lb/>
even at the cost of some self-contempt. He did not<lb/>
accept Nostromo's proposal that he should get into the<lb/>
boat at once. "Something sudden may overwhelm us,<lb/>


<pb n="283"/>

se&ntilde;or," the Capataz remarked promising faithfully, at<lb/>
the same time, to let go the painter at the moment<lb/>
when the necessity became manifest.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   But Decoud assured him lightly that he did not mean<lb/>
to take to the boat till the very last moment, and that<lb/>
then he meant the Capataz to come along, too. The<lb/>
darkness of the gulf was no longer for him the end of all<lb/>
things. It was part of a living world since, pervading<lb/>
it, failure and death could be felt at your elbow. And<lb/>
at the same time it was a shelter. He exulted in its<lb/>
impenetrable obscurity. "Like a wall, like a wall," he<lb/>
muttered to himself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The only thing which checked his confidence was the<lb/>
thought of Se&ntilde;or Hirsch. Not to have bound and<lb/>
gagged him seemed to Decoud now the height of improvident<lb/>
folly. As long as the miserable creature had<lb/>
the power to raise a yell he was a constant danger. His<lb/>
abject terror was mute now, but there was no saying<lb/>
from what cause it might suddenly find vent in shrieks.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   This very madness of fear which both Decoud and<lb/>
Nostromo had seen in the wild and irrational glances,<lb/>
and in the continuous twitchings of his mouth, protected<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or Hirsch from the cruel necessities of this desperate<lb/>
affair. The moment of silencing him for ever had<lb/>
passed. As Nostromo remarked, in answer to Decoud's<lb/>
regrets, it was too late! It could not be done without<lb/>
noise, especially in the ignorance of the man's exact<lb/>
position. Wherever he had elected to crouch and<lb/>
tremble, it was too hazardous to go near him. He<lb/>
would begin probably to yell for mercy. It was much<lb/>
better to leave him quite alone since he was keeping so<lb/>
still. But to trust to his silence became every moment<lb/>
a greater strain upon Decoud's composure.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I wish, Capataz, you had not let the right moment<lb/>
pass," he murmured.<lb/>


<pb n="284"/>

</p>

<p>   "What! To silence him for ever? I thought it good<lb/>
to hear first how he came to be here. It was too<lb/>
strange. Who could imagine that it was all an accident?<lb/>
Afterwards, se&ntilde;or, when I saw you giving him water to<lb/>
drink, I could not do it. Not after I had seen you<lb/>
holding up the can to his lips as though he were your<lb/>
brother. Se&ntilde;or, that sort of necessity must not be<lb/>
thought of too long. And yet it would have been no<lb/>
cruelty to take away from him his wretched life. It is<lb/>
nothing but fear. Your compassion saved him then,<lb/>
Don Martin, and now it is too late. It couldn't be<lb/>
done without noise."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   In the steamer they were keeping a perfect silence,<lb/>
and the stillness was so profound that Decoud felt as if<lb/>
the slightest sound conceivable must travel unchecked<lb/>
and audible to the end of the world. What if Hirsch<lb/>
coughed or sneezed? To feel himself at the mercy of<lb/>
such an idiotic contingency was too exasperating to be<lb/>
looked upon with irony. Nostromo, too, seemed to be<lb/>
getting restless. Was it possible, he asked himself, that<lb/>
the steamer, finding the night too dark altogether, intended<lb/>
to remain stopped where she was till daylight?<lb/>
He began to think that this, after all, was the real danger.<lb/>
He was afraid that the darkness, which was his<lb/>
protection, would, in the end, cause his undoing.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo, as Nostromo had surmised, was in command<lb/>
on board the transport. The events of the last forty-<lb/>
eight hours in Sulaco were not known to him; neither<lb/>
was he aware that the telegraphist in Esmeralda had<lb/>
managed to warn his colleague in Sulaco. Like a good<lb/>
many officers of the troops garrisoning the province,<lb/>
Sotillo had been influenced in his adoption of the Ribierist<lb/>
cause by the belief that it had the enormous<lb/>
wealth of the Gould Concession on its side. He had<lb/>
been one of the frequenters of the Casa Gould, where he<lb/>


<pb n="285"/>

had aired his Blanco convictions and his ardour for reform<lb/>
before Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos, casting frank, honest<lb/>
glances towards Mrs. Gould and Antonia the while. He<lb/>
was known to belong to a good family persecuted and<lb/>
impoverished during the tyranny of Guzman Bento.<lb/>
The opinions he expressed appeared eminently natural<lb/>
and proper in a man of his parentage and antecedents.<lb/>
And he was not a deceiver; it was perfectly natural for<lb/>
him to express elevated sentiments while his whole<lb/>
faculties were taken up with what seemed then a solid<lb/>
and practical notion &mdash; the notion that the husband of<lb/>
Antonia Avellanos would be, naturally, the intimate<lb/>
friend of the Gould Concession. He even pointed this<lb/>
out to Anzani once, when negotiating the sixth or<lb/>
seventh small loan in the gloomy, damp apartment<lb/>
with enormous iron bars, behind the principal shop in<lb/>
the whole row under the Arcades. He hinted to the<lb/>
universal shopkeeper at the excellent terms he was on<lb/>
with the emancipated se&ntilde;orita, who was like a sister<lb/>
to the Englishwoman. He would advance one leg and<lb/>
put his arms akimbo, posing for Anzani's inspection, and<lb/>
fixing him with a haughty stare.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Look, miserable shopkeeper! How can a man like<lb/>
me fail with any woman, let alone an emancipated girl<lb/>
living in scandalous freedom?" he seemed to say.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   His manner in the Casa Gould was, of course, very<lb/>
different &mdash; devoid of all truculence, and even slightly<lb/>
mournful. Like most of his countrymen, he was carried<lb/>
away by the sound of fine words, especially if uttered<lb/>
by himself. He had no convictions of any sort upon<lb/>
anything except as to the irresistible power of his<lb/>
personal advantages. But that was so firm that even<lb/>
Decoud's appearance in Sulaco, and his intimacy with<lb/>
the Goulds and the Avellanos, did not disquiet him.<lb/>
On the contrary, he tried to make friends with that<lb/>


<pb n="286"/>

rich Costaguanero from Europe in the hope of borrowing<lb/>
a large sum by-and-by. The only guiding motive<lb/>
of his life was to get money for the satisfaction of his<lb/>
expensive tastes, which he indulged recklessly, having<lb/>
no self-control.  He imagined himself a master of<lb/>
intrigue, but his corruption was as simple as an animal<lb/>
instinct. At times, in solitude, he had his moments of<lb/>
ferocity, and also on such occasions as, for instance,<lb/>
when alone in a room with Anzani trying to get a loan.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He had talked himself into the command of the<lb/>
Esmeralda garrison. That small seaport had its importance<lb/>
as the station of the main submarine cable connecting<lb/>
the Occidental Provinces with the outer world,<lb/>
and the junction with it of the Sulaco branch. Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute; Avellanos proposed him, and Barrios, with a rude<lb/>
and jeering guffaw, had said, "Oh, let Sotillo go. He is<lb/>
a very good man to keep guard over the cable, and the<lb/>
ladies of Esmeralda ought to have their turn." Barrios,<lb/>
an indubitably brave man, had no great opinion of Sotillo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
  It was through the Esmeralda cable alone that the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mine could be kept in constant touch with<lb/>
the great financier, whose tacit approval made the<lb/>
strength of the Ribierist movement. This movement<lb/>
had its adversaries even there. Sotillo governed<lb/>
Esmeralda with repressive severity till the adverse<lb/>
course of events upon the distant theatre of civil war<lb/>
forced upon him the reflection that, after all, the great<lb/>
silver mine was fated to become the spoil of the victors.<lb/>
But caution was necessary. He began by assuming<lb/>
a dark and mysterious attitude towards the faithful<lb/>
Ribierist municipality of Esmeralda. Later on, the<lb/>
information that the commandant was holding assemblies<lb/>
of officers in the dead of night (which had<lb/>
leaked out somehow) caused those gentlemen to neglect<lb/>


<pb n="287"/>

their civil duties altogether, and remain shut up in their<lb/>
houses. Suddenly one day all the letters from Sulaco<lb/>
by the overland courier were carried off by a file of<lb/>
soldiers from the post office to the Commandancia,<lb/>
without disguise, concealment, or apology. Sotillo had<lb/>
heard through Cayta of the final defeat of Ribiera.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   This was the first open sign of the change in his convictions.<lb/>
Presently notorious democrats, who had been<lb/>
living till then in constant fear of arrest, leg irons, and<lb/>
even floggings, could be observed going in and out at<lb/>
the great door of the Commandancia, where the horses<lb/>
of the orderlies doze under their heavy saddles, while<lb/>
the men, in ragged uniforms and pointed straw hats,<lb/>
lounge on a bench, with their naked feet stuck out<lb/>
beyond the strip of shade; and a sentry, in a red baize<lb/>
coat with holes at the elbows, stands at the top of the<lb/>
steps glaring haughtily at the common people, who uncover<lb/>
their heads to him as they pass.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo's ideas did not soar above the care for his<lb/>
personal safety and the chance of plundering the town<lb/>
in his charge, but he feared that such a late adhesion<lb/>
would earn but scant gratitude from the victors. He<lb/>
had believed just a little too long in the power of the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mine. The seized correspondence had confirmed<lb/>
his previous information of a large amount of<lb/>
silver ingots lying in the Sulaco Custom House. To<lb/>
gain possession of it would be a clear Monterist move; a<lb/>
sort of service that would have to be rewarded. With<lb/>
the silver in his hands he could make terms for himself<lb/>
and his soldiers. He was aware neither of the riots, nor<lb/>
of the President's escape to Sulaco and the close pursuit<lb/>
led by Montero's brother, the guerrillero. The game<lb/>
seemed in his own hands. The initial moves were the<lb/>
seizure of the cable telegraph office and the securing<lb/>
of the Government steamer lying in the narrow creek<lb/>


<pb n="288"/>

which is the harbour of Esmeralda. The last was effected<lb/>
without difficulty by a company of soldiers<lb/>
swarming with a rush over the gangways as she lay<lb/>
alongside the quay; but the lieutenant charged with the<lb/>
duty of arresting the telegraphist halted on the way before<lb/>
the only caf&eacute; in Esmeralda, where he distributed<lb/>
some brandy to his men, and refreshed himself at the<lb/>
expense of the owner, a known Ribierist. The whole<lb/>
party became intoxicated, and proceeded on their<lb/>
mission up the street yelling and firing random shots at<lb/>
the windows. This little festivity, which might have<lb/>
turned out dangerous to the telegraphist's life, enabled<lb/>
him in the end to send his warning to Sulaco. The<lb/>
lieutenant, staggering upstairs with a drawn sabre, was<lb/>
before long kissing him on both cheeks in one of those<lb/>
swift changes of mood peculiar to a state of drunkenness.<lb/>
He clasped the telegraphist close round the neck,<lb/>
assuring him that all the officers of the Esmeralda<lb/>
garrison were going to be made colonels, while tears of<lb/>
happiness streamed down his sodden face. Thus it<lb/>
came about that the town major, coming along later,<lb/>
found the whole party sleeping on the stairs and in<lb/>
passages, and the telegraphist (who scorned this chance<lb/>
of escape) very busy clicking the key of the transmitter.<lb/>
The major led him away bareheaded, with his hands tied<lb/>
behind his back, but concealed the truth from Sotillo,<lb/>
who remained in ignorance of the warning despatched<lb/>
to Sulaco.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The colonel was not the man to let any sort of darkness<lb/>
stand in the way of the planned surprise. It appeared<lb/>
to him a dead certainty; his heart was set upon<lb/>
his object with an ungovernable, childlike impatience.<lb/>
Ever since the steamer had rounded Punta Mala, to<lb/>
enter the deeper shadow of the gulf, he had remained on<lb/>
the bridge in a group of officers as excited as himself.<lb/>


<pb n="289"/>

Distracted between the coaxings and menaces of Sotillo<lb/>
and his Staff, the miserable commander of the steamer<lb/>
kept her moving with as much prudence as they would<lb/>
let him exercise. Some of them had been drinking<lb/>
heavily, no doubt; but the prospect of laying hands<lb/>
on so much wealth made them absurdly foolhardy, and,<lb/>
at the same time, extremely anxious. The old major<lb/>
of the battalion, a stupid, suspicious man, who had<lb/>
never been afloat in his life, distinguished himself by<lb/>
putting out suddenly the binnacle light, the only one<lb/>
allowed on board for the necessities of navigation. He<lb/>
could not understand of what use it could be for finding<lb/>
the way. To the vehement protestations of the ship's<lb/>
captain, he stamped his foot and tapped the handle of<lb/>
his sword. "Aha! I have unmasked you," he cried,<lb/>
triumphantly. "You are tearing your hair from<lb/>
despair at my acuteness. Am I a child to believe that<lb/>
a light in that brass box can show you where the harbour<lb/>
is? I am an old soldier, I am. I can smell a<lb/>
traitor a league off. You wanted that gleam to betray<lb/>
our approach to your friend the Englishman. A thing<lb/>
like that show you the way! What a miserable lie!<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Que picardia!</hi> You Sulaco people are all in the pay of<lb/>
those foreigners. You deserve to be run through the<lb/>
body with my sword." Other officers, crowding round,<lb/>
tried to calm his indignation, repeating persuasively,<lb/>
"No, no! This is an appliance of the mariners, major.<lb/>
This is no treachery." The captain of the transport<lb/>
flung himself face downwards on the bridge, and refused<lb/>
to rise. "Put an end to me at once," he repeated<lb/>
in a stifled voice. Sotillo had to interfere.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The uproar and confusion on the bridge became so<lb/>
great that the helmsman fled from the wheel. He took<lb/>
refuge in the engine-room, and alarmed the engineers,<lb/>
who, disregarding the threats of the soldiers set on<lb/>


<pb n="290"/>

guard over them, stopped the engines, protesting that<lb/>
they would rather be shot than run the risk of being<lb/>
drowned down below.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   This was the first time Nostromo and Decoud heard<lb/>
the steamer stop. After order had been restored, and<lb/>
the binnacle lamp relighted, she went ahead again, passing<lb/>
wide of the lighter in her search for the Isabels. The<lb/>
group could not be made out, and, at the pitiful entreaties<lb/>
of the captain, Sotillo allowed the engines to<lb/>
be stopped again to wait for one of those periodical<lb/>
lightenings of darkness caused by the shifting of the<lb/>
cloud canopy spread above the waters of the gulf.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo, on the bridge, muttered from time to time<lb/>
angrily to the captain. The other, in an apologetic<lb/>
and cringing tone, begged <hi rend="italic">su merced</hi> the colonel to take<lb/>
into consideration the limitations put upon human<lb/>
faculties by the darkness of the night. Sotillo swelled<lb/>
with rage and impatience. It was the chance of a<lb/>
lifetime.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "If your eyes are of no more use to you than this, I<lb/>
shall have them put out," he yelled.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The captain of the steamer made no answer, for just<lb/>
then the mass of the Great Isabel loomed up darkly<lb/>
after a passing shower, then vanished, as if swept away<lb/>
by a wave of greater obscurity preceding another downpour.<lb/>
This was enough for him. In the voice of a man<lb/>
come back to life again, he informed Sotillo that in an<lb/>
hour he would be alongside the Sulaco wharf. The<lb/>
ship was put then full speed on the course, and a great<lb/>
bustle of preparation for landing arose among the<lb/>
soldiers on her deck.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   It was heard distinctly by Decoud and Nostromo.<lb/>
The Capataz understood its meaning. They had made<lb/>
out the Isabels, and were going on now in a straight line<lb/>
for Sulaco. He judged that they would pass close; but<lb/>


<pb n="291"/>

believed that lying still like this, with the sail lowered,<lb/>
the lighter could not be seen. "No, not even if they<lb/>
rubbed sides with us," he muttered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The rain began to fall again; first like a wet mist, then<lb/>
with a heavier touch, thickening into a smart, perpendicular<lb/>
downpour; and the hiss and thump of the<lb/>
approaching steamer was coming extremely near. Decoud,<lb/>
with his eyes full of water, and lowered head,<lb/>
asked himself how long it would be before she drew<lb/>
past, when unexpectedly he felt a lurch. An inrush of<lb/>
foam broke swishing over the stern, simultaneously with<lb/>
a crack of timbers and a staggering shock. He had the<lb/>
impression of an angry hand laying hold of the lighter<lb/>
and dragging it along to destruction. The shock, of<lb/>
course, had knocked him down, and he found himself<lb/>
rolling in a lot of water at the bottom of the lighter. A<lb/>
violent churning went on alongside; a strange and<lb/>
amazed voice cried out something above him in the<lb/>
night. He heard a piercing shriek for help from Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Hirsch. He kept his teeth hard set all the time. It<lb/>
was a collision!<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The steamer had struck the lighter obliquely, heeling<lb/>
her over till she was half swamped, starting some of her<lb/>
timbers, and swinging her head parallel to her own<lb/>
course with the force of the blow. The shock of it on<lb/>
board of her was hardly perceptible. All the violence<lb/>
of that collision was, as usual, felt only on board the<lb/>
smaller craft. Even Nostromo himself thought that<lb/>
this was perhaps the end of his desperate adventure.<lb/>
He, too, had been flung away from the long tiller, which<lb/>
took charge in the lurch. Next moment the steamer<lb/>
would have passed on, leaving the lighter to sink or<lb/>
swim after having shouldered her thus out of her way,<lb/>
and without even getting a glimpse of her form, had it<lb/>
not been that, being deeply laden with stores and the<lb/>


<pb n="292"/>

great number of people on board, her anchor was low<lb/>
enough to hook itself into one of the wire shrouds of the<lb/>
lighter's mast. For the space of two or three gasping<lb/>
breaths that new rope held against the sudden strain.<lb/>
It was this that gave Decoud the sensation of the<lb/>
snatching pull, dragging the lighter away to destruction.<lb/>
The cause of it, of course, was inexplicable to him. The<lb/>
whole thing was so sudden that he had no time to think.<lb/>
But all his sensations were perfectly clear; he had kept<lb/>
complete possession of himself; in fact, he was even<lb/>
pleasantly aware of that calmness at the very moment<lb/>
of being pitched head first over the transom, to struggle<lb/>
on his back in a lot of water. Se&ntilde;or Hirsch's shriek he<lb/>
had heard and recognized while he was regaining his feet,<lb/>
always with that mysterious sensation of being dragged<lb/>
headlong through the darkness. Not a word, not a<lb/>
cry escaped him; he had no time to see anything; and<lb/>
following upon the despairing screams for help, the<lb/>
dragging motion ceased so suddenly that he staggered<lb/>
forward with open arms and fell against the pile of the<lb/>
treasure boxes. He clung to them instinctively, in the<lb/>
vague apprehension of being flung about again; and<lb/>
immediately he heard another lot of shrieks for help,<lb/>
prolonged and despairing, not near him at all, but<lb/>
unaccountably in the distance, away from the lighter<lb/>
altogether, as if some spirit in the night were mocking at<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or Hirsch's terror and despair.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Then all was still &mdash; as still as when you wake up in<lb/>
your bed in a dark room from a bizarre and agitated<lb/>
dream. The lighter rocked slightly; the rain was still<lb/>
falling. Two groping hands took hold of his bruised<lb/>
sides from behind, and the Capataz's voice whispered,<lb/>
in his ear, "Silence, for your life! Silence! The<lb/>
steamer has stopped."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud listened. The gulf was dumb. He felt the<lb/>


<pb n="293"/>

water nearly up to his knees. "Are we sinking?" he<lb/>
asked in a faint breath.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I don't know," Nostromo breathed back to him.<lb/>
"Se&ntilde;or, make not the slightest sound."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Hirsch, when ordered forward by Nostromo, had not<lb/>
returned into his first hiding-place. He had fallen near<lb/>
the mast, and had no strength to rise; moreover, he<lb/>
feared to move. He had given himself up for dead, but<lb/>
not on any rational grounds. It was simply a cruel and<lb/>
terrifying feeling. Whenever he tried to think what<lb/>
would become of him his teeth would start chattering<lb/>
violently. He was too absorbed in the utter misery<lb/>
of his fear to take notice of anything.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Though he was stifling under the lighter's sail which<lb/>
Nostromo had unwittingly lowered on top of him, he<lb/>
did not even dare to put out his head till the very<lb/>
moment of the steamer striking. Then, indeed, he<lb/>
leaped right out, spurred on to new miracles of bodily<lb/>
vigour by this new shape of danger. The inrush of<lb/>
water when the lighter heeled over unsealed his lips.<lb/>
His shriek, "Save me!" was the first distinct warning of<lb/>
the collision for the people on board the steamer. Next<lb/>
moment the wire shroud parted, and the released anchor<lb/>
swept over the lighter's forecastle. It came against the<lb/>
breast of Se&ntilde;or Hirsch, who simply seized hold of it,<lb/>
without in the least knowing what it was, but curling<lb/>
his arms and legs upon the part above the fluke with an<lb/>
invincible, unreasonable tenacity. The lighter yawed<lb/>
off wide, and the steamer, moving on, carried him away,<lb/>
clinging hard, and shouting for help. It was some<lb/>
time, however, after the steamer had stopped that his<lb/>
position was discovered. His sustained yelping for<lb/>
help seemed to come from somebody swimming in the<lb/>
water. At last a couple of men went over the bows and<lb/>
hauled him on board. He was carried straight off to<lb/>


<pb n="294"/>

Sotillo on the bridge. His examination confirmed the<lb/>
impression that some craft had been run over and sunk,<lb/>
but it was impracticable on such a dark night to look for<lb/>
the positive proof of floating wreckage. Sotillo was<lb/>
more anxious than ever now to enter the harbour without<lb/>
loss of time; the idea that he had destroyed the<lb/>
principal object of his expedition was too intolerable to<lb/>
be accepted. This feeling made the story he had heard<lb/>
appear the more incredible. Se&ntilde;or Hirsch, after being<lb/>
beaten a little for telling lies, was thrust into the chart-<lb/>
room. But he was beaten only a little. His tale had<lb/>
taken the heart out of Sotillo's Staff, though they all<lb/>
repeated round their chief, "Impossible! impossible!"<lb/>
with the exception of the old major, who triumphed<lb/>
gloomily.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I told you; I told you," he mumbled. "I could<lb/>
smell some treachery, some <hi rend="italic">diableria</hi> a league off."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Meantime, the steamer had kept on her way towards<lb/>
Sulaco, where only the truth of that matter could be<lb/>
ascertained. Decoud and Nostromo heard the loud<lb/>
churning of her propeller diminish and die out; and<lb/>
then, with no useless words, busied themselves in making<lb/>
for the Isabels. The last shower had brought with<lb/>
it a gentle but steady breeze. The danger was not<lb/>
over yet, and there was no time for talk. The lighter<lb/>
was leaking like a sieve. They splashed in the water<lb/>
at every step. The Capataz put into Decoud's hands<lb/>
the handle of the pump which was fitted at the side<lb/>
aft, and at once, without question or remark, Decoud<lb/>
began to pump in utter forgetfulness of every<lb/>
desire but that of keeping the treasure afloat. Nostromo<lb/>
hoisted the sail, flew back to the tiller, pulled<lb/>
at the sheet like mad. The short flare of a match<lb/>
(they had been kept dry in a tight tin box, though<lb/>
the man himself was completely wet), disclosed to<lb/>


<pb n="295"/>

the toiling Decoud the eagerness of his face, bent low<lb/>
over the box of the compass, and the attentive stare<lb/>
of his eyes. He knew now where he was, and he hoped<lb/>
to run the sinking lighter ashore in the shallow cove<lb/>
where the high, cliff-like end of the Great Isabel is<lb/>
divided in two equal parts by a deep and overgrown<lb/>
ravine.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Decoud pumped without intermission. Nostromo<lb/>
steered without relaxing for a second the intense, peering<lb/>
effort of his stare. Each of them was as if utterly<lb/>
alone with his task. It did not occur to them to speak.<lb/>
There was nothing in common between them but the<lb/>
knowledge that the damaged lighter must be slowly<lb/>
but surely sinking. In that knowledge, which was like<lb/>
the crucial test of their desires, they seemed to have<lb/>
become completely estranged, as if they had discovered<lb/>
in the very shock of the collision that the loss of the<lb/>
lighter would not mean the same thing to them both.<lb/>
This common danger brought their differences in aim, in<lb/>
view, in character, and in position, into absolute prominence<lb/>
in the private vision of each. There was no bond<lb/>
of conviction, of common idea; they were merely two<lb/>
adventurers pursuing each his own adventure, involved<lb/>
in the same imminence of deadly peril. Therefore they<lb/>
had nothing to say to each other. But this peril, this<lb/>
only incontrovertible truth in which they shared,<lb/>
seemed to act as an inspiration to their mental and<lb/>
bodily powers.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   There was certainly something almost miraculous in<lb/>
the way the Capataz made the cove with nothing but<lb/>
the shadowy hint of the island's shape and the vague<lb/>
gleam of a small sandy strip for a guide. Where the<lb/>
ravine opens between the cliffs, and a slender, shallow<lb/>
rivulet meanders out of the bushes to lose itself in the<lb/>
sea, the lighter was run ashore; and the two men, with<lb/>


<pb n="296"/>

a taciturn, undaunted energy, began to discharge her<lb/>
precious freight, carrying each ox-hide box up the bed<lb/>
of the rivulet beyond the bushes to a hollow place which<lb/>
the caving in of the soil had made below the roots of a<lb/>
large tree. Its big smooth trunk leaned like a falling<lb/>
column far over the trickle of water running amongst<lb/>
the loose stones.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   A couple of years before Nostromo had spent a whole<lb/>
Sunday, all alone, exploring the island. He explained<lb/>
this to Decoud after their task was done, and they sat,<lb/>
weary in every limb, with their legs hanging down the<lb/>
low bank, and their backs against the tree, like a pair<lb/>
of blind men aware of each other and their surroundings<lb/>
by some indefinable sixth sense.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes," Nostromo repeated, "I never forget a place<lb/>
I have carefully looked at once." He spoke slowly, almost<lb/>
lazily, as if there had been a whole leisurely life<lb/>
before him, instead of the scanty two hours before daylight.<lb/>
The existence of the treasure, barely concealed<lb/>
in this improbable spot, laid a burden of secrecy upon<lb/>
every contemplated step, upon every intention and plan<lb/>
of future conduct. He felt the partial failure of this<lb/>
desperate affair entrusted to the great reputation he had<lb/>
known how to make for himself. However, it was also<lb/>
a partial success. His vanity was half appeased. His<lb/>
nervous irritation had subsided.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You never know what may be of use," he pursued<lb/>
with his usual quietness of tone and manner. "I spent<lb/>
a whole miserable Sunday in exploring this crumb of<lb/>
land."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "A misanthropic sort of occupation," muttered Decoud,<lb/>
viciously. "You had no money, I suppose, to<lb/>
gamble with, and to fling about amongst the girls in<lb/>
your usual haunts, Capataz."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   <hi rend="italic">"&Egrave; vero!"</hi> exclaimed the Capataz, surprised into the<lb/>


<pb n="297"/>

use of his native tongue by so much perspicacity. "I<lb/>
had not! Therefore I did not want to go amongst those<lb/>
beggarly people accustomed to my generosity. It is<lb/>
looked for from the Capataz of the Cargadores, who<lb/>
are the rich men, and, as it were, the Caballeros amongst<lb/>
the common people. I don't care for cards but as a<lb/>
pastime; and as to those girls that boast of having<lb/>
opened their doors to my knock, you know I wouldn't<lb/>
look at any one of them twice except for what the<lb/>
people would say. They are queer, the good people of<lb/>
Sulaco, and I have got much useful information simply<lb/>
by listening patiently to the talk of the women that<lb/>
everybody believed I was in love with. Poor Teresa<lb/>
could never understand that. On that particular Sunday,<lb/>
se&ntilde;or, she scolded so that I went out of the house<lb/>
swearing that I would never darken their door again unless<lb/>
to fetch away my hammock and my chest of clothes.<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or, there is nothing more exasperating than to hear<lb/>
a woman you respect rail against your good reputation<lb/>
when you have not a single brass coin in your pocket.<lb/>
I untied one of the small boats and pulled myself out<lb/>
of the harbour with nothing but three cigars in my<lb/>
pocket to help me spend the day on this island. But<lb/>
the water of this rivulet you hear under your feet is cool<lb/>
and sweet and good, se&ntilde;or, both before and after a<lb/>
smoke." He was silent for a while, then added reflectively,<lb/>
"That was the first Sunday after I brought<lb/>
down the white-whiskered English <hi rend="italic">rico</hi> all the way<lb/>
down the mountains from the Paramo on the top of the<lb/>
Entrada Pass &mdash; and in the coach, too! No coach had<lb/>
gone up or down that mountain road within the memory<lb/>
of man, se&ntilde;or, till I brought this one down in charge of<lb/>
fifty peons working like one man with ropes, pickaxes,<lb/>
and poles under my direction. That was the rich<lb/>
Englishman who, as people say, pays for the making of<lb/>


<pb n="298"/>

this railway. He was very pleased with me. But my<lb/>
wages were not due till the end of the month."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He slid down the bank suddenly. Decoud heard the<lb/>
splash of his feet in the brook and followed his footsteps<lb/>
down the ravine. His form was lost among the bushes<lb/>
till he had reached the strip of sand under the cliff.<lb/>
As often happens in the gulf when the showers<lb/>
during the first part of the night had been frequent and<lb/>
heavy, the darkness had thinned considerably towards<lb/>
the morning though there were no signs of daylight<lb/>
as yet.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The cargo-lighter, relieved of its precious burden,<lb/>
rocked feebly, half-afloat, with her fore-foot on the sand.<lb/>
A long rope stretched away like a black cotton thread<lb/>
across the strip of white beach to the grapnel Nostromo<lb/>
had carried ashore and hooked to the stem of a tree-like<lb/>
shrub in the very opening of the ravine.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   There was nothing for Decoud but to remain on the<lb/>
island. He received from Nostromo's hands whatever<lb/>
food the foresight of Captain Mitchell had put on<lb/>
board the lighter and deposited it temporarily in the<lb/>
little dinghy which on their arrival they had hauled up<lb/>
out of sight amongst the bushes. It was to be left with<lb/>
him. The island was to be a hiding-place, not a prison;<lb/>
he could pull out to a passing ship. The O.S.N. Company's<lb/>
mail boats passed close to the islands when going<lb/>
into Sulaco from the north. But the <hi rend="italic">Minerva</hi>, carrying<lb/>
off the ex-president, had taken the news up north of the<lb/>
disturbances in Sulaco. It was possible that the next<lb/>
steamer down would get instructions to miss the port<lb/>
altogether since the town, as far as the <hi rend="italic">Minerva's</hi><lb/>
officers knew, was for the time being in the hands of the<lb/>
rabble. This would mean that there would be no<lb/>
steamer for a month, as far as the mail service went; but<lb/>
Decoud had to take his chance of that. The island was<lb/>


<pb n="299"/>

his only shelter from the proscription hanging over his<lb/>
head. The Capataz was, of course, going back. The<lb/>
unloaded lighter leaked much less, and he thought that<lb/>
she would keep afloat as far as the harbour.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He passed to Decoud, standing knee-deep alongside,<lb/>
one of the two spades which belonged to the equipment<lb/>
of each lighter for use when ballasting ships. By working<lb/>
with it carefully as soon as there was daylight<lb/>
enough to see, Decoud could loosen a mass of earth and<lb/>
stones overhanging the cavity in which they had<lb/>
deposited the treasure, so that it would look as if it had<lb/>
fallen naturally. It would cover up not only the cavity,<lb/>
but even all traces of their work, the footsteps, the displaced<lb/>
stones, and even the broken bushes.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Besides, who would think of looking either for you<lb/>
or the treasure here?" Nostromo continued, as if he<lb/>
could not tear himself away from the spot. "Nobody<lb/>
is ever likely to come here. What could any man want<lb/>
with this piece of earth as long as there is room for his<lb/>
feet on the mainland! The people in this country are<lb/>
not curious. There are even no fishermen here to intrude<lb/>
upon your worship. All the fishing that is done<lb/>
in the gulf goes on near Zapiga, over there. Se&ntilde;or, if<lb/>
you are forced to leave this island before anything can<lb/>
be arranged for you, do not try to make for Zapiga. It<lb/>
is a settlement of thieves and matreros, where they<lb/>
would cut your throat promptly for the sake of your<lb/>
gold watch and chain. And, se&ntilde;or, think twice before<lb/>
confiding in any one whatever; even in the officers of<lb/>
the Company's steamers, if you ever get on board one.<lb/>
Honesty alone is not enough for security. You must<lb/>
look to discretion and prudence in a man. And always<lb/>
remember, se&ntilde;or, before you open your lips for a confidence,<lb/>
that this treasure may be left safely here for<lb/>
hundreds of years. Time is on its side, se&ntilde;or. And<lb/>


<pb n="300"/>

silver is an incorruptible metal that can be trusted to<lb/>
keep its value for ever. . . . An incorruptible<lb/>
metal," he repeated, as if the idea had given him a profound<lb/>
pleasure.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "As some men are said to be," Decoud pronounced,<lb/>
inscrutably, while the Capataz, who busied himself in<lb/>
baling out the lighter with a wooden bucket, went on<lb/>
throwing the water over the side with a regular splash.<lb/>
Decoud, incorrigible in his scepticism, reflected, not<lb/>
cynically, but with general satisfaction, that this man<lb/>
was made incorruptible by his enormous vanity, that<lb/>
finest form of egoism which can take on the aspect of<lb/>
every virtue.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo ceased baling, and, as if struck with a<lb/>
sudden thought, dropped the bucket with a clatter into<lb/>
the lighter.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Have you any message?" he asked in a lowered<lb/>
voice. "Remember, I shall be asked questions."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You must find the hopeful words that ought to be<lb/>
spoken to the people in town. I trust for that your<lb/>
intelligence and your experience, Capataz. You understand?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>
  "Si, se&ntilde;or. . . . For the ladies."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes, yes," said Decoud, hastily. "Your wonderful<lb/>
reputation will make them attach great value to your<lb/>
words; therefore be careful what you say. I am looking<lb/>
forward," he continued, feeling the fatal touch of<lb/>
contempt for himself to which his complex nature was<lb/>
subject, "I am looking forward to a glorious and successful<lb/>
ending to my mission. Do you hear, Capataz?<lb/>
Use the words glorious and successful when you speak<lb/>
to the se&ntilde;orita. Your own mission is accomplished<lb/>
gloriously and successfully. You have indubitably<lb/>
saved the silver of the mine. Not only this silver, but<lb/>
probably all the silver that shall ever come out of it."<lb/>


<pb n="301"/>

</p>

<p>   Nostromo detected the ironic tone. "I dare say,<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or Don Martin," he said, moodily. "There are very<lb/>
few things that I am not equal to. Ask the foreign<lb/>
signori. I, a man of the people, who cannot always<lb/>
understand what you mean.   But as to this lot<lb/>
which I must leave here, let me tell you that I would<lb/>
believe it in greater safety if you had not been with<lb/>
me at all."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   An exclamation escaped Decoud, and a short pause<lb/>
followed. "Shall I go back with you to Sulaco?" he<lb/>
asked in an angry tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Shall I strike you dead with my knife where you<lb/>
stand?" retorted Nostromo, contemptuously. "It<lb/>
would be the same thing as taking you to Sulaco.<lb/>
Come, se&ntilde;or. Your reputation is in your politics, and<lb/>
mine is bound up with the fate of this silver. Do you<lb/>
wonder I wish there had been no other man to share my<lb/>
knowledge? I wanted no one with me, se&ntilde;or."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You could not have kept the lighter afloat without<lb/>
me," Decoud almost shouted. "You would have gone<lb/>
to the bottom with her."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes," uttered Nostromo, slowly; "alone."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Here was a man, Decoud reflected, that seemed as<lb/>
though he would have preferred to die rather than deface<lb/>
the perfect form of his egoism. Such a man was<lb/>
safe. In silence he helped the Capataz to get the grapnel<lb/>
on board.   Nostromo cleared the shelving shore<lb/>
with one push of the heavy oar, and Decoud found himself<lb/>
solitary on the beach like a man in a dream. A<lb/>
sudden desire to hear a human voice once more seized<lb/>
upon his heart. The lighter was hardly distinguishable<lb/>
from the black water upon which she floated.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "What do you think has become of Hirsch?" he<lb/>
shouted.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Knocked overboard and drowned," cried Nostromo's<lb/>


<pb n="302"/>

voice confidently out of the black wastes of sky<lb/>
and sea around the islet. "Keep close in the ravine,<lb/>
se&ntilde;or. I shall try to come out to you in a night or<lb/>
two."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   A slight swishing rustle showed that Nostromo was<lb/>
setting the sail. It filled all at once with a sound as of<lb/>
a single loud drum-tap. Decoud went back to the<lb/>
ravine. Nostromo, at the tiller, looked back from<lb/>
time to time at the vanishing mass of the Great Isabel,<lb/>
which, little by little, merged into the uniform texture<lb/>
of the night. At last, when he turned his head<lb/>
again, he saw nothing but a smooth darkness, like a<lb/>
solid wall.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Then he, too, experienced that feeling of solitude<lb/>
which had weighed heavily on Decoud after the lighter<lb/>
had slipped off the shore. But while the man on the<lb/>
island was oppressed by a bizarre sense of unreality<lb/>
affecting the very ground upon which he walked, the<lb/>
mind of the Capataz of the Cargadores turned alertly<lb/>
to the problem of future conduct. Nostromo's faculties,<lb/>
working on parallel lines, enabled him to steer straight,<lb/>
to keep a look-out for Hermosa, near which he had to<lb/>
pass, and to try to imagine what would happen tomorrow<lb/>
in Sulaco. To-morrow, or, as a matter of fact,<lb/>
to-day, since the dawn was not very far, Sotillo would<lb/>
find out in what way the treasure had gone. A gang of<lb/>
Cargadores had been employed in loading it into a rail-<lb/>
way truck from the Custom House store-rooms, and<lb/>
running the truck on to the wharf. There would be<lb/>
arrests made, and certainly before noon Sotillo would<lb/>
know in what manner the silver had left Sulaco, and<lb/>
who it was that took it out.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Nostromo's intention had been to sail right into the<lb/>
harbour; but at this thought by a sudden touch of the<lb/>
tiller he threw the lighter into the wind and checked<lb/>


<pb n="303"/>

her rapid way. His re-appearance with the very boat<lb/>
would raise suspicions, would cause surmises, would<lb/>
absolutely put Sotillo on the track. He himself would<lb/>
be arrested; and once in the Calabozo there was no<lb/>
saying what they would do to him to make him speak.<lb/>
He trusted himself, but he stood up to look round.<lb/>
Near by, Hermosa showed low its white surface as flat<lb/>
as a table, with the slight run of the sea raised by the<lb/>
breeze washing over its edges noisily. The lighter<lb/>
must be sunk at once.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He allowed her to drift with her sail aback. There<lb/>
was already a good deal of water in her. He allowed<lb/>
her to drift towards the harbour entrance, and, letting<lb/>
the tiller swing about, squatted down and busied himself<lb/>
in loosening the plug. With that out she would fill<lb/>
very quickly, and every lighter carried a little iron<lb/>
ballast &mdash; enough to make her go down when full of<lb/>
water. When he stood up again the noisy wash about<lb/>
the Hermosa sounded far away, almost inaudible; and<lb/>
already he could make out the shape of land about the<lb/>
harbour entrance. This was a desperate affair, and he<lb/>
was a good swimmer. A mile was nothing to him, and<lb/>
he knew of an easy place for landing just below the<lb/>
earthworks of the old abandoned fort. It occurred to<lb/>
him with a peculiar fascination that this fort was a good<lb/>
place in which to sleep the day through after so many<lb/>
sleepless nights.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   With one blow of the tiller he unshipped for the purpose,<lb/>
he knocked the plug out, but did not take the<lb/>
trouble to lower the sail. He felt the water welling up<lb/>
heavily about his legs before he leaped on to the taffrail.<lb/>
There, upright and motionless, in his shirt and trousers<lb/>
only, he stood waiting. When he had felt her settle he<lb/>
sprang far away with a mighty splash.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   At once he turned his head. The gloomy, clouded<lb/>


<pb n="304"/>

dawn from behind the mountains showed him on the<lb/>
smooth waters the upper corner of the sail, a dark wet<lb/>
triangle of canvas waving slightly to and fro. He saw<lb/>
it vanish, as if jerked under, and then struck out for the<lb/>
shore.<lb/>

<pb n="307"/>

<p>   DIRECTLY the cargo boat had slipped away from the<lb/>
wharf and got lost in the darkness of the harbour the<lb/>
Europeans of Sulaco separated, to prepare for the coming<lb/>
of the Monterist <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>, which was approaching<lb/>
Sulaco from the mountains, as well as from the sea.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   This bit of manual work in loading the silver was<lb/>
their last concerted action. It ended the three days of<lb/>
danger, during which, according to the newspaper press<lb/>
of Europe, their energy had preserved the town from the<lb/>
calamities of popular disorder. At the shore end of the<lb/>
jetty, Captain Mitchell said good-night and turned<lb/>
back. His intention was to walk the planks of the<lb/>
wharf till the steamer from Esmeralda turned up. The<lb/>
engineers of the railway staff, collecting their Basque<lb/>
and Italian workmen, marched them away to the rail-<lb/>
way yards, leaving the Custom House, so well defended<lb/>
on the first day of the riot, standing open to the four<lb/>
winds of heaven. Their men had conducted themselves<lb/>
bravely and faithfully during the famous "three days"<lb/>
of Sulaco. In a great part this faithfulness and that<lb/>
courage had been exercised in self-defence rather than<lb/>
in the cause of those material interests to which Charles<lb/>
Gould had pinned his faith. Amongst the cries of the<lb/>
mob not the least loud had been the cry of death to<lb/>
foreigners. It was, indeed, a lucky circumstance for<lb/>
Sulaco that the relations of those imported workmen<lb/>
with the people of the country had been uniformly bad<lb/>
from the first.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Doctor Monygham, going to the door of Viola's<lb/>

<pb n="308"/>

kitchen, observed this retreat marking the end of the<lb/>
foreign interference, this withdrawal of the army of<lb/>
material progress from the field of Costaguana revolutions.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
  Algarrobe torches carried on the outskirts of the<lb/>
moving body sent their penetrating aroma into his<lb/>
nostrils. Their light, sweeping along the front of the<lb/>
house, made the letters of the inscription, "Albergo<lb/>
d'ltalia Una," leap out black from end to end of the<lb/>
long wall. His eyes blinked in the clear blaze. Several<lb/>
young men, mostly fair and tall, shepherding this mob<lb/>
of dark bronzed heads, surmounted by the glint of<lb/>
slanting rifle barrels, nodded to him familiarly as they<lb/>
went by. The doctor was a well-known character.<lb/>
Some of them wondered what he was doing there.<lb/>
Then, on the flank of their workmen they tramped on,<lb/>
following the line of rails.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Withdrawing your people from the harbour?"<lb/>
said the doctor, addressing himself to the chief engineer<lb/>
of the railway, who had accompanied Charles Gould so<lb/>
far on his way to the town, walking by the side of the<lb/>
horse, with his hand on the saddle-bow. They had<lb/>
stopped just outside the open door to let the workmen<lb/>
cross the road.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "As quick as I can. We are not a political faction,"<lb/>
answered the engineer, meaningly. "And we are not<lb/>
going to give our new rulers a handle against the rail-<lb/>
way. You approve me, Gould?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Absolutely," said Charles Gould's impassive voice,<lb/>
high up and outside the dim parallelogram of light falling<lb/>
on the road through the open door.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   With Sotillo expected from one side, and Pedro<lb/>
Montero from the other, the engineer-in-chief's only<lb/>
anxiety now was to avoid a collision with either. Sulaco,<lb/>
for him, was a railway station, a terminus, workshops,<lb/>


<pb n="309"/>

a great accumulation of stores. As against the mob<lb/>
the railway defended its property, but politically the<lb/>
railway was neutral. He was a brave man; and in that<lb/>
spirit of neutrality he had carried proposals of truce to<lb/>
the self-appointed chiefs of the popular party, the<lb/>
deputies Fuentes and Gamacho. Bullets were still<lb/>
flying about when he had crossed the Plaza on that<lb/>
mission, waving above his head a white napkin belonging<lb/>
to the table linen of the Amarilla Club.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He was rather proud of this exploit; and reflecting<lb/>
that the doctor, busy all day with the wounded in the<lb/>
patio of the Casa Gould, had not had time to hear the<lb/>
news, he began a succinct narrative. He had communicated<lb/>
to them the intelligence from the Construction<lb/>
Camp as to Pedro Montero. The brother of the victorious<lb/>
general, he had assured them, could be expected<lb/>
at Sulaco at any time now. This news (as he anticipated),<lb/>
when shouted out of the window by Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Gamacho, induced a rush of the mob along the Campo<lb/>
Road towards Rincon. The two deputies also, after<lb/>
shaking hands with him effusively, mounted and<lb/>
galloped off to meet the great man. "I have misled<lb/>
them a little as to the time," the chief engineer confessed.<lb/>
"However hard he rides, he can scarcely get<lb/>
here before the morning. But my object is attained.<lb/>
I've secured several hours' peace for the losing party.<lb/>
But I did not tell them anything about Sotillo, for fear<lb/>
they would take it into their heads to try to get hold<lb/>
of the harbour again, either to oppose him or welcome<lb/>
him &mdash; there's no saying which. There was Gould's<lb/>
silver, on which rests the remnant of our hopes. Decoud's<lb/>
retreat had to be thought of, too. I think the<lb/>
railway has done pretty well by its friends without compromising<lb/>
itself hopelessly. Now the parties must be<lb/>
left to themselves."<lb/>


<pb n="310"/>

</p>

<p>   "Costaguana for the Costaguaneros," interjected the<lb/>
doctor, sardonically. "It is a fine country, and they<lb/>
have raised a fine crop of hates, vengeance, murder,<lb/>
and rapine &mdash; those sons of the country."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Well, I am one of them," Charles Gould's voice<lb/>
sounded, calmly, "and I must be going on to see to my<lb/>
own crop of trouble. My wife has driven straight on,<lb/>
doctor?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes. All was quiet on this side. Mrs. Gould has<lb/>
taken the two girls with her."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Charles Gould rode on, and the engineer-in-chief<lb/>
followed the doctor indoors.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "That man is calmness personified," he said, appreciatively,<lb/>
dropping on a bench, and stretching his well-<lb/>
shaped legs in cycling stockings nearly across the doorway.<lb/>
"He must be extremely sure of himself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "If that's all he is sure of, then he is sure of nothing,"<lb/>
said the doctor. He had perched himself again on the<lb/>
end of the table. He nursed his cheek in the palm of<lb/>
one hand, while the other sustained the elbow. "It is<lb/>
the last thing a man ought to be sure of." The candle,<lb/>
half-consumed and burning dimly with a long wick,<lb/>
lighted up from below his inclined face, whose expression<lb/>
affected by the drawn-in cicatrices in the cheeks, had<lb/>
something vaguely unnatural, an exaggerated remorseful<lb/>
bitterness. As he sat there he had the air of meditating<lb/>
upon sinister things. The engineer-in-chief<lb/>
gazed at him for a time before he protested.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I really don't see that. For me there seems to be<lb/>
nothing else. However &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He was a wise man, but he could not quite conceal<lb/>
his contempt for that sort of paradox; in fact. Dr.<lb/>
Monygham was not liked by the Europeans of Sulaco.<lb/>
His outward aspect of an outcast, which he preserved<lb/>
even in Mrs. Gould's drawing-room, provoked unfavourable<lb/>


<pb n="311"/>

criticism. There could be no doubt of his<lb/>
intelligence; and as he had lived for over twenty years<lb/>
in the country, the pessimism of his outlook could not be<lb/>
altogether ignored. But instinctively, in self-defence<lb/>
of their activities and hopes, his hearers put it to the<lb/>
account of some hidden imperfection in the man's<lb/>
character. It was known that many years before,<lb/>
when quite young, he had been made by Guzman Bento<lb/>
chief medical officer of the army. Not one of the<lb/>
Europeans then in the service of Costaguana had been<lb/>
so much liked and trusted by the fierce old Dictator.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Afterwards his story was not so clear. It lost itself<lb/>
amongst the innumerable tales of conspiracies and<lb/>
plots against the tyrant as a stream is lost in an arid<lb/>
belt of sandy country before it emerges, diminished and<lb/>
troubled, perhaps, on the other side. The doctor made<lb/>
no secret of it that he had lived for years in the wildest<lb/>
parts of the Republic, wandering with almost unknown<lb/>
Indian tribes in the great forests of the far interior where<lb/>
the great rivers have their sources. But it was mere<lb/>
aimless wandering; he had written nothing, collected<lb/>
nothing, brought nothing for science out of the twilight<lb/>
of the forests, which seemed to cling to his battered<lb/>
personality limping about Sulaco, where it had drifted in<lb/>
casually, only to get stranded on the shores of the sea.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   It was also known that he had lived in a state of<lb/>
destitution till the arrival of the Goulds from Europe.<lb/>
Don Carlos and Do&ntilde;a Emilia had taken up the mad<lb/>
English doctor, when it became apparent that for all<lb/>
his savage independence he could be tamed by kindness.<lb/>
Perhaps it was only hunger that had tamed him. In<lb/>
years gone by he had certainly been acquainted with<lb/>
Charles Gould's father in Sta. Marta; and now, no<lb/>
matter what were the dark passages of his history, as the<lb/>
medical officer of the San Tom&eacute; mine he became a recognized<lb/>


<pb n="312"/>

personality. He was recognized, but not unreservedly<lb/>
accepted. So much defiant eccentricity and<lb/>
such an outspoken scorn for mankind seemed to point to<lb/>
mere recklessness of judgment, the bravado of guilt.<lb/>
Besides, since he had become again of some account,<lb/>
vague whispers had been heard that years ago, when<lb/>
fallen into disgrace and thrown into prison by Guzman<lb/>
Bento at the time of the so-called Great Conspiracy, he<lb/>
had betrayed some of his best friends amongst the<lb/>
conspirators. Nobody pretended to believe that whisper;<lb/>
the whole story of the Great Conspiracy was<lb/>
hopelessly involved and obscure; it is admitted in Costaguana<lb/>
that there never had been a conspiracy except in<lb/>
the diseased imagination of the Tyrant; and, therefore,<lb/>
nothing and no one to betray; though the most distinguished<lb/>
Costaguaneros had been imprisoned and<lb/>
executed upon that accusation. The procedure had<lb/>
dragged on for years, decimating the better class like<lb/>
a pestilence. The mere expression of sorrow for the<lb/>
fate of executed kinsmen had been punished with death.<lb/>
Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos was perhaps the only one living who<lb/>
knew the whole story of those unspeakable cruelties.<lb/>
He had suffered from them himself, and he, with a<lb/>
shrug of the shoulders and a nervous, jerky gesture of<lb/>
the arm, was wont to put away from him, as it were,<lb/>
every allusion to it. But whatever the reason, Dr.<lb/>
Monygham, a personage in the administration of the<lb/>
Gould Concession, treated with reverent awe by the<lb/>
miners, and indulged in his peculiarities by Mrs.<lb/>
Gould, remained somehow outside the pale.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   It was not from any liking for the doctor that the<lb/>
engineer-in-chief had lingered in the inn upon the plain.<lb/>
He liked old Viola much better. He had come to look<lb/>
upon the Albergo d'ltalia Una as a dependence of the<lb/>
railway. Many of his subordinates had their quarters<lb/>


<pb n="313"/>

there. Mrs. Gould's interest in the family conferred<lb/>
upon it a sort of distinction.  The engineer-in-chief,<lb/>
with an army of workers under his orders, appreciated<lb/>
the moral influence of the old Garibaldino upon his<lb/>
countrymen. His austere, old-world Republicanism<lb/>
had a severe, soldier-like standard of faithfulness and<lb/>
duty, as if the world were a battlefield where men had<lb/>
to fight for the sake of universal love and brotherhood,<lb/>
instead of a more or less large share of booty.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Poor old chap!" he said, after he had heard the<lb/>
doctor's account of Teresa. "He'll never be able to<lb/>
keep the place going by himself. I shall be sorry."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "He's quite alone up there," grunted Doctor Monygham,<lb/>
with a toss of his heavy head towards the narrow<lb/>
staircase. "Every living soul has cleared out, and Mrs.<lb/>
Gould took the girls away just now. It might not be<lb/>
over-safe for them out here before very long. Of<lb/>
course, as a doctor I can do nothing more here; but she<lb/>
has asked me to stay with old Viola, and as I have no<lb/>
horse to get back to the mine, where I ought to be, I<lb/>
made no difficulty to stay. They can do without me in<lb/>
the town."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I have a good mind to remain with you, doctor, till<lb/>
we see whether anything happens to-night at the<lb/>
harbour," declared the engineer-in-chief. "He must<lb/>
not be molested by Sotillo's soldiery, who may push on<lb/>
as far as this at once. Sotillo used to be very cordial<lb/>
to me at the Goulds' and at the club. How that man'll<lb/>
ever dare to look any of his friends here in the face I<lb/>
can't imagine."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "He'll no doubt begin by shooting some of them to<lb/>
get over the first awkwardness," said the doctor.<lb/>
"Nothing in this country serves better your military<lb/>
man who has changed sides than a few summary<lb/>
executions." He spoke with a gloomy positiveness<lb/>


<pb n="314"/>

that left no room for protest. The engineer-in-chief<lb/>
did not attempt any. He simply nodded several<lb/>
times regretfully, then said &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I think we shall be able to mount you in the morning,<lb/>
doctor. Our peons have recovered some of our<lb/>
stampeded horses. By riding hard and taking a wide<lb/>
circuit by Los Hatos and along the edge of the forest,<lb/>
clear of Rincon altogether, you may hope to reach the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; bridge without being interfered with. The<lb/>
mine is just now, to my mind, the safest place for anybody<lb/>
at all compromised. I only wish the railway was<lb/>
as difficult to touch."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Am I compromised?" Doctor Monygham brought<lb/>
out slowly after a short silence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "The whole Gould Concession is compromised. It<lb/>
could not have remained for ever outside the political<lb/>
life of the country &mdash; if those convulsions may be called<lb/>
life. The thing is &mdash; can it be touched? The moment<lb/>
was bound to come when neutrality would become impossible,<lb/>
and Charles Gould understood this well. I<lb/>
believe he is prepared for every extremity. A man of<lb/>
his sort has never contemplated remaining indefinitely<lb/>
at the mercy of ignorance and corruption. It was like<lb/>
being a prisoner in a cavern of banditti with the price of<lb/>
your ransom in your pocket, and buying your life from<lb/>
day to day. Your mere safety, not your liberty, mind,<lb/>
doctor. I know what I am talking about. The image<lb/>
at which you shrug your shoulders is perfectly correct,<lb/>
especially if you conceive such a prisoner endowed with<lb/>
the power of replenishing his pocket by means as remote<lb/>
from the faculties of his captors as if they were magic.<lb/>
You must have understood that as well as I do, doctor.<lb/>
He was in the position of the goose with the golden<lb/>
eggs. I broached this matter to him as far back as Sir<lb/>
John's visit here. The prisoner of stupid and greedy<lb/>


<pb n="315"/>

banditti is always at the mercy of the first imbecile<lb/>
ruffian, who may blow out his brains in a fit of temper or<lb/>
for some prospect of an immediate big haul. The tale of<lb/>
killing the goose with the golden eggs has not been<lb/>
evolved for nothing out of the wisdom of mankind. It<lb/>
is a story that will never grow old. That is why<lb/>
Charles Gould in his deep, dumb way has countenanced<lb/>
the Ribierist Mandate, the first public act that promised<lb/>
him safety on other than venal grounds. Ribierism has<lb/>
failed, as everything merely rational fails in this<lb/>
country. But Gould remains logical in wishing to save<lb/>
this big lot of silver. Decoud's plan of a counter-<lb/>
revolution may be practicable or not, it may have a<lb/>
chance, or it may not have a chance. With all my<lb/>
experience of this revolutionary continent, I can hardly<lb/>
yet look at their methods seriously. Decoud has been<lb/>
reading to us his draft of a proclamation, and talking<lb/>
very well for two hours about his plan of action. He<lb/>
had arguments which should have appeared solid<lb/>
enough if we, members of old, stable political and<lb/>
national organizations, were not startled by the mere<lb/>
idea of a new State evolved like this out of the head of a<lb/>
scoffing young man fleeing for his life, with a proclamation<lb/>
in his pocket, to a rough, jeering, half-bred swashbuckler,<lb/>
who in this part of the world is called a general.<lb/>
It sounds like a comic fairy tale &mdash; and behold, it may<lb/>
come off; because it is true to the very spirit of the<lb/>
country."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Is the silver gone off, then?" asked the doctor,<lb/>
moodily.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The chief engineer pulled out his watch. "By<lb/>
Captain Mitchell's reckoning &mdash; and he ought to know &mdash;<lb/>
it has been gone long enough now to be some three or<lb/>
four miles outside the harbour; and, as Mitchell says,<lb/>
Nostromo is the sort of seaman to make the best of his<lb/>


<pb n="316"/>

opportunities." Here the doctor grunted so heavily that<lb/>
the other changed his tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You have a poor opinion of that move, doctor? But<lb/>
why? Charles Gould has got to play his game out,<lb/>
though he is not the man to formulate his conduct even<lb/>
to himself, perhaps, let alone to others. It may be that<lb/>
the game has been partly suggested to him by Holroyd;<lb/>
but it accords with his character, too; and that is why it<lb/>
has been so successful. Haven't they come to calling<lb/>
him 'El Rey de Sulaco' in Sta. Marta? A nickname<lb/>
may be the best record of a success. That's what I call<lb/>
putting the face of a joke upon the body of a truth. My<lb/>
dear sir, when I first arrived in Sta. Marta I was struck<lb/>
by the way all those journalists, demagogues, members<lb/>
of Congress, and all those generals and judges cringed<lb/>
before a sleepy-eyed advocate without practice simply<lb/>
because he was the plenipotentiary of the Gould Concession.<lb/>
Sir John when he came out was impressed, too."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "A new State, with that plump dandy, Decoud, for<lb/>
the first President," mused Dr. Monygham, nursing his<lb/>
cheek and swinging his legs all the time.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Upon my word, and why not?" the chief engineer<lb/>
retorted in an unexpectedly earnest and confidential<lb/>
voice. It was as if something subtle in the air of<lb/>
Costaguana had inoculated him with the local faith in<lb/>
"pronunciamientos." All at once he began to talk, like<lb/>
an expert revolutionist, of the instrument ready to hand<lb/>
in the intact army at Cayta, which could be brought<lb/>
back in a few days to Sulaco if only Decoud managed to<lb/>
make his way at once down the coast. For the military<lb/>
chief there was Barrios, who had nothing but a bullet to<lb/>
expect from Montero, his former professional rival and<lb/>
bitter enemy. Barrios's concurrence was assured. As<lb/>
to his army, it had nothing to expect from Montero<lb/>
either; not even a month's pay. From that point of<lb/>


<pb n="317"/>

view the existence of the treasure was of enormous<lb/>
importance. The mere knowledge that it had been<lb/>
saved from the Monterists would be a strong inducement<lb/>
for the Cayta troops to embrace the cause of the<lb/>
new State.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The doctor turned round and contemplated his companion<lb/>
for some time.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "This Decoud, I see, is a persuasive young beggar,"<lb/>
he remarked at last. "And pray is it for this, then,<lb/>
that Charles Gould has let the whole lot of ingots go<lb/>
out to sea in charge of that Nostromo?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Charles Gould," said the engineer-in-chief, "has<lb/>
said no more about his motive than usual. You know,<lb/>
he doesn't talk. But we all here know his motive, and<lb/>
he has only one &mdash; the safety of the San Tom&eacute; mine with<lb/>
the preservation of the Gould Concession in the spirit<lb/>
of his compact with Holroyd. Holroyd is another uncommon<lb/>
man. They understand each other's imaginative<lb/>
side. One is thirty, the other nearly sixty, and<lb/>
they have been made for each other. To be a millionaire,<lb/>
and such a millionaire as Holroyd, is like being<lb/>
eternally young. The audacity of youth reckons upon<lb/>
what it fancies an unlimited time at its disposal; but a<lb/>
millionaire has unlimited means in his hand &mdash; which is<lb/>
better. One's time on earth is an uncertain quantity,<lb/>
but about the long reach of millions there is no doubt.<lb/>
The introduction of a pure form of Christianity into this<lb/>
continent is a dream for a youthful enthusiast, and I<lb/>
have been trying to explain to you why Holroyd at<lb/>
fifty-eight is like a man on the threshold of life, and<lb/>
better, too. He's not a missionary, but the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mine holds just that for him. I assure you, in sober<lb/>
truth, that he could not manage to keep this out of a<lb/>
strictly business conference upon the finances of Costaguana<lb/>
he had with Sir John a couple of years ago.<lb/>


<pb n="318"/>

Sir John mentioned it with amazement in a letter he<lb/>
wrote to me here, from San Francisco, when on his way<lb/>
home. Upon my word, doctor, things seem to be worth<lb/>
nothing by what they are in themselves. I begin to<lb/>
believe that the only solid thing about them is the<lb/>
spiritual value which everyone discovers in his own<lb/>
form of activity &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Bah!" interrupted the doctor, without stopping for<lb/>
an instant the idle swinging movement of his legs.<lb/>
"Self-flattery. Food for that vanity which makes the<lb/>
world go round. Meantime, what do you think is<lb/>
going to happen to the treasure floating about the gulf<lb/>
with the great Capataz and the great politician?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Why are you uneasy about it, doctor?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I uneasy! And what the devil is it to me? I put<lb/>
no spiritual value into my desires, or my opinions, or my<lb/>
actions. They have not enough vastness to give me<lb/>
room for self-flattery. Look, for instance, I should certainly<lb/>
have liked to ease the last moments of that poor<lb/>
woman. And I can't. It's impossible. Have you met<lb/>
the impossible face to face &mdash; or have you, the Napoleon<lb/>
of railways, no such word in your dictionary?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Is she bound to have a very bad time of it?" asked<lb/>
the chief engineer, with humane concern.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Slow, heavy footsteps moved across the planks above<lb/>
the heavy hard wood beams of the kitchen. Then<lb/>
down the narrow opening of the staircase made in the<lb/>
thickness of the wall, and narrow enough to be defended<lb/>
by one man against twenty enemies, came the murmur<lb/>
of two voices, one faint and broken, the other deep and<lb/>
gentle answering it, and in its graver tone covering the<lb/>
weaker sound.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The two men remained still and silent till the murmurs<lb/>
ceased, then the doctor shrugged his shoulders and<lb/>
muttered &mdash;<lb/>


<pb n="319"/>

</p>

<p>   "Yes, she's bound to. And I could do nothing if I<lb/>
went up now."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   A long period of silence above and below ensued.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I fancy," began the engineer, in a subdued voice,<lb/>
"that you mistrust Captain Mitchell's Capataz."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Mistrust him!" muttered the doctor through his<lb/>
teeth. "I believe him capable of anything &mdash; even of<lb/>
the most absurd fidelity. I am the last person he spoke<lb/>
to before he left the wharf, you know. The poor<lb/>
woman up there wanted to see him, and I let him go up<lb/>
to her. The dying must not be contradicted, you<lb/>
know. She seemed then fairly calm and resigned, but<lb/>
the scoundrel in those ten minutes or so has done or<lb/>
said something which seems to have driven her into<lb/>
despair. You know," went on the doctor, hesitatingly,<lb/>
"women are so very unaccountable in every position,<lb/>
and at all times of life, that I thought sometimes she<lb/>
was in a way, don't you see? in love with him &mdash; the<lb/>
Capataz. The rascal has his own charm indubitably,<lb/>
or he would not have made the conquest of all the<lb/>
populace of the town. No, no, I am not absurd. I<lb/>
may have given a wrong name to some strong sentiment<lb/>
for him on her part, to an unreasonable and<lb/>
simple attitude a woman is apt to take up emotionally<lb/>
towards a man. She used to abuse him to me frequently,<lb/>
which, of course, is not inconsistent with my<lb/>
idea. Not at all. It looked to me as if she were always<lb/>
thinking of him. He was something important<lb/>
in her life. You know, I have seen a lot of those people.<lb/>
Whenever I came down from the mine Mrs. Gould used<lb/>
to ask me to keep my eye on them. She likes Italians;<lb/>
she has lived a long time in Italy, I believe, and she took<lb/>
a special fancy to that old Garibaldino. A remarkable<lb/>
chap enough. A rugged and dreamy character, living<lb/>
in the republicanism of his young days as if in a cloud.<lb/>


<pb n="320"/>

He has encouraged much of the Capataz's confounded<lb/>
nonsense &mdash; the high-strung, exalted old beggar!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "What sort of nonsense?" wondered the chief engineer.<lb/>
"I found the Capataz always a very shrewd<lb/>
and sensible fellow, absolutely fearless, and remarkably<lb/>
useful. A perfect handy man. Sir John was greatly<lb/>
impressed by his resourcefulness and attention when he<lb/>
made that overland journey from Sta. Marta. Later<lb/>
on, as you might have heard, he rendered us a service<lb/>
by disclosing to the then chief of police the presence in<lb/>
the town of some professional thieves, who came from a<lb/>
distance to wreck and rob our monthly pay train. He<lb/>
has certainly organized the lighterage service of the<lb/>
harbour for the O.S.N. Company with great ability.<lb/>
He knows how to make himself obeyed, foreigner though<lb/>
he is. It is true that the Cargadores are strangers here,<lb/>
too, for the most part &mdash; immigrants, Isle&ntilde;os."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "His prestige is his fortune," muttered the doctor,<lb/>
sourly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "The man has proved his trustworthiness up to the<lb/>
hilt on innumerable occasions and in all sorts of ways,"<lb/>
argued the engineer. "When this question of the silver<lb/>
arose, Captain Mitchell naturally was very warmly of<lb/>
the opinion that his Capataz was the only man fit for<lb/>
the trust. As a sailor, of course, I suppose so. But as<lb/>
a man, don't you know, Gould, Decoud, and myself<lb/>
judged that it didn't matter in the least who went.<lb/>
Any boatman would have done just as well. Pray,<lb/>
what could a thief do with such a lot of ingots? If he<lb/>
ran off with them he would have in the end to land somewhere,<lb/>
and how could he conceal his cargo from the<lb/>
knowledge of the people ashore? We dismissed that<lb/>
consideration from our minds. Moreover, Decoud was<lb/>
going. There have been occasions when the Capataz<lb/>
has been more implicitly trusted."<lb/>


<pb n="321"/>

</p>

<p>   "He took a slightly different view," the doctor said.<lb/>
"I heard him declare in this very room that it would be<lb/>
the most desperate affair of his life. He made a sort of<lb/>
verbal will here in my hearing, appointing old Viola his<lb/>
executor; and, by Jove! do you know, he &mdash; he's not<lb/>
grown rich by his fidelity to you good people of the rail-<lb/>
way and the harbour. I suppose he obtains some &mdash;<lb/>
how do you say that? &mdash; some spiritual value for his<lb/>
labours, or else I don't know why the devil he should<lb/>
be faithful to you, Gould, Mitchell, or anybody else.<lb/>
He knows this country well. He knows, for instance,<lb/>
that Gamacho, the Deputy from Javira, has been nothing<lb/>
else but a 'tramposo' of the commonest sort, a petty<lb/>
pedlar of the Campo, till he managed to get enough<lb/>
goods on credit from Anzani to open a little store in the<lb/>
wilds, and got himself elected by the drunken mozos<lb/>
that hang about the Estancias and the poorest sort of<lb/>
rancheros who were in his debt. And Gamacho, who<lb/>
to-morrow will be probably one of our high officials, is a<lb/>
stranger, too &mdash; an Isle&ntilde;o. He might have been a<lb/>
Cargador on the O. S. N. wharf had he not (the posadero<lb/>
of Rincon is ready to swear it) murdered a pedlar in the<lb/>
woods and stolen his pack to begin life on. And do you<lb/>
think that Gamacho, then, would have ever become a<lb/>
hero with the democracy of this place, like our Capataz?<lb/>
Of course not. He isn't half the man. No; decidedly,<lb/>
I think that Nostromo is a fool."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The doctor's talk was distasteful to the builder of<lb/>
railways. "It is impossible to argue that point," he said,<lb/>
philosophically. "Each man has his gifts. You should<lb/>
have heard Gamacho haranguing his friends in the street.<lb/>
He has a howling voice, and he shouted like mad, lifting<lb/>
his clenched fist right above his head, and throwing his<lb/>
body half out of the window. At every pause the<lb/>
rabble below yelled, 'Down with the Oligarchs! <hi rend="italic">Viva</hi><lb/>


<pb n="322"/>

la Libertad!' Fuentes inside looked extremely miserable.<lb/>
 You know, he is the brother of Jorge Fuentes,<lb/>
who has been Minister of the Interior for six months or<lb/>
so, some few years back. Of course, he has no conscience;<lb/>
but he is a man of birth and education &mdash; at one<lb/>
time the director of the Customs of Cayta.  That<lb/>
idiot-brute Gamacho fastened himself upon him with<lb/>
his following of the lowest rabble. His sickly fear of<lb/>
that ruffian was the most rejoicing sight imaginable."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He got up and went to the door to look out towards<lb/>
the harbour. "All quiet," he said; "I wonder if Sotillo<lb/>
really means to turn up here?"<lb/>
</p>

<head>CHAPTER TWO</head>

<pb n="323"/>


<p>   CAPTAIN MITCHELL, pacing the wharf, was asking<lb/>
himself the same question. There was always the doubt<lb/>
whether the warning of the Esmeralda telegraphist &mdash;<lb/>
a fragmentary and interrupted message &mdash; had been<lb/>
properly understood. However, the good man had<lb/>
made up his mind not to go to bed till daylight, if even<lb/>
then. He imagined himself to have rendered an enormous<lb/>
service to Charles Gould. When he thought of<lb/>
the saved silver he rubbed his hands together with<lb/>
satisfaction. In his simple way he was proud at being<lb/>
a party to this extremely clever expedient. It was he<lb/>
who had given it a practical shape by suggesting the<lb/>
possibility of intercepting at sea the north-bound<lb/>
steamer. And it was advantageous to his Company,<lb/>
too, which would have lost a valuable freight if the<lb/>
treasure had been left ashore to be confiscated. The<lb/>
pleasure of disappointing the Monterists was also very<lb/>
great. Authoritative by temperament and the long<lb/>
habit of command, Captain Mitchell was no democrat.<lb/>
He even went so far as to profess a contempt for<lb/>
parliamentarism itself. "His Excellency Don Vincente<lb/>
Ribiera," he used to say, "whom I and that fellow of<lb/>
mine, Nostromo, had the honour, sir, and the pleasure<lb/>
of saving from a cruel death, deferred too much to his<lb/>
Congress. It was a mistake &mdash; a distinct mistake, sir."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The guileless old seaman superintending the O.S.N.<lb/>
service imagined that the last three days had exhausted<lb/>
every startling surprise the political life of Costaguana<lb/>
could offer. He used to confess afterwards that the<lb/>




<pb n="324"/>

events which followed surpassed his imagination. To<lb/>
begin with, Sulaco (because of the seizure of the cables<lb/>
and the disorganization of the steam service) remained<lb/>
for a whole fortnight cut off from the rest of the world<lb/>
like a besieged city.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "One would not have believed it possible; but so it<lb/>
was, sir. A full fortnight."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The account of the extraordinary things that happened<lb/>
during that time, and the powerful emotions he<lb/>
experienced, acquired a comic impressiveness from the<lb/>
pompous manner of his personal narrative. He opened<lb/>
it always by assuring his hearer that he was "in the<lb/>
thick of things from first to last." Then he would begin<lb/>
by describing the getting away of the silver, and his<lb/>
natural anxiety lest "his fellow" in charge of the lighter<lb/>
should make some mistake. Apart from the loss of<lb/>
so much precious metal, the life of Se&ntilde;or Martin Decoud,<lb/>
an agreeable, wealthy, and well-informed young<lb/>
gentleman, would have been jeopardized through his<lb/>
falling into the hands of his political enemies. Captain<lb/>
Mitchell also admitted that in his solitary vigil on<lb/>
the wharf he had felt a certain measure of concern for<lb/>
the future of the whole country.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "A feeling, sir," he explained, "perfectly comprehensible<lb/>
in a man properly grateful for the many<lb/>
kindnesses received from the best families of merchants<lb/>
and other native gentlemen of independent means, who,<lb/>
barely saved by us from the excesses of the mob, seemed,<lb/>
to my mind's eye, destined to become the prey in person<lb/>
and fortune of the native soldiery, which, as is well<lb/>
known, behave with regrettable barbarity to the inhabitants<lb/>
during their civil commotions. And then,<lb/>
sir, there were the Goulds, for both of whom, man and<lb/>
wife, I could not but entertain the warmest feelings<lb/>
deserved by their hospitality and kindness. I felt, too,<lb/>


<pb n="325"/>

the dangers of the gentlemen of the Amarilla Club, who<lb/>
had made me honorary member, and had treated me<lb/>
with uniform regard and civility, both in my capacity<lb/>
of Consular Agent and as Superintendent of an important<lb/>
Steam Service. Miss Antonia Avellanos,<lb/>
the most beautiful and accomplished young lady whom<lb/>
it had ever been my privilege to speak to, was not a<lb/>
little in my mind, I confess. How the interests of my<lb/>
Company would be affected by the impending change<lb/>
of officials claimed a large share of my attention, too.<lb/>
In short, sir, I was extremely anxious and very tired, as<lb/>
you may suppose, by the exciting and memorable events<lb/>
in which I had taken my little part. The Company's<lb/>
building containing my residence was within five<lb/>
minutes' walk, with the attraction of some supper and of<lb/>
my hammock (I always take my nightly rest in a hammock,<lb/>
as the most suitable to the climate); but somehow,<lb/>
sir, though evidently I could do nothing for any<lb/>
one by remaining about, I could not tear myself away<lb/>
from that wharf, where the fatigue made me stumble<lb/>
painfully at times. The night was excessively dark &mdash;<lb/>
the darkest I remember in my life; so that I began to<lb/>
think that the arrival of the transport from Esmeralda<lb/>
could not possibly take place before daylight, owing<lb/>
to the difficulty of navigating the gulf. The mosquitoes<lb/>
bit like fury. We have been infested here with mosquitoes<lb/>
before the late improvements; a peculiar harbour<lb/>
brand, sir, renowned for its ferocity. They were<lb/>
like a cloud about my head, and I shouldn't wonder<lb/>
that but for their attacks I would have dozed off as I<lb/>
walked up and down, and got a heavy fall. I kept on<lb/>
smoking cigar after cigar, more to protect myself from<lb/>
being eaten up alive than from any real relish for the<lb/>
weed. Then, sir, when perhaps for the twentieth time<lb/>
I was approaching my watch to the lighted end in order<lb/>


<pb n="326"/>

to see the time, and observing with surprise that it<lb/>
wanted yet ten minutes to midnight, I heard the splash<lb/>
of a ship's propeller &mdash; an unmistakable sound to a<lb/>
sailor's ear on such a calm night. It was faint indeed,<lb/>
because they were advancing with precaution and dead<lb/>
slow, both on account of the darkness and from their<lb/>
desire of not revealing too soon their presence: a very<lb/>
unnecessary care, because, I verily believe, in all the<lb/>
enormous extent of this harbour I was the only living<lb/>
soul about. Even the usual staff of watchmen and<lb/>
others had been absent from their posts for several<lb/>
nights owing to the disturbances. I stood stock still,<lb/>
after dropping and stamping out my cigar &mdash; a circumstance<lb/>
highly agreeable, I should think, to the mosquitoes,<lb/>
if I may judge from the state of my face next morning.<lb/>
But that was a trifling inconvenience in comparison<lb/>
with the brutal proceedings I became victim of<lb/>
on the part of Sotillo. Something utterly inconceivable,<lb/>
sir; more like the proceedings of a maniac than the<lb/>
action of a sane man, however lost to all sense of honour<lb/>
and decency. But Sotillo was furious at the failure of<lb/>
his thievish scheme."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   In this Captain Mitchell was right. Sotillo was indeed<lb/>
infuriated. Captain Mitchell, however, had not<lb/>
been arrested at once; a vivid curiosity induced him to<lb/>
remain on the wharf (which is nearly four hundred feet<lb/>
long) to see, or rather hear, the whole process of disembarkation.<lb/>
Concealed by the railway truck used<lb/>
for the silver, which had been run back afterwards to<lb/>
the shore end of the jetty, Captain Mitchell saw the<lb/>
small detachment thrown forward, pass by, taking<lb/>
different directions upon the plain. Meantime, the<lb/>
troops were being landed and formed into a column,<lb/>
whose head crept up gradually so close to him that he<lb/>
made it out, barring nearly the whole width of the<lb/>


<pb n="327"/>

wharf, only a very few yards from him. Then the low,<lb/>
shuffling, murmuring, clinking sounds ceased, and the<lb/>
whole mass remained for about an hour motionless and<lb/>
silent, awaiting the return of the scouts. On land<lb/>
nothing was to be heard except the deep baying of the<lb/>
mastiffs at the railway yards, answered by the faint<lb/>
barking of the curs infesting the outer limits of the<lb/>
town. A detached knot of dark shapes stood in front of<lb/>
the head of the column.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Presently the picket at the end of the wharf began to<lb/>
challenge in undertones single figures approaching from<lb/>
the plain. Those messengers sent back from the scouting<lb/>
parties flung to their comrades brief sentences and<lb/>
passed on rapidly, becoming lost in the great motionless<lb/>
mass, to make their report to the Staff. It occurred to<lb/>
Captain Mitchell that his position could become disagreeable<lb/>
and perhaps dangerous, when suddenly, at<lb/>
the head of the jetty, there was a shout of command, a<lb/>
bugle call, followed by a stir and a rattling of arms, and a<lb/>
murmuring noise that ran right up the column. Near<lb/>
by a loud voice directed hurriedly, "Push that railway<lb/>
car out of the way!" At the rush of bare feet to execute<lb/>
the order Captain Mitchell skipped back a pace or<lb/>
two; the car, suddenly impelled by many hands, flew<lb/>
away from him along the rails, and before he knew what<lb/>
had happened he found himself surrounded and seized<lb/>
by his arms and the collar of his coat.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "We have caught a man hiding here, <hi rend="italic">mi teniente!"</hi><lb/>
cried one of his captors.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Hold him on one side till the rearguard comes<lb/>
along," answered the voice. The whole column<lb/>
streamed past Captain Mitchell at a run, the thundering<lb/>
noise of their feet dying away suddenly on the shore.<lb/>
His captors held him tightly, disregarding his declaration<lb/>
that he was an Englishman and his loud demands to<lb/>


<pb n="328"/>

be taken at once before their commanding officer.<lb/>
Finally he lapsed into dignified silence. With a hollow<lb/>
rumble of wheels on the planks a couple of field guns,<lb/>
dragged by hand, rolled by. Then, after a small body<lb/>
of men had marched past escorting four or five figures<lb/>
which walked in advance, with a jingle of steel scabbards,<lb/>
he felt a tug at his arms, and was ordered to come<lb/>
along. During the passage from the wharf to the<lb/>
Custom House it is to be feared that Captain Mitchell<lb/>
was subjected to certain indignities at the hands of the<lb/>
soldiers &mdash; such as jerks, thumps on the neck, forcible<lb/>
application of the butt of a rifle to the small of his back.<lb/>
Their ideas of speed were not in accord with his notion<lb/>
of his dignity. He became flustered, flushed, and helpless.<lb/>
It was as if the world were coming to an end.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The long building was surrounded by troops, which<lb/>
were already piling arms by companies and preparing<lb/>
to pass the night lying on the ground in their ponchos<lb/>
with their sacks under their heads. Corporals moved<lb/>
with swinging lanterns posting sentries all round the<lb/>
walls wherever there was a door or an opening. Sotillo<lb/>
was taking his measures to protect his conquest as if<lb/>
it had indeed contained the treasure. His desire to<lb/>
make his fortune at one audacious stroke of genius had<lb/>
overmastered his reasoning faculties. He would not<lb/>
believe in the possibility of failure; the mere hint of<lb/>
such a thing made his brain reel with rage. Every<lb/>
circumstance pointing to it appeared incredible. The<lb/>
statement of Hirsch, which was so absolutely fatal to his<lb/>
hopes, could by no means be admitted. It is true, too,<lb/>
that Hirsch's story had been told so incoherently, with<lb/>
such excessive signs of distraction, that it really looked<lb/>
improbable. It was extremely difficult, as the saying<lb/>
is, to make head or tail of it. On the bridge of the<lb/>
steamer, directly after his rescue, Sotillo and his officers,<lb/>


<pb n="329"/>

in their impatience and excitement, would not give<lb/>
the wretched man time to collect such few wits as remained<lb/>
to him. He ought to have been quieted,<lb/>
soothed, and reassured, whereas he had been roughly<lb/>
handled, cuffed, shaken, and addressed in menacing<lb/>
tones. His struggles, his wriggles, his attempts to get<lb/>
down on his knees, followed by the most violent efforts<lb/>
to break away, as if he meant incontinently to jump<lb/>
overboard, his shrieks and shrinkings and cowering<lb/>
wild glances had filled them first with amazement, then<lb/>
with a doubt of his genuineness, as men are wont to suspect<lb/>
the sincerity of every great passion. His Spanish,<lb/>
too, became so mixed up with German that the better<lb/>
half of his statements remained incomprehensible. He<lb/>
tried to propitiate them by calling them <hi rend="italic">hochwohlgeboren<lb/>
herren</hi>, which in itself sounded suspicious. When<lb/>
admonished sternly not to trifle he repeated his entreaties<lb/>
and protestations of loyalty and innocence again<lb/>
in German, obstinately, because he was not aware in<lb/>
what language he was speaking. His identity, of<lb/>
course, was perfectly known as an inhabitant of Esmeralda,<lb/>
but this made the matter no clearer. As he<lb/>
kept on forgetting Decoud's name, mixing him up with<lb/>
several other people he had seen in the Casa Gould, it<lb/>
looked as if they all had been in the lighter together;<lb/>
and for a moment Sotillo thought that he had drowned<lb/>
every prominent Ribierist of Sulaco. The improbability<lb/>
of such a thing threw a doubt upon the whole<lb/>
statement. Hirsch was either mad or playing a part &mdash;<lb/>
pretending fear and distraction on the spur of the moment<lb/>
to cover the truth. Sotillo's rapacity, excited to<lb/>
the highest pitch by the prospect of an immense booty,<lb/>
could believe in nothing adverse. This Jew might have<lb/>
been very much frightened by the accident, but he<lb/>
knew where the silver was concealed, and had invented<lb/>


<pb n="330"/>

this story, with his Jewish cunning, to put him entirely<lb/>
off the track as to what had been done.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo had taken up his quarters on the upper floor<lb/>
in a vast apartment with heavy black beams. But<lb/>
there was no ceiling, and the eye lost itself in the darkness<lb/>
under the high pitch of the roof. The thick shutters<lb/>
stood open. On a long table could be seen a large<lb/>
inkstand, some stumpy, inky quill pens, and two<lb/>
square wooden boxes, each holding half a hundred-<lb/>
weight of sand. Sheets of grey coarse official paper<lb/>
bestrewed the floor. It must have been a room occupied<lb/>
by some higher official of the Customs, because<lb/>
a large leathern armchair stood behind the table,<lb/>
with other high-backed chairs scattered about. A net<lb/>
hammock was swung under one of the beams &mdash; for the<lb/>
official's afternoon siesta, no doubt. A couple of<lb/>
candles stuck into tall iron candlesticks gave a dim<lb/>
reddish light. The colonel's hat, sword, and revolver<lb/>
lay between them, and a couple of his more trusty<lb/>
officers lounged gloomily against the table. The<lb/>
colonel threw himself into the armchair, and a big<lb/>
negro with a sergeant's stripes on his ragged sleeve,<lb/>
kneeling down, pulled off his boots. Sotillo's ebony<lb/>
moustache contrasted violently with the livid colouring<lb/>
of his cheeks. His eyes were sombre and as if sunk very<lb/>
far into his head. He seemed exhausted by his perplexities,<lb/>
languid with disappointment; but when the<lb/>
sentry on the landing thrust his head in to announce the<lb/>
arrival of a prisoner, he revived at once.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Let him be brought in," he shouted, fiercely.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The door flew open, and Captain Mitchell, bare-<lb/>
headed, his waistcoat open, the bow of his tie under his<lb/>
ear, was hustled into the room.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo recognized him at once. He could not have<lb/>
hoped for a more precious capture; here was a man who<lb/>


<pb n="331"/>

could tell him, if he chose, everything he wished to<lb/>
know &mdash; and directly the problem of how best to make<lb/>
him talk to the point presented itself to his mind. The<lb/>
resentment of a foreign nation had no terrors for Sotillo.<lb/>
The might of the whole armed Europe would not have<lb/>
protected Captain Mitchell from insults and ill-usage, so<lb/>
well as the quick reflection of Sotillo that this was an<lb/>
Englishman who would most likely turn obstinate under<lb/>
bad treatment, and become quite unmanageable. At<lb/>
all events, the colonel smoothed the scowl on his brow.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "What! The excellent Se&ntilde;or Mitchell!" he cried,<lb/>
in affected dismay. The pretended anger of his swift<lb/>
advance and of his shout, "Release the caballero at<lb/>
once," was so effective that the astounded soldiers<lb/>
positively sprang away from their prisoner. Thus<lb/>
suddenly deprived of forcible support, Captain Mitchell<lb/>
reeled as though about to fall. Sotillo took him<lb/>
familiarly under the arm, led him to a chair, waved his<lb/>
hand at the room. "Go out, all of you," he commanded.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
  When they had been left alone he stood looking down,<lb/>
irresolute and silent, watching till Captain Mitchell<lb/>
had recovered his power of speech.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Here in his very grasp was one of the men concerned<lb/>
in the removal of the silver. Sotillo's temperament was<lb/>
of that sort that he experienced an ardent desire to beat<lb/>
him; just as formerly when negotiating with difficulty<lb/>
a loan from the cautious Anzani, his fingers always<lb/>
itched to take the shopkeeper by the throat. As to<lb/>
Captain Mitchell, the suddenness, unexpectedness, and<lb/>
general inconceivableness of this experience had confused<lb/>
his thoughts. Moreover, he was physically out<lb/>
of breath.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I've been knocked down three times between this<lb/>
and the wharf," he gasped out at last. "Somebody<lb/>


<pb n="332"/>

shall be made to pay for this." He had certainly<lb/>
stumbled more than once, and had been dragged along<lb/>
for some distance before he could regain his stride.<lb/>
With his recovered breath his indignation seemed to<lb/>
madden him. He jumped up, crimson, all his white<lb/>
hair bristling, his eyes glaring vengefully, and shook<lb/>
violently the flaps of his ruined waistcoat before the<lb/>
disconcerted Sotillo. "Look! Those uniformed thieves<lb/>
of yours downstairs have robbed me of my watch."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The old sailor's aspect was very threatening. Sotillo<lb/>
saw himself cut off from the table on which his sabre and<lb/>
revolver were lying.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I demand restitution and apologies," Mitchell<lb/>
thundered at him, quite beside himself. "From you!<lb/>
Yes, from you!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   For the space of a second or so the colonel stood with<lb/>
a perfectly stony expression of face; then, as Captain<lb/>
Mitchell flung out an arm towards the table as if to<lb/>
snatch up the revolver, Sotillo, with a yell of alarm,<lb/>
bounded to the door and was gone in a flash, slamming<lb/>
it after him. Surprise calmed Captain Mitchell's fury.<lb/>
Behind the closed door Sotillo shouted on the landing,<lb/>
and there was a great tumult of feet on the wooden<lb/>
staircase.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Disarm him! Bind him!" the colonel could be<lb/>
heard vociferating.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Captain Mitchell had just the time to glance once<lb/>
at the windows, with three perpendicular bars of iron<lb/>
each and some twenty feet from the ground, as he well<lb/>
knew, before the door flew open and the rush upon him<lb/>
took place. In an incredibly short time he found himself<lb/>
bound with many turns of a hide rope to a high-<lb/>
backed chair, so that his head alone remained free. Not<lb/>
till then did Sotillo, who had been leaning in the doorway<lb/>
trembling visibly, venture again within. The<lb/>


<pb n="333"/>

soldiers, picking up from the floor the rifles they had<lb/>
dropped to grapple with the prisoner, filed out of the<lb/>
room. The officers remained leaning on their swords<lb/>
and looking on.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "The watch! the watch!" raved the colonel, pacing<lb/>
to and fro like a tiger in a cage. "Give me that man's<lb/>
watch."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   It was true, that when searched for arms in the hall<lb/>
downstairs, before being taken into Sotillo's presence,<lb/>
Captain Mitchell had been relieved of his watch and<lb/>
chain; but at the colonel's clamour it was produced<lb/>
quickly enough, a corporal bringing it up, carried carefully<lb/>
in the palms of his joined hands. Sotillo snatched<lb/>
it, and pushed the clenched fist from which it dangled<lb/>
close to Captain Mitchell's face.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Now then! You arrogant Englishman! You dare<lb/>
to call the soldiers of the army thieves! Behold your<lb/>
watch."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He flourished his fist as if aiming blows at the prisoner's<lb/>
nose. Captain Mitchell, helpless as a swathed<lb/>
infant, looked anxiously at the sixty-guinea gold half-<lb/>
chronometer, presented to him years ago by a Committee<lb/>
of Underwriters for saving a ship from total loss<lb/>
by fire. Sotillo, too, seemed to perceive its valuable<lb/>
appearance. He became silent suddenly, stepped aside<lb/>
to the table, and began a careful examination in the<lb/>
light of the candles. He had never seen anything so<lb/>
fine. His officers closed in and craned their necks behind<lb/>
his back.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He became so interested that for an instant he forgot<lb/>
his precious prisoner. There is always something<lb/>
childish in the rapacity of the passionate, clear-minded,<lb/>
Southern races, wanting in the misty idealism of the<lb/>
Northerners, who at the smallest encouragement dream<lb/>
of nothing less than the conquest of the earth. Sotillo<lb/>


<pb n="334"/>

was fond of jewels, gold trinkets, of personal adornment.<lb/>
After a moment he turned about, and with a commanding<lb/>
gesture made all his officers fall back. He laid<lb/>
down the watch on the table, then, negligently, pushed<lb/>
his hat over it.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Ha!" he began, going up very close to the chair.<lb/>
"You dare call my valiant soldiers of the Esmeralda<lb/>
regiment, thieves. You dare! What impudence! You<lb/>
foreigners come here to rob our country of its wealth.<lb/>
You never have enough! Your audacity knows no<lb/>
bounds."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He looked towards the officers, amongst whom there<lb/>
was an approving murmur. The older major was<lb/>
moved to declare &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Si, mi colonel. They are all traitors."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I shall say nothing," continued Sotillo, fixing the<lb/>
motionless and powerless Mitchell with an angry but<lb/>
uneasy stare. "I shall say nothing of your treacherous<lb/>
attempt to get possession of my revolver to shoot<lb/>
me while I was trying to treat you with consideration<lb/>
you did not deserve. You have forfeited your<lb/>
life. Your only hope is in my clemency."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He watched for the effect of his words, but there was<lb/>
no obvious sign of fear on Captain Mitchell's face. His<lb/>
white hair was full of dust, which covered also the rest<lb/>
of his helpless person. As if he had heard nothing, he<lb/>
twitched an eyebrow to get rid of a bit of straw which<lb/>
hung amongst the hairs.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo advanced one leg and put his arms akimbo.<lb/>
"It is you, Mitchell," he said, emphatically, "who are<lb/>
the thief, not my soldiers!" He pointed at his prisoner<lb/>
a forefinger with a long, almond-shaped nail. "Where<lb/>
is the silver of the San Tom&eacute; mine? I ask you, Mitchell,<lb/>
where is the silver that was deposited in this Custom<lb/>
House? Answer me that! You stole it. You were a<lb/>


<pb n="335"/>

party to stealing it. It was stolen from the Government.<lb/>
Aha! you think I do not know what I say; but I am up<lb/>
to your foreign tricks. It is gone, the silver! No?<lb/>
Gone in one of your lanchas, you miserable man! How<lb/>
dared you?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   This time he produced his effect. "How on earth<lb/>
could Sotillo know that?" thought Mitchell. His head,<lb/>
the only part of his body that could move, betrayed his<lb/>
surprise by a sudden jerk.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Ha! you tremble," Sotillo shouted, suddenly. "It<lb/>
is a conspiracy. It is a crime against the State. Did<lb/>
you not know that the silver belongs to the Republic till<lb/>
the Government claims are satisfied? Where is it?<lb/>
Where have you hidden it, you miserable thief?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   At this question Captain Mitchell's sinking spirits revived.<lb/>
In whatever incomprehensible manner Sotillo<lb/>
had already got his information about the lighter, he had<lb/>
not captured it. That was clear. In his outraged<lb/>
heart, Captain Mitchell had resolved that nothing<lb/>
would induce him to say a word while he remained so<lb/>
disgracefully bound, but his desire to help the escape of<lb/>
the silver made him depart from this resolution. His<lb/>
wits were very much at work. He detected in Sotillo a<lb/>
certain air of doubt, of irresolution.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "That man," he said to himself, "is not certain of<lb/>
what he advances." For all his pomposity in social<lb/>
intercourse, Captain Mitchell could meet the realities of<lb/>
life in a resolute and ready spirit. Now he had got over<lb/>
the first shock of the abominable treatment he was cool<lb/>
and collected enough. The immense contempt he felt<lb/>
for Sotillo steadied him, and he said oracularly, "No<lb/>
doubt it is well concealed by this time."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo, too, had time to cool down. <hi rend="italic">"Muy bien</hi>,<lb/>
Mitchell," he said in a cold and threatening manner.<lb/>
"But can you produce the Government receipt for the<lb/>


<pb n="336"/>

royalty and the Custom House permit of embarkation,<lb/>
hey? Can you? No. Then the silver has been removed<lb/>
illegally, and the guilty shall be made to suffer,<lb/>
unless it is produced within five days from this." He<lb/>
gave orders for the prisoner to be unbound and locked<lb/>
up in one of the smaller rooms downstairs. He walked<lb/>
about the room, moody and silent, till Captain Mitchell,<lb/>
with each of his arms held by a couple of men, stood up,<lb/>
shook himself, and stamped his feet.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "How did you like to be tied up, Mitchell?" he asked,<lb/>
derisively.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "It is the most incredible, abominable use of power!"<lb/>
Captain Mitchell declared in a loud voice. "And<lb/>
whatever your purpose, you shall gain nothing from it,<lb/>
I can promise you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The tall colonel, livid, with his coal-black ringlets and<lb/>
moustache, crouched, as it were, to look into the eyes of<lb/>
the short, thick-set, red-faced prisoner with rumpled<lb/>
white hair.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "That we shall see. You shall know my power a<lb/>
little better when I tie you up to a <hi rend="italic">potalon</hi> outside in the<lb/>
sun for a whole day." He drew himself up haughtily,<lb/>
and made a sign for Captain Mitchell to be led away.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "What about my watch?" cried Captain Mitchell,<lb/>
hanging back from the efforts of the men pulling him<lb/>
towards the door.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo turned to his officers. "No! But only listen<lb/>
to this picaro, caballeros," he pronounced with affected<lb/>
scorn, and was answered by a chorus of derisive laughter.<lb/>
"He demands his watch!" . . . He ran up<lb/>
again to Captain Mitchell, for the desire to relieve his<lb/>
feelings by inflicting blows and pain upon this Englishman<lb/>
was very strong within him. "Your watch! You<lb/>
are a prisoner in war time, Mitchell! In war time!<lb/>
You have no rights and no property! <hi rend="italic">Caramba!</hi> The<lb/>


<pb n="337"/>

very breath in your body belongs to me. Remember<lb/>
that."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Bosh!" said Captain Mitchell, concealing a disagreeable<lb/>
impression.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Down below, in a great hall, with the earthen floor<lb/>
and with a tall mound thrown up by white ants in a<lb/>
corner, the soldiers had kindled a small fire with broken<lb/>
chairs and tables near the arched gateway, through<lb/>
which the faint murmur of the harbour waters on the<lb/>
beach could be heard. While Captain Mitchell was<lb/>
being led down the staircase, an officer passed him,<lb/>
running up to report to Sotillo the capture of more<lb/>
prisoners. A lot of smoke hung about in the vast<lb/>
gloomy place, the fire crackled, and, as if through a<lb/>
haze, Captain Mitchell made out, surrounded by short<lb/>
soldiers with fixed bayonets, the heads of three tall<lb/>
prisoners &mdash; the doctor, the engineer-in-chief, and the<lb/>
white leonine mane of old Viola, who stood half-turned<lb/>
away from the others with his chin on his breast and his<lb/>
arms crossed. Mitchell's astonishment knew no<lb/>
bounds. He cried out; the other two exclaimed also.<lb/>
But he hurried on, diagonally, across the big cavern-<lb/>
like hall. Lots of thoughts, surmises, hints of caution,<lb/>
and so on, crowded his head to distraction.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Is he actually keeping you?" shouted the chief<lb/>
engineer, whose single eyeglass glittered in the firelight.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   An officer from the top of the stairs was shouting<lb/>
urgently, "Bring them all up &mdash; all three."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   In the clamour of voices and the rattle of arms, Captain<lb/>
Mitchell made himself heard imperfectly: "By<lb/>
heavens! the fellow has stolen my watch."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The engineer-in-chief on the staircase resisted the<lb/>
pressure long enough to shout, "What? What did you<lb/>
say?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "My chronometer!" Captain Mitchell yelled violently<lb/>


<pb n="338"/>

at the very moment of being thrust head foremost<lb/>
through a small door into a sort of cell, perfectly<lb/>
black, and so narrow that he fetched up against the<lb/>
opposite wall. The door had been instantly slammed.<lb/>
He knew where they had put him. This was the strong<lb/>
room of the Custom House, whence the silver had been<lb/>
removed only a few hours earlier. It was almost as<lb/>
narrow as a corridor, with a small square aperture,<lb/>
barred by a heavy grating, at the distant end. Captain<lb/>
Mitchell staggered for a few steps, then sat down on the<lb/>
earthen floor with his back to the wall. Nothing, not<lb/>
even a gleam of light from anywhere, interfered with<lb/>
Captain Mitchell's meditation. He did some hard<lb/>
but not very extensive thinking. It was not of a<lb/>
gloomy cast. The old sailor, with all his small weaknesses<lb/>
and absurdities, was constitutionally incapable<lb/>
of entertaining for any length of time a fear of his personal<lb/>
safety. It was not so much firmness of soul as the<lb/>
lack of a certain kind of imagination &mdash; the kind whose<lb/>
undue development caused intense suffering to Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Hirsch; that sort of imagination which adds the blind<lb/>
terror of bodily suffering and of death, envisaged as an<lb/>
accident to the body alone, strictly &mdash; to all the other<lb/>
apprehensions on which the sense of one's existence is<lb/>
based. Unfortunately, Captain Mitchell had not much<lb/>
penetration of any kind; characteristic, illuminating<lb/>
trifles of expression, action, or movement, escaped him<lb/>
completely. He was too pompously and innocently<lb/>
aware of his own existence to observe that of others.<lb/>
For instance, he could not believe that Sotillo had been<lb/>
really afraid of him, and this simply because it would<lb/>
never have entered into his head to shoot any one<lb/>
except in the most pressing case of self-defence. Anybody<lb/>
could see he was not a murdering kind of man, he<lb/>
reflected quite gravely. Then why this preposterous<lb/>


<pb n="339"/>

and insulting charge? he asked himself.   But his<lb/>
thoughts mainly clung around the astounding and unanswerable<lb/>
question: How the devil the fellow got to<lb/>
know that the silver had gone off in the lighter? It was<lb/>
obvious that he had not captured it. And, obviously,<lb/>
he could not have captured it! In this last conclusion<lb/>
Captain Mitchell was misled by the assumption drawn<lb/>
from his observation of the weather during his long<lb/>
vigil on the wharf. He thought that there had been<lb/>
much more wind than usual that night in the gulf;<lb/>
whereas, as a matter of fact, the reverse was the case.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "How in the name of all that's marvellous did that<lb/>
confounded fellow get wind of the affair?" was the first<lb/>
question he asked directly after the bang, clatter, and<lb/>
flash of the open door (which was closed again almost<lb/>
before he could lift his dropped head) informed him that<lb/>
he had a companion of captivity. Dr. Monygham's<lb/>
voice stopped muttering curses in English and Spanish.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Is that you, Mitchell?" he made answer, surlily. "I<lb/>
struck my forehead against this confounded wall with<lb/>
enough force to fell an ox. Where are you?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Captain Mitchell, accustomed to the darkness, could<lb/>
make out the doctor stretching out his hands blindly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I am sitting here on the floor. Don't fall over my<lb/>
legs," Captain Mitchell's voice announced with great<lb/>
dignity of tone. The doctor, entreated not to walk<lb/>
about in the dark, sank down to the ground, too. The<lb/>
two prisoners of Sotillo, with their heads nearly touching,<lb/>
began to exchange confidences.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes," the doctor related in a low tone to Captain<lb/>
Mitchell's vehement curiosity, "we have been nabbed<lb/>
in old Viola's place. It seems that one of their pickets,<lb/>
commanded by an officer, pushed as far as the town<lb/>
gate. They had orders not to enter, but to bring along<lb/>
every soul they could find on the plain. We had been<lb/>


<pb n="340"/>

talking in there with the door open, and no doubt they<lb/>
saw the glimmer of our light. They must have been<lb/>
making their approaches for some time. The engineer<lb/>
laid himself on a bench in a recess by the fire-place, and<lb/>
I went upstairs to have a look. I hadn't heard any<lb/>
sound from there for a long time. Old Viola, as soon as<lb/>
he saw me come up, lifted his arm for silence. I stole in<lb/>
on tiptoe. By Jove, his wife was lying down and had<lb/>
gone to sleep. The woman had actually dropped off to<lb/>
sleep! 'Se&ntilde;or Doctor,' Viola whispers to me, 'it looks<lb/>
as if her oppression was going to get better.' 'Yes,' I<lb/>
said, very much surprised; 'your wife is a wonderful<lb/>
woman, Giorgio.' Just then a shot was fired in the<lb/>
kitchen, which made us jump and cower as if at a thunder-clap.<lb/>
It seems that the party of soldiers had<lb/>
stolen quite close up, and one of them had crept up to<lb/>
the door. He looked in, thought there was no one there,<lb/>
and, holding his rifle ready, entered quietly. The chief<lb/>
told me that he had just closed his eyes for a moment.<lb/>
When he opened them, he saw the man already in the<lb/>
middle of the room peering into the dark corners. The<lb/>
chief was so startled that, without thinking, he made<lb/>
one leap from the recess right out in front of the fireplace.<lb/>
The soldier, no less startled, up with his rifle<lb/>
and pulls the trigger, deafening and singeing the engineer,<lb/>
but in his flurry missing him completely. But,<lb/>
look what happens! At the noise of the report the<lb/>
sleeping woman sat up, as if moved by a spring, with a<lb/>
shriek, 'The children, Gian' Battista! Save the children!'<lb/>
I have it in my ears now. It was the truest cry<lb/>
of distress I ever heard. I stood as if paralyzed, but<lb/>
the old husband ran across to the bedside, stretching out<lb/>
his hands. She clung to them! I could see her eyes<lb/>
go glazed; the old fellow lowered her down on the pillows<lb/>
and then looked round at me. She was dead!<lb/>


<pb n="341"/>

All this took less than five minutes, and then I ran down<lb/>
to see what was the matter. It was no use thinking of<lb/>
any resistance. Nothing we two could say availed with<lb/>
the officer, so I volunteered to go up with a couple of<lb/>
soldiers and fetch down old Viola. He was sitting at<lb/>
the foot of the bed, looking at his wife's face, and did not<lb/>
seem to hear what I said; but after I had pulled the<lb/>
sheet over her head, he got up and followed us downstairs<lb/>
quietly, in a sort of thoughtful way. They<lb/>
marched us off along the road, leaving the door open<lb/>
and the candle burning. The chief engineer strode on<lb/>
without a word, but I looked back once or twice at the<lb/>
feeble gleam. After we had gone some considerable<lb/>
distance, the Garibaldino, who was walking by my side,<lb/>
suddenly said, 'I have buried many men on battlefields<lb/>
on this continent. The priests talk of consecrated<lb/>
ground! Bah! All the earth made by God is holy;<lb/>
but the sea, which knows nothing of kings and priests<lb/>
and tyrants, is the holiest of all. Doctor! I should like<lb/>
to bury her in the sea. No mummeries, candles, incense,<lb/>
no holy water mumbled over by priests. The<lb/>
spirit of liberty is upon the waters.' . . . Amazing<lb/>
old man. He was saying all this in an undertone<lb/>
as if talking to himself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes, yes," interrupted Captain Mitchell, impatiently.<lb/>
"Poor old chap! But have you any idea how<lb/>
that ruffian Sotillo obtained his information? He did not<lb/>
get hold of any of our Cargadores who helped with the<lb/>
truck, did he? But no, it is impossible! These were<lb/>
picked men we've had in our boats for these five years,<lb/>
and I paid them myself specially for the job, with instructions<lb/>
to keep out of the way for twenty-four hours at<lb/>
least. I saw them with my own eyes march on with the<lb/>
Italians to the railway yards. The chief promised to give<lb/>
them rations as long as they wanted to remain there."<lb/>


<pb n="342"/>

</p>

<p>   "Well," said the doctor, slowly, "I can tell you that<lb/>
you may say good-bye for ever to your best lighter, and<lb/>
to the Capataz of Cargadores."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   At this, Captain Mitchell scrambled up to his feet in<lb/>
the excess of his excitement. The doctor, without giving<lb/>
him time to exclaim, stated briefly the part played<lb/>
by Hirsch during the night.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Captain Mitchell was overcome. "Drowned!" he<lb/>
muttered, in a bewildered and appalled whisper.<lb/>
"Drowned!" Afterwards he kept still, apparently<lb/>
listening, but too absorbed in the news of the catastrophe<lb/>
to follow the doctor's narrative with attention.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The doctor had taken up an attitude of perfect<lb/>
ignorance, till at last Sotillo was induced to have<lb/>
Hirsch brought in to repeat the whole story, which was<lb/>
got out of him again with the greatest difficulty, because<lb/>
every moment he would break out into lamentations.<lb/>
At last, Hirsch was led away, looking more dead<lb/>
than alive, and shut up in one of the upstairs rooms to<lb/>
be close at hand. Then the doctor, keeping up his<lb/>
character of a man not admitted to the inner councils of<lb/>
the San Tom&eacute; Administration, remarked that the story<lb/>
sounded incredible. Of course, he said, he couldn't<lb/>
tell what had been the action of the Europeans, as he<lb/>
had been exclusively occupied with his own work in<lb/>
looking after the wounded, and also in attending Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute; Avellanos. He had succeeded in assuming so well<lb/>
a tone of impartial indifference, that Sotillo seemed<lb/>
to be completely deceived. Till then a show of regular<lb/>
inquiry had been kept up; one of the officers sitting at<lb/>
the table wrote down the questions and the answers, the<lb/>
others, lounging about the room, listened attentively,<lb/>
puffing at their long cigars and keeping their eyes on the<lb/>
doctor. But at that point Sotillo ordered everybody<lb/>
out.<lb/>
</p>


</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="3" id="d29">
<head>CHAPTER THREE</head>

<pb n="343"/>


<p>   DIRECTLY they were alone, the colonel's severe official<lb/>
manner changed. He rose and approached the doctor.<lb/>
His eyes shone with rapacity and hope; he became confidential.<lb/>
"The silver might have been indeed put on<lb/>
board the lighter, but it was not conceivable that it<lb/>
should have been taken out to sea." The doctor,<lb/>
watching every word, nodded slightly, smoking with<lb/>
apparent relish the cigar which Sotillo had offered him<lb/>
as a sign of his friendly intentions. The doctor's<lb/>
manner of cold detachment from the rest of the Europeans<lb/>
led Sotillo on, till, from conjecture to conjecture,<lb/>
he arrived at hinting that in his opinion this was a put-<lb/>
up job on the part of Charles Gould, in order to get hold<lb/>
of that immense treasure all to himself. The doctor,<lb/>
observant and self-possessed, muttered, "He is very<lb/>
capable of that."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Here Captain Mitchell exclaimed with amazement,<lb/>
amusement, and indignation, "You said that of Charles<lb/>
Gould!" Disgust, and even some suspicion, crept into<lb/>
his tone, for to him, too, as to other Europeans, there appeared<lb/>
to be something dubious about the doctor's<lb/>
personality.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "What on earth made you say that to this watch-<lb/>
stealing scoundrel?" he asked. "What's the object of<lb/>
an infernal lie of that sort? That confounded pick-<lb/>
pocket was quite capable of believing you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He snorted. For a time the doctor remained silent<lb/>
in the dark.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes, that is exactly what I did say," he uttered at<lb/>




<pb n="344"/>

last, in a tone which would have made it clear enough<lb/>
to a third party that the pause was not of a reluctant but<lb/>
of a reflective character. Captain Mitchell thought<lb/>
that he had never heard anything so brazenly impudent<lb/>
in his life.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Well, well!" he muttered to himself, but he had not<lb/>
the heart to voice his thoughts. They were swept<lb/>
away by others full of astonishment and regret. A<lb/>
heavy sense of discomfiture crushed him: the loss of the<lb/>
silver, the death of Nostromo, which was really quite a<lb/>
blow to his sensibilities, because he had become attached<lb/>
to his Capataz as people get attached to their inferiors<lb/>
from love of ease and almost unconscious gratitude.<lb/>
And when he thought of Decoud being drowned, too, his<lb/>
sensibility was almost overcome by this miserable end.<lb/>
What a heavy blow for that poor young woman! Captain<lb/>
Mitchell did not belong to the species of crabbed<lb/>
old bachelors; on the contrary, he liked to see young<lb/>
men paying attentions to young women. It seemed to<lb/>
him a natural and proper thing. Proper especially.<lb/>
As to sailors, it was different; it was not their place to<lb/>
marry, he maintained, but it was on moral grounds as a<lb/>
matter of self-denial, for, he explained, life on board<lb/>
ship is not fit for a woman even at best, and if you leave<lb/>
her on shore, first of all it is not fair, and next she either<lb/>
suffers from it or doesn't care a bit, which, in both cases,<lb/>
is bad. He couldn't have told what upset him most &mdash;<lb/>
Charles Gould's immense material loss, the death of<lb/>
Nostromo, which was a heavy loss to himself, or the<lb/>
idea of that beautiful and accomplished young woman<lb/>
being plunged into mourning.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes," the doctor, who had been apparently reflecting,<lb/>
began again, "he believed me right enough.<lb/>
I thought he would have hugged me. 'Si, si,' he<lb/>
said, 'he will write to that partner of his, the rich<lb/>


<pb n="345"/>

Americano in San Francisco, that it is all lost. Why<lb/>
not? There is enough to share with many people.'"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "But this is perfectly imbecile!" cried Captain<lb/>
Mitchell.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The doctor remarked that Sotillo <hi rend="italic">was</hi> imbecile, and<lb/>
that his imbecility was ingenious enough to lead him completely<lb/>
astray. He had helped him only but a little way.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I mentioned," the doctor said, "in a sort of casual<lb/>
way, that treasure is generally buried in the earth<lb/>
rather than set afloat upon the sea. At this my Sotillo<lb/>
slapped his forehead. '<hi rend="italic">Por Dios</hi>, yes,' he said;<lb/>
'they must have buried it on the shores of this harbour<lb/>
somewhere before they sailed out.'"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Heavens and earth!" muttered Captain Mitchell,<lb/>
"I should not have believed that anybody could be ass<lb/>
enough &mdash;" He paused, then went on mournfully:<lb/>
"But what's the good of all this? It would have been<lb/>
a clever enough lie if the lighter had been still afloat. It<lb/>
would have kept that inconceivable idiot perhaps from<lb/>
sending out the steamer to cruise in the gulf. That was<lb/>
the danger that worried me no end." Captain Mitchell<lb/>
sighed profoundly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I had an object," the doctor pronounced, slowly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Had you?" muttered Captain Mitchell.  "Well,<lb/>
that's lucky, or else I would have thought that you<lb/>
went on fooling him for the fun of the thing. And perhaps<lb/>
that was your object. Well, I must say I personally<lb/>
wouldn't condescend to that sort of thing. It is<lb/>
not to my taste. No, no. Blackening a friend's<lb/>
character is not my idea of fun, if it were to fool the<lb/>
greatest blackguard on earth."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Had it not been for Captain Mitchell's depression,<lb/>
caused by the fatal news, his disgust of Dr. Monygham<lb/>
would have taken a more outspoken shape; but he<lb/>
thought to himself that now it really did not matter<lb/>


<pb n="346"/>

what that man, whom he had never liked, would say<lb/>
and do.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I wonder," he grumbled, "why they have shut us<lb/>
up together, or why Sotillo should have shut you up at<lb/>
all, since it seems to me you have been fairly chummy up<lb/>
there?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes, I wonder," said the doctor grimly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Captain Mitchell's heart was so heavy that he would<lb/>
have preferred for the time being a complete solitude to<lb/>
the best of company. But any company would have<lb/>
been preferable to the doctor's, at whom he had always<lb/>
looked askance as a sort of beachcomber of superior<lb/>
intelligence partly reclaimed from his abased state.<lb/>
That feeling led him to ask &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "What has that ruffian done with the other two?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "The chief engineer he would have let go in any case,"<lb/>
said the doctor. "He wouldn't like to have a quarrel<lb/>
with the railway upon his hands. Not just yet, at any<lb/>
rate. I don't think, Captain Mitchell, that you understand<lb/>
exactly what Sotillo's position is &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I don't see why I should bother my head about it,"<lb/>
snarled Captain Mitchell.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "No," assented the doctor, with the same grim composure.<lb/>
"I don't see why you should. It wouldn't<lb/>
help a single human being in the world if you thought<lb/>
ever so hard upon any subject whatever."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "No," said Captain Mitchell, simply, and with<lb/>
evident depression. "A man locked up in a confounded<lb/>
dark hole is not much use to anybody."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "As to old Viola," the doctor continued, as though<lb/>
he had not heard, "Sotillo released him for the same<lb/>
reason he is presently going to release you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Eh? What?" exclaimed Captain Mitchell, staring<lb/>
like an owl in the darkness. "What is there in common<lb/>
between me and old Viola? More likely because the<lb/>


<pb n="347"/>

old chap has no watch and chain for the pickpocket to<lb/>
steal. And I tell you what, Dr. Monygham," he went<lb/>
on with rising choler, "he will find it more difficult than<lb/>
he thinks to get rid of me. He will burn his fingers over<lb/>
that job yet, I can tell you. To begin with, I won't go<lb/>
without my watch, and as to the rest &mdash; we shall see. I<lb/>
dare say it is no great matter for you to be locked up.<lb/>
But Joe Mitchell is a different kind of man, sir. I<lb/>
don't mean to submit tamely to insult and robbery. I<lb/>
am a public character, sir."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   And then Captain Mitchell became aware that the<lb/>
bars of the opening had become visible, a black grating<lb/>
upon a square of grey. The coming of the day silenced<lb/>
Captain Mitchell as if by the reflection that now in all<lb/>
the future days he would be deprived of the invaluable<lb/>
services of his Capataz. He leaned against the wall<lb/>
with his arms folded on his breast, and the doctor<lb/>
walked up and down the whole length of the place<lb/>
with his peculiar hobbling gait, as if slinking about on<lb/>
damaged feet. At the end furthest from the grating he<lb/>
would be lost altogether in the darkness. Only the<lb/>
slight limping shuffle could be heard. There was an air<lb/>
of moody detachment in that painful prowl kept up<lb/>
without a pause. When the door of the prison was<lb/>
suddenly flung open and his name shouted out he<lb/>
showed no surprise. He swerved sharply in his walk,<lb/>
and passed out at once, as though much depended upon<lb/>
his speed; but Captain Mitchell remained for some<lb/>
time with his shoulders against the wall, quite undecided<lb/>
in the bitterness of his spirit whether it wouldn't be<lb/>
better to refuse to stir a limb in the way of protest. He<lb/>
had half a mind to get himself carried out, but after the<lb/>
officer at the door had shouted three or four times in<lb/>
tones of remonstrance and surprise he condescended to<lb/>
walk out.<lb/>


<pb n="348"/>

</p>

<p>   Sotillo's manner had changed. The colonel's offhand<lb/>
civility was slightly irresolute, as though he were in<lb/>
doubt if civility were the proper course in this case. He<lb/>
observed Captain Mitchell attentively before he spoke<lb/>
from the big armchair behind the table in a condescending<lb/>
voice &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I have concluded not to detain you, Se&ntilde;or Mitchell.<lb/>
I am of a forgiving disposition. I make allowances.<lb/>
Let this be a lesson to you, however."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The peculiar dawn of Sulaco, which seems to break<lb/>
far away to the westward and creep back into the shade<lb/>
of the mountains, mingled with the reddish light of the<lb/>
candles. Captain Mitchell, in sign of contempt and<lb/>
indifference, let his eyes roam all over the room, and he<lb/>
gave a hard stare to the doctor, perched already on the<lb/>
casement of one of the windows, with his eyelids<lb/>
lowered, careless and thoughtful &mdash; or perhaps ashamed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo, ensconced in the vast armchair, remarked, "I<lb/>
should have thought that the feelings of a caballero<lb/>
would have dictated to you an appropriate reply."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He waited for it, but Captain Mitchell remaining<lb/>
mute, more from extreme resentment than from<lb/>
reasoned intention, Sotillo hesitated, glanced towards<lb/>
the doctor, who looked up and nodded, then went on<lb/>
with a slight effort &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Here, Se&ntilde;or Mitchell, is your watch. Learn how<lb/>
hasty and unjust has been your judgment of my<lb/>
patriotic soldiers."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Lying back in his seat, he extended his arm over the<lb/>
table and pushed the watch away slightly. Captain<lb/>
Mitchell walked up with undisguised eagerness, put it<lb/>
to his ear, then slipped it into his pocket coolly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo seemed to overcome an immense reluctance.<lb/>
Again he looked aside at the doctor, who stared at him<lb/>
unwinkingly.<lb/>


<pb n="349"/>

</p>

<p>   But as Captain Mitchell was turning away, without<lb/>
as much as a nod or a glance, he hastened to<lb/>
say &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You may go and wait downstairs for the se&ntilde;or doctor,<lb/>
whom I am going to liberate, too. You foreigners<lb/>
are insignificant, to my mind."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He forced a slight, discordant laugh out of himself,<lb/>
while Captain Mitchell, for the first time, looked at him<lb/>
with some interest.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "The law shall take note later on of your transgressions,"<lb/>
Sotillo hurried on. "But as for me, you can<lb/>
live free, unguarded, unobserved. Do you hear, Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Mitchell? You may depart to your affairs. You are<lb/>
beneath my notice. My attention is claimed by matters<lb/>
of the very highest importance."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Captain Mitchell was very nearly provoked to an<lb/>
answer. It displeased him to be liberated insultingly;<lb/>
but want of sleep, prolonged anxieties, a profound<lb/>
disappointment with the fatal ending of the silver-<lb/>
saving business weighed upon his spirits. It was as<lb/>
much as he could do to conceal his uneasiness, not<lb/>
about himself perhaps, but about things in general.<lb/>
It occurred to him distinctly that something underhand<lb/>
was going on. As he went out he ignored the<lb/>
doctor pointedly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "A brute!" said Sotillo, as the door shut.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Dr. Monygham slipped off the window-sill, and,<lb/>
thrusting his hands into the pockets of the long, grey<lb/>
dust coat he was wearing, made a few steps into the<lb/>
room.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo got up, too, and, putting himself in the way,<lb/>
examined him from head to foot.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "So your countrymen do not confide in you very<lb/>
much, se&ntilde;or doctor. They do not love you, eh? Why<lb/>
is that, I wonder?"<lb/>


<pb n="350"/>

</p>

<p>   The doctor, lifting his head, answered by a long, lifeless<lb/>
stare and the words, "Perhaps because I have lived<lb/>
too long in Costaguana."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Sotillo had a gleam of white teeth under the black<lb/>
moustache.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Aha! But you love yourself," he said, encouragingly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
  "If you leave them alone," the doctor said, looking<lb/>
with the same lifeless stare at Sotillo's handsome face,<lb/>
"they will betray themselves very soon. Meantime, I<lb/>
may try to make Don Carlos speak?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Ah! se&ntilde;or doctor," said Sotillo, wagging his head,<lb/>
"you are a man of quick intelligence. We were made<lb/>
to understand each other." He turned away. He<lb/>
could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless<lb/>
stare, which seemed to have a sort of impenetrable<lb/>
emptiness like the black depth of an abyss.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Even in a man utterly devoid of moral sense there<lb/>
remains an appreciation of rascality which, being conventional,<lb/>
is perfectly clear. Sotillo thought that Dr.<lb/>
Monygham, so different from all Europeans, was ready<lb/>
to sell his countrymen and Charles Gould, his employer,<lb/>
for some share of the San Tom&eacute; silver. Sotillo did not<lb/>
despise him for that. The colonel's want of moral<lb/>
sense was of a profound and innocent character. It<lb/>
bordered upon stupidity, moral stupidity. Nothing<lb/>
that served his ends could appear to him really reprehensible.<lb/>
Nevertheless, he despised Dr. Monygham.<lb/>
He had for him an immense and satisfactory contempt.<lb/>
He despised him with all his heart because he did not<lb/>
mean to let the doctor have any reward at all. He<lb/>
despised him, not as a man without faith and honour,<lb/>
but as a fool. Dr. Monygham's insight into his<lb/>
character had deceived Sotillo completely. Therefore<lb/>
he thought the doctor a fool.<lb/>


<pb n="351"/>

</p>

<p>   Since his arrival in Sulaco the colonel's ideas had<lb/>
undergone some modification.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He no longer wished for a political career in Montero's<lb/>
administration. He had always doubted the safety of<lb/>
that course. Since he had learned from the chief<lb/>
engineer that at daylight most likely he would be confronted<lb/>
by Pedro Montero his misgivings on that point<lb/>
had considerably increased. The guerrillero brother of<lb/>
the general &mdash; the Pedrito of popular speech &mdash; had a<lb/>
reputation of his own. He wasn't safe to deal with.<lb/>
Sotillo had vaguely planned seizing not only the treasure<lb/>
but the town itself, and then negotiating at leisure.<lb/>
But in the face of facts learned from the chief engineer<lb/>
(who had frankly disclosed to him the whole situation)<lb/>
his audacity, never of a very dashing kind, had been<lb/>
replaced by a most cautious hesitation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "An army &mdash; an army crossed the mountains under<lb/>
Pedrito already," he had repeated, unable to hide his<lb/>
consternation. "If it had not been that I am given the<lb/>
news by a man of your position I would never have<lb/>
believed it. Astonishing!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "An armed force," corrected the engineer, suavely.<lb/>
His aim was attained. It was to keep Sulaco clear of<lb/>
any armed occupation for a few hours longer, to let<lb/>
those whom fear impelled leave the town. In the<lb/>
general dismay there were families hopeful enough to<lb/>
fly upon the road towards Los Hatos, which was left open<lb/>
by the withdrawal of the armed rabble under Se&ntilde;ores<lb/>
Fuentes and Gamacho, to Rincon, with their enthusiastic<lb/>
welcome for Pedro Montero. It was a hasty and<lb/>
risky exodus, and it was said that Hernandez, occupying<lb/>
with his band the woods about Los Hatos, was receiving<lb/>
the fugitives. That a good many people he<lb/>
knew were contemplating such a flight had been well<lb/>
known to the chief engineer.<lb/>


<pb n="352"/>

</p>

<p>   Father Corbel&agrave;n's efforts in the cause of that most<lb/>
pious robber had not been altogether fruitless. The<lb/>
political chief of Sulaco had yielded at the last moment<lb/>
to the urgent entreaties of the priest, had signed a<lb/>
provisional nomination appointing Hernandez a general,<lb/>
and calling upon him officially in this new capacity to<lb/>
preserve order in the town. The fact is that the<lb/>
political chief, seeing the situation desperate, did not<lb/>
care what he signed. It was the last official document<lb/>
he signed before he left the palace of the Intendencia<lb/>
for the refuge of the O.S.N. Company's office. But<lb/>
even had he meant his act to be effective it was already<lb/>
too late. The riot which he feared and expected broke<lb/>
out in less than an hour after Father Corbel&agrave;n had left<lb/>
him. Indeed, Father Corbel&agrave;n, who had appointed a<lb/>
meeting with Nostromo in the Dominican Convent,<lb/>
where he had his residence in one of the cells, never<lb/>
managed to reach the place. From the Intendencia he<lb/>
had gone straight on to the Avellanos's house to tell<lb/>
his brother-in-law, and though he stayed there no<lb/>
more than half an hour he had found himself cut off<lb/>
from his ascetic abode. Nostromo, after waiting there<lb/>
for some time, watching uneasily the increasing uproar<lb/>
in the street, had made his way to the offices of the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi>, and stayed there till daylight, as Decoud had<lb/>
mentioned in the letter to his sister. Thus the Capataz,<lb/>
instead of riding towards the Los Hatos woods as<lb/>
bearer of Hernandez's nomination, had remained in<lb/>
town to save the life of the President Dictator, to assist<lb/>
in repressing the outbreak of the mob, and at last to sail<lb/>
out with the silver of the mine.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   But Father Corbel&agrave;n, escaping to Hernandez, had the<lb/>
document in his pocket, a piece of official writing turning<lb/>
a bandit into a general in a memorable last official<lb/>
act of the Ribierist party, whose watchwords were<lb/>


<pb n="353"/>

honesty, peace, and progress. Probably neither the<lb/>
priest nor the bandit saw the irony of it. Father<lb/>
Corbel&agrave;n must have found messengers to send into the<lb/>
town, for early on the second day of the disturbances<lb/>
there were rumours of Hernandez being on the road to<lb/>
Los Hatos ready to receive those who would put themselves<lb/>
under his protection. A strange-looking horseman,<lb/>
elderly and audacious, had appeared in the town, riding<lb/>
slowly while his eyes examined the fronts of the houses,<lb/>
as though he had never seen such high buildings before.<lb/>
Before the cathedral he had dismounted, and, kneeling<lb/>
in the middle of the Plaza, his bridle over his arm and<lb/>
his hat lying in front of him on the ground, had bowed<lb/>
his head, crossing himself and beating his breast for<lb/>
some little time. Remounting his horse, with a fearless<lb/>
but not unfriendly look round the little gathering<lb/>
formed about his public devotions, he had asked for the<lb/>
Casa Avellanos. A score of hands were extended in<lb/>
answer, with fingers pointing up the Calle de la Constitucion.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
  The horseman had gone on with only a glance of<lb/>
casual curiosity upwards to the windows of the Amarilla<lb/>
Club at the corner. His stentorian voice shouted<lb/>
periodically in the empty street, "Which is the Casa<lb/>
Avellanos?" till an answer came from the scared porter,<lb/>
and he disappeared under the gate. The letter he was<lb/>
bringing, written by Father Corbel&agrave;n with a pencil by<lb/>
the camp-fire of Hernandez, was addressed to Don Jos&eacute;,<lb/>
of whose critical state the priest was not aware. Antonia<lb/>
read it, and, after consulting Charles Gould, sent<lb/>
it on for the information of the gentlemen garrisoning<lb/>
the Amarilla Club. For herself, her mind was made<lb/>
up; she would rejoin her uncle; she would entrust the<lb/>
last day &mdash; the last hours perhaps &mdash; of her father's life<lb/>
to the keeping of the bandit, whose existence was a<lb/>


<pb n="354"/>

protest against the irresponsible tyranny of all parties<lb/>
alike, against the moral darkness of the land. The<lb/>
gloom of Los Hatos woods was preferable; a life of hardships<lb/>
in the train of a robber band less debasing. Antonia<lb/>
embraced with all her soul her uncle's obstinate<lb/>
defiance of misfortune. It was grounded in the belief<lb/>
in the man whom she loved.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   In his message the Vicar-General answered upon his<lb/>
head for Hernandez's fidelity. As to his power, he<lb/>
pointed out that he had remained unsubdued for so<lb/>
many years. In that letter Decoud's idea of the new<lb/>
Occidental State (whose flourishing and stable condition<lb/>
is a matter of common knowledge now) was for<lb/>
the first time made public and used as an argument.<lb/>
Hernandez, ex-bandit and the last general of Ribierist<lb/>
creation, was confident of being able to hold the tract of<lb/>
country between the woods of Los Hatos and the coast<lb/>
range till that devoted patriot, Don Martin Decoud,<lb/>
could bring General Barrios back to Sulaco for the re-<lb/>
conquest of the town.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Heaven itself wills it. Providence is on our side,"<lb/>
wrote Father Corbel&agrave;n; there was no time to reflect upon<lb/>
or to controvert his statement; and if the discussion<lb/>
started upon the reading of that letter in the Amarilla<lb/>
Club was violent, it was also shortlived. In the<lb/>
general bewilderment of the collapse some jumped at<lb/>
the idea with joyful astonishment as upon the amazing<lb/>
discovery of a new hope. Others became fascinated by<lb/>
the prospect of immediate personal safety for their<lb/>
women and children. The majority caught at it as a<lb/>
drowning man catches at a straw.   Father Corbel&agrave;n<lb/>
was unexpectedly offering them a refuge from Pedrito<lb/>
Montero with his llaneros allied to Se&ntilde;ores Fuentes and<lb/>
Gamacho with their armed rabble.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   All the latter part of the afternoon an animated<lb/>


<pb n="355"/>

discussion went on in the big rooms of the Amarilla<lb/>
Club. Even those members posted at the windows<lb/>
with rifles and carbines to guard the end of the street<lb/>
in case of an offensive return of the populace shouted<lb/>
their opinions and arguments over their shoulders. As<lb/>
dusk fell Don Juste Lopez, inviting those caballeros who<lb/>
were of his way of thinking to follow him, withdrew<lb/>
into the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>, where at a little table in the light of<lb/>
two candles he busied himself in composing an address,<lb/>
or rather a solemn declaration to be presented to Pedrito<lb/>
Montero by a deputation of such members of<lb/>
Assembly as had elected to remain in town. His idea<lb/>
was to propitiate him in order to save the form at least<lb/>
of parliamentary institutions. Seated before a blank<lb/>
sheet of paper, a goose-quill pen in his hand and surged<lb/>
upon from all sides, he turned to the right and to the<lb/>
left, repeating with solemn insistence &mdash;<lb/>
    "Caballeros, a moment of silence! A moment of<lb/>
silence! We ought to make it clear that we bow in all<lb/>
good faith to the accomplished facts."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The utterance of that phrase seemed to give him a<lb/>
melancholy satisfaction. The hubbub of voices round<lb/>
him was growing strained and hoarse. In the sudden<lb/>
pauses the excited grimacing of the faces would sink all<lb/>
at once into the stillness of profound dejection.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Meantime, the exodus had begun. Carretas full of<lb/>
ladies and children rolled swaying across the Plaza, with<lb/>
men walking or riding by their side; mounted parties<lb/>
followed on mules and horses; the poorest were setting<lb/>
out on foot, men and women carrying bundles, clasping<lb/>
babies in their arms, leading old people, dragging along<lb/>
the bigger children. When Charles Gould, after leaving<lb/>
the doctor and the engineer at the Casa Viola, entered<lb/>
the town by the harbour gate, all those that had meant<lb/>
to go were gone, and the others had barricaded themselves<lb/>


<pb n="356"/>

in their houses. In the whole dark street there<lb/>
was only one spot of flickering lights and moving figures,<lb/>
where the Se&ntilde;or Administrador recognized his wife's<lb/>
carriage waiting at the door of the Avellanos's house.<lb/>
He rode up, almost unnoticed, and looked on without a<lb/>
word while some of his own servants came out of the<lb/>
gate carrying Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos, who, with closed eyes<lb/>
and motionless features, appeared perfectly lifeless.<lb/>
His wife and Antonia walked on each side of the improvised<lb/>
stretcher, which was put at once into the<lb/>
carriage. The two women embraced; while from the<lb/>
other side of the landau Father Corbel&agrave;n's emissary,<lb/>
with his ragged beard all streaked with grey, and high,<lb/>
bronzed cheek-bones, stared, sitting upright in the<lb/>
saddle. Then Antonia, dry-eyed, got in by the side of<lb/>
the stretcher, and, after making the sign of the cross<lb/>
rapidly, lowered a thick veil upon her face. The<lb/>
servants and the three or four neighbours who had come<lb/>
to assist, stood back, uncovering their heads. On the<lb/>
box, Ignacio, resigned now to driving all night (and to<lb/>
having perhaps his throat cut before daylight) looked<lb/>
back surlily over his shoulder.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Drive carefully," cried Mrs. Gould in a tremulous<lb/>
voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   <hi rend="italic">"Si</hi>, carefully; <hi rend="italic">si ni&ntilde;a</hi>," he mumbled, chewing his<lb/>
lips, his round leathery cheeks quivering. And the<lb/>
landau rolled slowly out of the light.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I will see them as far as the ford," said Charles<lb/>
Gould to his wife. She stood on the edge of the sidewalk<lb/>
with her hands clasped lightly, and nodded to him<lb/>
as he followed after the carriage. And now the windows<lb/>
of the Amarilla Club were dark. The last spark<lb/>
of resistance had died out. Turning his head at the<lb/>
corner, Charles Gould saw his wife crossing over to their<lb/>
own gate in the lighted patch of the street. One of their<lb/>


<pb n="357"/>

neighbours, a well-known merchant and landowner of<lb/>
the province, followed at her elbow, talking with great<lb/>
gestures. As she passed in all the lights went out in the<lb/>
street, which remained dark and empty from end to end.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The houses of the vast Plaza were lost in the night.<lb/>
High up, like a star, there was a small gleam in one of<lb/>
the towers of the cathedral; and the equestrian statue<lb/>
gleamed pale against the black trees of the Alameda,<lb/>
like a ghost of royalty haunting the scenes of revolution.<lb/>
The rare prowlers they met ranged themselves against<lb/>
the wall. Beyond the last houses the carriage rolled<lb/>
noiselessly on the soft cushion of dust, and with a<lb/>
greater obscurity a feeling of freshness seemed to fall<lb/>
from the foliage of the trees bordering the country road.<lb/>
The emissary from Hernandez's camp pushed his horse<lb/>
close to Charles Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Caballero," he said in an interested voice, "you are<lb/>
he whom they call the King of Sulaco, the master of the<lb/>
mine? Is it not so?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Yes, I am the master of the mine," answered<lb/>
Charles Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The man cantered for a time in silence, then said, "I<lb/>
have a brother, a sere&ntilde;o in your service in the San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; valley. You have proved yourself a just man.<lb/>
There has been no wrong done to any one since you<lb/>
called upon the people to work in the mountains. My<lb/>
brother says that no official of the Government, no<lb/>
oppressor of the Campo, has been seen on your side of<lb/>
the stream. Your own officials do not oppress the<lb/>
people in the gorge. Doubtless they are afraid of your<lb/>
severity. You are a just man and a powerful one," he<lb/>
added.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He spoke in an abrupt, independent tone, but evidently<lb/>
he was communicative with a purpose. He told<lb/>
Charles Gould that he had been a ranchero in one of the<lb/>


<pb n="358"/>

lower valleys, far south, a neighbour of Hernandez in<lb/>
the old days, and godfather to his eldest boy; one of<lb/>
those who joined him in his resistance to the recruiting<lb/>
raid which was the beginning of all their misfortunes.<lb/>
It was he that, when his compadre had been carried off,<lb/>
had buried his wife and children, murdered by the<lb/>
soldiers.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Si, se&ntilde;or," he muttered, hoarsely, "I and two or three<lb/>
others, the lucky ones left at liberty, buried them all in<lb/>
one grave near the ashes of their ranch, under the tree<lb/>
that had shaded its roof."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   It was to him, too, that Hernandez came after he had<lb/>
deserted, three years afterwards. He had still his<lb/>
uniform on with the sergeant's stripes on the sleeve, and<lb/>
the blood of his colonel upon his hands and breast.<lb/>
Three troopers followed him, of those who had started<lb/>
in pursuit but had ridden on for liberty. And he told<lb/>
Charles Gould how he and a few friends, seeing those<lb/>
soldiers, lay in ambush behind some rocks ready to pull<lb/>
the trigger on them, when he recognized his compadre<lb/>
and jumped up from cover, shouting his name, because<lb/>
he knew that Hernandez could not have been coming<lb/>
back on an errand of injustice and oppression. Those<lb/>
three soldiers, together with the party who lay behind<lb/>
the rocks, had formed the nucleus of the famous band,<lb/>
and he, the narrator, had been the favourite lieutenant<lb/>
of Hernandez for many, many years. He mentioned<lb/>
proudly that the officials had put a price upon his head,<lb/>
too; but it did not prevent it getting sprinkled with grey<lb/>
upon his shoulders. And now he had lived long enough<lb/>
to see his compadre made a general.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He had a burst of muffled laughter. "And now from<lb/>
robbers we have become soldiers. But look, Caballero,<lb/>
at those who made us soldiers and him a general! Look<lb/>
at these people!"<lb/>


<pb n="359"/>

</p>

<p>   Ignacio shouted. The light of the carriage lamps,<lb/>
running along the nopal hedges that crowned the bank<lb/>
on each side, flashed upon the scared faces of people<lb/>
standing aside in the road, sunk deep, like an English<lb/>
country lane, into the soft soil of the Campo. They<lb/>
cowered; their eyes glistened very big for a second; and<lb/>
then the light, running on, fell upon the half-denuded<lb/>
roots of a big tree, on another stretch of nopal hedge,<lb/>
caught up another bunch of faces glaring back apprehensively.<lb/>
Three women &mdash; of whom one was carrying a<lb/>
child &mdash; and a couple of men in civilian dress &mdash; one armed<lb/>
with a sabre and another with a gun &mdash; were grouped<lb/>
about a donkey carrying two bundles tied up in blankets.<lb/>
Further on Ignacio shouted again to pass a<lb/>
carreta, a long wooden box on two high wheels, with the<lb/>
door at the back swinging open. Some ladies in it<lb/>
must have recognized the white mules, because they<lb/>
screamed out, "Is it you, Do&ntilde;a Emilia?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   At the turn of the road the glare of a big fire filled the<lb/>
short stretch vaulted over by the branches meeting overhead.<lb/>
Near the ford of a shallow stream a roadside<lb/>
rancho of woven rushes and a roof of grass had been set<lb/>
on fire by accident, and the flames, roaring viciously, lit<lb/>
up an open space blocked with horses, mules, and a<lb/>
distracted, shouting crowd of people. When Ignacio<lb/>
pulled up, several ladies on foot assailed the carriage,<lb/>
begging Antonia for a seat. To their clamour she<lb/>
answered by pointing silently to her father.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "I must leave you here," said Charles Gould, in the<lb/>
uproar. The flames leaped up sky-high, and in the recoil<lb/>
from the scorching heat across the road the stream<lb/>
of fugitives pressed against the carriage. A middle-<lb/>
aged lady dressed in black silk, but with a coarse manta<lb/>
over her head and a rough branch for a stick in her hand,<lb/>
staggered against the front wheel. Two young girls,<lb/>


<pb n="360"/>

frightened and silent, were clinging to her arms. Charles<lb/>
Gould knew her very well.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   <hi rend="italic">"Misericordia!</hi> We are getting terribly bruised in<lb/>
this crowd!" she exclaimed, smiling up courageously to<lb/>
him. "We have started on foot. All our servants ran<lb/>
away yesterday to join the democrats. We are going<lb/>
to put ourselves under the protection of Father Corbel&agrave;n,<lb/>
of your sainted uncle, Antonia. He has wrought a<lb/>
miracle in the heart of a most merciless robber. A<lb/>
miracle!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   She raised her voice gradually up to a scream as she<lb/>
was borne along by the pressure of people getting out of<lb/>
the way of some carts coming up out of the ford at a<lb/>
gallop, with loud yells and cracking of whips. Great<lb/>
masses of sparks mingled with black smoke flew over the<lb/>
road; the bamboos of the walls detonated in the fire with<lb/>
the sound of an irregular fusillade. And then the<lb/>
bright blaze sank suddenly, leaving only a red dusk<lb/>
crowded with aimless dark shadows drifting in contrary<lb/>
directions; the noise of voices seemed to die away<lb/>
with the flame; and the tumult of heads, arms, quarrelling,<lb/>
and imprecations passed on fleeing into the darkness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
  "I must leave you now," repeated Charles Gould to<lb/>
Antonia. She turned her head slowly and uncovered<lb/>
her face. The emissary and compadre of Hernandez<lb/>
spurred his horse close up.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Has not the master of the mine any message to send<lb/>
to Hernandez, the master of the Campo?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The truth of the comparison struck Charles Gould<lb/>
heavily. In his determined purpose he held the mine,<lb/>
and the indomitable bandit held the Campo by the<lb/>
same precarious tenure. They were equals before the<lb/>
lawlessness of the land. It was impossible to disentangle<lb/>
one's activity from its debasing contacts. A<lb/>


<pb n="361"/>

close-meshed net of crime and corruption lay upon the<lb/>
whole country. An immense and weary discouragement<lb/>
sealed his lips for a time.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You are a just man," urged the emissary of Hernandez.<lb/>
"Look at those people who made my compadre<lb/>
a general and have turned us all into soldiers.<lb/>
Look at those oligarchs fleeing for life, with only the<lb/>
clothes on their backs. My compadre does not think<lb/>
of that, but our followers may be wondering greatly, and<lb/>
I would speak for them to you. Listen, se&ntilde;or! For<lb/>
many months now the Campo has been our own. We<lb/>
need ask no man for anything; but soldiers must have<lb/>
their pay to live honestly when the wars are over. It<lb/>
is believed that your soul is so just that a prayer from<lb/>
you would cure the sickness of every beast, like the<lb/>
orison of the upright judge. Let me have some words<lb/>
from your lips that would act like a charm upon the<lb/>
doubts of our <hi rend="italic">partida</hi>, where all are men."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Do you hear what he says?" Charles Gould said in<lb/>
English to Antonia.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Forgive us our misery!" she exclaimed, hurriedly.<lb/>
"It is your character that is the inexhaustible treasure<lb/>
which may save us all yet; your character, Carlos, not<lb/>
your wealth. I entreat you to give this man your word<lb/>
that you will accept any arrangement my uncle may<lb/>
make with their chief. One word. He will want no<lb/>
more."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   On the site of the roadside hut there remained nothing<lb/>
but an enormous heap of embers, throwing afar a<lb/>
darkening red glow, in which Antonia's face appeared<lb/>
deeply flushed with excitement. Charles Gould, with<lb/>
only a short hesitation, pronounced the required pledge.<lb/>
He was like a man who had ventured on a precipitous<lb/>
path with no room to turn, where the only chance of<lb/>
safety is to press forward. At that moment he understood<lb/>


<pb n="362"/>

it thoroughly as he looked down at Don Jos&eacute;<lb/>
stretched out, hardly breathing, by the side of the erect<lb/>
Antonia, vanquished in a lifelong struggle with the<lb/>
powers of moral darkness, whose stagnant depths breed<lb/>
monstrous crimes and monstrous illusions. In a few<lb/>
words the emissary from Hernandez expressed his complete<lb/>
satisfaction. Stoically Antonia lowered her veil,<lb/>
resisting the longing to inquire about Decoud's escape.<lb/>
But Ignacio leered morosely over his shoulder.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "Take a good look at the mules, <hi rend="italic">mi amo</hi>," he grumbled.<lb/>
"You shall never see them again!"<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="363"/>


<p>   CHARLES GOULD turned towards the town. Before<lb/>
him the jagged peaks of the Sierra came out all black in<lb/>
the clear dawn. Here and there a muffled lepero<lb/>
whisked round the corner of a grass-grown street before<lb/>
the ringing hoofs of his horse. Dogs barked behind the<lb/>
walls of the gardens; and with the colourless light<lb/>
the chill of the snows seemed to fall from the mountains<lb/>
upon the disjointed pavements and the shuttered houses<lb/>
with broken cornices and the plaster peeling in patches<lb/>
between the flat pilasters of the fronts. The daybreak<lb/>
struggled with the gloom under the arcades on the Plaza,<lb/>
with no signs of country people disposing their goods<lb/>
for the day's market, piles of fruit, bundles of vegetables<lb/>
ornamented with flowers, on low benches under enormous<lb/>
mat umbrellas; with no cheery early morning<lb/>
bustle of villagers, women, children, and loaded donkeys.<lb/>
Only a few scattered knots of revolutionists<lb/>
stood in the vast space, all looking one way from under<lb/>
their slouched hats for some sign of news from Rincon.<lb/>
The largest of those groups turned about like one man<lb/>
as Charles Gould passed, and shouted, <hi rend="italic">"Viva la libertad!"</hi><lb/>
after him in a menacing tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Charles Gould rode on, and turned into the archway<lb/>
of his house. In the patio littered with straw, a practicante,<lb/>
one of Dr. Monygham's native assistants, sat on<lb/>
the ground with his back against the rim of the fountain,<lb/>
fingering a guitar discreetly, while two girls of the lower<lb/>
class, standing up before him, shuffled their feet a little<lb/>
and waved their arms, humming a popular dance tune.<lb/>




<pb n="364"/>

Most of the wounded during the two days of rioting had<lb/>
been taken away already by their friends and relations,<lb/>
but several figures could be seen sitting up balancing<lb/>
their bandaged heads in time to the music. Charles<lb/>
Gould dismounted. A sleepy mozo coming out of the<lb/>
bakery door took hold of the horse's bridle; the practicante<lb/>
endeavoured to conceal his guitar hastily; the<lb/>
girls, unabashed, stepped back smiling; and Charles<lb/>
Gould, on his way to the staircase, glanced into a dark<lb/>
corner of the patio at another group, a mortally<lb/>
wounded Cargador with a woman kneeling by his side;<lb/>
she mumbled prayers rapidly, trying at the same time<lb/>
to force a piece of orange between the stiffening lips<lb/>
of the dying man.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The cruel futility of things stood unveiled in the levity<lb/>
and sufferings of that incorrigible people; the cruel<lb/>
futility of lives and of deaths thrown away in the vain<lb/>
endeavour to attain an enduring solution of the problem.<lb/>
Unlike Decoud, Charles Gould could not play<lb/>
lightly a part in a tragic farce. It was tragic enough for<lb/>
him in all conscience, but he could see no farcical element.<lb/>
He suffered too much under a conviction of<lb/>
irremediable folly. He was too severely practical and<lb/>
too idealistic to look upon its terrible humours with<lb/>
amusement, as Martin Decoud, the imaginative materialist,<lb/>
was able to do in the dry light of his scepticism.<lb/>
To him, as to all of us, the compromises with his conscience<lb/>
appeared uglier than ever in the light of failure.<lb/>
His taciturnity, assumed with a purpose, had prevented<lb/>
him from tampering openly with his thoughts; but the<lb/>
Gould Concession had insidiously corrupted his judgment.<lb/>
He might have known, he said to himself, leaning<lb/>
over the balustrade of the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>, that Ribierism<lb/>
could never come to anything. The mine had corrupted<lb/>
his judgment by making him sick of bribing and<lb/>


<pb n="365"/>

intriguing merely to have his work left alone from day<lb/>
to day. Like his father, he did not like to be robbed.<lb/>
It exasperated him. He had persuaded himself that,<lb/>
apart from higher considerations, the backing up of Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute;'s hopes of reform was good business. He had gone<lb/>
forth into the senseless fray as his poor uncle, whose<lb/>
sword hung on the wall of his study, had gone forth &mdash; in<lb/>
the defence of the commonest decencies of organized<lb/>
society. Only his weapon was the wealth of the mine,<lb/>
more far-reaching and subtle than an honest blade of<lb/>
steel fitted into a simple brass guard.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   More dangerous to the wielder, too, this weapon of<lb/>
wealth, double-edged with the cupidity and misery of<lb/>
mankind, steeped in all the vices of self-indulgence as<lb/>
in a concoction of poisonous roots, tainting the very<lb/>
cause for which it is drawn, always ready to turn awkwardly<lb/>
in the hand. There was nothing for it now but<lb/>
to go on using it. But he promised himself to see it<lb/>
shattered into small bits before he let it be wrenched<lb/>
from his grasp.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   After all, with his English parentage and English<lb/>
upbringing, he perceived that he was an adventurer in<lb/>
Costaguana, the descendant of adventurers enlisted in a<lb/>
foreign legion, of men who had sought fortune in a<lb/>
revolutionary war, who had planned revolutions, who<lb/>
had believed in revolutions. For all the uprightness of<lb/>
his character, he had something of an adventurer's easy<lb/>
morality which takes count of personal risk in the<lb/>
ethical appraising of his action. He was prepared, if<lb/>
need be, to blow up the whole San Tom&eacute; mountain sky<lb/>
high out of the territory of the Republic. This resolution<lb/>
expressed the tenacity of his character, the remorse<lb/>
of that subtle conjugal infidelity through which<lb/>
his wife was no longer the sole mistress of his thoughts,<lb/>
something of his father's imaginative weakness, and<lb/>


<pb n="366"/>

something, too, of the spirit of a buccaneer throwing a<lb/>
lighted match into the magazine rather than surrender<lb/>
his ship.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Down below in the patio the wounded Cargador had<lb/>
breathed his last. The woman cried out once, and her<lb/>
cry, unexpected and shrill, made all the wounded sit<lb/>
up. The practicante scrambled to his feet, and, guitar<lb/>
in hand, gazed steadily in her direction with elevated<lb/>
eyebrows. The two girls &mdash; sitting now one on<lb/>
each side of their wounded relative, with their knees<lb/>
drawn up and long cigars between their lips &mdash; nodded<lb/>
at each other significantly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Charles Gould, looking down over the balustrade, saw<lb/>
three men dressed ceremoniously in black frock-coats<lb/>
with white shirts, and wearing European round hats,<lb/>
enter the patio from the street. One of them, head and<lb/>
shoulders taller than the two others, advanced with<lb/>
marked gravity, leading the way. This was Don Juste<lb/>
Lopez, accompanied by two of his friends, members of<lb/>
Assembly, coming to call upon the Administrador of the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mine at this early hour. They saw him, too,<lb/>
waved their hands to him urgently, walking up the<lb/>
stairs as if in procession.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Don Juste, astonishingly changed by having shaved<lb/>
off altogether his damaged beard, had lost with it nine-<lb/>
tenths of his outward dignity. Even at that time of<lb/>
serious pre-occupation Charles Gould could not help<lb/>
noting the revealed ineptitude in the aspect of the man.<lb/>
His companions looked crestfallen and sleepy. One<lb/>
kept on passing the tip of his tongue over his parched<lb/>
lips; the other's eyes strayed dully over the tiled floor of<lb/>
the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>, while Don Juste, standing a little in advance,<lb/>
harangued the Se&ntilde;or Administrador of the San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; mine. It was his firm opinion that forms had to<lb/>
be observed. A new governor is always visited by<lb/>


<pb n="367"/>

deputations from the Cabildo, which is the Municipal<lb/>
Council, from the Consulado, the commercial Board,<lb/>
and it was proper that the Provincial Assembly should<lb/>
send a deputation, too, if only to assert the existence<lb/>
of parliamentary institutions. Don Juste proposed that<lb/>
Don Carlos Gould, as the most prominent citizen of the<lb/>
province, should join the Assembly's deputation. His<lb/>
position was exceptional, his personality known through<lb/>
the length and breadth of the whole Republic. Official<lb/>
courtesies must not be neglected, if they are gone through<lb/>
with a bleeding heart. The acceptance of accomplished<lb/>
facts may save yet the precious vestiges of parliamentary<lb/>
institutions. Don Juste's eyes glowed dully; he believed<lb/>
in parliamentary institutions &mdash; and the convinced drone<lb/>
of his voice lost itself in the stillness of the house like the<lb/>
deep buzzing of some ponderous insect.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Charles Gould had turned round to listen patiently,<lb/>
leaning his elbow on the balustrade. He shook his<lb/>
head a little, refusing, almost touched by the anxious<lb/>
gaze of the President of the Provincial Assembly. It<lb/>
was not Charles Gould's policy to make the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mine a party to any formal proceedings.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "My advice, se&ntilde;ores, is that you should wait for your<lb/>
fate in your houses. There is no necessity for you to<lb/>
give yourselves up formally into Montero's hands.<lb/>
Submission to the inevitable, as Don Juste calls it, is all<lb/>
very well, but when the inevitable is called Pedrito<lb/>
Montero there is no need to exhibit pointedly the whole<lb/>
extent of your surrender. The fault of this country is<lb/>
the want of measure in political life. Flat acquiescence<lb/>
in illegality, followed by sanguinary reaction &mdash; that,<lb/>
se&ntilde;ores, is not the way to a stable and prosperous future."<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Charles Gould stopped before the sad bewilderment<lb/>
of the faces, the wondering, anxious glances of the eyes.<lb/>
The feeling of pity for those men, putting all their trust<lb/>


<pb n="368"/>

into words of some sort, while murder and rapine<lb/>
stalked over the land, had betrayed him into what<lb/>
seemed empty loquacity. Don Juste murmured &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You are abandoning us, Don Carlos. . . . And<lb/>
yet, parliamentary institutions &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>   He could not finish from grief. For a moment he put<lb/>
his hand over his eyes. Charles Gould, in his fear of<lb/>
empty loquacity, made no answer to the charge. He<lb/>
returned in silence their ceremonious bows. His<lb/>
taciturnity was his refuge. He understood that what<lb/>
they sought was to get the influence of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mine on their side. They wanted to go on a conciliating<lb/>
errand to the victor under the wing of the Gould Concession.<lb/>
Other public bodies &mdash; the Cabildo, the Consulado<lb/>
&mdash; would be coming, too, presently, seeking the<lb/>
support of the most stable, the most effective force<lb/>
they had ever known to exist in their province.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The doctor, arriving with his sharp, jerky walk, found<lb/>
that the master had retired into his own room with.<lb/>
orders not to be disturbed on any account. But Dr.<lb/>
Monygham was not anxious to see Charles Gould at<lb/>
once. He spent some time in a rapid examination of<lb/>
his wounded. He gazed down upon each in turn,<lb/>
rubbing his chin between his thumb and forefinger; his<lb/>
steady stare met without expression their silently inquisitive<lb/>
look. All these cases were doing well; but<lb/>
when he came to the dead Cargador he stopped a little<lb/>
longer, surveying not the man who had ceased to suffer,<lb/>
but the woman kneeling in silent contemplation of the<lb/>
rigid face, with its pinched nostrils and a white gleam in<lb/>
the imperfectly closed eyes. She lifted her head slowly,<lb/>
and said in a dull voice &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "It is not long since he had become a Cargador &mdash; only<lb/>
a few weeks. His worship the Capataz had accepted<lb/>
him after many entreaties."<lb/>


<pb n="369"/>

</p>

<p>   "I am not responsible for the great Capataz," muttered<lb/>
the doctor, moving off.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Directing his course upstairs towards the door of<lb/>
Charles Gould's room, the doctor at the last moment<lb/>
hesitated; then, turning away from the handle with a<lb/>
shrug of his uneven shoulders, slunk off hastily along the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">corredor</hi> in search of Mrs. Gould's camerista.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   Leonardo told him that the se&ntilde;ora had not risen yet.<lb/>
The se&ntilde;ora had given into her charge the girls belonging<lb/>
to that Italian posadero. She, Leonarda, had put them<lb/>
to bed in her own room. The fair girl had cried herself<lb/>
to sleep, but the dark one &mdash; the bigger &mdash; had not closed<lb/>
her eyes yet. She sat up in bed clutching the sheets<lb/>
right up under her chin and staring before her like a<lb/>
little witch. Leonarda did not approve of the Viola<lb/>
children being admitted to the house. She made this<lb/>
feeling clear by the indifferent tone in which she inquired<lb/>
whether their mother was dead yet. As to the<lb/>
se&ntilde;ora, she must be asleep. Ever since she had gone<lb/>
into her room after seeing the departure of Do&ntilde;a<lb/>
Antonia with her dying father, there had been no sound<lb/>
behind her door.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   The doctor, rousing himself out of profound reflection,<lb/>
told her abruptly to call her mistress at once. He<lb/>
hobbled off to wait for Mrs. Gould in the sala. He was<lb/>
very tired, but too excited to sit down. In this great<lb/>
drawing-room, now empty, in which his withered soul<lb/>
had been refreshed after many arid years and his outcast<lb/>
spirit had accepted silently the toleration of many<lb/>
side-glances, he wandered haphazard amongst the<lb/>
chairs and tables till Mrs. Gould, enveloped in a<lb/>
morning wrapper, came in rapidly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>   "You know that I never approved of the silver being<lb/>
sent away," the doctor began at once, as a preliminary<lb/>
to the narrative of his night's adventures in association<lb/>


<pb n="370"/>

with Captain Mitchell, the engineer-in-chief, and old<lb/>
Viola, at Sotillo's headquarters. To the doctor, with<lb/>
his special conception of this political crisis, the removal<lb/>
of the silver had seemed an irrational and ill-omened<lb/>
measure. It was as if a general were sending the best<lb/>
part of his troops away on the eve of battle upon some<lb/>
recondite pretext. The whole lot of ingots might have<lb/>
been concealed somewhere where they could have been<lb/>
got at for the purpose of staving off the dangers which<lb/>
were menacing the security of the Gould Concession.<lb/>
The Administrador had acted as if the immense and<lb/>
powerful prosperity of the mine had been founded on<lb/>
methods of probity, on the sense of usefulness. And it<lb/>
was nothing of the kind. The method followed had<lb/>
been the only one possible. The Gould Concession had<lb/>
ransomed its way through all those years. It was a<lb/>
nauseous process. He quite understood that Charles<lb/>
Gould had got sick of it and had left the old path to<lb/>
back up that hopeless attempt at reform. The doctor<lb/>
did not believe in the reform of Costaguana. And now<lb/>
the mine was back again in its old path, with the disadvantage<lb/>
that henceforth it had to deal not only with<lb/>
the greed provoked by its wealth, but with the resentment<lb/>
awakened by the attempt to free itself from its<lb/>
bondage to moral corruption. That was the penalty of<lb/>
failure. What made him uneasy was that Charles<lb/>
Gould seemed to him to have weakened at the decisive<lb/>
moment when a frank return to the old methods was the<lb/>
only chance. Listening to Decoud's wild scheme had<lb/>
been a weakness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor flung up his arms, exclaiming, "Decoud!<lb/>
Decoud!" He hobbled about the room with slight,<lb/>
angry laughs. Many years ago both his ankles had<lb/>
been seriously damaged in the course of a certain<lb/>
investigation conducted in the castle of Sta. Marta by a<lb/>


<pb n="371"/>

commission composed of military men. Their nomination<lb/>
had been signified to them unexpectedly at the dead<lb/>
of night, with scowling brow, flashing eyes, and in a<lb/>
tempestuous voice, by Guzman Bento. The old tyrant,<lb/>
maddened by one of his sudden accesses of suspicion,<lb/>
mingled spluttering appeals to their fidelity with<lb/>
imprecations and horrible menaces. The cells and<lb/>
casements of the castle on the hill had been already<lb/>
filled with prisoners. The commission was charged<lb/>
now with the task of discovering the iniquitous conspiracy<lb/>
against the Citizen-Saviour of his country.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Their dread of the raving tyrant translated itself into<lb/>
a hasty ferocity of procedure. The Citizen-Saviour was<lb/>
not accustomed to wait. A conspiracy had to be discovered.<lb/>
The courtyards of the castle resounded with<lb/>
the clanking of leg-irons, sounds of blows, yells of pain;<lb/>
and the commission of high officers laboured feverishly,<lb/>
concealing their distress and apprehensions from each<lb/>
other, and especially from their secretary, Father Beron,<lb/>
an army chaplain, at that time very much in the confidence<lb/>
of the Citizen-Saviour. That priest was a big<lb/>
round-shouldered man, with an unclean-looking, overgrown<lb/>
tonsure on the top of his flat head, of a dingy,<lb/>
yellow complexion, softly fat, with greasy stains all<lb/>
down the front of his lieutenant's uniform, and a small<lb/>
cross embroidered in white cotton on his left breast. He<lb/>
had a heavy nose and a pendant lip. Dr. Monygham<lb/>
remembered him still. He remembered him against all<lb/>
the force of his will striving its utmost to forget. Father<lb/>
Beron had been adjoined to the commission by Guzman<lb/>
Bento expressly for the purpose that his enlightened zeal<lb/>
should assist them in their labours. Dr. Monygham could<lb/>
by no manner of means forget the zeal of Father Beron,<lb/>
or his face, or the pitiless, monotonous voice in which<lb/>
he pronounced the words, "Will you confess now?"<lb/>


<pb n="372"/>

</p>

<p>     This memory did not make him shudder, but it had<lb/>
made of him what he was in the eyes of respectable<lb/>
people, a man careless of common decencies, something<lb/>
between a clever vagabond and a disreputable doctor.<lb/>
But not all respectable people would have had the<lb/>
necessary delicacy of sentiment to understand with<lb/>
what trouble of mind and accuracy of vision Dr. Monygham,<lb/>
medical officer of the San Tom&eacute; mine, remembered<lb/>
Father Beron, army chaplain, and once a secretary of<lb/>
a military commission. After all these years Dr.<lb/>
Monygham, in his rooms at the end of the hospital<lb/>
building in the San Tom&eacute; gorge, remembered Father<lb/>
Beron as distinctly as ever. He remembered that priest<lb/>
at night, sometimes, in his sleep. On such nights the<lb/>
doctor waited for daylight with a candle lighted, and<lb/>
walking the whole length of his rooms to and fro,<lb/>
staring down at his bare feet, his arms hugging his<lb/>
sides tightly. He would dream of Father Beron<lb/>
sitting at the end of a long black table, behind which,<lb/>
in a row, appeared the heads, shoulders, and epaulettes<lb/>
of the military members, nibbling the feather of a quill<lb/>
pen, and listening with weary and impatient scorn to<lb/>
the protestations of some prisoner calling heaven to<lb/>
witness of his innocence, till he burst out, "What's the<lb/>
use of wasting time over that miserable nonsense! Let<lb/>
me take him outside for a while." And Father Beron<lb/>
would go outside after the clanking prisoner, led away<lb/>
between two soldiers. Such interludes happened on<lb/>
many days, many times, with many prisoners. When<lb/>
the prisoner returned he was ready to make a full confession,<lb/>
Father Beron would declare, leaning forward<lb/>
with that dull, surfeited look which can be seen in the<lb/>
eyes of gluttonous persons after a heavy meal.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The priest's inquisitorial instincts suffered but little<lb/>
from the want of classical apparatus of the Inquisition<lb/>


<pb n="373"/>

At no time of the world's history have men been at a<lb/>
loss how to inflict mental and bodily anguish upon<lb/>
their fellow-creatures. This aptitude came to them in<lb/>
the growing complexity of their passions and the early<lb/>
refinement of their ingenuity. But it may safely be said<lb/>
that primeval man did not go to the trouble of inventing<lb/>
tortures. He was indolent and pure of heart. He<lb/>
brained his neighbour ferociously with a stone axe from<lb/>
necessity and without malice. The stupidest mind<lb/>
may invent a rankling phrase or brand the innocent with<lb/>
a cruel aspersion. A piece of string and a ramrod; a<lb/>
few muskets in combination with a length of hide rope;<lb/>
or even a simple mallet of heavy, hard wood applied<lb/>
with a swing to human fingers or to the joints of a<lb/>
human body is enough for the infliction of the most<lb/>
exquisite torture. The doctor had been a very stubborn<lb/>
prisoner, and, as a natural consequence of that "bad<lb/>
disposition" (so Father Beron called it), his subjugation<lb/>
had been very crushing and very complete. That is<lb/>
why the limp in his walk, the twist of his shoulders, the<lb/>
scars on his cheeks were so pronounced. His confessions,<lb/>
when they came at last, were very complete,<lb/>
too. Sometimes on the nights when he walked the<lb/>
floor, he wondered, grinding his teeth with shame and<lb/>
rage, at the fertility of his imagination when stimulated<lb/>
by a sort of pain which makes truth, honour, self-<lb/>
respect, and life itself matters of little moment.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And he could not forget Father Beron with his monotonous<lb/>
phrase, "Will you confess now?" reaching him<lb/>
in an awful iteration and lucidity of meaning through the<lb/>
delirious incoherence of unbearable pain. He could<lb/>
not forget. But that was not the worst. Had he met<lb/>
Father Beron in the street after all these years Dr.<lb/>
Monygham was sure he would have quailed before him.<lb/>
This contingency was not to be feared now. Father<lb/>


<pb n="374"/>

Beron was dead; but the sickening certitude prevented<lb/>
Dr. Monygham from looking anybody in the face.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Dr. Monygham. had become, in a manner, the slave of<lb/>
a ghost. It was obviously impossible to take his knowledge<lb/>
of Father Beron home to Europe. When making<lb/>
his extorted confessions to the Military Board, Dr.<lb/>
Monygham was not seeking to avoid death. He longed<lb/>
for it. Sitting half-naked for hours on the wet earth<lb/>
of his prison, and so motionless that the spiders, his<lb/>
companions, attached their webs to his matted hair, he<lb/>
consoled the misery of his soul with acute reasonings<lb/>
that he had confessed to crimes enough for a sentence of<lb/>
death &mdash; that they had gone too far with him to let him<lb/>
live to tell the tale.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But, as if by a refinement of cruelty, Dr. Monygham<lb/>
was left for months to decay slowly in the darkness of his<lb/>
grave-like prison. It was no doubt hoped that it would<lb/>
finish him off without the trouble of an execution; but<lb/>
Dr. Monygham had an iron constitution. It was<lb/>
Guzman Bento who died, not by the knife thrust of a<lb/>
conspirator, but from a stroke of apoplexy, and Dr.<lb/>
Monygham was liberated hastily. His fetters were<lb/>
struck off by the light of a candle, which, after months of<lb/>
gloom, hurt his eyes so much that he had to cover his<lb/>
face with his hands. He was raised up. His heart was<lb/>
beating violently with the fear of this liberty. When<lb/>
he tried to walk the extraordinary lightness of his feet<lb/>
made him giddy, and he fell down. Two sticks were<lb/>
thrust into his hands, and he was pushed out of the<lb/>
passage. It was dusk; candles glimmered already in<lb/>
the windows of the officers' quarters round the courtyard;<lb/>
but the twilight sky dazed him by its enormous<lb/>
and overwhelming brilliance. A thin poncho hung over<lb/>
his naked, bony shoulders; the rags of his trousers came<lb/>
down no lower than his knees; an eighteen months'<lb/>


<pb n="375"/>

growth of hair fell in dirty grey locks on each side of his<lb/>
sharp cheek-bones. As he dragged himself past the<lb/>
guard-room door, one of the soldiers, lolling outside,<lb/>
moved by some obscure impulse, leaped forward with a<lb/>
strange laugh and rammed a broken old straw hat on<lb/>
his head. And Dr. Monygham, after having tottered,<lb/>
continued on his way. He advanced one stick, then<lb/>
one maimed foot, then the other stick; the other foot<lb/>
followed only a very short distance along the ground,<lb/>
toilfully, as though it were almost too heavy to be<lb/>
moved at all; and yet his legs under the hanging angles<lb/>
of the poncho appeared no thicker than the two sticks in<lb/>
his hands. A ceaseless trembling agitated his bent<lb/>
body, all his wasted limbs, his bony head, the conical,<lb/>
ragged crown of the sombrero, whose ample flat rim<lb/>
rested on his shoulders.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In such conditions of manner and attire did Dr.<lb/>
Monygham go forth to take possession of his liberty.<lb/>
And these conditions seemed to bind him indissolubly<lb/>
to the land of Costaguana like an awful procedure of<lb/>
naturalization, involving him deep in the national life,<lb/>
far deeper than any amount of success and honour could<lb/>
have done. They did away with his Europeanism; for<lb/>
Dr. Monygham had made himself an ideal conception of<lb/>
his disgrace. It was a conception eminently fit and<lb/>
proper for an officer and a gentleman. Dr. Monygham,<lb/>
before he went out to Costaguana, had been surgeon in<lb/>
one of Her Majesty's regiments of foot. It was a conception<lb/>
which took no account of physiological facts or<lb/>
reasonable arguments; but it was not stupid for all that.<lb/>
It was simple. A rule of conduct resting mainly on<lb/>
severe rejections is necessarily simple.  Dr. Monygham's<lb/>
view of what it behoved him to do was severe; it<lb/>
was an ideal view, in so much that it was the imaginative<lb/>
exaggeration of a correct feeling. It was also, in its<lb/>


<pb n="376"/>

force, influence, and persistency, the view of an eminently<lb/>
loyal nature.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There was a great fund of loyalty in Dr. Monygham's<lb/>
nature. He had settled it all on Mrs. Gould's head. He<lb/>
believed her worthy of every devotion. At the bottom<lb/>
of his heart he felt an angry uneasiness before the prosperity<lb/>
of the San Tom&eacute; mine, because its growth was<lb/>
robbing her of all peace of mind. Costaguana was no<lb/>
place for a woman of that kind. What could Charles<lb/>
Gould have been thinking of when he brought her out<lb/>
there! It was outrageous! And the doctor had<lb/>
watched the course of events with a grim and distant<lb/>
reserve which, he imagined, his lamentable history imposed<lb/>
upon him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Loyalty to Mrs. Gould could not, however, leave out<lb/>
of account the safety of her husband. The doctor had<lb/>
contrived to be in town at the critical time because he<lb/>
mistrusted Charles Gould. He considered him hopelessly<lb/>
infected with the madness of revolutions. That<lb/>
is why he hobbled in distress in the drawing-room of the<lb/>
Casa Gould on that morning, exclaiming, "Decoud,<lb/>
Decoud!" in a tone of mournful irritation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould, her colour heightened, and with glistening<lb/>
eyes, looked straight before her at the sudden<lb/>
enormity of that disaster. The finger-tips on one hand<lb/>
rested lightly on a low little table by her side, and the<lb/>
arm trembled right up to the shoulder. The sun,<lb/>
which looks late upon Sulaco, issuing in all the fulness of<lb/>
its power high up on the sky from behind the dazzling<lb/>
snow-edge of Higuerota, had precipitated the delicate,<lb/>
smooth, pearly greyness of light, in which the town lies<lb/>
steeped during the early hours, into sharp-cut masses of<lb/>
black shade and spaces of hot, blinding glare. Three<lb/>
long rectangles of sunshine fell through the windows of<lb/>
the sala; while just across the street the front of the<lb/>


<pb n="377"/>

Avellanos's house appeared very sombre in its own<lb/>
shadow seen through the flood of light.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A voice said at the door, "What of Decoud?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was Charles Gould. They had not heard him<lb/>
coming along the <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>. His glance just glided over<lb/>
his wife and struck full at the doctor.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have brought some news, doctor?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Dr. Monygham blurted it all out at once, in the rough.<lb/>
For some time after he had done, the Administrador of<lb/>
the San Tom&eacute; mine remained looking at him without a<lb/>
word. Mrs. Gould sank into a low chair with her hands<lb/>
lying on her lap. A silence reigned between those three<lb/>
motionless persons. Then Charles Gould spoke &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You must want some breakfast."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He stood aside to let his wife pass first. She caught<lb/>
up her husband's hand and pressed it as she went out,<lb/>
raising her handkerchief to her eyes. The sight of her<lb/>
husband had brought Antonia's position to her mind,<lb/>
and she could not contain her tears at the thought of the<lb/>
poor girl. When she rejoined the two men in the dining-<lb/>
room after having bathed her face, Charles Gould was<lb/>
saying to the doctor across the table &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, there does not seem any room for doubt."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And the doctor assented.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, I don't see myself how we could question that<lb/>
wretched Hirsch's tale. It's only too true, I fear."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She sat down desolately at the head of the table and<lb/>
looked from one to the other. The two men, without<lb/>
absolutely turning their heads away, tried to avoid her<lb/>
glance. The doctor even made a show of being hungry;<lb/>
he seized his knife and fork, and began to eat with<lb/>
emphasis, as if on the stage. Charles Gould made no<lb/>
pretence of the sort; with his elbows raised squarely, he<lb/>
twisted both ends of his flaming moustaches &mdash; they were<lb/>
so long that his hands were quite away from his face.<lb/>


<pb n="378"/>

</p>

<p>     "I am not surprised," he muttered, abandoning<lb/>
his moustaches and throwing one arm over the back<lb/>
of his chair. His face was calm with that immobility<lb/>
of expression which betrays the intensity of a mental<lb/>
struggle. He felt that this accident had brought to a<lb/>
point all the consequences involved in his line of conduct,<lb/>
with its conscious and subconscious intentions.<lb/>
There must be an end now of this silent reserve, of that<lb/>
air of impenetrability behind which he had been safe-<lb/>
guarding his dignity. It was the least ignoble form of<lb/>
dissembling forced upon him by that parody of civilized<lb/>
institutions which offended his intelligence, his uprightness,<lb/>
and his sense of right. He was like his father.<lb/>
He had no ironic eye. He was not amused at the<lb/>
absurdities that prevail in this world. They hurt him<lb/>
in his innate gravity. He felt that the miserable death of<lb/>
that poor Decoud took from him his inaccessible position<lb/>
of a force in the background. It committed him openly<lb/>
unless he wished to throw up the game &mdash; and that was<lb/>
impossible. The material interests required from him<lb/>
the sacrifice of his aloofness &mdash; perhaps his own safety<lb/>
too. And he reflected that Decoud's separationist<lb/>
plan had not gone to the bottom with the lost silver.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The only thing that was not changed was his position<lb/>
towards Mr. Holroyd. The head of silver and steel<lb/>
interests had entered into Costaguana affairs with a sort<lb/>
of passion. Costaguana had become necessary to his<lb/>
existence; in the San Tom&eacute; mine he had found the<lb/>
imaginative satisfaction which other minds would get<lb/>
from drama, from art, or from a risky and fascinating<lb/>
sport.  It was a special form of the great man's extravagance,<lb/>
sanctioned by a moral intention, big<lb/>
enough to flatter his vanity. Even in this aberration of<lb/>
his genius he served the progress of the world. Charles<lb/>
Gould felt sure of being understood with precision and<lb/>


<pb n="379"/>

judged with the indulgence of their common passion.<lb/>
Nothing now could surprise or startle this great man.<lb/>
And Charles Gould imagined himself writing a letter to<lb/>
San Francisco in some such words: ". . . . The<lb/>
men at the head of the movement are dead or have<lb/>
fled; the civil organization of the province is at an end<lb/>
for the present; the Blanco party in Sulaco has collapsed<lb/>
inexcusably, but in the characteristic manner of<lb/>
this country. But Barrios, untouched in Cayta,<lb/>
remains still available. I am forced to take up openly<lb/>
the plan of a provincial revolution as the only way of<lb/>
placing the enormous material interests involved in the<lb/>
prosperity and peace of Sulaco in a position of permanent<lb/>
safety. . . ." That was clear. He saw these<lb/>
words as if written in letters of fire upon the wall at<lb/>
which he was gazing abstractedly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs Gould watched his abstraction with dread. It<lb/>
was a domestic and frightful phenomenon that darkened<lb/>
and chilled the house for her like a thunder-<lb/>
cloud passing over the sun. Charles Gould's fits of<lb/>
abstraction depicted the energetic concentration of a<lb/>
will haunted by a fixed idea. A man haunted by a<lb/>
fixed idea is insane. He is dangerous even if that<lb/>
idea is an idea of justice; for may he not bring the<lb/>
heaven down pitilessly upon a loved head? The eyes<lb/>
of Mrs. Gould, watching her husband's profile, filled<lb/>
with tears again. And again she seemed to see the<lb/>
despair of the unfortunate Antonia.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What would I have done if Charley had been<lb/>
drowned while we were engaged?" she exclaimed, mentally,<lb/>
with horror. Her heart turned to ice, while<lb/>
her cheeks flamed up as if scorched by the blaze of a<lb/>
funeral pyre consuming all her earthly affections. The<lb/>
tears burst out of her eyes.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Antonia will kill herself!" she cried out.<lb/>


<pb n="380"/>

</p>

<p>     This cry fell into the silence of the room with<lb/>
strangely little effect. Only the doctor, crumbling<lb/>
up a piece of bread, with his head inclined on one side,<lb/>
raised his face, and the few long hairs sticking out of<lb/>
his shaggy eyebrows stirred in a slight frown. Dr.<lb/>
Monygham thought quite sincerely that Decoud was a<lb/>
singularly unworthy object for any woman's affection.<lb/>
Then he lowered his head again, with a curl of his lip,<lb/>
and his heart full of tender admiration for Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She thinks of that girl," he said to himself; "she<lb/>
thinks of the Viola children; she thinks of me; of the<lb/>
wounded; of the miners; she always thinks of everybody<lb/>
who is poor and miserable! But what will she do if<lb/>
Charles gets the worst of it in this infernal scrimmage<lb/>
those confounded Avellanos have drawn him into? No<lb/>
one seems to be thinking of her."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould, staring at the wall, pursued his reflections<lb/>
subtly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I shall write to Holroyd that the San Tom&eacute; mine is<lb/>
big enough to take in hand the making of a new State.<lb/>
It'll please him. It'll reconcile him to the risk."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But was Barrios really available? Perhaps. But he<lb/>
was inaccessible. To send off a boat to Cayta was no<lb/>
longer possible, since Sotillo was master of the harbour,<lb/>
and had a steamer at his disposal. And now, with all<lb/>
the democrats in the province up, and every Campo<lb/>
township in a state of disturbance, where could he find<lb/>
a man who would make his way successfully overland to<lb/>
Cayta with a message, a ten days' ride at least; a man<lb/>
of courage and resolution, who would avoid arrest or<lb/>
murder, and if arrested would faithfully eat the paper?<lb/>
The Capataz de Cargadores would have been just such<lb/>
a man. But the Capataz of the Cargadores was no<lb/>
more.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And Charles Gould, withdrawing his eyes from the<lb/>


<pb n="381"/>

wall, said gently, "That Hirsch! What an extraordinary<lb/>
thing! Saved himself by clinging to the anchor,<lb/>
did he? I had no idea that he was still in Sulaco.<lb/>
I thought he had gone back overland to Esmeralda<lb/>
more than a week ago. He came here once to talk<lb/>
to me about his hide business and some other things.<lb/>
I made it clear to him that nothing could be done."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He was afraid to start back on account of Hernandez<lb/>
being about," remarked the doctor.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And but for him we might not have known anything<lb/>
of what has happened," marvelled Charles Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould cried out &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Antonia must not know! She must not be told.<lb/>
Not now."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Nobody's likely to carry the news," remarked the<lb/>
doctor. "It's no one's interest. Moreover, the people<lb/>
here are afraid of Hernandez as if he were the devil."<lb/>
He turned to Charles Gould. "It's even awkward,<lb/>
because if you wanted to communicate with the refugees<lb/>
you could find no messenger. When Hernandez<lb/>
was ranging hundreds of miles away from here the<lb/>
Sulaco populace used to shudder at the tales of him<lb/>
roasting his prisoners alive."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes," murmured Charles Gould; "Captain Mitchell's<lb/>
Capataz was the only man in the town who had<lb/>
seen Hernandez eye to eye. Father Corbel&agrave;n employed<lb/>
him. He opened the communications first. It<lb/>
is a pity that &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His voice was covered by the booming of the great<lb/>
bell of the cathedral. Three single strokes, one after<lb/>
another, burst out explosively, dying away in deep and<lb/>
mellow vibrations. And then all the bells in the tower<lb/>
of every church, convent, or chapel in town, even those<lb/>
that had remained shut up for years, pealed out together<lb/>
with a crash. In this furious flood of metallic<lb/>


<pb n="382"/>

uproar there was a power of suggesting images of strife<lb/>
and violence which blanched Mrs. Gould's cheek.<lb/>
Basilio, who had been waiting at table, shrinking within<lb/>
himself, clung to the sideboard with chattering teeth.<lb/>
It was impossible to hear yourself speak.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Shut these windows!" Charles Gould yelled at him,<lb/>
angrily. All the other servants, terrified at what they<lb/>
took for the signal of a general massacre, had rushed upstairs,<lb/>
tumbling over each other, men and women, the<lb/>
obscure and generally invisible population of the ground<lb/>
floor on the four sides of the patio. The women, screaming<lb/>
"Misericordia!" ran right into the room, and, falling<lb/>
on their knees against the walls, began to cross themselves<lb/>
convulsively. The staring heads of men blocked<lb/>
the doorway in an instant &mdash; mozos from the stable,<lb/>
gardeners, nondescript helpers living on the crumbs of<lb/>
the munificent house &mdash; and Charles Gould beheld all<lb/>
the extent of his domestic establishment, even to the<lb/>
gatekeeper. This was a half-paralyzed old man, whose<lb/>
long white locks fell down to his shoulders: an heirloom<lb/>
taken up by Charles Gould's familial piety. He could<lb/>
remember Henry Gould, an Englishman and a Costaguanero<lb/>
of the second generation, chief of the Sulaco<lb/>
province; he had been his personal mozo years and<lb/>
years ago in peace and war; had been allowed to attend<lb/>
his master in prison; had, on the fatal morning, followed<lb/>
the firing squad; and, peeping from behind one<lb/>
of the cypresses growing along the wall of the Franciscan<lb/>
Convent, had seen, with his eyes starting out of his<lb/>
head, Don Enrique throw up his hands and fall with<lb/>
his face in the dust. Charles Gould noted particularly<lb/>
the big patriarchal head of that witness in the rear of the<lb/>
other servants. But he was surprised to see a shrivelled<lb/>
old hag or two, of whose existence within the walls of his<lb/>
house he had not been aware. They must have been the<lb/>


<pb n="383"/>

mothers, or even the grandmothers of some of his people.<lb/>
There were a few children, too, more or less naked, crying<lb/>
and clinging to the legs of their elders. He had never<lb/>
before noticed any sign of a child in his patio. Even<lb/>
Leonarda, the camerista, came in a fright, pushing<lb/>
through, with her spoiled, pouting face of a favourite<lb/>
maid, leading the Viola girls by the hand. The crockery<lb/>
rattled on table and sideboard, and the whole house<lb/>
seemed to sway in the deafening wave of sound.<lb/>
</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="5" id="d31">
<head>CHAPTER FIVE</head>

<pb n="384"/>

<p>DURING the night the expectant populace had taken<lb/>
possession of all the belfries in the town in order to welcome<lb/>
Pedrito Montero, who was making his entry after<lb/>
having slept the night in Rincon. And first came straggling<lb/>
in through the land gate the armed mob of all<lb/>
colours, complexions, types, and states of raggedness,<lb/>
calling themselves the Sulaco National Guard, and<lb/>
commanded by Se&ntilde;or Gamacho. Through the middle<lb/>
of the street streamed, like a torrent of rubbish, a mass<lb/>
of straw hats, ponchos, gun-barrels, with an enormous<lb/>
green and yellow flag flapping in their midst, in a<lb/>
cloud of dust, to the furious beating of drums. The<lb/>
spectators recoiled against the walls of the houses<lb/>
shouting their <hi rend="italic">Vivas!</hi> Behind the rabble could be seen<lb/>
the lances of the cavalry, the "army" of Pedro Montero.<lb/>
He advanced between Se&ntilde;ores Fuentes and Gamacho<lb/>
at the head of his llaneros, who had accomplished the<lb/>
feat of crossing the Paramos of the Higuerota in a<lb/>
snow-storm. They rode four abreast, mounted on<lb/>
confiscated Campo horses, clad in the heterogeneous<lb/>
stock of roadside stores they had looted hurriedly in<lb/>
their rapid ride through the northern part of the province;<lb/>
for Pedro Montero had been in a great hurry<lb/>
to occupy Sulaco. The handkerchiefs knotted loosely<lb/>
around their bare throats were glaringly new, and all<lb/>
the right sleeves of their cotton shirts had been cut<lb/>
off close to the shoulder for greater freedom in throwing<lb/>
the lazo. Emaciated greybeards rode by the side of<lb/>
lean dark youths, marked by all the hardships of campaigning,<lb/>




<pb n="385"/>

with strips of raw beef twined round the<lb/>
crowns of their hats, and huge iron spurs fastened to<lb/>
their naked heels. Those that in the passes of the<lb/>
mountain had lost their lances had provided themselves<lb/>
with the goads used by the Campo cattlemen: slender<lb/>
shafts of palm fully ten feet long, with a lot of loose rings<lb/>
jingling under the ironshod point. They were armed<lb/>
with knives and revolvers. A haggard fearlessness characterized<lb/>
the expression of all these sun-blacked countenances;<lb/>
they glared down haughtily with their<lb/>
scorched eyes at the crowd, or, blinking upwards insolently,<lb/>
pointed out to each other some particular<lb/>
head amongst the women at the windows. When they<lb/>
had ridden into the Plaza and caught sight of the equestrian<lb/>
statue of the King dazzlingly white in the sunshine,<lb/>
towering enormous and motionless above the<lb/>
surges of the crowd, with its eternal gesture of saluting,<lb/>
a murmur of surprise ran through their ranks. "What<lb/>
is that saint in the big hat?" they asked each other.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     They were a good sample of the cavalry of the plains<lb/>
with which Pedro Montero had helped so much the victorious<lb/>
career of his brother the general. The influence<lb/>
which that man, brought up in coast towns, acquired in<lb/>
a short time over the plainsmen of the Republic can be<lb/>
ascribed only to a genius for treachery of so effective<lb/>
a kind that it must have appeared to those violent men<lb/>
but little removed from a state of utter savagery, as the<lb/>
perfection of sagacity and virtue. The popular lore<lb/>
of all nations testifies that duplicity and cunning, together<lb/>
with bodily strength, were looked upon, even<lb/>
more than courage, as heroic virtues by primitive mankind.<lb/>
To overcome your adversary was the great<lb/>
affair of life. Courage was taken for granted. But<lb/>
the use of intelligence awakened wonder and respect.<lb/>
Stratagems, providing they did not fail, were honourable;<lb/>


<pb n="386"/>

the easy massacre of an unsuspecting enemy evoked<lb/>
no feelings but those of gladness, pride, and admiration.<lb/>
Not perhaps that primitive men were more faithless<lb/>
than their descendants of to-day, but that they went<lb/>
straighter to their aim, and were more artless in their<lb/>
recognition of success as the only standard of morality.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     We have changed since. The use of intelligence<lb/>
awakens little wonder and less respect. But the ignorant<lb/>
and barbarous plainsmen engaging in civil strife followed<lb/>
willingly a leader who often managed to deliver their<lb/>
enemies bound, as it were, into their hands. Pedro Montero<lb/>
had a talent for lulling his adversaries into a sense<lb/>
of security. And as men learn wisdom with extreme<lb/>
slowness, and are always ready to believe promises that<lb/>
flatter their secret hopes, Pedro Montero was successful<lb/>
time after time. Whether only a servant or some inferior<lb/>
official in the Costaguana Legation in Paris, he had<lb/>
rushed back to his country directly he heard that his<lb/>
brother had emerged from the obscurity of his frontier<lb/>
commandancia. He had managed to deceive by his<lb/>
gift of plausibility the chiefs of the Ribierist movement<lb/>
in the capital, and even the acute agent of the San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; mine had failed to understand him thoroughly.<lb/>
At once he had obtained an enormous influence over<lb/>
his brother. They were very much alike in appearance,<lb/>
both bald, with bunches of crisp hair above their ears,<lb/>
arguing the presence of some negro blood. Only Pedro<lb/>
was smaller than the general, more delicate altogether,<lb/>
with an ape-like faculty for imitating all the outward<lb/>
signs of refinement and distinction, and with a parrot-<lb/>
like talent for languages. Both brothers had received<lb/>
some elementary instruction by the munificence of a<lb/>
great European traveller, to whom their father had been<lb/>
a body-servant during his journeys in the interior of<lb/>
the country. In General Montero's case it enabled<lb/>


<pb n="387"/>

him to rise from the ranks. Pedrito, the younger, incorrigibly<lb/>
lazy and slovenly, had drifted aimlessly from<lb/>
one coast town to another, hanging about counting-<lb/>
houses, attaching himself to strangers as a sort of <hi rend="italic">valet-<lb/>
de-place</hi>, picking up an easy and disreputable living.<lb/>
His ability to read did nothing for him but fill his head<lb/>
with absurd visions. His actions were usually determined<lb/>
by motives so improbable in themselves as to<lb/>
escape the penetration of a rational person.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Thus at first sight the agent of the Gould Concession<lb/>
in Sta. Marta had credited him with the possession of<lb/>
sane views, and even with a restraining power over the<lb/>
general's everlastingly discontented vanity. It could<lb/>
never have entered his head that Pedrito Montero,<lb/>
lackey or inferior scribe, lodged in the garrets of the<lb/>
various Parisian hotels where the Costaguana Legation<lb/>
used to shelter its diplomatic dignity, had been devouring<lb/>
the lighter sort of historical works in the French<lb/>
language, such, for instance as the books of Imbert<lb/>
de Saint Amand upon the Second Empire. But Pedrito<lb/>
had been struck by the splendour of a brilliant court,<lb/>
and had conceived the idea of an existence for himself<lb/>
where, like the Duc de Morny, he would associate the<lb/>
command of every pleasure with the conduct of political<lb/>
affairs and enjoy power supremely in every way. Nobody<lb/>
could have guessed that. And yet this was one<lb/>
of the immediate causes of the Monterist Revolution.<lb/>
This will appear less incredible by the reflection that<lb/>
the fundamental causes were the same as ever, rooted<lb/>
in the political immaturity of the people, in the indolence<lb/>
of the upper classes and the mental darkness of<lb/>
the lower.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Pedrito Montero saw in the elevation of his brother<lb/>
the road wide open to his wildest imaginings. This was<lb/>
what made the Monterist pronunciamiento so unpreventable.<lb/>


<pb n="388"/>

The general himself probably could have been<lb/>
bought off, pacified with flatteries, despatched on a<lb/>
diplomatic mission to Europe. It was his brother who<lb/>
had egged him on from first to last. He wanted to become<lb/>
the most brilliant statesman of South America.<lb/>
He did not desire supreme power. He would have been<lb/>
afraid of its labour and risk, in fact. Before all, Pedrito<lb/>
Montero, taught by his European experience, meant<lb/>
to acquire a serious fortune for himself. With this<lb/>
object in view he obtained from his brother, on the<lb/>
very morrow of the successful battle, the permission<lb/>
to push on over the mountains and take possession<lb/>
of Sulaco. Sulaco was the land of future prosperity,<lb/>
the chosen land of material progress, the only province<lb/>
in the Republic of interest to European capitalists.<lb/>
Pedrito Montero, following the example of the Duc de<lb/>
Morny, meant to have his share of this prosperity.<lb/>
This is what he meant literally. Now his brother was<lb/>
master of the country, whether as President, Dictator,<lb/>
or even as Emperor &mdash; why not as an Emperor? &mdash; he<lb/>
meant to demand a share in every enterprise &mdash; in railways,<lb/>
in mines, in sugar estates, in cotton mills, in land<lb/>
companies, in each and every undertaking &mdash; as the price<lb/>
of his protection. The desire to be on the spot early<lb/>
was the real cause of the celebrated ride over the mountains<lb/>
with some two hundred llaneros, an enterprise of<lb/>
which the dangers had not appeared at first clearly to<lb/>
his impatience. Coming from a series of victories, it<lb/>
seemed to him that a Montero had only to appear<lb/>
to be master of the situation. This illusion had betrayed<lb/>
him into a rashness of which he was becoming<lb/>
aware. As he rode at the head of his llaneros he regretted<lb/>
that there were so few of them. The enthusiasm<lb/>
of the populace reassured him. They yelled <hi rend="italic">"Viva</hi><lb/>
Montero! <hi rend="italic">Viva</hi> Pedrito!" In order to make them still<lb/>


<pb n="389"/>

more enthusiastic, and from the natural pleasure he had<lb/>
in dissembling, he dropped the reins on his horse's neck,<lb/>
and with a tremendous effect of familiarity and confidence<lb/>
slipped his hands under the arms of Se&ntilde;ores<lb/>
Fuentes and Gamacho. In that posture, with a ragged<lb/>
town mozo holding his horse by the bridle, he rode<lb/>
triumphantly across the Plaza to the door of the Intendencia.<lb/>
 Its old gloomy walls seemed to shake in<lb/>
the acclamations that rent the air and covered the<lb/>
crashing peals of the cathedral bells.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Pedro Montero, the brother of the general, dismounted<lb/>
into a shouting and perspiring throng of enthusiasts<lb/>
whom the ragged Nationals were pushing<lb/>
back fiercely. Ascending a few steps he surveyed the<lb/>
large crowd gaping at him. and the bullet-speckled<lb/>
walls of the houses opposite lightly veiled by a sunny<lb/>
haze of dust. The word "PORVENIR" in immense<lb/>
black capitals, alternating with broken windows, stared<lb/>
at him across the vast space; and he thought with delight<lb/>
of the hour of vengeance, because he was very sure<lb/>
of laying his hands upon Decoud. On his left hand,<lb/>
Gamacho, big and hot, wiping his hairy wet face,<lb/>
uncovered a set of yellow fangs in a grin of stupid hilarity.<lb/>
On his right, Se&ntilde;or Fuentes, small and lean,<lb/>
looked on with compressed lips. The crowd stared<lb/>
literally open-mouthed, lost in eager stillness, as<lb/>
though they had expected the great guerrillero, the<lb/>
famous Pedrito, to begin scattering at once some sort<lb/>
of visible largesse. What he began was a speech. He<lb/>
began it with the shouted word "Citizens!" which<lb/>
reached even those in the middle of the Plaza. Afterwards<lb/>
the greater part of the citizens remained fascinated<lb/>
by the orator's action alone, his tip-toeing, the<lb/>
arms flung above his head with the fists clenched, a<lb/>
hand laid flat upon the heart, the silver gleam of rolling<lb/>


<pb n="390"/>

eyes, the sweeping, pointing, embracing gestures, a<lb/>
hand laid familiarly on Gamacho's shoulder; a hand<lb/>
waved formally towards the little black-coated person<lb/>
of Se&ntilde;or Fuentes, advocate and politician and a true<lb/>
friend of the people. The <hi rend="italic">vivas</hi> of those nearest to the<lb/>
orator bursting out suddenly propagated themselves irregularly<lb/>
to the confines of the crowd, like flames running<lb/>
over dry grass, and expired in the opening of the<lb/>
streets. In the intervals, over the swarming Plaza<lb/>
brooded a heavy silence, in which the mouth of the<lb/>
orator went on opening and shutting, and detached<lb/>
phrases &mdash; "The happiness of the people," "Sons of<lb/>
the country," "The entire world, <hi rend="italic">el mundo entiero"</hi> &mdash;<lb/>
reached even the packed steps of the cathedral with<lb/>
a feeble clear ring, thin as the buzzing of a mosquito.<lb/>
But the orator struck his breast; he seemed to prance<lb/>
between his two supporters. It was the supreme effort<lb/>
of his peroration. Then the two smaller figures disappeared<lb/>
from the public gaze and the enormous Gamacho,<lb/>
left alone, advanced, raising his hat high above<lb/>
his head. Then he covered himself proudly and yelled<lb/>
out, "Ciudadanos!" A dull roar greeted Se&ntilde;or Gamacho,<lb/>
ex-pedlar of the Campo, Commandante of the<lb/>
National Guards.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Upstairs Pedrito Montero walked about rapidly from<lb/>
one wrecked room of the Intendencia to another, snarling<lb/>
incessantly &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What stupidity! What destruction!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Se&ntilde;or Fuentes, following, would relax his taciturn<lb/>
disposition to murmur &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is all the work of Gamacho and his Nationals;"<lb/>
and then, inclining his head on his left shoulder,<lb/>
would press together his lips so firmly that a little<lb/>
hollow would appear at each corner. He had his<lb/>
nomination for Political Chief of the town in his<lb/>


<pb n="391"/>

pocket, and was all impatience to enter upon his<lb/>
functions.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the long audience room, with its tall mirrors all<lb/>
starred by stones, the hangings torn down and the<lb/>
canopy over the platform at the upper end pulled to<lb/>
pieces, the vast, deep muttering of the crowd and the<lb/>
howling voice of Gamacho speaking just below reached<lb/>
them through the shutters as they stood idly in dimness<lb/>
and desolation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The brute!" observed his Excellency Don Pedro<lb/>
Montero through clenched teeth. "We must contrive<lb/>
as quickly as possible to send him and his Nationals out<lb/>
there to fight Hernandez."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The new G&eacute;f&eacute; Pol&iacute;tico only jerked his head sideways,<lb/>
and took a puff at his cigarette in sign of his agreement<lb/>
with this method for ridding the town of Gamacho and<lb/>
his inconvenient rabble.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Pedrito Montero looked with disgust at the absolutely<lb/>
bare floor, and at the belt of heavy gilt picture-frames<lb/>
running round the room, out of which the remnants of<lb/>
torn and slashed canvases fluttered like dingy rags.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "We are not barbarians," he said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This was what said his Excellency, the popular<lb/>
Pedrito, the guerrillero skilled in the art of laying ambushes,<lb/>
charged by his brother at his own demand<lb/>
with the organization of Sulaco on democratic principles.<lb/>
 The night before, during the consultation<lb/>
with his partisans, who had come out to meet him in<lb/>
Rincon, he had opened his intentions to Se&ntilde;or Fuentes &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "We shall organize a popular vote, by yes or no, confiding<lb/>
the destinies of our beloved country to the wisdom<lb/>
and valiance of my heroic brother, the invincible general.<lb/>
A plebiscite. Do you understand?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And Se&ntilde;or Fuentes, puffing out his leathery cheeks,<lb/>
had inclined his head slightly to the left, letting a thin,<lb/>


<pb n="392"/>

bluish jet of smoke escape through his pursed lips. He<lb/>
had understood.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His Excellency was exasperated at the devastation.<lb/>
Not a single chair, table, sofa, <hi rend="italic">&eacute;tag&egrave;re</hi> or console had<lb/>
been left in the state rooms of the Intendencia. His<lb/>
Excellency, though twitching all over with rage, was<lb/>
restrained from bursting into violence by a sense of his<lb/>
remoteness and isolation. His heroic brother was very<lb/>
far away. Meantime, how was he going to take his<lb/>
siesta? He had expected to find comfort and luxury<lb/>
in the Intendencia after a year of hard camp life, ending<lb/>
with the hardships and privations of the daring dash<lb/>
upon Sulaco &mdash; upon the province which was worth<lb/>
more in wealth and influence than all the rest of the<lb/>
Republic's territory.  He would get even with Gamacho<lb/>
by-and-by. And Se&ntilde;or Gamacho's oration, delectable<lb/>
to popular ears, went on in the heat and glare<lb/>
of the Plaza like the uncouth howlings of an inferior<lb/>
sort of devil cast into a white-hot furnace. Every<lb/>
moment he had to wipe his streaming face with his bare<lb/>
fore-arm; he had flung off his coat, and had turned up<lb/>
the sleeves of his shirt high above the elbows; but he<lb/>
kept on his head the large cocked hat with white plumes.<lb/>
His ingenuousness cherished this sign of his rank as<lb/>
Commandante of the National Guards. Approving and<lb/>
grave murmurs greeted his periods. His opinion was<lb/>
that war should be declared at once against France,<lb/>
England, Germany, and the United States, who, by<lb/>
introducing railways, mining enterprises, colonization,<lb/>
and under such other shallow pretences, aimed at robbing<lb/>
poor people of their lands, and with the help of<lb/>
these Goths and paralytics, the aristocrats would convert<lb/>
them into toiling and miserable slaves.  And<lb/>
the leperos, flinging about the corners of their dirty<lb/>
white mantas, yelled their approbation. General<lb/>


<pb n="393"/>

Montero, Gamacho howled with conviction, was the<lb/>
only man equal to the patriotic task. They assented<lb/>
to that, too.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The morning was wearing on; there were already signs<lb/>
of disruption, currents and eddies in the crowd. Some<lb/>
were seeking the shade of the walls and under the trees<lb/>
of the Alameda. Horsemen spurred through, shouting;<lb/>
groups of sombreros set level on heads against the vertical<lb/>
sun were drifting away into the streets, where the<lb/>
open doors of pulperias revealed an enticing gloom resounding<lb/>
with the gentle tinkling of guitars. The National<lb/>
Guards were thinking of siesta, and the eloquence<lb/>
of Gamacho, their chief, was exhausted. Later on,<lb/>
when, in the cooler hours of the afternoon, they tried<lb/>
to assemble again for further consideration of public<lb/>
affairs, detachments of Montero's cavalry camped on<lb/>
the Alameda charged them without parley, at speed,<lb/>
with long lances levelled at their flying backs as far as<lb/>
the ends of the streets. The National Guards of<lb/>
Sulaco were surprised by this proceeding. But they<lb/>
were not indignant. No Costaguanero had ever<lb/>
learned to question the eccentricities of a military force.<lb/>
They were part of the natural order of things. This must<lb/>
be, they concluded, some kind of administrative measure,<lb/>
no doubt. But the motive of it escaped their<lb/>
unaided intelligence, and their chief and orator, Gamacho,<lb/>
Commandante of the National Guard, was lying<lb/>
drunk and asleep in the bosom of his family. His bare<lb/>
feet were upturned in the shadows repulsively, in the<lb/>
manner of a corpse. His eloquent mouth had dropped<lb/>
open. His youngest daughter, scratching her head with<lb/>
one hand, with the other waved a green bough over his<lb/>
scorched and peeling face.<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="394"/>


<p>     THE declining sun had shifted the shadows from west<lb/>
to east amongst the houses of the town. It had shifted<lb/>
them upon the whole extent of the immense Campo,<lb/>
with the white walls of its haciendas on the knolls<lb/>
dominating the green distances; with its grass-thatched<lb/>
ranches crouching in the folds of ground by the banks<lb/>
of streams; with the dark islands of clustered trees on a<lb/>
clear sea of grass, and the precipitous range of the<lb/>
Cordillera, immense and motionless, emerging from the<lb/>
billows of the lower forests like the barren coast of a<lb/>
land of giants. The sunset rays striking the snow-slope<lb/>
of Higuerota from afar gave it an air of rosy youth,<lb/>
while the serrated mass of distant peaks remained black,<lb/>
as if calcined in the fiery radiance. The undulating<lb/>
surface of the forests seemed powdered with pale gold<lb/>
dust; and away there, beyond Rincon, hidden from<lb/>
the town by two wooded spurs, the rocks of the San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; gorge, with the flat wall of the mountain itself<lb/>
crowned by gigantic ferns, took on warm tones of brown<lb/>
and yellow, with red rusty streaks, and the dark green<lb/>
clumps of bushes rooted in crevices. From the plain<lb/>
the stamp sheds and the houses of the mine appeared<lb/>
dark and small, high up, like the nests of birds clustered<lb/>
on the ledges of a cliff. The zigzag paths resembled<lb/>
faint tracings scratched on the wall of a cyclopean<lb/>
blockhouse.  To the two sere&ntilde;os of the mine on<lb/>
patrol duty, strolling, carbine in hand, and watchful<lb/>
eyes, in the shade of the trees lining the stream near<lb/>
the bridge, Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, descending the path from<lb/>




<pb n="395"/>

the upper plateau, appeared no bigger than a large<lb/>
beetle.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With his air of aimless, insect-like going to and fro<lb/>
upon the face of the rock, Don P&eacute;p&eacute;'s figure kept on<lb/>
descending steadily, and, when near the bottom, sank<lb/>
at last behind the roofs of store-houses, forges, and<lb/>
workshops. For a time the pair of sere&ntilde;os strolled<lb/>
back and forth before the bridge, on which they had<lb/>
stopped a horseman holding a large white envelope in<lb/>
his hand. Then Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, emerging in the village<lb/>
street from amongst the houses, not a stone's throw from<lb/>
the frontier bridge, approached, striding in wide dark<lb/>
trousers tucked into boots, a white linen jacket, sabre<lb/>
at his side, and revolver at his belt. In this disturbed<lb/>
time nothing could find the Se&ntilde;or Gobernador with<lb/>
his boots off, as the saying is.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     At a slight nod from one of the sere&ntilde;os, the man, a<lb/>
messenger from the town, dismounted, and crossed the<lb/>
bridge, leading his horse by the bridle.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don P&eacute;p&eacute; received the letter from his other hand,<lb/>
slapped his left side and his hips in succession, feeling<lb/>
for his spectacle case. After settling the heavy silver-<lb/>
mounted affair astride his nose, and adjusting it carefully<lb/>
behind his ears, he opened the envelope, holding<lb/>
it up at about a foot in front of his eyes. The paper he<lb/>
pulled out contained some three lines of writing. He<lb/>
looked at them for a long time. His grey moustache<lb/>
moved slightly up and down, and the wrinkles, radiating<lb/>
at the corners of his eyes, ran together. He nodded<lb/>
serenely. <hi rend="italic">"Bueno</hi>," he said. "There is no answer."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Then, in his quiet, kindly way, he engaged in a cautious<lb/>
conversation with the man, who was willing to talk<lb/>
cheerily, as if something lucky had happened to him<lb/>
recently. He had seen from a distance Sotillo's infantry<lb/>
camped along the shore of the harbour on each<lb/>


<pb n="396"/>

side of the Custom House. They had done no damage<lb/>
to the buildings. The foreigners of the railway remained<lb/>
shut up within the yards. They were no longer<lb/>
anxious to shoot poor people. He cursed the foreigners;<lb/>
then he reported Montero's entry and the rumours of<lb/>
the town. The poor were going to be made rich now.<lb/>
That was very good. More he did not know, and,<lb/>
breaking into propitiatory smiles, he intimated that he<lb/>
was hungry and thirsty. The old major directed him to<lb/>
go to the alcalde of the first village. The man rode off,<lb/>
and Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, striding slowly in the direction of a little<lb/>
wooden belfry, looked over a hedge into a little garden,<lb/>
and saw Father Rom&agrave;n sitting in a white hammock slung<lb/>
between two orange trees in front of the presbytery.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     An enormous tamarind shaded with its dark foliage<lb/>
the whole white framehouse. A young Indian girl with<lb/>
long hair, big eyes, and small hands and feet, carried out<lb/>
a wooden chair, while a thin old woman, crabbed and<lb/>
vigilant, watched her all the time from the verandah.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don P&eacute;p&eacute; sat down in the chair and lighted a cigar;<lb/>
the priest drew in an immense quantity of snuff out<lb/>
of the hollow of his palm. On his reddish-brown<lb/>
face, worn, hollowed as if crumbled, the eyes, fresh<lb/>
and candid, sparkled like two black diamonds.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, in a mild and humorous voice, informed<lb/>
Father Rom&agrave;n that Pedrito Montero, by the hand of<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or Fuentes, had asked him on what terms he would<lb/>
surrender the mine in proper working order to a legally<lb/>
constituted commission of patriotic citizens, escorted<lb/>
by a small military force. The priest cast his eyes up<lb/>
to heaven. However, Don P&eacute;p&eacute; continued, the mozo<lb/>
who brought the letter said that Don Carlos Gould<lb/>
was alive, and so far unmolested.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Father Rom&agrave;n expressed in a few words his thankfulness<lb/>
at hearing of the Se&ntilde;or Administrador's safety.<lb/>


<pb n="397"/>

</p>

<p>     The hour of oration had gone by in the silvery ringing<lb/>
of a bell in the little belfry. The belt of forest<lb/>
closing the entrance of the valley stood like a screen<lb/>
between the low sun and the street of the village. At<lb/>
the other end of the rocky gorge, between the walls of<lb/>
basalt and granite, a forest-clad mountain, hiding all<lb/>
the range from the San Tom&eacute; dwellers, rose steeply,<lb/>
lighted up and leafy to the very top. Three small rosy<lb/>
clouds hung motionless overhead in the great depth<lb/>
of blue. Knots of people sat in the street between the<lb/>
wattled huts. Before the casa of the alcalde, the foremen<lb/>
of the night-shift, already assembled to lead their<lb/>
men, squatted on the ground in a circle of leather skull-<lb/>
caps, and, bowing their bronze backs, were passing<lb/>
round the gourd of mat&eacute;. The mozo from the town,<lb/>
having fastened his horse to a wooden post before<lb/>
the door, was telling them the news of Sulaco as the<lb/>
blackened gourd of the decoction passed from hand to<lb/>
hand. The grave alcalde himself, in a white waistcloth<lb/>
and a flowered chintz gown with sleeves, open wide upon<lb/>
his naked stout person with an effect of a gaudy bathing<lb/>
robe, stood by, wearing a rough beaver hat at the back<lb/>
of his head, and grasping a tall staff with a silver knob<lb/>
in his hand. These insignia of his dignity had been<lb/>
conferred upon him by the Administration of the mine,<lb/>
the fountain of honour, of prosperity, and peace. He<lb/>
had been one of the first immigrants into this valley;<lb/>
his sons and sons-in-law worked within the mountain<lb/>
which seemed with its treasures to pour down the<lb/>
thundering ore shoots of the upper mesa, the gifts of<lb/>
well-being, security, and justice upon the toilers. He<lb/>
listened to the news from the town with curiosity<lb/>
and indifference, as if concerning another world than<lb/>
his own. And it was true that they appeared to<lb/>
him so. In a very few years the sense of belonging<lb/>


<pb n="398"/>

to a powerful organization had been developed<lb/>
in these harassed, half-wild Indians. They were proud<lb/>
of, and attached to, the mine. It had secured their<lb/>
confidence and belief. They invested it with a protecting<lb/>
and invincible virtue as though it were a fetish<lb/>
made by their own hands, for they were ignorant, and<lb/>
in other respects did not differ appreciably from the<lb/>
rest of mankind which puts infinite trust in its own<lb/>
creations. It never entered the alcalde's head that<lb/>
the mine could fail in its protection and force. Politics<lb/>
were good enough for the people of the town and the<lb/>
Campo. His yellow, round face, with wide nostrils,<lb/>
and motionless in expression, resembled a fierce full<lb/>
moon. He listened to the excited vapourings of the<lb/>
mozo without misgivings, without surprise, without<lb/>
any active sentiment whatever.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Padre Rom&agrave;n sat dejectedly balancing himself, his<lb/>
feet just touching the ground, his hands gripping the<lb/>
edge of the hammock. With less confidence, but as<lb/>
ignorant as his flock, he asked the major what did he<lb/>
think was going to happen now.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, bolt upright in the chair, folded his hands<lb/>
peacefully on the hilt of his sword, standing perpendicular<lb/>
between his thighs, and answered that he did not<lb/>
know. The mine could be defended against any force<lb/>
likely to be sent to take possession. On the other hand,<lb/>
from the arid character of the valley, when the regular<lb/>
supplies from the Campo had been cut off, the population<lb/>
of the three villages could be starved into submission.<lb/>
Don P&eacute;p&eacute; exposed these contingencies with<lb/>
serenity to Father Rom&agrave;n, who, as an old campaigner,<lb/>
was able to understand the reasoning of a military man.<lb/>
They talked with simplicity and directness. Father<lb/>
Rom&agrave;n was saddened at the idea of his flock being<lb/>
scattered or else enslaved. He had no illusions as to<lb/>


<pb n="399"/>

their fate, not from penetration, but from long experience<lb/>
of political atrocities, which seemed to him<lb/>
fatal and unavoidable in the life of a State. The working<lb/>
of the usual public institutions presented itself to<lb/>
him most distinctly as a series of calamities overtaking<lb/>
private individuals and flowing logically from each other<lb/>
through hate, revenge, folly, and rapacity, as though<lb/>
they had been part of a divine dispensation. Father<lb/>
Rom&agrave;n's clear-sightedness was served by an uninformed<lb/>
intelligence; but his heart, preserving its tenderness<lb/>
amongst scenes of carnage, spoliation, and violence,<lb/>
abhorred these calamities the more as his association<lb/>
with the victims was closer. He entertained towards<lb/>
the Indians of the valley feelings of paternal scorn.<lb/>
He had been marrying, baptizing, confessing, absolving,<lb/>
and burying the workers of the San Tom&eacute; mine with<lb/>
dignity and unction for five years or more; and he believed<lb/>
in the sacredness of these ministrations, which<lb/>
made them his own in a spiritual sense. They were<lb/>
dear to his sacerdotal supremacy. Mrs. Gould's earnest<lb/>
interest in the concerns of these people enhanced<lb/>
their importance in the priest's eyes, because it really<lb/>
augmented his own. When talking over with her the<lb/>
innumerable Marias and Brigidas of the villages, he felt<lb/>
his own humanity expand. Padre Rom&agrave;n was incapable<lb/>
of fanaticism to an almost reprehensible degree.<lb/>
The English se&ntilde;ora was evidently a heretic; but at the<lb/>
same time she seemed to him wonderful and angelic.<lb/>
Whenever that confused state of his feelings occurred<lb/>
to him, while strolling, for instance, his breviary under<lb/>
his arm, in the wide shade of the tamarind, he would<lb/>
stop short to inhale with a strong snuffling noise a large<lb/>
quantity of snuff, and shake his head profoundly. At<lb/>
the thought of what might befall the illustrious se&ntilde;ora<lb/>
presently, he became gradually overcome with dismay.<lb/>


<pb n="400"/>

He voiced it in an agitated murmur. Even Don P&eacute;p&eacute;<lb/>
lost his serenity for a moment. He leaned forward<lb/>
stiffly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Listen, Padre. The very fact that those thieving<lb/>
macaques in Sulaco are trying to find out the price of my<lb/>
honour proves that Se&ntilde;or Don Carlos and all in the Casa<lb/>
Gould are safe. As to my honour, that also is safe, as<lb/>
every man, woman, and child knows. But the negro<lb/>
Liberals who have snatched the town by surprise do not<lb/>
know that. Bueno. Let them sit and wait. While<lb/>
they wait they can do no harm."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And he regained his composure. He regained it<lb/>
easily, because whatever happened his honour of an old<lb/>
officer of Paez was safe. He had promised Charles<lb/>
Gould that at the approach of an armed force he would<lb/>
defend the gorge just long enough to give himself time<lb/>
to destroy scientifically the whole plant, buildings, and<lb/>
workshops of the mine with heavy charges of dynamite;<lb/>
block with ruins the main tunnel, break down the pathways,<lb/>
blow up the dam of the water-power, shatter<lb/>
the famous Gould Concession into fragments, flying<lb/>
sky high out of a horrified world. The mine had got<lb/>
hold of Charles Gould with a grip as deadly as ever<lb/>
it had laid upon his father. But this extreme resolution<lb/>
had seemed to Don P&eacute;p&eacute; the most natural thing in the<lb/>
world. His measures had been taken with judgment.<lb/>
Everything was prepared with a careful completeness.<lb/>
And Don P&eacute;p&eacute; folded his hands pacifically on his<lb/>
sword hilt, and nodded at the priest. In his excitement,<lb/>
Father Rom&agrave;n had flung snuff in handfuls at his<lb/>
face, and, all besmeared with tobacco, round-eyed, and<lb/>
beside himself, had got out of the hammock to walk<lb/>
about, uttering exclamations.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Don P&eacute;p&eacute; stroked his grey and pendant moustache,<lb/>
whose fine ends hung far below the clean-cut line<lb/>


<pb n="401"/>

of his jaw, and spoke with a conscious pride in his<lb/>
reputation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "So, Padre, I don't know what will happen. But I<lb/>
know that as long as I am here Don Carlos can speak to<lb/>
that macaque, Pedrito Montero, and threaten the destruction<lb/>
of the mine with perfect assurance that he will<lb/>
be taken seriously. For people know me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He began to turn the cigar in his lips a little nervously,<lb/>
and went on &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But that is talk &mdash; good for the politicos. I am a<lb/>
military man. I do not know what may happen. But<lb/>
I know what ought to be done &mdash; the mine should march<lb/>
upon the town with guns, axes, knives tied up to sticks<lb/>
&mdash; <hi rend="italic">por Dios</hi>. That is what should be done. Only &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His folded hands twitched on the hilt. The cigar<lb/>
turned faster in the corner of his lips.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And who should lead but I? Unfortunately &mdash; observe<lb/>
&mdash; I have given my word of honour to Don Carlos<lb/>
not to let the mine fall into the hands of these thieves.<lb/>
In war &mdash; you know this, Padre &mdash; the fate of battles is<lb/>
uncertain, and whom could I leave here to act for me<lb/>
in case of defeat? The explosives are ready. But it<lb/>
would require a man of high honour, of intelligence, of<lb/>
judgment, of courage, to carry out the prepared destruction.<lb/>
Somebody I can trust with my honour as I<lb/>
can trust myself. Another old officer of Paez, for instance.<lb/>
Or &mdash; or &mdash; perhaps one of Paez's old chaplains<lb/>
would do."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He got up, long, lank, upright, hard, with his martial<lb/>
moustache and the bony structure of his face, from which<lb/>
the glance of the sunken eyes seemed to transfix the<lb/>
priest, who stood still, an empty wooden snuff-box held<lb/>
upside down in his hand, and glared back, speechless,<lb/>
at the governor of the mine.<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="402"/>


<p>     AT ABOUT that time, in the Intendencia of Sulaco,<lb/>
Charles Gould was assuring Pedrito Montero, who had<lb/>
sent a request for his presence there, that he would never<lb/>
let the mine pass out of his hands for the profit of a<lb/>
Government who had robbed him of it. The Gould<lb/>
Concession could not be resumed. His father had not<lb/>
desired it. The son would never surrender it. He<lb/>
would never surrender it alive. And once dead, where<lb/>
was the power capable of resuscitating such an enterprise<lb/>
in all its vigour and wealth out of the ashes and<lb/>
ruin of destruction? There was no such power in the<lb/>
country. And where was the skill and capital abroad<lb/>
that would condescend to touch such an ill-omened<lb/>
corpse? Charles Gould talked in the impassive tone<lb/>
which had for many years served to conceal his anger<lb/>
and contempt. He suffered. He was disgusted with<lb/>
what he had to say. It was too much like heroics. In<lb/>
him the strictly practical instinct was in profound discord<lb/>
with the almost mystic view he took of his right.<lb/>
The Gould Concession was symbolic of abstract justice.<lb/>
Let the heavens fall. But since the San Tom&eacute; mine<lb/>
had developed into world-wide fame his threat had<lb/>
enough force and effectiveness to reach the rudimentary<lb/>
intelligence of Pedro Montero, wrapped up as it was<lb/>
in the futilities of historical anecdotes.  The Gould<lb/>
Concession was a serious asset in the country's finance,<lb/>
and, what was more, in the private budgets of many<lb/>
officials as well. It was traditional. It was known.<lb/>
It was said. It was credible. Every Minister of<lb/>




<pb n="403"/>

Interior drew a salary from the San Tom&eacute; mine. It<lb/>
was natural. And Pedrito intended to be Minister<lb/>
of the Interior and President of the Council in his<lb/>
brother's Government. The Duc de Morny had occupied<lb/>
those high posts during the Second French<lb/>
Empire with conspicuous advantage to himself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A table, a chair, a wooden bedstead had been procured<lb/>
for His Excellency, who, after a short siesta, rendered<lb/>
absolutely necessary by the labours and the pomps of his<lb/>
entry into Sulaco, had been getting hold of the administrative<lb/>
machine by making appointments, giving orders,<lb/>
and signing proclamations. Alone with Charles Gould<lb/>
in the audience room, His Excellency managed with his<lb/>
well-known skill to conceal his annoyance and consternation.<lb/>
He had begun at first to talk loftily of confiscation,<lb/>
but the want of all proper feeling and mobility in the<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or Administrador's features ended by affecting<lb/>
adversely his power of masterful expression. Charles<lb/>
Gould had repeated: "The Government can certainly<lb/>
bring about the destruction of the San Tom&eacute; mine if it<lb/>
likes; but without me it can do nothing else." It was<lb/>
an alarming pronouncement, and well calculated to<lb/>
hurt the sensibilities of a politician whose mind is bent<lb/>
upon the spoils of victory. And Charles Gould said<lb/>
also that the destruction of the San Tom&eacute; mine would<lb/>
cause the ruin of other undertakings, the withdrawal<lb/>
of European capital, the withholding, most probably,<lb/>
of the last instalment of the foreign loan. That stony<lb/>
fiend of a man said all these things (which were accessible<lb/>
to His Excellency's intelligence) in a cold-<lb/>
blooded manner which made one shudder.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A long course of reading historical works, light and<lb/>
gossipy in tone, carried out in garrets of Parisian hotels,<lb/>
sprawling on an untidy bed, to the neglect of his duties,<lb/>
menial or otherwise, had affected the manners of Pedro<lb/>


<pb n="404"/>

Montero. Had he seen around him the splendour of<lb/>
the old Intendencia, the magnificent hangings, the gilt<lb/>
furniture ranged along the walls; had he stood upon a<lb/>
da&iuml;s on a noble square of red carpet, he would have probably<lb/>
been very dangerous from a sense of success and<lb/>
elevation. But in this sacked and devastated residence,<lb/>
with the three pieces of common furniture huddled up<lb/>
in the middle of the vast apartment, Pedrito's imagination<lb/>
was subdued by a feeling of insecurity and<lb/>
impermanence.   That feeling and the firm attitude<lb/>
of Charles Gould who had not once, so far, pronounced<lb/>
the word "Excellency," diminished him in his own eyes.<lb/>
He assumed the tone of an enlightened man of the world,<lb/>
and begged Charles Gould to dismiss from his mind<lb/>
every cause for alarm. He was now conversing, he<lb/>
reminded him, with the brother of the master of the<lb/>
country, charged with a reorganizing mission. The<lb/>
trusted brother of the master of the country, he repeated.<lb/>
Nothing was further from the thoughts of<lb/>
that wise and patriotic hero than ideas of destruction.<lb/>
"I entreat you, Don Carlos, not to give way to your<lb/>
anti-democratic prejudices," he cried, in a burst of<lb/>
condescending effusion.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Pedrito Montero surprised one at first sight by the<lb/>
vast development of his bald forehead, a shiny yellow<lb/>
expanse between the crinkly coal-black tufts of hair<lb/>
without any lustre, the engaging form of his mouth,<lb/>
and an unexpectedly cultivated voice. But his eyes,<lb/>
very glistening as if freshly painted on each side of his<lb/>
hooked nose, had a round, hopeless, birdlike stare when<lb/>
opened fully. Now, however, he narrowed them agreeably,<lb/>
throwing his square chin up and speaking with<lb/>
closed teeth slightly through the nose, with what he<lb/>
imagined to be the manner of a grand seigneur.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In that attitude, he declared suddenly that the highest<lb/>


<pb n="405"/>

expression of democracy was C&aelig;sarism: the imperial<lb/>
rule based upon the direct popular vote. C&aelig;sarism<lb/>
was conservative. It was strong. It recognized the<lb/>
legitimate needs of democracy which requires orders,<lb/>
titles, and distinctions. They would be showered<lb/>
upon deserving men. C&aelig;sarism was peace. It was<lb/>
progressive. It secured the prosperity of a country.<lb/>
Pedrito Montero was carried away. Look at what the<lb/>
Second Empire had done for France. It was a r&eacute;gime<lb/>
which delighted to honour men of Don Carlos's stamp.<lb/>
The Second Empire fell, but that was because its chief<lb/>
was devoid of that military genius which had raised<lb/>
General Montero to the pinnacle of fame and glory.<lb/>
Pedrito elevated his hand jerkily to help the idea of<lb/>
pinnacle, of fame. "We shall have many talks yet.<lb/>
We shall understand each other thoroughly, Don<lb/>
Carlos!" he cried in a tone of fellowship. Republicanism<lb/>
had done its work. Imperial democracy was the<lb/>
power of the future. Pedrito, the guerrillero, showing<lb/>
his hand, lowered his voice forcibly. A man singled<lb/>
out by his fellow-citizens for the honourable nickname<lb/>
of El Rey de Sulaco could not but receive a full recognition<lb/>
from an imperial democracy as a great captain<lb/>
of industry and a person of weighty counsel, whose<lb/>
popular designation would be soon replaced by a more<lb/>
solid title. "Eh, Don Carlos? No! What do you<lb/>
say? Conde de Sulaco &mdash; Eh? &mdash; or marquis . . ."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He ceased. The air was cool on the Plaza, where a patrol<lb/>
of cavalry rode round and round without penetrating<lb/>
into the streets, which resounded with shouts and<lb/>
the strumming of guitars issuing from the open doors<lb/>
of pulperias. The orders were not to interfere with the<lb/>
enjoyments of the people. And above the roofs, next<lb/>
to the perpendicular lines of the cathedral towers the<lb/>
snowy curve of Higuerota blocked a large space of<lb/>


<pb n="406"/>

darkening blue sky before the windows of the Intendencia.<lb/>
After a time Pedrito Montero, thrusting his<lb/>
hand in the bosom of his coat, bowed his head with<lb/>
slow dignity. The audience was over.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould on going out passed his hand over his<lb/>
forehead as if to disperse the mists of an oppressive<lb/>
dream, whose grotesque extravagance leaves behind a<lb/>
subtle sense of bodily danger and intellectual decay.<lb/>
In the passages and on the staircases of the old palace<lb/>
Montero's troopers lounged about insolently, smoking<lb/>
and making way for no one; the clanking of sabres<lb/>
and spurs resounded all over the building. Three silent<lb/>
groups of civilians in severe black waited in the main<lb/>
gallery, formal and helpless, a little huddled up, each<lb/>
keeping apart from the others, as if in the exercise of a<lb/>
public duty they had been overcome by a desire to shun<lb/>
the notice of every eye. These were the deputations<lb/>
waiting for their audience. The one from the Provincial<lb/>
Assembly, more restless and uneasy in its corporate<lb/>
expression, was overtopped by the big face of Don Juste<lb/>
Lopez, soft and white, with prominent eyelids and<lb/>
wreathed in impenetrable solemnity as if in a dense<lb/>
cloud. The President of the Provincial Assembly,<lb/>
coming bravely to save the last shred of parliamentary<lb/>
institutions (on the English model), averted his eyes<lb/>
from the Administrador of the San Tom&eacute; mine as a<lb/>
dignified rebuke of his little faith in that only saving<lb/>
principle.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The mournful severity of that reproof did not affect<lb/>
Charles Gould, but he was sensible to the glances of the<lb/>
others directed upon him without reproach, as if only to<lb/>
read their own fate upon his face. All of them had<lb/>
talked, shouted, and declaimed in the great sala of the<lb/>
Casa Gould. The feeling of compassion for those men,<lb/>
struck with a strange impotence in the toils of moral<lb/>


<pb n="407"/>

degradation, did not induce him to make a sign. He<lb/>
suffered from his fellowship in evil with them too much.<lb/>
He crossed the Plaza unmolested. The Amarilla Club<lb/>
was full of festive ragamuffins. Their frowsy heads<lb/>
protruded from every window, and from within came<lb/>
drunken shouts, the thumping of feet, and the twanging<lb/>
of harps. Broken bottles strewed the pavement below.<lb/>
Charles Gould found the doctor still in his house.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Dr. Monygham came away from the crack in the<lb/>
shutter through which he had been watching the street.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! You are back at last!" he said in a tone of<lb/>
relief. "I have been telling Mrs. Gould that you were<lb/>
perfectly safe, but I was not by any means certain that<lb/>
the fellow would have let you go."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Neither was I," confessed Charles Gould, laying his<lb/>
hat on the table.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You will have to take action."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The silence of Charles Gould seemed to admit that<lb/>
this was the only course. This was as far as Charles<lb/>
Gould was accustomed to go towards expressing his<lb/>
intentions.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I hope you did not warn Montero of what you mean<lb/>
to do," the doctor said, anxiously.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I tried to make him see that the existence of the<lb/>
mine was bound up with my personal safety," continued<lb/>
Charles Gould, looking away from the doctor, and fixing<lb/>
his eyes upon the water-colour sketch upon the wall.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He believed you?" the doctor asked, eagerly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "God knows!" said Charles Gould. "I owed it to<lb/>
my wife to say that much. He is well enough informed.<lb/>
He knows that I have Don P&eacute;p&eacute; there. Fuentes must<lb/>
have told him. They know that the old major is perfectly<lb/>
capable of blowing up the San Tom&eacute; mine without<lb/>
hesitation or compunction. Had it not been for<lb/>
that I don't think I'd have left the Intendencia a free<lb/>


<pb n="408"/>

man. He would blow everything up from loyalty<lb/>
and from hate &mdash; from hate of these Liberals, as they<lb/>
call themselves. Liberals! The words one knows so<lb/>
well have a nightmarish meaning in this country.<lb/>
Liberty, democracy, patriotism, government &mdash; all of<lb/>
them have a flavour of folly and murder. Haven't<lb/>
they, doctor? . . . I alone can restrain Don P&eacute;p&eacute;.<lb/>
If they were to &mdash; to do away with me, nothing could<lb/>
prevent him."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "They will try to tamper with him," the doctor<lb/>
suggested, thoughtfully.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is very possible," Charles Gould said very low,<lb/>
as if speaking to himself, and still gazing at the sketch<lb/>
of the San Tom&eacute; gorge upon the wall. "Yes, I expect<lb/>
they will try that." Charles Gould looked for the first<lb/>
time at the doctor. "It would give me time," he added.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Exactly," said Dr. Monygham, suppressing his excitement.<lb/>
"Especially if Don P&eacute;p&eacute; behaves diplomatically.<lb/>
Why shouldn't he give them some hope of success?<lb/>
Eh? Otherwise you wouldn't gain so much time.<lb/>
Couldn't he be instructed to &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Charles Gould, looking at the doctor steadily, shook<lb/>
his head, but the doctor continued with a certain<lb/>
amount of fire &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes, to enter into negotiations for the surrender of<lb/>
the mine. It is a good notion. You would mature<lb/>
your plan. Of course, I don't ask what it is. I don't<lb/>
want to know. I would refuse to listen to you if you<lb/>
tried to tell me. I am not fit for confidences."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What nonsense!" muttered Charles Gould, with<lb/>
displeasure.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He disapproved of the doctor's sensitiveness about<lb/>
that far-off episode of his life. So much memory<lb/>
shocked Charles Gould. It was like morbidness. And<lb/>
again he shook his head. He refused to tamper with<lb/>


<pb n="409"/>

the open rectitude of Don P&eacute;p&eacute;'s conduct, both from<lb/>
taste and from policy. Instructions would have to be<lb/>
either verbal or in writing. In either case they ran the<lb/>
risk of being intercepted. It was by no means certain<lb/>
that a messenger could reach the mine; and, besides,<lb/>
there was no one to send. It was on the tip of Charles's<lb/>
tongue to say that only the late Capataz de Cargadores<lb/>
could have been employed with some chance of success<lb/>
and the certitude of discretion. But he did not say<lb/>
that. He pointed out to the doctor that it would have<lb/>
been bad policy. Directly Don P&eacute;p&eacute; let it be supposed<lb/>
that he could be bought over, the Administrador's<lb/>
personal safety and the safety of his friends would become<lb/>
endangered. For there would be then no reason<lb/>
for moderation. The incorruptibility of Don P&eacute;p&eacute;<lb/>
was the essential and restraining fact. The doctor hung<lb/>
his head and admitted that in a way it was so.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He couldn't deny to himself that the reasoning was<lb/>
sound enough. Don P&eacute;p&eacute;'s usefulness consisted in his<lb/>
unstained character. As to his own usefulness, he<lb/>
reflected bitterly it was also his own character. He<lb/>
declared to Charles Gould that he had the means of<lb/>
keeping Sotillo from joining his forces with Montero,<lb/>
at least for the present.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "If you had had all this silver here," the doctor said,<lb/>
"or even if it had been known to be at the mine, you<lb/>
could have bribed Sotillo to throw off his recent Monterism.<lb/>
You could have induced him either to go away<lb/>
in his steamer or even to join you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Certainly not that last," Charles Gould declared,<lb/>
firmly. "What could one do with a man like that,<lb/>
afterwards &mdash; tell me, doctor? The silver is gone, and<lb/>
I am glad of it. It would have been an immediate<lb/>
and strong temptation. The scramble for that visible<lb/>
plunder would have precipitated a disastrous ending.<lb/>


<pb n="410"/>

I would have had to defend it, too. I am glad we've<lb/>
removed it &mdash; even if it is lost. It would have been a<lb/>
danger and a curse."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Perhaps he is right," the doctor, an hour later, said<lb/>
hurriedly to Mrs. Gould, whom he met in the corridor.<lb/>
"The thing is done, and the shadow of the treasure may<lb/>
do just as well as the substance. Let me try to serve you<lb/>
to the whole extent of my evil reputation. I am off now<lb/>
to play my game of betrayal with Sotillo, and keep him<lb/>
off the town."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She put out both her hands impulsively. "Dr. Monygham,<lb/>
you are running a terrible risk," she whispered,<lb/>
averting from his face her eyes, full of tears, for a short<lb/>
glance at the door of her husband's room. She pressed<lb/>
both his hands, and the doctor stood as if rooted to the<lb/>
spot, looking down at her, and trying to twist his lips<lb/>
into a smile.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Oh, I know you will defend my memory," he uttered<lb/>
at last, and ran tottering down the stairs across the<lb/>
patio, and out of the house. In the street he kept up.<lb/>
a great pace with his smart hobbling walk, a case of instruments<lb/>
under his arm. He was known for being <hi rend="italic">loco</hi>.<lb/>
Nobody interfered with him. From under the seaward<lb/>
gate, across the dusty, arid plain, interspersed with low<lb/>
bushes, he saw, more than a mile away, the ugly enormity<lb/>
of the Custom House, and the two or three other<lb/>
buildings which at that time constituted the seaport<lb/>
of Sulaco. Far away to the south groves of palm trees<lb/>
edged the curve of the harbour shore. The distant<lb/>
peaks of the Cordillera had lost their identity of clear-<lb/>
cut shapes in the steadily deepening blue of the eastern<lb/>
sky. The doctor walked briskly. A darkling shadow<lb/>
seemed to fall upon him from the zenith. The sun<lb/>
had set. For a time the snows of Higuerota continued<lb/>
to glow with the reflected glory of the west. The<lb/>


<pb n="411"/>

doctor, holding a straight course for the Custom House,<lb/>
appeared lonely, hopping amongst the dark bushes like<lb/>
a tall bird with a broken wing.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Tints of purple, gold, and crimson were mirrored in<lb/>
the clear water of the harbour. A long tongue of land,<lb/>
straight as a wall, with the grass-grown ruins of the<lb/>
fort making a sort of rounded green mound, plainly<lb/>
visible from the inner shore, closed its circuit; while<lb/>
beyond the Placid Gulf repeated those splendours of<lb/>
colouring on a greater scale and with a more sombre<lb/>
magnificence. The great mass of cloud filling the head<lb/>
of the gulf had long red smears amongst its convoluted<lb/>
folds of grey and black, as of a floating mantle stained<lb/>
with blood. The three Isabels, overshadowed and<lb/>
clear cut in a great smoothness confounding the sea<lb/>
and sky, appeared suspended, purple-black, in the air.<lb/>
The little wavelets seemed to be tossing tiny red sparks<lb/>
upon the sandy beaches. The glassy bands of water<lb/>
along the horizon gave out a fiery red glow, as if fire<lb/>
and water had been mingled together in the vast bed<lb/>
of the ocean.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     At last the conflagration of sea and sky, lying embraced<lb/>
and still in a flaming contact upon the edge of<lb/>
the world, went out. The red sparks in the water<lb/>
vanished together with the stains of blood in the black<lb/>
mantle draping the sombre head of the Placid Gulf; a<lb/>
sudden breeze sprang up and died out after rustling<lb/>
heavily the growth of bushes on the ruined earthwork<lb/>
of the fort. Nostromo woke up from a fourteen hours'<lb/>
sleep, and arose full length from his lair in the long grass.<lb/>
He stood knee deep amongst the whispering undulations<lb/>
of the green blades with the lost air of a man just born<lb/>
into the world. Handsome, robust, and supple, he<lb/>
threw back his head, flung his arms open, and stretched<lb/>
himself with a slow twist of the waist and a leisurely<lb/>


<pb n="412"/>

growling yawn of white teeth, as natural and free from<lb/>
evil in the moment of waking as a magnificent and<lb/>
unconscious wild beast. Then, in the suddenly steadied<lb/>
glance fixed upon nothing from under a thoughtful<lb/>
frown, appeared the man.<lb/>
</p>


</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="8" id="d34">
<head>CHAPTER EIGHT</head>

<pb n="413"/>


<p>     AFTER landing from his swim Nostromo had scrambled<lb/>
up, all dripping, into the main quadrangle of the<lb/>
old fort; and there, amongst ruined bits of walls and<lb/>
rotting remnants of roofs and sheds, he had slept<lb/>
the day through. He had slept in the shadow of the<lb/>
mountains, in the white blaze of noon, in the stillness<lb/>
and solitude of that overgrown piece of land between<lb/>
the oval of the harbour and the spacious semi-circle<lb/>
of the gulf. He lay as if dead. A rey-zamuro, appearing<lb/>
like a tiny black speck in the blue, stooped, circling<lb/>
prudently with a stealthiness of flight startling in a bird<lb/>
of that great size. The shadow of his pearly-white<lb/>
body, of his black-tipped wings, fell on the grass no<lb/>
more silently than he alighted himself on a hillock of<lb/>
rubbish within three yards of that man, lying as still<lb/>
as a corpse. The bird stretched his bare neck, craned<lb/>
his bald head, loathsome in the brilliance of varied<lb/>
colouring, with an air of voracious anxiety towards the<lb/>
promising stillness of that prostrate body. Then,<lb/>
sinking his head deeply into his soft plumage, he settled<lb/>
himself to wait. The first thing upon which Nostromo's<lb/>
eyes fell on waking was this patient watcher for<lb/>
the signs of death and corruption. When the man got<lb/>
up the vulture hopped away in great, side-long, fluttering<lb/>
jumps. He lingered for a while, morose and reluctant,<lb/>
before he rose, circling noiselessly with a sinister<lb/>
droop of beak and claws.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Long after he had vanished, Nostromo, lifting his<lb/>
eyes up to the sky, muttered, "I am not dead yet."<lb/>




<pb n="414"/>

</p>

<p>     The Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores had lived in<lb/>
splendour and publicity up to the very moment, as it<lb/>
were, when he took charge of the lighter containing the<lb/>
treasure of silver ingots.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The last act he had performed in Sulaco was in complete<lb/>
harmony with his vanity, and as such perfectly<lb/>
genuine. He had given his last dollar to an old woman<lb/>
moaning with the grief and fatigue of a dismal search<lb/>
under the arch of the ancient gate. Performed in<lb/>
obscurity and without witnesses, it had still the characteristics<lb/>
of splendour and publicity, and was in strict<lb/>
keeping with his reputation. But this awakening in<lb/>
solitude, except for the watchful vulture, amongst<lb/>
the ruins of the fort, had no such characteristics. His<lb/>
first confused feeling was exactly this &mdash; that it was not<lb/>
in keeping. It was more like the end of things. The<lb/>
necessity of living concealed somehow, for God knows<lb/>
how long, which assailed him on his return to consciousness,<lb/>
made everything that had gone before for years<lb/>
appear vain and foolish, like a flattering dream come<lb/>
suddenly to an end.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He climbed the crumbling slope of the rampart, and,<lb/>
putting aside the bushes, looked upon the harbour. He<lb/>
saw a couple of ships at anchor upon the sheet of water<lb/>
reflecting the last gleams of light, and Sotillo's steamer<lb/>
moored to the jetty. And behind the pale long front of<lb/>
the Custom House, there appeared the extent of the<lb/>
town like a grove of thick timber on the plain with a<lb/>
gateway in front, and the cupolas, towers, and miradors<lb/>
rising above the trees, all dark, as if surrendered already<lb/>
to the night. The thought that it was no longer open<lb/>
to him to ride through the streets, recognized by everyone,<lb/>
great and little, as he used to do every evening<lb/>
on his way to play <hi rend="italic">monte</hi> in the posada of the Mexican<lb/>
Domingo; or to sit in the place of honour, listening to<lb/>


<pb n="415"/>

songs and looking at dances, made it appear to him as<lb/>
a town that had no existence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     For a long time he gazed on, then let the parted<lb/>
bushes spring back, and, crossing over to the other side<lb/>
of the fort, surveyed the vaster emptiness of the great<lb/>
gulf. The Isabels stood out heavily upon the narrowing<lb/>
long band of red in the west, which gleamed low between<lb/>
their black shapes, and the Capataz thought of Decoud<lb/>
alone there with the treasure. That man was the only<lb/>
one who cared whether he fell into the hands of the<lb/>
Monterists or not, the Capataz reflected bitterly. And<lb/>
that merely would be an anxiety for his own sake. As<lb/>
to the rest, they neither knew nor cared. What he<lb/>
had heard Giorgio Viola say once was very true.<lb/>
Kings, ministers, aristocrats, the rich in general, kept<lb/>
the people in poverty and subjection; they kept them<lb/>
as they kept dogs, to fight and hunt for their service.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The darkness of the sky had descended to the line of<lb/>
the horizon, enveloping the whole gulf, the islets, and<lb/>
the lover of Antonia alone with the treasure on the<lb/>
Great Isabel. The Capataz, turning his back on these<lb/>
things invisible and existing, sat down and took his<lb/>
face between his fists. He felt the pinch of poverty<lb/>
for the first time in his life. To find himself without<lb/>
money after a run of bad luck at <hi rend="italic">monte</hi> in the low,<lb/>
smoky room of Domingo's posada, where the fraternity<lb/>
of Cargadores gambled, sang, and danced of an evening;<lb/>
to remain with empty pockets after a burst of public<lb/>
generosity to some <hi rend="italic">peyne d'oro</hi> girl or other (for whom<lb/>
he did not care), had none of the humiliation of destitution.<lb/>
He remained rich in glory and reputation. But<lb/>
since it was no longer possible for him to parade the<lb/>
streets of the town, and be hailed with respect in the<lb/>
usual haunts of his leisure, this sailor felt himself destitute<lb/>
indeed.<lb/>


<pb n="416"/>

</p>

<p>     His mouth was dry. It was dry with heavy sleep and<lb/>
extremely anxious thinking, as it had never been dry<lb/>
before. It may be said that Nostromo tasted the dust<lb/>
and ashes of the fruit of life into which he had bitten<lb/>
deeply in his hunger for praise. Without removing<lb/>
his head from between his fists, he tried to spit before<lb/>
him &mdash; "Tfui" &mdash; and muttered a curse upon the selfishness<lb/>
of all the rich people.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Since everything seemed lost in Sulaco (and that was<lb/>
the feeling of his waking), the idea of leaving the country<lb/>
altogether had presented itself to Nostromo. At<lb/>
that thought he had seen, like the beginning of another<lb/>
dream, a vision of steep and tideless shores, with dark<lb/>
pines on the heights and white houses low down near<lb/>
a very blue sea. He saw the quays of a big port,<lb/>
where the coasting feluccas, with their lateen sails<lb/>
outspread like motionless wings, enter gliding silently<lb/>
between the end of long moles of squared blocks that<lb/>
project angularly towards each other, hugging a cluster<lb/>
of shipping to the superb bosom of a hill covered with<lb/>
palaces. He remembered these sights not without<lb/>
some filial emotion, though he had been habitually and<lb/>
severely beaten as a boy on one of these feluccas by a<lb/>
short-necked, shaven Genoese, with a deliberate and<lb/>
distrustful manner, who (he firmly believed) had cheated<lb/>
him out of his orphan's inheritance. But it is mercifully<lb/>
decreed that the evils of the past should appear<lb/>
but faintly in retrospect. Under the sense of loneliness,<lb/>
abandonment, and failure, the idea of return to these<lb/>
things appeared tolerable. But, what? Return? With<lb/>
bare feet and head, with one check shirt and a pair of<lb/>
cotton calzoneros for all worldly possessions?<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The renowned Capataz, his elbows on his knees and a<lb/>
fist dug into each cheek, laughed with self-derision, as<lb/>
he had spat with disgust, straight out before him into<lb/>


<pb n="417"/>

the night. The confused and intimate impressions of<lb/>
universal dissolution which beset a subjective nature at<lb/>
any strong check to its ruling passion had a bitterness<lb/>
approaching that of death itself. He was simple. He<lb/>
was as ready to become the prey of any belief, superstition,<lb/>
or desire as a child.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The facts of his situation he could appreciate like a<lb/>
man with a distinct experience of the country. He saw<lb/>
them clearly. He was as if sobered after a long bout<lb/>
of intoxication. His fidelity had been taken advantage<lb/>
of. He had persuaded the body of Cargadores to side<lb/>
with the Blancos against the rest of the people; he had<lb/>
had interviews with Don Jos&eacute;; he had been made use<lb/>
of by Father Corbel&agrave;n for negotiating with Hernandez;<lb/>
it was known that Don Martin Decoud had admitted<lb/>
him to a sort of intimacy, so that he had been<lb/>
free of the offices of the <hi rend="italic">Porvenir</hi>. All these things had<lb/>
flattered him in the usual way. What did he care about<lb/>
their politics? Nothing at all. And at the end of it all<lb/>
&mdash; Nostromo here and Nostromo there &mdash; where is Nostromo?<lb/>
Nostromo can do this and that &mdash; work all day<lb/>
and ride all night &mdash; behold! he found himself a marked<lb/>
Ribierist for any sort of vengeance Gamacho, for instance,<lb/>
would choose to take, now the Montero party,<lb/>
had, after all, mastered the town. The Europeans<lb/>
had given up; the Caballeros had given up. Don<lb/>
Martin had indeed explained it was only temporary &mdash;<lb/>
that he was going to bring Barrios to the rescue. Where<lb/>
was that now &mdash; with Don Martin (whose ironic manner<lb/>
of talk had always made the Capataz feel vaguely uneasy)<lb/>
stranded on the Great Isabel? Everybody had<lb/>
given up. Even Don Carlos had given up. The<lb/>
hurried removal of the treasure out to sea meant nothing<lb/>
else than that. The Capataz de Cargadores, on a revulsion<lb/>
of subjectiveness, exasperated almost to insanity,<lb/>


<pb n="418"/>

beheld all his world without faith and courage. He had<lb/>
been betrayed!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With the boundless shadows of the sea behind him,<lb/>
out of his silence and immobility, facing the lofty shapes<lb/>
of the lower peaks crowded around the white, misty<lb/>
sheen of Higuerota, Nostromo laughed aloud again,<lb/>
sprang abruptly to his feet, and stood still. He must<lb/>
go. But where?<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "There is no mistake. They keep us and encourage<lb/>
us as if we were dogs born to fight and hunt for them.<lb/>
The vecchio is right," he said, slowly and scathingly.<lb/>
He remembered old Giorgio taking his pipe out of his<lb/>
mouth to throw these words over his shoulder at the<lb/>
caf&eacute;, full of engine-drivers and fitters from the railway<lb/>
workshops. This image fixed his wavering purpose.<lb/>
He would try to find old Giorgio if he could. God<lb/>
knows what might have happened to him! He made<lb/>
a few steps, then stopped again and shook his head.<lb/>
To the left and right, in front and behind him, the<lb/>
scrubby bush rustled mysteriously in the darkness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Teresa was right, too," he added in a low tone<lb/>
touched with awe. He wondered whether she was<lb/>
dead in her anger with him or still alive. As if in answer<lb/>
to this thought, half of remorse and half of hope, with a<lb/>
soft flutter and oblique flight, a big owl, whose appalling<lb/>
cry: "Ya-acabo! Ya-acabo! &mdash; it is finished; it is finished"<lb/>
&mdash; announces calamity and death in the popular<lb/>
belief, drifted vaguely like a large dark ball across his<lb/>
path. In the downfall of all the realities that made his<lb/>
force, he was affected by the superstition, and shuddered<lb/>
slightly. Signora Teresa must have died, then. It<lb/>
could mean nothing else. The cry of the ill-omened<lb/>
bird, the first sound he was to hear on his return, was a<lb/>
fitting welcome for his betrayed individuality. The<lb/>
unseen powers which he had offended by refusing<lb/>


<pb n="419"/>

to bring a priest to a dying woman were lifting up<lb/>
their voice against him. She was dead. With admirable<lb/>
and human consistency he referred everything to<lb/>
himself. She had been a woman of good counsel always.<lb/>
And the bereaved old Giorgio remained stunned<lb/>
by his loss just as he was likely to require the advice<lb/>
of his sagacity. The blow would render the dreamy<lb/>
old man quite stupid for a time.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     As to Captain Mitchell, Nostromo, after the manner<lb/>
of trusted subordinates, considered him as a person<lb/>
fitted by education perhaps to sign papers in an office<lb/>
and to give orders, but otherwise of no use whatever,<lb/>
and something of a fool. The necessity of winding<lb/>
round his little finger, almost daily, the pompous and<lb/>
testy self-importance of the old seaman had grown<lb/>
irksome with use to Nostromo. At first it had given<lb/>
him an inward satisfaction. But the necessity of<lb/>
overcoming small obstacles becomes wearisome to a<lb/>
self-confident personality as much by the certitude<lb/>
of success as by the monotony of effort. He mistrusted<lb/>
his superior's proneness to fussy action. That old<lb/>
Englishman had no judgment, he said to himself. It<lb/>
was useless to suppose that, acquainted with the true<lb/>
state of the case, he would keep it to himself. He<lb/>
would talk of doing impracticable things. Nostromo<lb/>
feared him as one would fear saddling one's self<lb/>
with some persistent worry. He had no discretion.<lb/>
He would betray the treasure. And Nostromo had<lb/>
made up his mind that the treasure should not be<lb/>
betrayed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The word had fixed itself tenaciously in his intelligence.<lb/>
His imagination had seized upon the clear and<lb/>
simple notion of betrayal to account for the dazed feeling<lb/>
of enlightenment as to being done for, of having<lb/>
inadvertently gone out of his existence on an issue in<lb/>


<pb n="420"/>

which his personality had not been taken into account.<lb/>
A man betrayed is a man destroyed. Signora Teresa<lb/>
(may God have her soul!) had been right. He had<lb/>
never been taken into account. Destroyed! Her<lb/>
white form sitting up bowed in bed, the falling black<lb/>
hair, the wide-browed suffering face raised to him, the<lb/>
anger of her denunciations appeared to him now majestic<lb/>
with the awfulness of inspiration and of death.<lb/>
For it was not for nothing that the evil bird had uttered<lb/>
its lamentable shriek over his head. She was dead &mdash;<lb/>
may God have her soul!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sharing in the anti-priestly freethought of the masses,<lb/>
his mind used the pious formula from the superficial<lb/>
force of habit, but with a deep-seated sincerity. The<lb/>
popular mind is incapable of scepticism; and that incapacity<lb/>
delivers their helpless strength to the wiles of<lb/>
swindlers and to the pitiless enthusiasms of leaders<lb/>
inspired by visions of a high destiny. She was dead.<lb/>
But would God consent to receive her soul? She had<lb/>
died without confession or absolution, because he had<lb/>
not been willing to spare her another moment of his<lb/>
time. His scorn of priests as priests remained; but<lb/>
after all, it was impossible to know whether what they<lb/>
affirmed was not true. Power, punishment, pardon,<lb/>
are simple and credible notions. The magnificent<lb/>
Capataz de Cargadores, deprived of certain simple<lb/>
realities, such as the admiration of women, the adulation<lb/>
of men, the admired publicity of his life, was ready<lb/>
to feel the burden of sacrilegious guilt descend upon his<lb/>
shoulders.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Bareheaded, in a thin shirt and drawers, he felt the<lb/>
lingering warmth of the fine sand under the soles of his<lb/>
feet. The narrow strand gleamed far ahead in a long<lb/>
curve, defining the outline of this wild side of the<lb/>
harbour. He flitted along the shore like a pursued<lb/>


<pb n="421"/>

shadow between the sombre palm-groves and the sheet<lb/>
of water lying as still as death on his right hand. He<lb/>
strode with headlong haste in the silence and solitude<lb/>
as though he had forgotten all prudence and caution.<lb/>
But he knew that on this side of the water he ran no<lb/>
risk of discovery. The only inhabitant was a lonely,<lb/>
silent, apathetic Indian in charge of the palmarias,<lb/>
who brought sometimes a load of cocoanuts to the town<lb/>
for sale. He lived without a woman in an open shed,<lb/>
with a perpetual fire of dry sticks smouldering near<lb/>
an old canoe lying bottom up on the beach.  He could<lb/>
be easily avoided.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The barking of the dogs about that man's ranche was<lb/>
the first thing that checked his speed. He had forgotten<lb/>
the dogs. He swerved sharply, and plunged into the<lb/>
palm-grove, as into a wilderness of columns in an immense<lb/>
hall, whose dense obscurity seemed to whisper<lb/>
and rustle faintly high above his head. He traversed<lb/>
it, entered a ravine, and climbed to the top of a steep<lb/>
ridge free of trees and bushes.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     From there, open and vague in the starlight, he saw<lb/>
the plain between the town and the harbour. In the<lb/>
woods above some night-bird made a strange drumming<lb/>
noise. Below beyond the palmaria on the beach, the<lb/>
Indian's dogs continued to bark uproariously. He<lb/>
wondered what had upset them so much, and, peering<lb/>
down from his elevation, was surprised to detect unaccountable<lb/>
movements of the ground below, as if<lb/>
several oblong pieces of the plain had been in motion.<lb/>
Those dark, shifting patches, alternately catching and<lb/>
eluding the eye, altered their place always away from<lb/>
the harbour, with a suggestion of consecutive order<lb/>
and purpose. A light dawned upon him. It was a<lb/>
column of infantry on a night march towards the higher<lb/>
broken country at the foot of the hills. But he was<lb/>


<pb n="422"/>

too much in the dark about everything for wonder<lb/>
and speculation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The plain had resumed its shadowy immobility.<lb/>
He descended the ridge and found himself in the open<lb/>
solitude, between the harbour and the town. Its spaciousness,<lb/>
extended indefinitely by an effect of obscurity,<lb/>
rendered more sensible his profound isolation.<lb/>
His pace became slower. No one waited for him; no<lb/>
one thought of him; no one expected or wished his return.<lb/>
"Betrayed! Betrayed!" he muttered to himself.<lb/>
No one cared. He might have been drowned<lb/>
by this time. No one would have cared &mdash; unless, perhaps,<lb/>
the children, he thought to himself. But they<lb/>
were with the English signora, and not thinking of him<lb/>
at all.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He wavered in his purpose of making straight for the<lb/>
Casa Viola. To what end? What could he expect<lb/>
there? His life seemed to fail him in all its details, even<lb/>
to the scornful reproaches of Teresa. He was aware<lb/>
painfully of his reluctance. Was it that remorse which<lb/>
she had prophesied with, what he saw now, was her<lb/>
last breath?<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Meantime, he had deviated from the straight course,<lb/>
inclining by a sort of instinct to the right, towards the<lb/>
jetty and the harbour, the scene of his daily labours.<lb/>
The great length of the Custom House loomed up all at<lb/>
once like the wall of a factory. Not a soul challenged<lb/>
his approach, and his curiosity became excited as he<lb/>
passed cautiously towards the front by the unexpected<lb/>
sight of two lighted windows.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     They had the fascination of a lonely vigil kept by<lb/>
some mysterious watcher up there, those two windows<lb/>
shining dimly upon the harbour in the whole vast extent<lb/>
of the abandoned building. The solitude could almost<lb/>
be felt. A strong smell of wood smoke hung about in<lb/>


<pb n="423"/>

a thin haze, which was faintly perceptible to his raised<lb/>
eyes against the glitter of the stars. As he advanced<lb/>
in the profound silence, the shrilling of innumerable<lb/>
cicalas in the dry grass seemed positively deafening to<lb/>
his strained ears. Slowly, step by step, he found himself<lb/>
in the great hall, sombre and full of acrid smoke.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A fire built against the staircase had burnt down<lb/>
impotently to a low heap of embers. The hard wood<lb/>
had failed to catch; only a few steps at the bottom<lb/>
smouldered, with a creeping glow of sparks defining<lb/>
their charred edges. At the top he saw a streak of<lb/>
light from an open door. It fell upon the vast landing,<lb/>
all foggy with a slow drift of smoke. That was the<lb/>
room. He climbed the stairs, then checked himself,<lb/>
because he had seen within the shadow of a man cast<lb/>
upon one of the walls. It was a shapeless, high-<lb/>
shouldered shadow of somebody standing still, with<lb/>
lowered head, out of his line of sight. The Capataz, remembering<lb/>
that he was totally unarmed, stepped aside,<lb/>
and, effacing himself upright in a dark corner, waited<lb/>
with his eyes fixed on the door.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The whole enormous ruined barrack of a place, unfinished,<lb/>
without ceilings under its lofty roof, was pervaded<lb/>
by the smoke swaying to and fro in the faint cross<lb/>
draughts playing in the obscurity of many lofty rooms<lb/>
and barnlike passages. Once one of the swinging<lb/>
shutters came against the wall with a single sharp crack,<lb/>
as if pushed by an impatient hand. A piece of paper<lb/>
scurried out from somewhere, rustling along the landing.<lb/>
The man, whoever he was, did not darken the<lb/>
lighted doorway. Twice the Capataz, advancing a<lb/>
couple of steps out of his corner, craned his neck in<lb/>
the hope of catching sight of what he could be at, so<lb/>
quietly, in there. But every time he saw only the distorted<lb/>
shadow of broad shoulders and bowed head.<lb/>


<pb n="424"/>

He was doing apparently nothing, and stirred not<lb/>
from the spot, as though he were meditating &mdash; or, perhaps,<lb/>
reading a paper. And not a sound issued from<lb/>
the room.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Once more the Capataz stepped back. He wondered<lb/>
who it was &mdash; some Monterist? But he dreaded to show<lb/>
himself. To discover his presence on shore, unless<lb/>
after many days, would, he believed, endanger the<lb/>
treasure. With his own knowledge possessing his whole<lb/>
soul, it seemed impossible that anybody in Sulaco<lb/>
should fail to jump at the right surmise. After a<lb/>
couple of weeks or so it would be different. Who<lb/>
could tell he had not returned overland from some<lb/>
port beyond the limits of the Republic? The existence<lb/>
of the treasure confused his thoughts with a peculiar<lb/>
sort of anxiety, as though his life had become bound<lb/>
up with it. It rendered him timorous for a moment<lb/>
before that enigmatic, lighted door. Devil take the<lb/>
fellow! He did not want to see him. There would be<lb/>
nothing to learn from his face, known or unknown.<lb/>
He was a fool to waste his time there in waiting.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Less than five minutes after entering the place the<lb/>
Capataz began his retreat. He got away down the<lb/>
stairs with perfect success, gave one upward look over<lb/>
his shoulder at the light on the landing, and ran stealthily<lb/>
across the hall. But at the very moment he was turning<lb/>
out of the great door, with his mind fixed upon escaping<lb/>
the notice of the man upstairs, somebody he had<lb/>
not heard coming briskly along the front ran full into<lb/>
him. Both muttered a stifled exclamation of surprise,<lb/>
and leaped back and stood still, each indistinct to the<lb/>
other. Nostromo was silent. The other man spoke<lb/>
first, in an amazed and deadened tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Who are you?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Already Nostromo had seemed to recognize Dr.<lb/>


<pb n="425"/>

Monygham. He had no doubt now. He hesitated<lb/>
the space of a second. The idea of bolting without a<lb/>
word presented itself to his mind. No use! An inexplicable<lb/>
repugnance to pronounce the name by which<lb/>
he was known kept him silent a little longer. At last<lb/>
he said in a low voice &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A Cargador."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He walked up to the other. Dr. Monygham had<lb/>
received a shock. He flung his arms up and cried out<lb/>
his wonder aloud, forgetting himself before the marvel<lb/>
of this meeting. Nostromo angrily warned him to moderate<lb/>
his voice. The Custom House was not so deserted<lb/>
as it looked. There was somebody in the lighted room<lb/>
above.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There is no more evanescent quality in an accomplished<lb/>
fact than its wonderfulness. Solicited incessantly<lb/>
by the considerations affecting its fears and<lb/>
desires, the human mind turns naturally away from the<lb/>
marvellous side of events. And it was in the most<lb/>
natural way possible that the doctor asked this man<lb/>
whom only two minutes before he believed to have<lb/>
been drowned in the gulf &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have seen somebody up there? Have you?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, I have not seen him."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Then how do you know?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I was running away from his shadow when we<lb/>
met."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "His shadow?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. His shadow in the lighted room," said Nostromo,<lb/>
in a contemptuous tone. Leaning back with<lb/>
folded arms at the foot of the immense building, he<lb/>
dropped his head, biting his lips slightly, and not looking<lb/>
at the doctor. "Now," he thought to himself, "he<lb/>
will begin asking me about the treasure."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But the doctor's thoughts were concerned with an<lb/>


<pb n="426"/>

event not as marvellous as Nostromo's appearance,<lb/>
but in itself much less clear. Why had Sotillo taken<lb/>
himself off with his whole command with this suddenness<lb/>
and secrecy? What did this move portend?<lb/>
However, it dawned upon the doctor that the man<lb/>
upstairs was one of the officers left behind by the disappointed<lb/>
colonel to communicate with him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I believe he is waiting for me," he said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is possible."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I must see. Do not go away yet, Capataz."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Go away where?" muttered Nostromo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Already the doctor had left him. He remained<lb/>
leaning against the wall, staring at the dark water of<lb/>
the harbour; the shrilling of cicalas filled his ears. An<lb/>
invincible vagueness coming over his thoughts took<lb/>
from them all power to determine his will.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Capataz! Capataz!" the doctor's voice called<lb/>
urgently from above.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The sense of betrayal and ruin floated upon his sombre<lb/>
indifference as upon a sluggish sea of pitch. But he<lb/>
stepped out from under the wall, and, looking up, saw<lb/>
Dr. Monygham leaning out of a lighted window.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Come up and see what Sotillo has done. You need<lb/>
not fear the man up here."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He answered by a slight, bitter laugh. Fear a man!<lb/>
The Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores fear a man!<lb/>
It angered him that anybody should suggest such a<lb/>
thing. It angered him to be disarmed and skulking<lb/>
and in danger because of the accursed treasure, which<lb/>
was of so little account to the people who had tied it<lb/>
round his neck. He could not shake off the worry of<lb/>
it. To Nostromo the doctor represented all these<lb/>
people. . . . And he had never even asked after<lb/>
it. Not a word of inquiry about the most desperate<lb/>
undertaking of his life.<lb/>


<pb n="427"/>

</p>

<p>     Thinking these thoughts, Nostromo passed again<lb/>
through the cavernous hall, where the smoke was considerably<lb/>
thinned, and went up the stairs, not so warm<lb/>
to his feet now, towards the streak of light at the top.<lb/>
The doctor appeared in it for a moment, agitated and<lb/>
impatient.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Come up! Come up!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     At the moment of crossing the doorway the Capataz<lb/>
experienced a shock of surprise. The man had not<lb/>
moved. He saw his shadow in the same place. He<lb/>
started, then stepped in with a feeling of being about to<lb/>
solve a mystery.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was very simple. For an infinitesimal fraction of<lb/>
a second, against the light of two flaring and guttering<lb/>
candles, through a blue, pungent, thin haze which made<lb/>
his eyes smart, he saw the man standing, as he had<lb/>
imagined him, with his back to the door, casting an<lb/>
enormous and distorted shadow upon the wall. Swifter<lb/>
than a flash of lightning followed the impression of his<lb/>
constrained, toppling attitude &mdash; the shoulders projecting<lb/>
forward, the head sunk low upon the breast. Then<lb/>
he distinguished the arms behind his back, and wrenched<lb/>
so terribly that the two clenched fists, lashed together,<lb/>
had been forced up higher than the shoulder-blades.<lb/>
From there his eyes traced in one instantaneous glance<lb/>
the hide rope going upwards from the tied wrists over<lb/>
a heavy beam and down to a staple in the wall. He<lb/>
did not want to look at the rigid legs, at the feet hanging<lb/>
down nervelessly, with their bare toes some six inches<lb/>
above the floor, to know that the man had been given<lb/>
the estrapade till he had swooned. His first impulse<lb/>
was to dash forward and sever the rope at one blow.<lb/>
He felt for his knife. He had no knife &mdash; not even a<lb/>
knife. He stood quivering, and the doctor, perched<lb/>
on the edge of the table, facing thoughtfully the cruel<lb/>


<pb n="428"/>

and lamentable sight, his chin in his hand, uttered,<lb/>
without stirring &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Tortured &mdash; and shot dead through the breast &mdash;<lb/>
getting cold."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This information calmed the Capataz. One of the<lb/>
candles flickering in the socket went out. "Who did<lb/>
this?" he asked.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Sotillo, I tell you. Who else? Tortured &mdash; of course.<lb/>
But why shot?" The doctor looked fixedly at Nostromo,<lb/>
who shrugged his shoulders slightly.  "And<lb/>
mark, shot suddenly, on impulse. It is evident. I<lb/>
wish I had his secret."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo had advanced, and stooped slightly to<lb/>
look. "I seem to have seen that face somewhere," he<lb/>
muttered. "Who is he?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor turned his eyes upon him again. "I<lb/>
may yet come to envying his fate. What do you<lb/>
think of that, Capataz, eh?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But Nostromo did not even hear these words. Seizing<lb/>
the remaining light, he thrust it under the drooping<lb/>
head. The doctor sat oblivious, with a lost gaze.<lb/>
Then the heavy iron candlestick, as if struck out of<lb/>
Nostromo's hand, clattered on the floor.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Hullo!" exclaimed the doctor, looking up with a<lb/>
start. He could hear the Capataz stagger against<lb/>
the table and gasp. In the sudden extinction of the<lb/>
light within, the dead blackness sealing the window-<lb/>
frames became alive with stars to his sight.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Of course, of course," the doctor muttered to himself<lb/>
in English. "Enough to make him jump out of his skin."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo's heart seemed to force itself into his throat.<lb/>
His head swam. Hirsch! The man was Hirsch!<lb/>
He held on tight to the edge of the table.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But he was hiding in the lighter," he almost shouted<lb/>
His voice fell. "In the lighter, and &mdash; and &mdash;"<lb/>


<pb n="429"/>

</p>

<p>     "And Sotillo brought him in," said the doctor. "He<lb/>
is no more startling to you than you were to me. What<lb/>
I want to know is how he induced some compassionate<lb/>
soul to shoot him."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "So Sotillo knows &mdash;" began Nostromo, in a more<lb/>
equable voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Everything!" interrupted the doctor.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Capataz was heard striking the table with his<lb/>
fist. "Everything? What are you saying, there?<lb/>
Everything? Know everything? It is impossible!<lb/>
Everything?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Of course. What do you mean by impossible? I<lb/>
tell you I have heard this Hirsch questioned last night,<lb/>
here, in this very room. He knew your name, Decoud's<lb/>
name, and all about the loading of the silver. . . .<lb/>
The lighter was cut in two. He was grovelling in abject<lb/>
terror before Sotillo, but he remembered that much.<lb/>
What do you want more? He knew least about himself.<lb/>
They found him clinging to their anchor. He<lb/>
must have caught at it just as the lighter went to the<lb/>
bottom."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Went to the bottom?" repeated Nostromo, slowly.<lb/>
"Sotillo believes that? <hi rend="italic">Bueno!"</hi><lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor, a little impatiently, was unable to<lb/>
imagine what else could anybody believe. Yes, Sotillo<lb/>
believed that the lighter was sunk, and the Capataz<lb/>
de Cargadores, together with Martin Decoud and perhaps<lb/>
one or two other political fugitives, had been<lb/>
drowned.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I told you well, se&ntilde;or doctor," remarked Nostromo<lb/>
at that point, "that Sotillo did not know everything."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Eh? What do you mean?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He did not know I was not dead."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Neither did we."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And you did not care &mdash; none of you caballeros on<lb/>


<pb n="430"/>

the wharf &mdash; once you got off a man of flesh and blood<lb/>
like yourselves on a fool's business that could not end<lb/>
well."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You forget, Capataz, I was not on the wharf. And I<lb/>
did not think well of the business. So you need not<lb/>
taunt me. I tell you what, man, we had but little leisure<lb/>
to think of the dead. Death stands near behind<lb/>
us all. You were gone."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I went, indeed!" broke in Nostromo. "And for the<lb/>
sake of what &mdash; tell me?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! that is your own affair," the doctor said, roughly.<lb/>
"Do not ask me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Their flowing murmurs paused in the dark. Perched<lb/>
on the edge of the table with slightly averted faces,<lb/>
they felt their shoulders touch, and their eyes remained<lb/>
directed towards an upright shape nearly lost in the<lb/>
obscurity of the inner part of the room, that with projecting<lb/>
head and shoulders, in ghastly immobility,<lb/>
seemed intent on catching every word.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Muy bien!"</hi> Nostromo muttered at last. "So be it.<lb/>
Teresa was right. It is my own affair."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Teresa is dead," remarked the doctor, absently,<lb/>
while his mind followed a new line of thought suggested<lb/>
by what might have been called Nostromo's return to<lb/>
life. "She died, the poor woman."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Without a priest?" the Capataz asked, anxiously.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What a question! Who could have got a priest for<lb/>
her last night?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "May God keep her soul!" ejaculated Nostromo,<lb/>
with a gloomy and hopeless fervour which had no time<lb/>
to surprise Dr. Monygham, before, reverting to their<lb/>
previous conversation, he continued in a sinister tone,<lb/>
"Si, se&ntilde;or doctor. As you were saying, it is my own<lb/>
affair. A very desperate affair."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "There are no two men in this part of the world that<lb/>


<pb n="431"/>

could have saved themselves by swimming as you have<lb/>
done," the doctor said, admiringly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And again there was silence between those two men.<lb/>
They were both reflecting, and the diversity of their<lb/>
natures made their thoughts born from their meeting<lb/>
swing afar from each other. The doctor, impelled to<lb/>
risky action by his loyalty to the Goulds, wondered<lb/>
with thankfulness at the chain of accident which had<lb/>
brought that man back where he would be of the greatest<lb/>
use in the work of saving the San Tom&eacute; mine. The<lb/>
doctor was loyal to the mine. It presented itself to<lb/>
his fifty-years' old eyes in the shape of a little woman in a<lb/>
soft dress with a long train, with a head attractively<lb/>
overweighted by a great mass of fair hair and the delicate<lb/>
preciousness of her inner worth, partaking of a<lb/>
gem and a flower, revealed in every attitude of her<lb/>
person. As the dangers thickened round the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mine this illusion acquired force, permanency, and<lb/>
authority. It claimed him at last! This claim, exalted<lb/>
by a spiritual detachment from the usual sanctions<lb/>
of hope and reward, made Dr. Monygham's thinking,<lb/>
acting, individuality extremely dangerous to himself<lb/>
and to others, all his scruples vanishing in the proud<lb/>
feeling that his devotion was the only thing that stood<lb/>
between an admirable woman and a frightful disaster.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was a sort of intoxication which made him utterly<lb/>
indifferent to Decoud's fate, but left his wits perfectly<lb/>
clear for the appreciation of Decoud's political idea.<lb/>
It was a good idea &mdash; and Barrios was the only instrument<lb/>
of its realization. The doctor's soul, withered and<lb/>
shrunk by the shame of a moral disgrace, became implacable<lb/>
in the expansion of its tenderness. Nostromo's<lb/>
return was providential. He did not think of him<lb/>
humanely, as of a fellow-creature just escaped from the<lb/>
jaws of death. The Capataz for him was the only<lb/>


<pb n="432"/>

possible messenger to Cayta. The very man. The<lb/>
doctor's misanthropic mistrust of mankind (the bitterer<lb/>
because based on personal failure) did not lift him<lb/>
sufficiently above common weaknesses. He was under<lb/>
the spell of an established reputation. Trumpeted<lb/>
by Captain Mitchell, grown in repetition, and fixed<lb/>
in general assent, Nostromo's faithfulness had never<lb/>
been questioned by Dr. Monygham as a fact. It was<lb/>
not likely to be questioned now he stood in desperate<lb/>
need of it himself. Dr. Monygham was human; he<lb/>
accepted the popular conception of the Capataz's<lb/>
incorruptibility simply because no word or fact had<lb/>
ever contradicted a mere affirmation. It seemed to be<lb/>
a part of the man, like his whiskers or his teeth. It<lb/>
was impossible to conceive him otherwise. The question<lb/>
was whether he would consent to go on such a<lb/>
dangerous and desperate errand. The doctor was observant<lb/>
enough to have become aware from the first<lb/>
of something peculiar in the man's temper. He was<lb/>
no doubt sore about the loss of the silver.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It will be necessary to take him into my fullest confidence,"<lb/>
he said to himself, with a certain acuteness of<lb/>
insight into the nature he had to deal with.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On Nostromo's side the silence had been full of black<lb/>
irresolution, anger, and mistrust. He was the first to<lb/>
break it, however.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The swimming was no great matter," he said. "It<lb/>
is what went before &mdash; and what comes after that &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He did not quite finish what he meant to say, breaking<lb/>
off short, as though his thought had butted against<lb/>
a solid obstacle. The doctor's mind pursued its own<lb/>
schemes with Machiavellian subtlety. He said as<lb/>
sympathetically as he was able &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is unfortunate, Capataz. But no one would<lb/>
think of blaming you. Very unfortunate. To begin<lb/>


<pb n="433"/>

with, the treasure ought never to have left the mountain.<lb/>
But it was Decoud who &mdash; however, he is dead. There<lb/>
is no need to talk of him."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No," assented Nostromo, as the doctor paused,<lb/>
"there is no need to talk of dead men. But I am not<lb/>
dead yet."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You are all right. Only a man of your intrepidity<lb/>
could have saved himself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In this Dr. Monygham was sincere. He esteemed<lb/>
highly the intrepidity of that man, whom he valued<lb/>
but little, being disillusioned as to mankind in general,<lb/>
because of the particular instance in which his own manhood<lb/>
had failed. Having had to encounter single-<lb/>
handed during his period of eclipse many physical<lb/>
dangers, he was well aware of the most dangerous<lb/>
element common to them all: of the crushing, paralyzing<lb/>
sense of human littleness, which is what really defeats<lb/>
a man struggling with natural forces, alone, far from<lb/>
the eyes of his fellows. He was eminently fit to appreciate<lb/>
the mental image he made for himself of the<lb/>
Capataz, after hours of tension and anxiety, precipitated<lb/>
suddenly into an abyss of waters and darkness,<lb/>
without earth or sky, and confronting it not only with<lb/>
an undismayed mind, but with sensible success. Of<lb/>
course, the man was an incomparable swimmer, that<lb/>
was known, but the doctor judged that this instance<lb/>
testified to a still greater intrepidity of spirit. It was<lb/>
pleasing to him; he augured well from it for the success<lb/>
of the arduous mission with which he meant to entrust<lb/>
the Capataz so marvellously restored to usefulness.<lb/>
And in a tone vaguely gratified, he observed &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It must have been terribly dark!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It was the worst darkness of the Golfo," the Capataz<lb/>
assented, briefly. He was mollified by what seemed a<lb/>
sign of some faint interest in such things as had befallen<lb/>


<pb n="434"/>

him, and dropped a few descriptive phrases with an<lb/>
affected and curt nonchalance. At that moment he<lb/>
felt communicative. He expected the continuance<lb/>
of that interest which, whether accepted or rejected,<lb/>
would have restored to him his personality &mdash; the only<lb/>
thing lost in that desperate affair. But the doctor,<lb/>
engrossed by a desperate adventure of his own, was<lb/>
terrible in the pursuit of his idea. He let an exclamation<lb/>
of regret escape him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I could almost wish you had shouted and shown a<lb/>
light."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This unexpected utterance astounded the Capataz<lb/>
by its character of cold-blooded atrocity. It was as<lb/>
much as to say, "I wish you had shown yourself a<lb/>
coward; I wish you had had your throat cut for your<lb/>
pains." Naturally he referred it to himself, whereas it<lb/>
related only to the silver, being uttered simply and with<lb/>
many mental reservations. Surprise and rage rendered<lb/>
him speechless, and the doctor pursued, practically<lb/>
unheard by Nostromo, whose stirred blood was beating<lb/>
violently in his ears.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "For I am convinced Sotillo in possession of the<lb/>
silver would have turned short round and made for some<lb/>
small port abroad. Economically it would have been<lb/>
wasteful, but still less wasteful than having it sunk.<lb/>
It was the next best thing to having it at hand in some<lb/>
safe place, and using part of it to buy up Sotillo. But<lb/>
I doubt whether Don Carlos would have ever made up<lb/>
his mind to it. He is not fit for Costaguana, and that<lb/>
is a fact, Capataz."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Capataz had mastered the fury that was like a<lb/>
tempest in his ears in time to hear the name of Don<lb/>
Carlos. He seemed to have come out of it a changed<lb/>
man &mdash; a man who spoke thoughtfully in a soft and even<lb/>
voice.<lb/>


<pb n="435"/>

</p>

<p>     "And would Don Carlos have been content if I had<lb/>
surrendered this treasure?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I should not wonder if they were all of that way of<lb/>
thinking now," the doctor said, grimly. "I was never<lb/>
consulted. Decoud had it his own way. Their eyes<lb/>
are opened by this time, I should think. I for one<lb/>
know that if that silver turned up this moment miraculously<lb/>
ashore I would give it to Sotillo. And, as things<lb/>
stand, I would be approved."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Turned up miraculously," repeated the Capataz<lb/>
very low; then raised his voice. "That, se&ntilde;or, would<lb/>
be a greater miracle than any saint could perform."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I believe you, Capataz," said the doctor, drily.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He went on to develop his view of Sotillo's dangerous<lb/>
influence upon the situation. And the Capataz, listening<lb/>
as if in a dream, felt himself of as little account as<lb/>
the indistinct, motionless shape of the dead man whom<lb/>
he saw upright under the beam, with his air of listening<lb/>
also, disregarded, forgotten, like a terrible example of<lb/>
neglect.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Was it for an unconsidered and foolish whim that<lb/>
they came to me, then?" he interrupted suddenly.<lb/>
"Had I not done enough for them to be of some account,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">por Dios?</hi> Is it that the <hi rend="italic">hombres finos</hi> &mdash; the gentlemen<lb/>
&mdash; need not think as long as there is a man of the people<lb/>
ready to risk his body and soul? Or, perhaps, we have<lb/>
no souls &mdash; like dogs?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "There was Decoud, too, with his plan," the doctor<lb/>
reminded him again.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Si! And the rich man in San Francisco who had<lb/>
something to do with that treasure, too &mdash; what do I<lb/>
know? No! I have heard too many things. It seems<lb/>
to me that everything is permitted to the rich."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I understand, Capataz," the doctor began.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What Capataz?" broke in Nostromo, in a forcible<lb/>


<pb n="436"/>

but even voice. "The Capataz is undone, destroyed.<lb/>
There is no Capataz. Oh, no! You will find the Capataz<lb/>
no more."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Come, this is childish!" remonstrated the doctor;<lb/>
and the other calmed down suddenly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I have been indeed like a little child," he muttered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And as his eyes met again the shape of the murdered<lb/>
man suspended in his awful immobility, which seemed<lb/>
the uncomplaining immobility of attention, he asked,<lb/>
wondering gently &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Why did Sotillo give the estrapade to this pitiful<lb/>
wretch? Do you know? No torture could have been<lb/>
worse than his fear. Killing I can understand. His<lb/>
anguish was intolerable to behold. But why should he<lb/>
torment him like this? He could tell no more."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No; he could tell nothing more. Any sane man<lb/>
would have seen that. He had told him everything.<lb/>
But I tell you what it is, Capataz. Sotillo would not<lb/>
believe what he was told. Not everything."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What is it he would not believe? I cannot understand."<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "I can, because I have seen the man. He refuses to<lb/>
believe that the treasure is lost."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What?" the Capataz cried out in a discomposed<lb/>
tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That startles you &mdash; eh?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Am I to understand, se&ntilde;or," Nostromo went on in a<lb/>
deliberate and, as it were, watchful tone, "that Sotillo<lb/>
thinks the treasure has been saved by some means?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No! no! That would be impossible," said the<lb/>
doctor, with conviction; and Nostromo emitted a grunt<lb/>
in the dark. "That would be impossible. He thinks<lb/>
that the silver was no longer in the lighter when she was<lb/>
sunk. He has convinced himself that the whole show<lb/>
of getting it away to sea is a mere sham got up to deceive<lb/>


<pb n="437"/>

Gamacho and his Nationals, Pedrito Montero, Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Fuentes, our new G&eacute;f&eacute; Pol&iacute;tico, and himself, too. Only,<lb/>
he says, he is no such fool."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But he is devoid of sense. He is the greatest imbecile<lb/>
that ever called himself a colonel in this country<lb/>
of evil," growled Nostromo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He is no more unreasonable than many sensible<lb/>
men," said the doctor. "He has convinced himself<lb/>
that the treasure can be found because he desires passionately<lb/>
to possess himself of it. And he is also afraid<lb/>
of his officers turning upon him and going over to<lb/>
Pedrito, whom he has not the courage either to fight<lb/>
or trust. Do you see that, Capataz? He need fear no<lb/>
desertion as long as some hope remains of that enormous<lb/>
plunder turning up. I have made it my business to<lb/>
keep this very hope up."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have?" the Capataz de Cargadores repeated<lb/>
cautiously. "Well, that is wonderful. And how long<lb/>
do you think you are going to keep it up?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "As long as I can."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What does that mean?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I can tell you exactly. As long as I live," the doctor<lb/>
retorted in a stubborn voice. Then, in a few words,<lb/>
he described the story of his arrest and the circumstances<lb/>
of his release. "I was going back to that silly scoundrel<lb/>
when we met," he concluded.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo had listened with profound attention.<lb/>
"You have made up your mind, then, to a speedy<lb/>
death," he muttered through his clenched teeth.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Perhaps, my illustrious Capataz," the doctor said,<lb/>
testily. "You are not the only one here who can look an<lb/>
ugly death in the face."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No doubt," mumbled Nostromo, loud enough to be<lb/>
overheard. "There may be even more than two fools<lb/>
in this place. Who knows?"<lb/>


<pb n="438"/>

</p>

<p>     "And that is my affair," said the doctor, curtly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "As taking out the accursed silver to sea was my<lb/>
affair," retorted Nostromo. "I see. Bueno! Each<lb/>
of us has his reasons. But you were the last man I<lb/>
conversed with before I started, and you talked to me<lb/>
as if I were a fool."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo had a great distaste for the doctor's<lb/>
sardonic treatment of his great reputation. Decoud's<lb/>
faintly ironic recognition used to make him uneasy;<lb/>
but the familiarity of a man like Don Martin was<lb/>
flattering, whereas the doctor was a nobody. He<lb/>
could remember him a penniless outcast, slinking about<lb/>
the streets of Sulaco, without a single friend or acquaintance,<lb/>
till Don Carlos Gould took him into the service<lb/>
of the mine.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You may be very wise," he went on, thoughtfully,<lb/>
staring into the obscurity of the room, pervaded by the<lb/>
gruesome enigma of the tortured and murdered Hirsch.<lb/>
"But I am not such a fool as when I started. I have<lb/>
learned one thing since, and that is that you are a<lb/>
dangerous man."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Dr. Monygham was too startled to do more than<lb/>
exclaim &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What is it you say?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "If he could speak he would say the same thing,"<lb/>
pursued Nostromo, with a nod of his shadowy head silhouetted<lb/>
against the starlit window.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I do not understand you," said Dr. Monygham,<lb/>
faintly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No? Perhaps, if you had not confirmed Sotillo in<lb/>
his madness, he would have been in no haste to give the<lb/>
estrapade to that miserable Hirsch."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor started at the suggestion. But his devotion,<lb/>
absorbing all his sensibilities, had left his heart<lb/>
steeled against remorse and pity. Still, for complete<lb/>


<pb n="439"/>

relief, he felt the necessity of repelling it loudly and<lb/>
contemptuously.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Bah! You dare to tell me that, with a man like<lb/>
Sotillo. I confess I did not give a thought to Hirsch.<lb/>
If I had it would have been useless. Anybody can see<lb/>
that the luckless wretch was doomed from the moment<lb/>
he caught hold of the anchor. He was doomed, I tell<lb/>
you! Just as I myself am doomed &mdash; most probably."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This is what Dr. Monygham said in answer to Nostromo's<lb/>
remark, which was plausible enough to prick<lb/>
his conscience. He was not a callous man. But the<lb/>
necessity, the magnitude, the importance of the task<lb/>
he had taken upon himself dwarfed all merely humane<lb/>
considerations. He had undertaken it in a fanatical<lb/>
spirit. He did not like it. To lie, to deceive, to circumvent<lb/>
even the basest of mankind was odious to him.<lb/>
It was odious to him by training, instinct, and tradition.<lb/>
To do these things in the character of a traitor was abhorrent<lb/>
to his nature and terrible to his feelings. He<lb/>
had made that sacrifice in a spirit of abasement. He<lb/>
had said to himself bitterly, "I am the only one fit for<lb/>
that dirty work." And he believed this. He was not<lb/>
subtle. His simplicity was such that, though he had<lb/>
no sort of heroic idea of seeking death, the risk, deadly<lb/>
enough, to which he exposed himself, had a sustaining<lb/>
and comforting effect. To that spiritual state the<lb/>
fate of Hirsch presented itself as part of the general<lb/>
atrocity of things. He considered that episode practically.<lb/>
What did it mean? Was it a sign of some dangerous<lb/>
change in Sotillo's delusion? That the man<lb/>
should have been killed like this was what the doctor<lb/>
could not understand.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. But why shot?" he murmured to himself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo kept very still.<lb/>
</p>


</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="9" id="d35">
<head>CHAPTER NINE</head>

<pb n="440"/>


<p>     DISTRACTED between doubts and hopes, dismayed by<lb/>
the sound of bells pealing out the arrival of Pedrito<lb/>
Montero, Sotillo had spent the morning in battling<lb/>
with his thoughts; a contest to which he was unequal,<lb/>
from the vacuity of his mind and the violence of his<lb/>
passions. Disappointment, greed, anger, and fear<lb/>
made a tumult, in the colonel's breast louder than the<lb/>
din of bells in the town. Nothing he had planned had<lb/>
come to pass. Neither Sulaco nor the silver of the<lb/>
mine had fallen into his hands. He had performed<lb/>
no military exploit to secure his position, and had obtained<lb/>
no enormous booty to make off with. Pedrito<lb/>
Montero, either as friend or foe, filled him with dread.<lb/>
The sound of bells maddened him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Imagining at first that he might be attacked at once,<lb/>
he had made his battalion stand to arms on the shore.<lb/>
He walked to and fro all the length of the room, stopping<lb/>
sometimes to gnaw the finger-tips of his right hand<lb/>
with a lurid sideways glare fixed on the floor; then, with<lb/>
a sullen, repelling glance all round, he would resume<lb/>
his tramping in savage aloofness. His hat, horsewhip,<lb/>
sword, and revolver were lying on the table. His<lb/>
officers, crowding the window giving the view of the<lb/>
town gate, disputed amongst themselves the use of his<lb/>
field-glass bought last year on long credit from Anzani.<lb/>
It passed from hand to hand, and the possessor for the<lb/>
time being was besieged by anxious inquiries.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "There is nothing; there is nothing to see!" he would<lb/>
repeat impatiently.<lb/>




<pb n="441"/>

</p>

<p>     There was nothing. And when the picket in the<lb/>
bushes near the Casa Viola had been ordered to fall<lb/>
back upon the main body, no stir of life appeared on the<lb/>
stretch of dusty and arid land between the town and<lb/>
the waters of the port. But late in the afternoon a<lb/>
horseman issuing from the gate was made out riding up<lb/>
fearlessly. It was an emissary from Se&ntilde;or Fuentes.<lb/>
Being all alone he was allowed to come on. Dismounting<lb/>
at the great door he greeted the silent bystanders<lb/>
with cheery impudence, and begged to be taken up at<lb/>
once to the "muy valliente" colonel.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Se&ntilde;or Fuentes, on entering upon his functions of G&eacute;f&eacute;<lb/>
Pol&iacute;tico, had turned his diplomatic abilities to getting<lb/>
hold of the harbour as well as of the mine. The man<lb/>
he pitched upon to negotiate with Sotillo was a Notary<lb/>
Public, whom the revolution had found languishing in<lb/>
the common jail on a charge of forging documents.<lb/>
Liberated by the mob along with the other "victims<lb/>
of Blanco tyranny," he had hastened to offer his services<lb/>
to the new Government.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He set out determined to display much zeal and<lb/>
eloquence in trying to induce Sotillo to come into town<lb/>
alone for a conference with Pedrito Montero. Nothing<lb/>
was further from the colonel's intentions. The mere<lb/>
fleeting idea of trusting himself into the famous Pedrito's<lb/>
hands had made him feel unwell several times.<lb/>
It was out of the question &mdash; it was madness. And to<lb/>
put himself in open hostility was madness, too. It<lb/>
would render impossible a systematic search for that<lb/>
treasure, for that wealth of silver which he seemed<lb/>
to feel somewhere about, to scent somewhere near.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But where? Where? Heavens! Where? Oh! why had<lb/>
he allowed that doctor to go! Imbecile that he was.<lb/>
But no! It was the only right course, he reflected distractedly,<lb/>
while the messenger waited downstairs chatting<lb/>


<pb n="442"/>

agreeably to the officers. It was in that scoundrelly<lb/>
doctor's true interest to return with positive information.<lb/>
But what if anything stopped him? A general prohibition<lb/>
to leave the town, for instance! There would<lb/>
be patrols!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The colonel, seizing his head in his hands, turned in<lb/>
his tracks as if struck with vertigo. A flash of craven<lb/>
inspiration suggested to him an expedient not unknown<lb/>
to European statesmen when they wish to delay a difficult<lb/>
negotiation. Booted and spurred, he scrambled<lb/>
into the hammock with undignified haste. His handsome<lb/>
face had turned yellow with the strain of weighty<lb/>
cares. The ridge of his shapely nose had grown sharp;<lb/>
the audacious nostrils appeared mean and pinched.<lb/>
The velvety, caressing glance of his fine eyes seemed<lb/>
dead, and even decomposed; for these almond-shaped,<lb/>
languishing orbs had become inappropriately bloodshot<lb/>
with much sinister sleeplessness. He addressed the<lb/>
surprised envoy of Se&ntilde;or Fuentes in a deadened, exhausted<lb/>
voice. It came pathetically feeble from under<lb/>
a pile of ponchos, which buried his elegant person right<lb/>
up to the black moustaches, uncurled, pendant, in sign<lb/>
of bodily prostration and mental incapacity. Fever,<lb/>
fever &mdash; a heavy fever had overtaken the "muy valliente"<lb/>
colonel. A wavering wildness of expression, caused by<lb/>
the passing spasms of a slight colic which had declared<lb/>
itself suddenly, and the rattling teeth of repressed panic,<lb/>
had a genuineness which impressed the envoy. It was a<lb/>
cold fit. The colonel explained that he was unable<lb/>
to think, to listen, to speak. With an appearance of<lb/>
superhuman effort the colonel gasped out that he was<lb/>
not in a state to return a suitable reply or to execute<lb/>
any of his Excellency's orders. But to-morrow!<lb/>
To-morrow! Ah! to-morrow! Let his Excellency Don<lb/>
Pedro be without uneasiness. The brave Esmeralda<lb/>


<pb n="443"/>

Regiment held the harbour, held &mdash; And closing his<lb/>
eyes, he rolled his aching head like a half-delirious<lb/>
invalid under the inquisitive stare of the envoy, who<lb/>
was obliged to bend down over the hammock in order<lb/>
to catch the painful and broken accents. Meantime,<lb/>
Colonel Sotillo trusted that his Excellency's humanity<lb/>
would permit the doctor, the English doctor, to come<lb/>
out of town with his case of foreign remedies to attend<lb/>
upon him. He begged anxiously his worship the<lb/>
caballero now present for the grace of looking in as he<lb/>
passed the Casa Gould, and informing the English<lb/>
doctor, who was probably there, that his services were<lb/>
immediately required by Colonel Sotillo, lying ill of<lb/>
fever in the Custom House. Immediately. Most<lb/>
urgently required. Awaited with extreme impatience.<lb/>
A thousand thanks. He closed his eyes wearily and<lb/>
would not open them again, lying perfectly still, deaf,<lb/>
dumb, insensible, overcome, vanquished, crushed, annihilated<lb/>
by the fell disease.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But as soon as the other had shut after him the door of<lb/>
the landing, the colonel leaped out with a fling of both<lb/>
feet in an avalanche of woollen coverings. His spurs<lb/>
having become entangled in a perfect welter of ponchos<lb/>
he nearly pitched on his head, and did not recover his<lb/>
balance till the middle of the room. Concealed behind<lb/>
the half-closed jalousies he listened to what went on<lb/>
below.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The envoy had already mounted, and turning to the<lb/>
morose officers occupying the great doorway, took off<lb/>
his hat formally.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Caballeros," he said, in a very loud tone, "allow me<lb/>
to recommend you to take great care of your colonel. It<lb/>
has done me much honour and gratification to have seen<lb/>
you all, a fine body of men exercising the soldierly virtue<lb/>
of patience in this exposed situation, where there is<lb/>


<pb n="444"/>

much sun, and no water to speak of, while a town full<lb/>
of wine and feminine charms is ready to embrace you<lb/>
for the brave men you are. Caballeros, I have the<lb/>
honour to salute you. There will be much dancing<lb/>
to-night in Sulaco. Good-bye!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But he reined in his horse and inclined his head sideways<lb/>
on seeing the old major step out, very tall and<lb/>
meagre, in a straight narrow coat coming down to his<lb/>
ankles as it were the casing of the regimental colours<lb/>
rolled round their staff.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The intelligent old warrior, after enunciating in a<lb/>
dogmatic tone the general proposition that the "world<lb/>
was full of traitors," went on pronouncing deliberately a<lb/>
panegyric upon Sotillo. He ascribed to him with leisurely<lb/>
emphasis every virtue under heaven, summing<lb/>
it all up in an absurd colloquialism current amongst<lb/>
the lower class of Occidentals (especially about Esmeralda).<lb/>
"And," he concluded, with a sudden rise in the<lb/>
voice, "a man of many teeth &mdash; '<hi rend="italic">hombre de muchos<lb/>
dientes</hi>.' <hi rend="italic">Si, se&ntilde;or</hi>. As to us," he pursued, portentous<lb/>
and impressive, "your worship is beholding the finest<lb/>
body of officers in the Republic, men unequalled for<lb/>
valour and sagacity, '<hi rend="italic">y hombres de muchos dientes</hi>.'"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What? All of them?" inquired the disreputable<lb/>
envoy of Se&ntilde;or Fuentes, with a faint, derisive smile.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Todos. Si, se&ntilde;or</hi>," the major affirmed, gravely,<lb/>
with conviction. "Men of many teeth."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The other wheeled his horse to face the portal resembling<lb/>
the high gate of a dismal barn. He raised<lb/>
himself in his stirrups, extended one arm. He was a<lb/>
facetious scoundrel, entertaining for these stupid<lb/>
Occidentals a feeling of great scorn natural in a native<lb/>
from the central provinces. The folly of Esmeraldians<lb/>
especially aroused his amused contempt. He<lb/>
began an oration upon Pedro Montero, keeping a solemn<lb/>


<pb n="445"/>

countenance. He flourished his hand as if introducing<lb/>
him to their notice. And when he saw every face set,<lb/>
all the eyes fixed upon his lips, he began to shout a sort<lb/>
of catalogue of perfections: "Generous, valorous,<lb/>
affable, profound" &mdash; (he snatched off his hat enthusiastically)<lb/>
&mdash; "a statesman, an invincible chief of partisans<lb/>
&mdash;" He dropped his voice startlingly to a deep,<lb/>
hollow note &mdash; "and a dentist."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He was off instantly at a smart walk; the rigid straddle<lb/>
of his legs, the turned-out feet, the stiff back, the<lb/>
rakish slant of the sombrero above the square, motionless<lb/>
set of the shoulders expressing an infinite, awe-<lb/>
inspiring impudence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Upstairs, behind the jalousies, Sotillo did not move<lb/>
for a long time. The audacity of the fellow appalled<lb/>
him. What were his officers saying below? They were<lb/>
saying nothing. Complete silence. He quaked. It was<lb/>
not thus that he had imagined himself at that stage<lb/>
of the expedition. He had seen himself triumphant,<lb/>
appeased, the idol of the soldiers, weighing<lb/>
in secret complacency the agreeable alternatives<lb/>
of power and wealth open to his choice. Alas! How<lb/>
different! Distracted, restless, supine, burning with<lb/>
fury, or frozen with terror, he felt a dread as fathomless<lb/>
as the sea creep upon him from every side. That rogue<lb/>
of a doctor had to come out with his information.<lb/>
That was clear. It would be of no use to him &mdash; alone.<lb/>
He could do nothing with it. Malediction! The doctor<lb/>
would never come out. He was probably under<lb/>
arrest already, shut up together with Don Carlos. He<lb/>
laughed aloud insanely. Ha! ha! ha! ha! It was<lb/>
Pedrito Montero who would get the information. Ha!<lb/>
ha! ha! ha! &mdash; and the silver. Ha!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     All at once, in the midst of the laugh, he became<lb/>
motionless and silent as if turned into stone. He too,<lb/>


<pb n="446"/>

had a prisoner. A prisoner who must, must know the<lb/>
real truth. He would have to be made to speak. And<lb/>
Sotillo, who all that time had not quite forgotten Hirsch,<lb/>
felt an inexplicable reluctance at the notion of proceeding<lb/>
to extremities.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He felt a reluctance &mdash; part of that unfathomable<lb/>
dread that crept on all sides upon him. He remembered<lb/>
reluctantly, too, the dilated eyes of the hide merchant,<lb/>
his contortions, his loud sobs and protestations. It<lb/>
was not compassion or even mere nervous sensibility.<lb/>
The fact was that though Sotillo did never for a moment<lb/>
believe his story &mdash; he could not believe it; nobody<lb/>
could believe such nonsense &mdash; yet those accents of despairing<lb/>
truth impressed him disagreeably. They made<lb/>
him feel sick. And he suspected also that the man might<lb/>
have gone mad with fear. A lunatic is a hopeless subject.<lb/>
Bah! A pretence. Nothing but a pretence.<lb/>
He would know how to deal with that.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He was working himself up to the right pitch of<lb/>
ferocity. His fine eyes squinted slightly; he clapped<lb/>
his hands; a bare-footed orderly appeared noiselessly,<lb/>
a corporal, with his bayonet hanging on his thigh and a<lb/>
stick in his hand.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The colonel gave his orders, and presently the miserable<lb/>
Hirsch, pushed in by several soldiers, found him<lb/>
frowning awfully in a broad armchair, hat on head,<lb/>
knees wide apart, arms akimbo, masterful, imposing,<lb/>
irresistible, haughty, sublime, terrible.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Hirsch, with his arms tied behind his back, had been<lb/>
bundled violently into one of the smaller rooms. For<lb/>
many hours he remained apparently forgotten, stretched<lb/>
lifelessly on the floor. From that solitude, full of despair<lb/>
and terror, he was torn out brutally, with kicks and<lb/>
blows, passive, sunk in hebetude. He listened to threats<lb/>
and admonitions, and afterwards made his usual answers<lb/>


<pb n="447"/>

to questions, with his chin sunk on his breast,<lb/>
his hands tied behind his back, swaying a little in front<lb/>
of Sotillo, and never looking up. When he was forced<lb/>
to hold up his head, by means of a bayonet-point prodding<lb/>
him under the chin, his eyes had a vacant, trance-<lb/>
like stare, and drops of perspiration as big as peas were<lb/>
seen hailing down the dirt, bruises, and scratches of<lb/>
his white face. Then they stopped suddenly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sotillo looked at him in silence. "Will you depart<lb/>
from your obstinacy, you rogue?" he asked. Already<lb/>
a rope, whose one end was fastened to Se&ntilde;or Hirsch's<lb/>
wrists, had been thrown over a beam, and three soldiers<lb/>
held the other end, waiting. He made no answer.<lb/>
His heavy lower lip hung stupidly. Sotillo made a<lb/>
sign. Hirsch was jerked up off his feet, and a yell of<lb/>
despair and agony burst out in the room, filled the passage<lb/>
of the great buildings, rent the air outside, caused<lb/>
every soldier of the camp along the shore to look up<lb/>
at the windows, started some of the officers in the hall<lb/>
babbling excitedly, with shining eyes; others, setting<lb/>
their lips, looked gloomily at the floor.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sotillo, followed by the soldiers, had left the room.<lb/>
The sentry on the landing presented arms. Hirsch went<lb/>
on screaming all alone behind the half-closed jalousies<lb/>
while the sunshine, reflected from the water of the harbour,<lb/>
made an ever-running ripple of light high up on<lb/>
the wall. He screamed with uplifted eyebrows and a<lb/>
wide-open mouth &mdash; incredibly wide, black, enormous,<lb/>
full of teeth &mdash; comical.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the still burning air of the windless afternoon he<lb/>
made the waves of his agony travel as far as the O. S. N.<lb/>
Company's offices. Captain Mitchell on the balcony,<lb/>
trying to make out what went on generally, had heard<lb/>
him faintly but distinctly, and the feeble and appalling<lb/>
sound lingered in his ears after he had retreated indoors<lb/>


<pb n="448"/>

with blanched cheeks. He had been driven off the<lb/>
balcony several times during that afternoon.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sotillo, irritable, moody, walked restlessly about, held<lb/>
consultations with his officers, gave contradictory orders<lb/>
in this shrill clamour pervading the whole empty edifice.<lb/>
Sometimes there would be long and awful silences.<lb/>
Several times he had entered the torture-chamber<lb/>
where his sword, horsewhip, revolver, and field-glass<lb/>
were lying on the table, to ask with forced calmness,<lb/>
"Will you speak the truth now? No? I can wait."<lb/>
But he could not afford to wait much longer. That<lb/>
was just it. Every time he went in and came out with<lb/>
a slam of the door, the sentry on the landing presented<lb/>
arms, and got in return a black, venomous, unsteady<lb/>
glance, which, in reality, saw nothing at all, being<lb/>
merely the reflection of the soul within &mdash; a soul of<lb/>
gloomy hatred, irresolution, avarice, and fury.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The sun had set when he went in once more. A<lb/>
soldier carried in two lighted candles and slunk out,<lb/>
shutting the door without noise.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Speak, thou Jewish child of the devil! The silver!<lb/>
The silver, I say! Where is it? Where have you<lb/>
foreign rogues hidden it? Confess or &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A slight quiver passed up the taut rope from the<lb/>
racked limbs, but the body of Se&ntilde;or Hirsch, enterprising<lb/>
business man from Esmeralda, hung under the heavy<lb/>
beam perpendicular and silent, facing the colonel<lb/>
awfully. The inflow of the night air, cooled by the<lb/>
snows of the Sierra, spread gradually a delicious freshness<lb/>
through the close heat of the room.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Speak &mdash; thief &mdash; scoundrel &mdash; picaro &mdash; or &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sotillo had seized the riding-whip, and stood with his<lb/>
arm lifted up. For a word, for one little word, he felt<lb/>
he would have knelt, cringed, grovelled on the floor<lb/>
before the drowsy, conscious stare of those fixed eye-<lb/>


<pb n="449"/>

balls starting out of the grimy, dishevelled head that<lb/>
drooped very still with its mouth closed askew. The<lb/>
colonel ground his teeth with rage and struck. The<lb/>
rope vibrated leisurely to the blow, like the long string<lb/>
of a pendulum starting from a rest. But no swinging<lb/>
motion was imparted to the body of Se&ntilde;or Hirsch,<lb/>
the well-known hide merchant on the coast. With<lb/>
a convulsive effort of the twisted arms it leaped up a few<lb/>
inches, curling upon itself like a fish on the end of a line.<lb/>
Se&ntilde;or Hirsch's head was flung back on his straining<lb/>
throat; his chin trembled. For a moment the rattle<lb/>
of his chattering teeth pervaded the vast, shadowy<lb/>
room, where the candles made a patch of light round<lb/>
the two flames burning side by side. And as Sotillo,<lb/>
staying his raised hand, waited for him to speak, with<lb/>
the sudden flash of a grin and a straining forward of the<lb/>
wrenched shoulders, he spat violently into his face.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The uplifted whip fell, and the colonel sprang back<lb/>
with a low cry of dismay, as if aspersed by a jet of<lb/>
deadly venom. Quick as thought he snatched up his<lb/>
revolver, and fired twice. The report and the concussion<lb/>
of the shots seemed to throw him at once from<lb/>
ungovernable rage into idiotic stupor. He stood with<lb/>
drooping jaw and stony eyes. What had he done,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Sangre de Dios!</hi> What had he done? He was basely<lb/>
appalled at his impulsive act, sealing for ever these lips<lb/>
from which so much was to be extorted. What could<lb/>
he say? How could he explain? Ideas of headlong<lb/>
flight somewhere, anywhere, passed through his mind;<lb/>
even the craven and absurd notion of hiding under<lb/>
the table occurred to his cowardice. It was too late;<lb/>
his officers had rushed in tumultuously, in a great clatter<lb/>
of scabbards, clamouring, with astonishment and<lb/>
wonder. But since they did not immediately proceed<lb/>
to plunge their swords into his breast, the brazen side<lb/>


<pb n="450"/>

of his character asserted itself. Passing the sleeve<lb/>
of his uniform over his face he pulled himself together,<lb/>
His truculent glance turned slowly here and there,<lb/>
checked the noise where it fell; and the stiff body of the<lb/>
late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch, merchant, after swaying imperceptibly,<lb/>
made a half turn, and came to a rest in the midst<lb/>
of awed murmurs and uneasy shuffling.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A voice remarked loudly, "Behold a man who will<lb/>
never speak again." And another, from the back<lb/>
row of faces, timid and pressing, cried out &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Why did you kill him, <hi rend="italic">mi colonel?"</hi><lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Because he has confessed everything," answered<lb/>
Sotillo, with the hardihood of desperation. He felt<lb/>
himself cornered. He brazened it out on the strength<lb/>
of his reputation with very fair success. His hearers<lb/>
thought him very capable of such an act. They were<lb/>
disposed to believe his flattering tale. There is no<lb/>
credulity so eager and blind as the credulity of covetousness,<lb/>
which, in its universal extent, measures the<lb/>
moral misery and the intellectual destitution of mankind.<lb/>
Ah! he had confessed everything, this fractious<lb/>
Jew, this <hi rend="italic">bribon</hi>. Good! Then he was no longer<lb/>
wanted. A sudden dense guffaw was heard from the<lb/>
senior captain &mdash; a big-headed man, with little round<lb/>
eyes and monstrously fat cheeks which never moved.<lb/>
The old major, tall and fantastically ragged like a scarecrow,<lb/>
walked round the body of the late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch,<lb/>
muttering to himself with ineffable complacency that<lb/>
like this there was no need to guard against any future<lb/>
treacheries of that scoundrel. The others stared, shifting<lb/>
from foot to foot, and whispering short remarks<lb/>
to each other.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Sotillo buckled on his sword and gave curt, peremptory<lb/>
orders to hasten the retirement decided upon in the<lb/>
afternoon. Sinister, impressive, his sombrero pulled<lb/>


<pb n="451"/>

right down upon his eyebrows, he marched first through<lb/>
the door in such disorder of mind that he forgot utterly<lb/>
to provide for Dr. Monygham's possible return. As<lb/>
the officers trooped out after him, one or two looked<lb/>
back hastily at the late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch, merchant from<lb/>
Esmeralda, left swinging rigidly at rest, alone with the<lb/>
two burning candles. In the emptiness of the room<lb/>
the burly shadow of head and shoulders on the wall had<lb/>
an air of life.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Below, the troops fell in silently and moved off by<lb/>
companies without drum or trumpet. The old scarecrow<lb/>
major commanded the rearguard; but the party<lb/>
he left behind with orders to fire the Custom House<lb/>
(and "burn the carcass of the treacherous Jew where it<lb/>
hung") failed somehow in their haste to set the staircase<lb/>
properly alight. The body of the late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch<lb/>
dwelt alone for a time in the dismal solitude of the unfinished<lb/>
building, resounding weirdly with sudden<lb/>
slams and clicks of doors and latches, with rustling<lb/>
scurries of torn papers, and the tremulous sighs that<lb/>
at each gust of wind passed under the high roof. The<lb/>
light of the two candles burning before the perpendicular<lb/>
and breathless immobility of the late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch<lb/>
threw a gleam afar over land and water, like a signal<lb/>
in the night. He remained to startle Nostromo by his<lb/>
presence, and to puzzle Dr. Monygham by the mystery<lb/>
of his atrocious end.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But why shot?" the doctor again asked himself,<lb/>
audibly. This time he was answered by a dry laugh<lb/>
from Nostromo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You seem much concerned at a very natural thing,<lb/>
se&ntilde;or doctor. I wonder why? It is very likely that before<lb/>
long we shall all get shot one after another, if not<lb/>
by Sotillo, then by Pedrito, or Fuentes, or Gamacho.<lb/>
And we may even get the estrapade, too, or worse &mdash; <hi rend="italic">quien</hi><lb/>


<pb n="452"/>

<hi rend="italic">sabe?</hi> &mdash; with your pretty tale of the silver you put into<lb/>
Sotillo's head."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It was in his head already," the doctor protested.<lb/>
"I only &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. And you only nailed it there so that the devil<lb/>
himself &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That is precisely what I meant to do," caught up<lb/>
the doctor.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That is what you meant to do. <hi rend="italic">Bueno</hi>. It is as I<lb/>
say. You are a dangerous man."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Their voices, which without rising had been growing<lb/>
quarrelsome, ceased suddenly. The late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch,<lb/>
erect and shadowy against the stars, seemed to be waiting<lb/>
attentive, in impartial silence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But Dr. Monygham had no mind to quarrel with Nostromo.<lb/>
At this supremely critical point of Sulaco's<lb/>
fortunes it was borne upon him at last that this man<lb/>
was really indispensable, more indispensable than ever<lb/>
the infatuation of Captain Mitchell, his proud discoverer,<lb/>
could conceive; far beyond what Decoud's<lb/>
best dry raillery about "my illustrious friend, the unique<lb/>
Capataz de Cargadores," had ever intended. The<lb/>
fellow was unique. He was not "one in a thousand."<lb/>
He was absolutely the only one. The doctor surrendered.<lb/>
There was something in the genius of that<lb/>
Genoese seaman which dominated the destinies of great<lb/>
enterprises and of many people, the fortunes of Charles<lb/>
Gould, the fate of an admirable woman. At this last<lb/>
thought the doctor had to clear his throat before he<lb/>
could speak.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In a completely changed tone he pointed out to the<lb/>
Capataz that, to begin with, he personally ran no great<lb/>
risk. As far as everybody knew he was dead. It was<lb/>
an enormous advantage. He had only to keep out<lb/>
of sight in the Casa Viola, where the old Garibaldino<lb/>


<pb n="453"/>

was known to be alone &mdash; with his dead wife. The<lb/>
servants had all run away. No one would think of<lb/>
searching for him there, or anywhere else on earth,<lb/>
for that matter.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That would be very true," Nostromo spoke up,<lb/>
bitterly, "if I had not met you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     For a time the doctor kept silent. "Do you mean to<lb/>
say that you think I may give you away?" he asked in<lb/>
an unsteady voice. "Why? Why should I do that?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What do I know? Why not? To gain a day perhaps.<lb/>
It would take Sotillo a day to give me the estrapade,<lb/>
and try some other things perhaps, before he puts<lb/>
a bullet through my heart &mdash; as he did to that poor<lb/>
wretch here. Why not?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor swallowed with difficulty. His throat<lb/>
had gone dry in a moment. It was not from indignation.<lb/>
The doctor, pathetically enough, believed that<lb/>
he had forfeited the right to be indignant with any one &mdash;<lb/>
for anything. It was simple dread. Had the fellow<lb/>
heard his story by some chance? If so, there was an<lb/>
end of his usefulness in that direction. The indispensable<lb/>
man escaped his influence, because of that indelible<lb/>
blot which made him fit for dirty work. A feeling<lb/>
as of sickness came upon the doctor. He would have<lb/>
given anything to know, but he dared not clear up the<lb/>
point. The fanaticism of his devotion, fed on the sense<lb/>
of his abasement, hardened his heart in sadness and<lb/>
scorn.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Why not, indeed?" he re&euml;choed, sardonically.<lb/>
"Then the safe thing for you is to kill me on the spot.<lb/>
I would defend myself. But you may just as well know<lb/>
I am going about unarmed."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Por Dios!"</hi> said the Capataz, passionately. "You<lb/>
fine people are all alike. All dangerous. All betrayers<lb/>
of the poor who are your dogs."<lb/>


<pb n="454"/>

</p>

<p>     "You do not understand," began the doctor, slowly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I understand you all!" cried the other with a violent<lb/>
movement, as shadowy to the doctor's eyes as the persistent<lb/>
immobility of the late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch. "A poor<lb/>
man amongst you has got to look after himself. I say<lb/>
that you do not care for those that serve you. Look<lb/>
at me! After all these years, suddenly, here I find<lb/>
myself like one of these curs that bark outside the walls<lb/>
&mdash; without a kennel or a dry bone for my teeth. (<hi rend="italic">Caramba!"</hi><lb/>
But he relented with a contemptuous fairness.<lb/>
"Of course," he went on, quietly, "I do not suppose<lb/>
that you would hasten to give me up to Sotillo,<lb/>
for example. It is not that. It is that I am nothing!<lb/>
Suddenly &mdash;" He swung his arm downwards. "Nothing<lb/>
to any one," he repeated.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor breathed freely. "Listen, Capataz,"<lb/>
he said, stretching out his arm almost affectionately<lb/>
towards Nostromo's shoulder. "I am going to tell<lb/>
you a very simple thing. You are safe because you<lb/>
are needed. I would not give you away for any conceivable<lb/>
reason, because I want you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the dark Nostromo bit his lip. He had heard<lb/>
enough of that. He knew what that meant. No more<lb/>
of that for him. But he had to look after himself now,<lb/>
he thought. And he thought, too, that it would not<lb/>
be prudent to part in anger from his companion. The<lb/>
doctor, admitted to be a great healer, had, amongst<lb/>
the populace of Sulaco, the reputation of being an evil<lb/>
sort of man. It was based solidly on his personal appearance,<lb/>
which was strange, and on his rough ironic<lb/>
manner &mdash; proofs visible, sensible, and incontrovertible<lb/>
of the doctor's malevolent disposition. And Nostromo<lb/>
was of the people. So he only grunted incredulously.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You, to speak plainly, are the only man," the doctor<lb/>
pursued. "It is in your power to save this town and<lb/>


<pb n="455"/>

. . . everybody from the destructive rapacity of<lb/>
men who &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, se&ntilde;or," said Nostromo, sullenly. "It is not<lb/>
in my power to get the treasure back for you to give<lb/>
up to Sotillo, or Pedrito, or Gamacho. What do I<lb/>
know?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Nobody expects the impossible," was the answer.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have said it yourself &mdash; nobody," muttered<lb/>
Nostromo, in a gloomy, threatening tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But Dr. Monygham, full of hope, disregarded the<lb/>
enigmatic words and the threatening tone. To their<lb/>
eyes, accustomed to obscurity, the late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch,<lb/>
growing more distinct, seemed to have come nearer.<lb/>
And the doctor lowered his voice in exposing his scheme<lb/>
as though afraid of being overheard.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He was taking the indispensable man into his fullest<lb/>
confidence. Its implied flattery and suggestion of great<lb/>
risks came with a familiar sound to the Capataz. His<lb/>
mind, floating in irresolution and discontent, recognized<lb/>
it with bitterness. He understood well that the doctor<lb/>
was anxious to save the San Tom&eacute; mine from annihilation.<lb/>
He would be nothing without it. It was his<lb/>
interest. Just as it had been the interest of Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Decoud, of the Blancos, and of the Europeans to get<lb/>
his Cargadores on their side. His thought became<lb/>
arrested upon Decoud. What would happen to him?<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo's prolonged silence made the doctor uneasy.<lb/>
He pointed out, quite unnecessarily, that though<lb/>
for the present he was safe, he could not live concealed<lb/>
for ever. The choice was between accepting the mission<lb/>
to Barrios, with all its dangers and difficulties, and leaving<lb/>
Sulaco by stealth, ingloriously, in poverty.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "None of your friends could reward you and protect<lb/>
you just now, Capataz. Not even Don Carlos himself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I would have none of your protection and none of<lb/>


<pb n="456"/>

your rewards. I only wish I could trust your courage<lb/>
and your sense. When I return in triumph, as you<lb/>
say, with Barrios, I may find you all destroyed. You<lb/>
have the knife at your throat now."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was the doctor's turn to remain silent in the contemplation<lb/>
of horrible contingencies.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well, we would trust your courage and your sense.<lb/>
And you, too, have a knife at your throat."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! And whom am I to thank for that? What<lb/>
are your politics and your mines to me &mdash; your silver and<lb/>
your constitutions &mdash; your Don Carlos this, and Don<lb/>
Jos&eacute; that &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I don't know," burst out the exasperated doctor.<lb/>
"There are innocent people in danger whose little<lb/>
finger is worth more than you or I and all the Ribierists<lb/>
together. I don't know. You should have asked<lb/>
yourself before you allowed Decoud to lead you into<lb/>
all this. It was your place to think like a man; but<lb/>
if you did not think then, try to act like a man now.<lb/>
Did you imagine Decoud cared very much for what<lb/>
would happen to you?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No more than you care for what will happen to me,"<lb/>
muttered the other.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No; I care for what will happen to you as little as I<lb/>
care for what will happen to myself."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And all this because you are such a devoted Ribierist?"<lb/>
Nostromo said in an incredulous tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "All this because I am such a devoted Ribierist,"<lb/>
repeated Dr. Monygham, grimly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Again Nostromo, gazing abstractedly at the body of<lb/>
the late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch, remained silent, thinking that the<lb/>
doctor was a dangerous person in more than one sense.<lb/>
It was impossible to trust him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Do you speak in the name of Don Carlos?" he asked<lb/>
at last.<lb/>


<pb n="457"/>

</p>

<p>     "Yes. I do," the doctor said, loudly, without hesitation.<lb/>
"He must come forward now. He must," he<lb/>
added in a mutter, which Nostromo did not catch.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What did you say, se&ntilde;or?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor started. "I say that you must be true to<lb/>
yourself, Capataz. It would be worse than folly to fail<lb/>
now."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "True to myself," repeated Nostromo. "How do<lb/>
you know that I would not be true to myself if I told<lb/>
you to go to the devil with your propositions?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I do not know. Maybe you would," the doctor<lb/>
said, with a roughness of tone intended to hide the<lb/>
sinking of his heart and the faltering of his voice. "All<lb/>
I know is, that you had better get away from here.<lb/>
Some of Sotillo's men may turn up here looking for<lb/>
me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He slipped off the table, listening intently. The<lb/>
Capataz, too, stood up.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Suppose I went to Cayta, what would you do meantime?"<lb/>
he asked.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I would go to Sotillo directly you had left &mdash; in the<lb/>
way I am thinking of."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A very good way &mdash; if only that engineer-in-chief<lb/>
consents. Remind him, se&ntilde;or, that I looked after the<lb/>
old rich Englishman who pays for the railway, and that<lb/>
I saved the lives of some of his people that time when a<lb/>
gang of thieves came from the south to wreck one of his<lb/>
pay-trains. It was I who discovered it all at the risk<lb/>
of my life, by pretending to enter into their plans. Just<lb/>
as you are doing with Sotillo."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. Yes, of course. But I can offer him better<lb/>
arguments," the doctor said, hastily. " Leave it to me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, yes! True. I am nothing."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Not at all. You are everything."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     They moved a few paces towards the door. Behind<lb/>


<pb n="458"/>

them the late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch preserved the immobility<lb/>
of a disregarded man.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That will be all right. I know what to say to the<lb/>
engineer," pursued the doctor, in a low tone. "My<lb/>
difficulty will be with Sotillo."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And Dr. Monygham stopped short in the doorway as<lb/>
if intimidated by the difficulty. He had made the sacrifice<lb/>
of his life. He considered this a fitting opportunity.<lb/>
But he did not want to throw his life away too soon.<lb/>
In his quality of betrayer of Don Carlos' confidence,<lb/>
he would have ultimately to indicate the hiding-place<lb/>
of the treasure. That would be the end of his deception,<lb/>
and the end of himself as well, at the hands of the infuriated<lb/>
colonel. He wanted to delay him to the very last<lb/>
moment; and he had been racking his brains to invent<lb/>
some place of concealment at once plausible and difficult<lb/>
of access.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He imparted his trouble to Nostromo, and concluded<lb/>
&mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Do you know what, Capataz? I think that when<lb/>
the time comes and some information must be given,<lb/>
I shall indicate the Great Isabel. That is the best<lb/>
place I can think of. What is the matter?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A low exclamation had escaped Nostromo.  The<lb/>
doctor waited, surprised, and after a moment of profound<lb/>
silence, heard a thick voice stammer out, "Utter<lb/>
folly," and stop with a gasp.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Why folly?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! You do not see it," began Nostromo, scathingly,<lb/>
gathering scorn as he went on. "Three men in<lb/>
half an hour would see that no ground had been disturbed<lb/>
anywhere on that island. Do you think that<lb/>
such a treasure can be buried without leaving traces<lb/>
of the work &mdash; eh! se&ntilde;or doctor? Why! you would not<lb/>
gain half a day more before having your throat cut by<lb/>


<pb n="459"/>

Sotillo. The Isabel! What stupidity! What miserable<lb/>
invention! Ah! you are all alike, you fine men<lb/>
of intelligence. All you are fit for is to betray men of<lb/>
the people into undertaking deadly risks for objects<lb/>
that you are not even sure about. If it comes off you<lb/>
get the benefit. If not, then it does not matter. He<lb/>
is only a dog. Ah! <hi rend="italic">Madre de Dios</hi>, I would &mdash;"<lb/>
He shook his fists above his head.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor was overwhelmed at first by this fierce,<lb/>
hissing vehemence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Well! It seems to me on your own showing that the<lb/>
men of the people are no mean fools, too," he said, sullenly.<lb/>
"No, but come. You are so clever. Have you<lb/>
a better place?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo had calmed down as quickly as he had<lb/>
flared up.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am clever enough for that," he said, quietly, almost<lb/>
with indifference. "You want to tell him of a<lb/>
hiding-place big enough to take days in ransacking &mdash; a<lb/>
place where a treasure of silver ingots can be buried<lb/>
without leaving a sign on the surface."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And close at hand," the doctor put in.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Just so, se&ntilde;or. Tell him it is sunk."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "This has the merit of being the truth," the doctor<lb/>
said, contemptuously. "He will not believe it."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You tell him that it is sunk where he may hope to<lb/>
lay his hands on it, and he will believe you quick enough.<lb/>
Tell him it has been sunk in the harbour in order to be<lb/>
recovered afterwards by divers. Tell him you found out<lb/>
that I had orders from Don Carlos Gould to lower the<lb/>
cases quietly overboard somewhere in a line between<lb/>
the end of the jetty and the entrance. The depth is<lb/>
not too great there. He has no divers, but he has a ship,<lb/>
boats, ropes, chains, sailors &mdash; of a sort. Let him fish<lb/>
for the silver. Let him set his fools to drag backwards<lb/>


<pb n="460"/>

and forwards and crossways while he sits and watches<lb/>
till his eyes drop out of his head."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Really, this is an admirable idea," muttered the<lb/>
doctor.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Si. You tell him that, and see whether he will not<lb/>
believe you! He will spend days in rage and torment &mdash;<lb/>
and still he will believe. He will have no thought for<lb/>
anything else. He will not give up till he is driven off &mdash;<lb/>
why, he may even forget to kill you. He will neither<lb/>
eat nor sleep. He &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The very thing! The very thing!" the doctor<lb/>
repeated in an excited whisper. "Capataz, I begin<lb/>
to believe that you are a great genius in your<lb/>
way."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo had paused; then began again in a changed<lb/>
tone, sombre, speaking to himself as though he had<lb/>
forgotten the doctor's existence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "There is something in a treasure that fastens upon a<lb/>
man's mind. He will pray and blaspheme and still<lb/>
persevere, and will curse the day he ever heard of it,<lb/>
and will let his last hour come upon him unawares, still<lb/>
believing that he missed it only by a foot. He will see<lb/>
it every time he closes his eyes. He will never forget<lb/>
it till he is dead &mdash; and even then &mdash; Doctor, did you<lb/>
ever hear of the miserable gringos on Azuera, that cannot<lb/>
die? Ha! ha! Sailors like myself. There is no<lb/>
getting away from a treasure that once fastens upon<lb/>
your mind."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You are a devil of a man, Capataz. It is the most<lb/>
plausible thing."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo pressed his arm.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It will be worse for him than thirst at sea or hunger<lb/>
in a town full of people. Do you know what that is?<lb/>
He shall suffer greater torments than he inflicted upon<lb/>
that terrified wretch who had no invention. None!<lb/>


<pb n="461"/>

none! Not like me. I could have told Sotillo a deadly<lb/>
tale for very little pain."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He laughed wildly and turned in the doorway towards<lb/>
the body of the late Se&ntilde;or Hirsch, an opaque long blotch<lb/>
in the semi-transparent obscurity of the room between<lb/>
the two tall parallelograms of the windows full of stars.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You man of fear!" he cried. "You shall be avenged<lb/>
by me &mdash; Nostromo. Out of my way, doctor! Stand<lb/>
aside &mdash; or, by the suffering soul of a woman dead without<lb/>
confession, I will strangle you with my two hands."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He bounded downwards into the black, smoky hall.<lb/>
With a grunt of astonishment, Dr. Monygham threw<lb/>
himself recklessly into the pursuit. At the bottom of<lb/>
the charred stairs he had a fall, pitching forward on his<lb/>
face with a force that would have stunned a spirit less<lb/>
intent upon a task of love and devotion. He was up<lb/>
in a moment, jarred, shaken, with a queer impression<lb/>
of the terrestrial globe having been flung at his head in<lb/>
the dark. But it wanted more than that to stop Dr.<lb/>
Monygham's body, possessed by the exaltation of self-<lb/>
sacrifice; a reasonable exaltation, determined not to lose<lb/>
whatever advantage chance put into its way. He ran<lb/>
with headlong, tottering swiftness, his arms going like a<lb/>
windmill in his effort to keep his balance on his crippled<lb/>
feet. He lost his hat; the tails of his open gaberdine<lb/>
flew behind him. He had no mind to lose sight of the<lb/>
indispensable man. But it was a long time, and a long<lb/>
way from the Custom House, before he managed to<lb/>
seize his arm from behind, roughly, out of breath.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Stop! Are you mad?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Already Nostromo was walking slowly, his head<lb/>
dropping, as if checked in his pace by the weariness<lb/>
of irresolution.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What is that to you? Ah! I forgot you want me<lb/>
for something. Always. Siempre Nostromo."<lb/>


<pb n="462"/>

</p>

<p>     "What do you mean by talking of strangling me?"<lb/>
panted the doctor.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What do I mean? I mean that the king of the<lb/>
devils himself has sent you out of this town of cowards<lb/>
and talkers to meet me to-night of all the nights of my<lb/>
life."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Under the starry sky the Albergo d'ltalia Una<lb/>
emerged, black and low, breaking the dark level of the<lb/>
plain. Nostromo stopped altogether.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The priests say he is a tempter, do they not?" he<lb/>
added, through his clenched teeth.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "My good man, you drivel. The devil has nothing<lb/>
to do with this. Neither has the town, which you may<lb/>
call by what name you please. But Don Carlos Gould<lb/>
is neither a coward nor an empty talker. You will<lb/>
admit that?" He waited. "Well?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Could I see Don Carlos?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Great heavens! No! Why? What for?" exclaimed<lb/>
the doctor in agitation. "I tell you it is madness. I<lb/>
will not let you go into the town for anything."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I must."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You must not!" hissed the doctor, fiercely, almost<lb/>
beside himself with the fear of the man doing away with<lb/>
his usefulness for an imbecile whim of some sort. "I<lb/>
tell you you shall not. I would rather &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He stopped at loss for words, feeling fagged out,<lb/>
powerless, holding on to Nostromo's sleeve, absolutely<lb/>
for support after his run.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am betrayed!" muttered the Capataz to himself;<lb/>
and the doctor, who overheard the last word, made an<lb/>
effort to speak calmly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "That is exactly what would happen to you. You<lb/>
would be betrayed."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He thought with a sickening dread that the man was<lb/>
so well known that he could not escape recognition.<lb/>


<pb n="463"/>

The house of the Se&ntilde;or Administrador was beset by<lb/>
spies, no doubt. And even the very servants of the<lb/>
casa were not to be trusted. "Reflect, Capataz," he<lb/>
said, impressively. . . . "What are you laughing at?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am laughing to think that if somebody that did not<lb/>
approve of my presence in town, for instance &mdash; you<lb/>
understand, se&ntilde;or doctor &mdash; if somebody were to give<lb/>
me up to Pedrito, it would not be beyond my power to<lb/>
make friends even with him. It is true. What do you<lb/>
think of that?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You are a man of infinite resource, Capataz," said<lb/>
Dr. Monygham, dismally. "I recognize that. But<lb/>
the town is full of talk about you; and those few Cargadores<lb/>
that are not in hiding with the railway people<lb/>
have been shouting 'Viva Montero' on the Plaza all<lb/>
day."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "My poor Cargadores!" muttered Nostromo. "Betrayed!<lb/>
Betrayed!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I understand that on the wharf you were pretty free<lb/>
in laying about you with a stick amongst your poor<lb/>
Cargadores," the doctor said in a grim tone, which<lb/>
showed that he was recovering from his exertions.<lb/>
"Make no mistake. Pedrito is furious at Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Ribiera's rescue, and at having lost the pleasure of<lb/>
shooting Decoud. Already there are rumours in the<lb/>
town of the treasure having been spirited away. To<lb/>
have missed that does not please Pedrito either; but<lb/>
let me tell you that if you had all that silver in your<lb/>
hand for ransom it would not save you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Turning swiftly, and catching the doctor by the shoulders,<lb/>
Nostromo thrust his face close to his.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Maladetta! You follow me speaking of the treasure.<lb/>
You have sworn my ruin. You were the last man who<lb/>
looked upon me before I went out with it. And Sidoni<lb/>
the engine-driver says you have an evil eye."<lb/>


<pb n="464"/>

</p>

<p>     "He ought to know. I saved his broken leg for him<lb/>
last year," the doctor said, stoically. He felt on his<lb/>
shoulders the weight of these hands famed amongst the<lb/>
populace for snapping thick ropes and bending horse-<lb/>
shoes. "And to you I offer the best means of saving<lb/>
yourself &mdash; let me go &mdash; and of retrieving your great reputation.<lb/>
You boasted of making the Capataz de Cargadores<lb/>
famous from one end of America to the other<lb/>
about this wretched silver. But I bring you a better<lb/>
opportunity &mdash; let me go, hombre!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo released him abruptly, and the doctor<lb/>
feared that the indispensable man would run off again.<lb/>
But he did not. He walked on slowly. The doctor<lb/>
hobbled by his side till, within a stone's throw from the<lb/>
Casa Viola, Nostromo stopped again.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Silent in inhospitable darkness, the Casa Viola seemed<lb/>
to have changed its nature; his home appeared to repel<lb/>
him with an air of hopeless and inimical mystery. The<lb/>
doctor said &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You will be safe there. Go in, Capataz."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "How can I go in?" Nostromo seemed to ask himself<lb/>
in a low, inward tone. "She cannot unsay what she<lb/>
said, and I cannot undo what I have done."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I tell you it is all right. Viola is all alone in there.<lb/>
I looked in as I came out of the town. You will be<lb/>
perfectly safe in that house till you leave it to make your<lb/>
name famous on the Campo. I am going now to arrange<lb/>
for your departure with the engineer-in-chief,<lb/>
and I shall bring you news here long before daybreak."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Dr. Monygham, disregarding, or perhaps fearing to<lb/>
penetrate the meaning of Nostromo's silence, clapped him<lb/>
lightly on the shoulder, and starting off with his smart,<lb/>
lame walk, vanished utterly at the third or fourth hop<lb/>
in the direction of the railway track. Arrested between<lb/>
the two wooden posts for people to fasten their horses to,<lb/>


<pb n="465"/>

Nostromo did not move, as if he, too, had been planted<lb/>
solidly in the ground. At the end of half an hour he<lb/>
lifted his head to the deep baying of the dogs at the railway<lb/>
yards, which had burst out suddenly, tumultuous<lb/>
and deadened as if coming from under the plain. That<lb/>
lame doctor with the evil eye had got there pretty fast.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Step by step Nostromo approached the Albergo<lb/>
d'Italia Una, which he had never known so lightless, so<lb/>
silent, before. The door, all black in the pale wall,<lb/>
stood open as he had left it twenty-four hours before,<lb/>
when he had nothing to hide from the world. He remained<lb/>
before it, irresolute, like a fugitive, like a man<lb/>
betrayed. Poverty, misery, starvation! Where had<lb/>
he heard these words? The anger of a dying woman<lb/>
had prophesied that fate for his folly. It looked as if<lb/>
it would come true very quickly. And the leperos<lb/>
would laugh &mdash; she had said. Yes, they would laugh<lb/>
if they knew that the Capataz de Cargadores was at<lb/>
the mercy of the mad doctor whom they could remember,<lb/>
only a few years ago, buying cooked food from a<lb/>
stall on the Plaza for a copper coin &mdash; like one of themselves.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    At that moment the notion of seeking Captain Mitchell<lb/>
passed through his mind. He glanced in the direction<lb/>
of the jetty and saw a small gleam of light in the<lb/>
O.S.N. Company's building. The thought of lighted<lb/>
windows was not attractive. Two lighted windows<lb/>
had decoyed him into the empty Custom House, only<lb/>
to fall into the clutches of that doctor. No! He would<lb/>
not go near lighted windows again on that night.<lb/>
Captain Mitchell was there. And what could he be<lb/>
told? That doctor would worm it all out of him as if<lb/>
he were a child.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On the threshold he called out "Giorgio!" in an<lb/>
undertone. Nobody answered. He stepped in. <hi rend="italic">"Ol&agrave;!</hi><lb/>


<pb n="466"/>

<hi rend="italic">viejo!</hi> Are you there? . . ." In the impenetrable<lb/>
darkness his head swam with the illusion that the obscurity<lb/>
of the kitchen was as vast as the Placid Gulf,<lb/>
and that the floor dipped forward like a sinking lighter.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"Ol&agrave;! viejo!"</hi> he repeated, falteringly, swaying where he<lb/>
stood. His hand, extended to steady himself, fell<lb/>
upon the table. Moving a step forward, he shifted<lb/>
it, and felt a box of matches under his fingers. He<lb/>
fancied he had heard a quiet sigh. He listened for a<lb/>
moment, holding his breath; then, with trembling hands,<lb/>
tried to strike a light.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The tiny piece of wood flamed up quite blindingly<lb/>
at the end of his fingers, raised above his blinking eyes.<lb/>
A concentrated glare fell upon the leonine white head<lb/>
of old Giorgio against the black fire-place &mdash; showed him<lb/>
leaning forward in a chair in staring immobility, surrounded,<lb/>
overhung, by great masses of shadow, his<lb/>
legs crossed, his cheek in his hand, an empty pipe in<lb/>
the corner of his mouth. It seemed hours before he attempted<lb/>
to turn his face; at the very moment the match<lb/>
went out, and he disappeared, overwhelmed by the<lb/>
shadows, as if the walls and roof of the desolate house<lb/>
had collapsed upon his white head in ghostly silence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo heard him stir and utter dispassionately<lb/>
the words &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It may have been a vision."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No," he said, softly. "It is no vision, old man."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A strong chest voice asked in the dark &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Is that you I hear, Giovann' Battista?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Si, viejo</hi>. Steady. Not so loud."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     After his release by Sotillo, Giorgio Viola, attended to<lb/>
the very door by the good-natured engineer-in-chief,<lb/>
had re&euml;ntered his house, which he had been made to<lb/>
leave almost at the very moment of his wife's death.<lb/>
All was still. The lamp above was burning. He nearly<lb/>


<pb n="467"/>

called out to her by name; and the thought that no call<lb/>
from him would ever again evoke the answer of her<lb/>
voice, made him drop heavily into the chair with a<lb/>
loud groan, wrung out by the pain as of a keen blade<lb/>
piercing his breast.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The rest of the night he made no sound. The darkness<lb/>
turned to grey, and on the colourless, clear, glassy<lb/>
dawn the jagged sierra stood out flat and opaque, as if<lb/>
cut out of paper.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The enthusiastic and severe soul of Giorgio Viola,<lb/>
sailor, champion of oppressed humanity, enemy of kings,<lb/>
and, by the grace of Mrs. Gould, hotel-keeper of the<lb/>
Sulaco harbour, had descended into the open abyss of<lb/>
desolation amongst the shattered vestiges of his past.<lb/>
He remembered his wooing between two campaigns,<lb/>
a single short week in the season of gathering olives.<lb/>
Nothing approached the grave passion of that time but<lb/>
the deep, passionate sense of his bereavement. He discovered<lb/>
all the extent of his dependence upon the silenced<lb/>
voice of that woman. It was her voice that he<lb/>
missed. Abstracted, busy, lost in inward contemplation,<lb/>
he seldom looked at his wife in those later years.<lb/>
The thought of his girls was a matter of concern, not<lb/>
of consolation. It was her voice that he would miss.<lb/>
And he remembered the other child &mdash; the little boy who<lb/>
died at sea. Ah! a man would have been something to<lb/>
lean upon. And, alas! even Gian' Battista &mdash; he of whom,<lb/>
and of Linda, his wife had spoken to him so anxiously<lb/>
before she dropped off into her last sleep on earth, he on<lb/>
whom she had called aloud to save the children, just<lb/>
before she died &mdash; even he was dead!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And the old man, bent forward, his head in his hand,<lb/>
sat through the day in immobility and solitude. He<lb/>
never heard the brazen roar of the bells in town. When<lb/>
it ceased the earthenware filter in the corner of the<lb/>


<pb n="468"/>

kitchen kept on its swift musical drip, drip into the<lb/>
great porous jar below.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Towards sunset he got up, and with slow movements<lb/>
disappeared up the narrow staircase. His bulk filled it;<lb/>
and the rubbing of his shoulders made a small noise as of<lb/>
a mouse running behind the plaster of a wall. While<lb/>
he remained up there the house was as dumb as a grave.<lb/>
Then, with the same faint rubbing noise, he descended.<lb/>
He had to catch at the chairs and tables to regain his<lb/>
seat. He seized his pipe off the high mantel of the<lb/>
fire-place &mdash; but made no attempt to reach the tobacco &mdash;<lb/>
thrust it empty into the corner of his mouth, and sat<lb/>
down again in the same staring pose. The sun of Pedrito's<lb/>
entry into Sulaco, the last sun of Se&ntilde;or Hirsch's<lb/>
life, the first of Decoud's solitude on the Great Isabel,<lb/>
passed over the Albergo d'ltalia Una on its way to the<lb/>
west. The tinkling drip, drip of the filter had ceased,<lb/>
the lamp upstairs had burnt itself out, and the night<lb/>
beset Giorgio Viola and his dead wife with its obscurity<lb/>
and silence that seemed invincible till the<lb/>
Capataz de Cargadores, returning from the dead, put<lb/>
them to flight with the splutter and flare of a match.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Si, viejo</hi>. It is me. Wait."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo, after barricading the door and closing the<lb/>
shutters carefully, groped upon a shelf for a candle, and<lb/>
lit it.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Old Viola had risen. He followed with his eyes in the<lb/>
dark the sounds made by Nostromo. The light disclosed<lb/>
him standing without support, as if the mere<lb/>
presence of that man who was loyal, brave, incorruptible,<lb/>
who was all his son would have been, were enough<lb/>
for the support of his decaying strength.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He extended his hand grasping the briar-wood pipe,<lb/>
whose bowl was charred on the edge, and knitted his<lb/>
bushy eyebrows heavily at the light.<lb/>


<pb n="469"/>

</p>

<p>     "You have returned," he said, with shaky dignity.<lb/>
"Ah! Very well! I &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He broke off.  Nostromo, leaning back against the<lb/>
table, his arms folded on his breast, nodded at him<lb/>
slightly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You thought I was drowned! No! The best dog<lb/>
of the rich, of the aristocrats, of these fine men who<lb/>
can only talk and betray the people, is not dead yet."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Garibaldino, motionless, seemed to drink in the<lb/>
sound of the well-known voice. His head moved<lb/>
slightly once as if in sign of approval; but Nostromo saw<lb/>
clearly that the old man understood nothing of the<lb/>
words. There was no one to understand; no one he<lb/>
could take into the confidence of Decoud's fate, of his<lb/>
own, into the secret of the silver. That doctor was an<lb/>
enemy of the people &mdash; a tempter. . . .<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Old Giorgio's heavy frame shook from head to foot<lb/>
with the effort to overcome his emotion at the sight of<lb/>
that man, who had shared the intimacies of his domestic<lb/>
life as though he had been a grown-up son.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She believed yon would return," he said, solemnly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo raised his head.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She was a wise woman. How could I fail to come<lb/>
back &mdash;?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He finished the thought mentally: "Since she has<lb/>
prophesied for me an end of poverty, misery, and starvation."<lb/>
These words of Teresa's anger, from the circumstances<lb/>
in which they had been uttered, like the<lb/>
cry of a soul prevented from making its peace with<lb/>
God, stirred the obscure superstition of personal<lb/>
fortune from which even the greatest genius amongst<lb/>
men of adventure and action is seldom free. They<lb/>
reigned over Nostromo's mind with the force of a potent<lb/>
malediction. And what a curse it was that which her<lb/>
words had laid upon him! He had been orphaned so<lb/>


<pb n="470"/>

young that he could remember no other woman whom<lb/>
he called mother. Henceforth there would be no enterprise<lb/>
in which he would not fail. The spell was working<lb/>
already. Death itself would elude him now. . . .<lb/>
He said violently &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Come, viejo! Get me something to eat. I am<lb/>
hungry! <hi rend="italic">Sangre de Dios!</hi> The emptiness of my belly<lb/>
makes me lightheaded."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With his chin dropped again upon his bare breast<lb/>
above his folded arms, barefooted, watching from under<lb/>
a gloomy brow the movements of old Viola foraging<lb/>
amongst the cupboards, he seemed as if indeed fallen<lb/>
under a curse &mdash; a ruined and sinister Capataz.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Old Viola walked out of a dark corner, and, without a<lb/>
word, emptied upon the table out of his hollowed palms<lb/>
a few dry crusts of bread and half a raw onion.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     While the Capataz began to devour this beggar's<lb/>
fare, taking up with stony-eyed voracity piece after<lb/>
piece lying by his side, the Garibaldino went off, and<lb/>
squatting down in another corner filled an earthenware<lb/>
mug with red wine out of a wicker-covered demijohn.<lb/>
With a familiar gesture, as when serving customers in<lb/>
the caf&eacute;, he had thrust his pipe between his teeth to<lb/>
have his hands free.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Capataz drank greedily. A slight flush deepened<lb/>
the bronze of his cheek. Before him, Viola, with a<lb/>
turn of his white and massive head towards the staircase,<lb/>
took his empty pipe out of his mouth, and pronounced<lb/>
slowly &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "After the shot was fired down here, which killed her<lb/>
as surely as if the bullet had struck her oppressed heart,<lb/>
she called upon you to save the children. Upon you,<lb/>
Gian' Battista."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Capataz looked up.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Did she do that, Padrone? To save the children!<lb/>


<pb n="471"/>

They are with the English se&ntilde;ora, their rich benefactress.<lb/>
Hey! old man of the people. Thy benefactress.<lb/>
. . ."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am old," muttered Giorgio Viola. "An English-<lb/>
woman was allowed to give a bed to Garibaldi lying<lb/>
wounded in prison. The greatest man that ever lived.<lb/>
A man of the people, too &mdash; a sailor. I may let another<lb/>
keep a roof over my head. <hi rend="italic">Si</hi> . . . I am old. I<lb/>
may let her. Life lasts too long sometimes."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And she herself may not have a roof over her head<lb/>
before many days are out, unless I . . . What do<lb/>
you say? Am I to keep a roof over her head? Am I<lb/>
to try &mdash; and save all the Blancos together with her?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You shall do it," said old Viola in a strong voice.<lb/>
"You shall do it as my son would have. . . ."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Thy son, viejo! .. .. There never has been a<lb/>
man like thy son. Ha, I must try. . . . But what<lb/>
if it were only a part of the curse to lure me on? . . .<lb/>
And so she called upon me to save &mdash; and then &mdash;?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She spoke no more." The heroic follower of Gari-@@@<lb/>
baldi, at the thought of the eternal stillness and silence<lb/>
fallen upon the shrouded form stretched out on the bed<lb/>
upstairs, averted his face and raised his hand to his<lb/>
furrowed brow. "She was dead before I could seize<lb/>
her hands," he stammered out, pitifully.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Before the wide eyes of the Capataz, staring at the<lb/>
doorway of the dark staircase, floated the shape of the<lb/>
Great Isabel, like a strange ship in distress, freighted<lb/>
with enormous wealth and the solitary life of a man.<lb/>
It was impossible for him to do anything. He could<lb/>
only hold his tongue, since there was no one to trust.<lb/>
The treasure would be lost, probably &mdash; unless Decoud.<lb/>
. . . And his thought came abruptly to an end.<lb/>
He perceived that he could not imagine in the least<lb/>
what Decoud was likely to do.<lb/>


<pb n="472"/>

</p>

<p>     Old Viola had not stirred. And the motionless Capataz<lb/>
dropped his long, soft eyelashes, which gave to the<lb/>
upper part of his fierce, black-whiskered face a touch of<lb/>
feminine ingenuousness. The silence had lasted for a<lb/>
long time.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "God rest her soul!" he murmured, gloomily.<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="473"/>


<p>     THE next day was quiet in the morning, except for the<lb/>
faint sound of firing to the northward, in the direction of<lb/>
Los Hatos. Captain Mitchell had listened to it from<lb/>
his balcony anxiously. The phrase, "In my delicate<lb/>
position as the only consular agent then in the port,<lb/>
everything, sir, everything was a just cause for anxiety,"<lb/>
had its place in the more or less stereotyped relation of<lb/>
the "historical events" which for the next few years was<lb/>
at the service of distinguished strangers visiting Sulaco.<lb/>
The mention of the dignity and neutrality of the flag,<lb/>
so difficult to preserve in his position, "right in the thick<lb/>
of these events between the lawlessness of that piratical<lb/>
villain Sotillo and the more regularly established<lb/>
but scarcely less atrocious tyranny of his Excellency<lb/>
Don Pedro Montero," came next in order. Captain<lb/>
Mitchell was not the man to enlarge upon mere dangers<lb/>
much. But he insisted that it was a memorable day.<lb/>
On that day, towards dusk, he had seen "that poor<lb/>
fellow of mine &mdash; Nostromo. The sailor whom I discovered,<lb/>
and, I may say, made, sir. The man of the famous<lb/>
ride to Cayta, sir. An historical event, sir!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Regarded by the O. S. N. Company as an old and<lb/>
faithful servant, Captain Mitchell was allowed to attain<lb/>
the term of his usefulness in ease and dignity at the head<lb/>
of the enormously extended service. The augmentation<lb/>
of the establishment, with its crowds of clerks, an<lb/>
office in town, the old office in the harbour, the division<lb/>
into departments &mdash; passenger, cargo, lighterage, and<lb/>
so on &mdash; secured a greater leisure for his last years in the<lb/>




<pb n="474"/>

regenerated Sulaco, the capital of the Occidental Republic.<lb/>
Liked by the natives for his good nature and<lb/>
the formality of his manner, self-important and simple,<lb/>
known for years as a "friend of our country," he felt<lb/>
himself a personality of mark in the town. Getting<lb/>
up early for a turn in the market-place while the gigantic<lb/>
shadow of Higuerota was still lying upon the fruit<lb/>
and flower stalls piled up with masses of gorgeous colouring,<lb/>
attending easily to current affairs, welcomed in<lb/>
houses, greeted by ladies on the Alameda, with his<lb/>
entry into all the clubs and a footing in the Casa Gould,<lb/>
he led his privileged old bachelor, man-about-town<lb/>
existence with great comfort and solemnity. But on<lb/>
mail-boat days he was down at the Harbour Office at<lb/>
an early hour, with his own gig, manned by a smart<lb/>
crew in white and blue, ready to dash off and board<lb/>
the ship directly she showed her bows between the<lb/>
harbour heads.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It would be into the Harbour Office that he would<lb/>
lead some privileged passenger he had brought off in his<lb/>
own boat, and invite him to take a seat for a moment<lb/>
while he signed a few papers. And Captain Mitchell,<lb/>
seating himself at his desk, would keep on talking hospitably<lb/>
&mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "There isn't much time if you are to see everything<lb/>
in a day. We shall be off in a moment. We'll have<lb/>
lunch at the Amarilla Club &mdash; though I belong also to<lb/>
the Anglo-American &mdash; mining engineers and business<lb/>
men, don't you know &mdash; and to the Mirliflores as well,<lb/>
a new club &mdash; English, French, Italians, all sorts &mdash; lively<lb/>
young fellows mostly, who wanted to pay a compliment<lb/>
to an old resident, sir. But we'll lunch at the Amarilla.<lb/>
Interest you, I fancy. Real thing of the country. Men<lb/>
of the first families. The President of the Occidental<lb/>
Republic himself belongs to it, sir. Fine old bishop<lb/>


<pb n="475"/>

with a broken nose in the patio. Remarkable piece<lb/>
of statuary, I believe. Cavaliere Parrochetti &mdash; you<lb/>
know Parrochetti, the famous Italian sculptor &mdash; was<lb/>
working here for two years &mdash; thought very highly of<lb/>
our old bishop. . . . There! I am very much at<lb/>
your service now."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Proud of his experience, penetrated by the sense of<lb/>
historical importance of men, events, and buildings, he<lb/>
talked pompously in jerky periods, with slight sweeps<lb/>
of his short, thick arm, letting nothing "escape the<lb/>
attention" of his privileged captive.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Lot of building going on, as you observe. Before<lb/>
the Separation it was a plain of burnt grass smothered<lb/>
in clouds of dust, with an ox-cart track to our Jetty.<lb/>
Nothing more. This is the Harbour Gate. Picturesque,<lb/>
is it not? Formerly the town stopped short there.<lb/>
We enter now the Calle de la Constitucion. Observe<lb/>
the old Spanish houses. Great dignity. Eh? I suppose<lb/>
it's just as it was in the time of the Viceroys, except<lb/>
for the pavement. Wood blocks now. Sulaco<lb/>
National Bank there, with the sentry boxes each side<lb/>
of the gate. Casa Avellanos this side, with all the<lb/>
ground-floor windows shuttered. A wonderful woman<lb/>
lives there &mdash; Miss Avellanos &mdash; the beautiful Antonia.<lb/>
A character, sir! A historical woman! Opposite<lb/>
&mdash; Casa Gould. Noble gateway. Yes, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Goulds<lb/>
of the original Gould Concession, that all the world<lb/>
knows of now. I hold seventeen of the thousand-dollar<lb/>
shares in the Consolidated San Tom&eacute; mines. All the<lb/>
poor savings of my lifetime, sir, and it will be enough<lb/>
to keep me in comfort to the end of my days at home<lb/>
when I retire. I got in on the ground-floor, you see.<lb/>
Don Carlos, great friend of mine. Seventeen shares &mdash;<lb/>
quite a little fortune to leave behind one, too. I have<lb/>
a niece &mdash; married a parson &mdash; most worthy man, incumbent<lb/>


<pb n="476"/>

of a small parish in Sussex; no end of children. I<lb/>
was never married myself. A sailor should exercise<lb/>
self-denial. Standing under that very gateway, sir,<lb/>
with some young engineer-fellows, ready to defend<lb/>
that house where we had received so much kindness<lb/>
and hospitality, I saw the first and last charge of<lb/>
Pedrito's horsemen upon Barrios's troops, who had just<lb/>
taken the Harbour Gate. They could not stand the<lb/>
new rifles brought out by that poor Decoud. It was a<lb/>
murderous fire. In a moment the street became<lb/>
blocked with a mass of dead men and horses. They<lb/>
never came on again."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And all day Captain Mitchell would talk like this<lb/>
to his more or less willing victim &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The Plaza. I call it magnificent. Twice the area<lb/>
of Trafalgar Square."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     From the very centre, in the blazing sunshine, he<lb/>
pointed out the buildings &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The Intendencia, now President's Palace &mdash; Cabildo,<lb/>
where the Lower Chamber of Parliament sits. You<lb/>
notice the new houses on that side of the Plaza? Compa&ntilde;ia<lb/>
Anzani, a great general store, like those co&ouml;perative<lb/>
things at home. Old Anzani was murdered by the<lb/>
National Guards in front of his safe. It was even for<lb/>
that specific crime that the deputy Gamacho, commanding<lb/>
the Nationals, a bloodthirsty and savage<lb/>
brute, was executed publicly by garrotte upon the sentence<lb/>
of a court-martial ordered by Barrios. Anzani's<lb/>
nephews converted the business into a company.<lb/>
All that side of the Plaza had been burnt; used to be<lb/>
colonnaded before. A terrible fire, by the light of which<lb/>
I saw the last of the fighting, the llaneros flying, the<lb/>
Nationals throwing their arms down, and the miners of<lb/>
San Tom&eacute;, all Indians from the Sierra, rolling by like a<lb/>
torrent to the sound of pipes and cymbals, green flags<lb/>


<pb n="477"/>

flying, a wild mass of men in white ponchos and green<lb/>
hats, on foot, on mules, on donkeys. Such a sight, sir,<lb/>
will never be seen again. The miners, sir, had marched<lb/>
upon the town, Don P&eacute;p&eacute; leading on his black horse,<lb/>
and their very wives in the rear on burros, screaming<lb/>
encouragement, sir, and beating tambourines. I remember<lb/>
one of these women had a green parrot seated<lb/>
on her shoulder, as calm as a bird of stone. They had<lb/>
just saved their Se&ntilde;or Administrador; for Barrios,<lb/>
though he ordered the assault at once, at night, too,<lb/>
would have been too late. Pedrito Montero had Don<lb/>
Carlos led out to be shot &mdash; like his uncle many years ago<lb/>
&mdash; and then, as Barrios said afterwards, 'Sulaco would<lb/>
not have been worth fighting for.' Sulaco without the<lb/>
Concession was nothing; and there were tons and tons<lb/>
of dynamite distributed all over the mountain with<lb/>
detonators arranged, and an old priest, Father Rom&agrave;n,<lb/>
standing by to annihilate the San Tom&eacute; mine at the<lb/>
first news of failure. Don Carlos had made up his<lb/>
mind not to leave it behind, and he had the right<lb/>
men to see to it, too."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Thus Captain Mitchell would talk in the middle of<lb/>
the Plaza, holding over his head a white umbrella with a<lb/>
green lining; but inside the cathedral, in the dim light,<lb/>
with a faint scent of incense floating in the cool atmosphere,<lb/>
and here and there a kneeling female figure,<lb/>
black or all white, with a veiled head, his lowered voice<lb/>
became solemn and impressive.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Here," he would say, pointing to a niche in the wall<lb/>
of the dusky aisle, "you see the bust of Don Jos&eacute; Avellanos,<lb/>
'Patriot and Statesman,' as the inscription says,<lb/>
'Minister to Courts of England and Spain, etc., etc.,<lb/>
died in the woods of Los Hatos worn out with his life-<lb/>
long struggle for Right and Justice at the dawn of the<lb/>
New Era.' A fair likeness. Parrochetti's work from<lb/>


<pb n="478"/>

some old photographs and a pencil sketch by Mrs.<lb/>
Gould. I was well acquainted with that distinguished<lb/>
Spanish-American of the old school, a true Hidalgo,<lb/>
beloved by everybody who knew him. The marble<lb/>
medallion in the wall, in the antique style, representing<lb/>
a veiled woman seated with her hands clasped loosely<lb/>
over her knees, commemorates that unfortunate young<lb/>
gentleman who sailed out with Nostromo on that fatal<lb/>
night, sir. See, 'To the memory of Martin Decoud,<lb/>
his betrothed Antonia Avellanos.' Frank, simple,<lb/>
noble. There you have that lady, sir, as she is. An<lb/>
exceptional woman. Those who thought she would<lb/>
give way to despair were mistaken, sir. She has been<lb/>
blamed in many quarters for not having taken the veil.<lb/>
It was expected of her. But Do&ntilde;a Antonia is not the<lb/>
stuff they make nuns of. Bishop Corbel&agrave;n, her uncle,<lb/>
lives with her in the Corbel&agrave;n town house. He is a<lb/>
fierce sort of priest, everlastingly worrying the Government<lb/>
about the old Church lands and convents. I believe<lb/>
they think a lot of him in Rome. Now let us go<lb/>
to the Amarilla Club, just across the Plaza, to get some<lb/>
lunch."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Directly outside the cathedral on the very top of the<lb/>
noble flight of steps, his voice rose pompously, his arm<lb/>
found again its sweeping gesture.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Porvenir</hi>, over there on that first floor, above those<lb/>
French plate-glass shop-fronts; our biggest daily. Conservative,<lb/>
or, rather, I should say, Parliamentary. We<lb/>
have the Parliamentary party here of which the actual<lb/>
Chief of the State, Don Juste Lopez, is the head; a very<lb/>
sagacious man, I think. A first-rate intellect, sir. The<lb/>
Democratic party in opposition rests mostly, I am sorry<lb/>
to say, on these socialistic Italians, sir, with their secret<lb/>
societies, camorras, and such-like. There are lots of<lb/>
Italians settled here on the railway lands, dismissed<lb/>


<pb n="479"/>

navvies, mechanics, and so on, all along the trunk line.<lb/>
There are whole villages of Italians on the Campo.<lb/>
And the natives, too, are being drawn into these ways<lb/>
. . . American bar? Yes. And over there you can<lb/>
see another. New Yorkers mostly frequent that<lb/>
one &mdash; Here we are at the Amarilla. Observe the<lb/>
bishop at the foot of the stairs to the right as we go in."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And the lunch would begin and terminate its lavish<lb/>
and leisurely course at a little table in the gallery, Captain<lb/>
Mitchell nodding, bowing, getting up to speak for a<lb/>
moment to different officials in black clothes, merchants<lb/>
in jackets, officers in uniform, middle-aged caballeros<lb/>
from the Campo &mdash; sallow, little, nervous men, and fat,<lb/>
placid, swarthy men, and Europeans or North Americans<lb/>
of superior standing, whose faces looked very white<lb/>
amongst the majority of dark complexions and black,<lb/>
glistening eyes.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Captain Mitchell would lie back in the chair, casting<lb/>
around looks of satisfaction, and tender over the table a<lb/>
case full of thick cigars.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Try a weed with your coffee. Local tobacco. The<lb/>
black coffee you get at the Amarilla, sir, you don't meet<lb/>
anywhere in the world. We get the bean from a famous<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">cafeteria</hi> in the foot-hills, whose owner sends three sacks<lb/>
every year as a present to his fellow members in remembrance<lb/>
of the fight against Gamacho's Nationals, carried<lb/>
on from these very windows by the caballeros. He was<lb/>
in town at the time, and took part, sir, to the bitter end.<lb/>
It arrives on three mules &mdash; not in the common way, by<lb/>
rail; no fear! &mdash; right into the patio, escorted by mounted<lb/>
peons, in charge of the Mayoral of his estate, who walks<lb/>
upstairs, booted and spurred, and delivers it to our<lb/>
committee formally with the words, 'For the sake of<lb/>
those fallen on the third of May.' We call it <hi rend="italic">Tres de<lb/>
Mayo</hi> coffee. Taste it."<lb/>


<pb n="480"/>

</p>

<p>     Captain Mitchell, with an expression as though making<lb/>
ready to hear a sermon in a church, would lift the<lb/>
tiny cup to his lips. And the nectar would be sipped<lb/>
to the bottom during a restful silence in a cloud of cigar<lb/>
smoke.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Look at this man in black just going out," he would<lb/>
begin, leaning forward hastily. "This is the famous<lb/>
Hernandez, Minister of War. <hi rend="italic">The Times'</hi> special<lb/>
correspondent, who wrote that striking series of letters<lb/>
calling the Occidental Republic the 'Treasure House of<lb/>
the World,' gave a whole article to him and the force<lb/>
he has organized &mdash; the renowned Carabineers of the<lb/>
Campo."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Captain Mitchell's guest, staring curiously, would see<lb/>
a figure in a long-tailed black coat walking gravely,<lb/>
with downcast eyelids in a long, composed face, a<lb/>
brow furrowed horizontally, a pointed head, whose<lb/>
grey hair, thin at the top, combed down carefully on<lb/>
all sides and rolled at the ends, fell low on the neck<lb/>
and shoulders. This, then, was the famous bandit of<lb/>
whom Europe had heard with interest. He put on a<lb/>
high-crowned sombrero with a wide flat brim; a rosary<lb/>
of wooden beads was twisted about his right wrist.<lb/>
And Captain Mitchell would proceed &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The protector of the Sulaco refugees from the rage of<lb/>
Pedrito. As general of cavalry with Barrios he distinguished<lb/>
himself at the storming of Tonoro, where Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Fuentes was killed with the last remnant of the Monterists.<lb/>
He is the friend and humble servant of Bishop<lb/>
Corbel&agrave;n. Hears three Masses every day. I bet<lb/>
you he will step into the cathedral to say a prayer or two<lb/>
on his way home to his siesta."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He took several puffs at his cigar in silence; then, in<lb/>
his most important manner, pronounced:<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The Spanish race, sir, is prolific of remarkable characters<lb/>


<pb n="481"/>

in every rank of life. . . . I propose we go<lb/>
now into the billiard-room, which is cool, for a quiet<lb/>
chat. There's never anybody there till after five. I<lb/>
could tell you episodes of the Separationist revolution<lb/>
that would astonish you. When the great heat's over,<lb/>
we'll take a turn on the Alameda."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The programme went on relentless, like a law of<lb/>
Nature. The turn on the Alameda was taken with<lb/>
slow steps and stately remarks.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "All the great world of Sulaco here, sir." Captain<lb/>
Mitchell bowed right and left with no end of formality;<lb/>
then with animation, "Do&ntilde;a Emilia, Mrs. Gould's<lb/>
carriage. Look. Always white mules. The kindest,<lb/>
most gracious woman the sun ever shone upon. A<lb/>
great position, sir. A great position. First lady in<lb/>
Sulaco &mdash; far before the President's wife. And worthy<lb/>
of it." He took off his hat; then, with a studied<lb/>
change of tone, added, negligently, that the man in<lb/>
black by her side, with a high white collar and a scarred,<lb/>
snarly face, was Dr. Monygham, Inspector of State<lb/>
Hospitals, chief medical officer of the Consolidated San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; mines. "A familiar of the house. Everlastingly<lb/>
there. No wonder. The Goulds made him.<lb/>
Very clever man and all that, but I never liked him.<lb/>
Nobody does. I can recollect him limping about the<lb/>
streets in a check shirt and native sandals with a water-<lb/>
melon under his arm &mdash; all he would get to eat for the<lb/>
day. A big-wig now, sir, and as nasty as ever. However<lb/>
. . . There's no doubt he played his part<lb/>
fairly well at the time. He saved us all from the deadly<lb/>
incubus of Sotillo, where a more particular man might<lb/>
have failed &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His arm went up.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The equestrian statue that used to stand on the<lb/>
pedestal over there has been removed. It was an<lb/>


<pb n="482"/>

anachronism," Captain Mitchell commented, obscurely.<lb/>
"There is some talk of replacing it by a marble shaft<lb/>
commemorative of Separation, with angels of peace at<lb/>
the four corners, and bronze Justice holding an even<lb/>
balance, all gilt, on the top. Cavaliere Parrochetti<lb/>
was asked to make a design, which you can see framed<lb/>
under glass in the Municipal Sala. Names are to be<lb/>
engraved all round the base. Well! They could do<lb/>
no better than begin with the name of Nostromo. He<lb/>
has done for Separation as much as anybody else, and,"<lb/>
added Captain Mitchell, "has got less than many others<lb/>
by it &mdash; when it comes to that." He dropped on to a<lb/>
stone seat under a tree, and tapped invitingly at the<lb/>
place by his side. "He carried to Barrios the letters<lb/>
from Sulaco which decided the General to abandon<lb/>
Cayta for a time, and come back to our help here by sea.<lb/>
The transports were still in harbour fortunately. Sir,<lb/>
I did not even know that my Capataz de Cargadores<lb/>
was alive. I had no idea. It was Dr. Monygham<lb/>
who came upon him, by chance, in the Custom House,<lb/>
evacuated an hour or two before by the wretched Sotillo.<lb/>
I was never told; never given a hint, nothing &mdash; as if<lb/>
I were unworthy of confidence. Monygham arranged<lb/>
it all. He went to the railway yards, and got admission<lb/>
to the engineer-in-chief, who, for the sake of the Goulds<lb/>
as much as for anything else, consented to let an engine<lb/>
make a dash down the line, one hundred and eighty<lb/>
miles, with Nostromo aboard. It was the only way to<lb/>
get him off. In the Construction Camp at the railhead,<lb/>
he obtained a horse, arms, some clothing, and<lb/>
started alone on that marvellous ride &mdash; four hundred<lb/>
miles in six days, through a disturbed country, ending<lb/>
by the feat of passing through the Monterist lines outside<lb/>
Cayta. The history of that ride, sir, would make a<lb/>
most exciting book. He carried all our lives in his<lb/>


<pb n="483"/>

pocket. Devotion, courage, fidelity, intelligence were<lb/>
not enough. Of course, he was perfectly fearless and<lb/>
incorruptible. But a man was wanted that would<lb/>
know how to succeed. He was that man, sir. On the<lb/>
fifth of May, being practically a prisoner in the Harbour<lb/>
Office of my Company, I suddenly heard the whistle<lb/>
of an engine in the railway yards, a quarter of a<lb/>
mile away. I could not believe my ears. I made one<lb/>
jump on to the balcony, and beheld a locomotive under<lb/>
a great head of steam run out of the yard gates, screeching<lb/>
like mad, enveloped in a white cloud, and then, just<lb/>
abreast of old Viola's inn, check almost to a standstill.<lb/>
I made out, sir, a man &mdash; I couldn't tell who &mdash; dash out<lb/>
of the Albergo d'ltalia Una, climb into the cab, and<lb/>
then, sir, that engine seemed positively to leap clear of<lb/>
the house, and was gone in the twinkling of an eye.<lb/>
As you blow a candle out, sir! There was a first-rate<lb/>
driver on the foot-plate, sir, I can tell you. They were<lb/>
fired heavily upon by the National Guards in Rincon<lb/>
and one other place. Fortunately the line had not<lb/>
been torn up. In four hours they reached the Construction<lb/>
Camp. Nostromo had his start. . . . The<lb/>
rest you know. You've got only to look round you.<lb/>
There are people on this Alameda that ride in their<lb/>
carriages, or even are alive at all to-day, because years<lb/>
ago I engaged a runaway Italian sailor for a foreman of<lb/>
our wharf simply on the strength of his looks. And<lb/>
that's a fact. You can't get over it, sir. On the seventeenth<lb/>
of May, just twelve days after I saw the man<lb/>
from the Casa Viola get on the engine, and wondered<lb/>
what it meant, Barrios's transports were entering this<lb/>
harbour, and the 'Treasure House of the World,' as<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">The Times</hi> man calls Sulaco in his book, was saved intact<lb/>
for civilization &mdash; for a great future, sir. Pedrito,<lb/>
with Hernandez on the west, and the San Tom&eacute; miners<lb/>


<pb n="484"/>

pressing on the land gate, was not able to oppose the<lb/>
landing. He had been sending messages to Sotillo<lb/>
for a week to join him. Had Sotillo done so there<lb/>
would have been massacres and proscription that would<lb/>
have left no man or woman of position alive. But<lb/>
that's where Dr. Monygham comes in. Sotillo, blind<lb/>
and deaf to everything, stuck on board his steamer<lb/>
watching the dragging for silver, which he believed to<lb/>
be sunk at the bottom of the harbour. They say that<lb/>
for the last three days he was out of his mind raving<lb/>
and foaming with disappointment at getting nothing,<lb/>
flying about the deck, and yelling curses at the boats<lb/>
with the drags, ordering them in, and then suddenly<lb/>
stamping his foot and crying out, 'And yet it is there!<lb/>
I see it! I feel it!'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He was preparing to hang Dr. Monygham (whom he<lb/>
had on board) at the end of the after-derrick, when the<lb/>
first of Barrios's transports, one of our own ships at<lb/>
that, steamed right in, and ranging close alongside<lb/>
opened a small-arm fire without as much preliminaries<lb/>
as a hail. It was the completest surprise in the world,<lb/>
sir. They were too astounded at first to bolt below.<lb/>
Men were falling right and left like ninepins. It's a<lb/>
miracle that Monygham, standing on the after-hatch<lb/>
with the rope already round his neck, escaped being<lb/>
riddled through and through like a sieve. He told me<lb/>
since that he had given himself up for lost, and kept on<lb/>
yelling with all the strength of his lungs: 'Hoist a white<lb/>
flag! Hoist a white flag!' Suddenly an old major<lb/>
of the Esmeralda regiment, standing by, unsheathed<lb/>
his sword with a shriek: 'Die, perjured traitor!' and ran<lb/>
Sotillo clean through the body, just before he fell himself<lb/>
shot through the head."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Captain Mitchell stopped for a while.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Begad, sir! I could spin you a yarn for hours.<lb/>


<pb n="485"/>

But it's time we started off to Rincon. It would not do<lb/>
for you to pass through Sulaco and not see the lights of<lb/>
the San Tom&eacute; mine, a whole mountain ablaze like a<lb/>
lighted palace above the dark Campo. It's a fashionable<lb/>
drive. . . . But let me tell you one little<lb/>
anecdote, sir; just to show you. A fortnight or more<lb/>
later, when Barrios, declared Generalissimo, was gone<lb/>
in pursuit of Pedrito away south, when the Provisional<lb/>
Junta, with Don Juste Lopez at its head, had promulgated<lb/>
the new Constitution, and our Don Carlos<lb/>
Gould was packing up his trunks bound on a mission to<lb/>
San Francisco and Washington (the United States, sir,<lb/>
were the first great power to recognize the Occidental<lb/>
Republic) &mdash; a fortnight later, I say, when we were<lb/>
beginning to feel that our heads were safe on our<lb/>
shoulders, if I may express myself so, a prominent man,<lb/>
a large shipper by our line, came to see me on business,<lb/>
and, says he, the first thing: 'I say, Captain Mitchell,<lb/>
is that fellow' (meaning Nostromo) 'still the Capataz of<lb/>
your Cargadores or not?' 'What's the matter?' says I.<lb/>
'Because, if he is, then I don't mind; I send and receive<lb/>
a good lot of cargo by your ships; but I have observed<lb/>
him several days loafing about the wharf, and just now<lb/>
he stopped me as cool as you please, with a request for<lb/>
a cigar. Now, you know, my cigars are rather special,<lb/>
and I can't get them so easily as all that.' 'I hope<lb/>
you stretched a point,' I said, very gently. 'Why, yes.<lb/>
But it's a confounded nuisance. The fellow's everlastingly<lb/>
cadging for smokes.' Sir, I turned my eyes<lb/>
away, and then asked, 'Weren't you one of the prisoners<lb/>
in the Cabildo?' 'You know very well I was, and in<lb/>
chains, too,' says he. 'And under a fine of fifteen<lb/>
thousand dollars?' He coloured, sir, because it got<lb/>
about that he fainted from fright when they came to<lb/>
arrest him, and then behaved before Fuentes in a manner<lb/>


<pb n="486"/>

to make the very <hi rend="italic">policianos</hi>, who had dragged him<lb/>
there by the hair of his head, smile at his cringing.<lb/>
'Yes,' he says, in a sort of shy way. 'Why?' 'Oh,<lb/>
nothing. You stood to lose a tidy bit,' says I, 'even<lb/>
if you saved your life. . . . But what can I do<lb/>
for you?' He never even saw the point. Not he.<lb/>
And that's how the world wags, sir."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He rose a little stiffly, and the drive to Rincon would<lb/>
be taken with only one philosophical remark, uttered<lb/>
by the merciless cicerone, with his eyes fixed upon the<lb/>
lights of San Tom&eacute;, that seemed suspended in the dark<lb/>
night between earth and heaven.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A great power, this, for good and evil, sir. A great<lb/>
power."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And the dinner of the Mirliflores would be eaten,<lb/>
excellent as to cooking, and leaving upon the traveller's<lb/>
mind an impression that there were in Sulaco many<lb/>
pleasant, able young men with salaries apparently<lb/>
too large for their discretion, and amongst them a few,<lb/>
mostly Anglo-Saxon, skilled in the art of, as the saying<lb/>
is, "taking a rise" out of his kind host.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With a rapid, jingling drive to the harbour in a two-<lb/>
wheeled machine (which Captain Mitchell called a curricle)<lb/>
behind a fleet and scraggy mule beaten all the<lb/>
time by an obviously Neapolitan driver, the cycle<lb/>
would be nearly closed before the lighted-up offices of<lb/>
the O. S. N. Company, remaining open so late because<lb/>
of the steamer. Nearly &mdash; but not quite.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ten o'clock. Your ship won't be ready to leave till<lb/>
half-past twelve, if by then. Come in for a brandy-<lb/>
and-soda and one more cigar."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And in the superintendent's private room the privileged<lb/>
passenger by the <hi rend="italic">Ceres</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Juno</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Pallas</hi>, stunned<lb/>
and as it were annihilated mentally by a sudden surfeit<lb/>
of sights, sounds, names, facts, and complicated information<lb/>


<pb n="487"/>

imperfectly apprehended, would listen like a<lb/>
tired child to a fairy tale; would hear a voice, familiar<lb/>
and surprising in its pompousness, tell him, as if from<lb/>
another world, how there was "in this very harbour"<lb/>
an international naval demonstration, which put an<lb/>
end to the Costaguana-Sulaco War. How the United<lb/>
States cruiser, <hi rend="italic">Powhattan</hi>, was the first to salute the<lb/>
Occidental flag &mdash; white, with a wreath of green laurel<lb/>
in the middle encircling a yellow amarilla flower. Would<lb/>
hear how General Montero, in less than a month after<lb/>
proclaiming himself Emperor of Costaguana, was shot<lb/>
dead (during a solemn and public distribution of orders<lb/>
and crosses) by a young artillery officer, the brother of<lb/>
his then mistress.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The abominable Pedrito, sir, fled the country," the<lb/>
voice would say. And it would continue: "A captain<lb/>
of one of our ships told me lately that he recognized<lb/>
Pedrito the Guerrillero, arrayed in purple slippers and a<lb/>
velvet smoking-cap with a gold tassel, keeping a disorderly<lb/>
house in one of the southern ports."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Abominable Pedrito! Who the devil was he?"<lb/>
would wonder the distinguished bird of passage<lb/>
hovering on the confines of waking and sleep with resolutely<lb/>
open eyes and a faint but amiable curl upon his<lb/>
lips, from between which stuck out the eighteenth or<lb/>
twentieth cigar of that memorable day.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He appeared to me in this very room like a haunting<lb/>
ghost, sir" &mdash; Captain Mitchell was talking of his Nostromo<lb/>
with true warmth of feeling and a touch of wistful<lb/>
pride. "You may imagine, sir, what an effect it<lb/>
produced on me. He had come round by sea with<lb/>
Barrios, of course. And the first thing he told me after<lb/>
I became fit to hear him was that he had picked up<lb/>
the lighter's boat floating in the gulf! He seemed quite<lb/>
overcome by the circumstance. And a remarkable<lb/>


<pb n="488"/>

enough circumstance it was, when you remember that<lb/>
it was then sixteen days since the sinking of the silver.<lb/>
At once I could see he was another man. He stared<lb/>
at the wall, sir, as if there had been a spider or something<lb/>
running about there. The loss of the silver<lb/>
preyed on his mind. The first thing he asked me about<lb/>
was whether Do&ntilde;a Antonia had heard yet of Decoud's<lb/>
death. His voice trembled. I had to tell him that<lb/>
Do&ntilde;a Antonia, as a matter of fact, was not back<lb/>
in town yet. Poor girl! And just as I was making<lb/>
ready to ask him a thousand questions, with a sudden,<lb/>
'Pardon me, se&ntilde;or,' he cleared out of the office altogether.<lb/>
I did not see him again for three days. I was<lb/>
terribly busy, you know. It seems that he wandered<lb/>
about in and out of the town, and on two nights turned<lb/>
up to sleep in the baracoons of the railway people.<lb/>
He seemed absolutely indifferent to what went on. I<lb/>
asked him on the wharf, 'When are you going to take<lb/>
hold again, Nostromo? There will be plenty of work<lb/>
for the Cargadores presently.'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'Se&ntilde;or,' says he, looking at me in a slow, inquisitive<lb/>
manner, 'would it surprise you to hear that I am too<lb/>
tired to work just yet? And what work could I do now?<lb/>
How can I look my Cargadores in the face after losing a<lb/>
lighter?'<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I begged him not to think any more about the silver,<lb/>
and he smiled. A smile that went to my heart, sir. 'It<lb/>
was no mistake,' I told him. 'It was a fatality. A<lb/>
thing that could not be helped.' '<hi rend="italic">Si, si!"</hi> he said, and<lb/>
turned away. I thought it best to leave him alone for a<lb/>
bit to get over it. Sir, it took him years really, to get<lb/>
over it. I was present at his interview with Don Carlos.<lb/>
I must say that Gould is rather a cold man. He<lb/>
had to keep a tight hand on his feelings, dealing with<lb/>
thieves and rascals, in constant danger of ruin for himself<lb/>


<pb n="489"/>

and wife for so many years, that it had become a<lb/>
second nature. They looked at each other for a long<lb/>
time. Don Carlos asked what he could do for him, in<lb/>
his quiet, reserved way.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "'My name is known from one end of Sulaco to the<lb/>
other,' he said, as quiet as the other. 'What more can<lb/>
you do for me?' That was all that passed on that occasion.<lb/>
Later, however, there was a very fine coasting<lb/>
schooner for sale, and Mrs. Gould and I put our heads<lb/>
together to get her bought and presented to him.<lb/>
It was done, but he paid all the price back within the<lb/>
next three years. Business was booming all along this<lb/>
seaboard, sir. Moreover, that man always succeeded<lb/>
in everything except in saving the silver. Poor Do&ntilde;a<lb/>
Antonia, fresh from her terrible experiences in the<lb/>
woods of Los Hatos, had an interview with him, too.<lb/>
Wanted to hear about Decoud: what they said, what<lb/>
they did, what they thought up to the last on that fatal<lb/>
night. Mrs. Gould told me his manner was perfect<lb/>
for quietness and sympathy. Miss Avellanos burst<lb/>
into tears only when he told her how Decoud had happened<lb/>
to say that his plan would be a glorious success.<lb/>
. . . And there's no doubt, sir, that it is.  It is a<lb/>
success."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The cycle was about to close at last. And while<lb/>
the privileged passenger, shivering with the pleasant<lb/>
anticipations of his berth, forgot to ask himself,<lb/>
"What on earth Decoud's plan could be?" Captain<lb/>
Mitchell was saying, "Sorry we must part so soon.<lb/>
Your intelligent interest made this a pleasant day to<lb/>
me. I shall see you now on board. You had a<lb/>
glimpse of the 'Treasure House of the World.' A<lb/>
very good name that." And the coxswain's voice at<lb/>
the door, announcing that the gig was ready, closed the<lb/>
cycle.<lb/>


<pb n="490"/>

</p>

<p>     Nostromo had, indeed, found the lighter's boat,<lb/>
which he had left on the Great Isabel with Decoud,<lb/>
floating empty far out in the gulf. He was then on<lb/>
the bridge of the first of Barrios's transports, and within<lb/>
an hour's steaming from Sulaco. Barrios, always delighted<lb/>
with a feat of daring and a good judge of courage,<lb/>
had taken a great liking to the Capataz. During<lb/>
the passage round the coast the General kept Nostromo<lb/>
near his person, addressing him frequently in that<lb/>
abrupt and boisterous manner which was the sign of his<lb/>
high favour.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo's eyes were the first to catch, broad on the<lb/>
bow, the tiny, elusive dark speck, which, alone with the<lb/>
forms of the Three Isabels right ahead, appeared on<lb/>
the flat, shimmering emptiness of the gulf. There are<lb/>
times when no fact should be neglected as insignificant;<lb/>
a small boat so far from the land might have had some<lb/>
meaning worth finding out. At a nod of consent from<lb/>
Barrios the transport swept out of her course, passing<lb/>
near enough to ascertain that no one manned the little<lb/>
cockle-shell. It was merely a common small boat gone<lb/>
adrift with her oars in her. But Nostromo, to whose<lb/>
mind Decoud had been insistently present for days, had<lb/>
long before recognized with excitement the dinghy of<lb/>
the lighter.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There could be no question of stopping to pick up that<lb/>
thing. Every minute of time was momentous with the<lb/>
lives and futures of a whole town. The head of the leading<lb/>
ship, with the General on board, fell off to her<lb/>
course. Behind her, the fleet of transports, scattered<lb/>
haphazard over a mile or so in the offing, like the finish<lb/>
of an ocean race, pressed on, all black and smoking on<lb/>
the western sky.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Mi General," Nostromo's voice rang out loud, but<lb/>
quiet, from behind a group of officers, "I should like to<lb/>


<pb n="491"/>

save that little boat. <hi rend="italic">Por Dios</hi>, I know her. She<lb/>
belongs to my Company."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And, <hi rend="italic">por Dios</hi>," guffawed Barrios, in a noisy, good-<lb/>
humoured voice, "you belong to me. I am going to<lb/>
make you a captain of cavalry directly we get within<lb/>
sight of a horse again."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I can swim far better than I can ride, mi General,"<lb/>
</p>

<p>cried Nostromo, pushing through to the rail with a set                <lb/>
</p>

<p>stare in his eyes. "Let me &mdash;"                                      <lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Let you? What a conceited fellow that is," bantered<lb/>
the General, jovially, without even looking at him.<lb/>
"Let him go! Ha! ha! ha! He wants me to admit<lb/>
that we cannot take Sulaco without him! Ha! ha!<lb/>
ha! Would you like to swim off to her, my son?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A tremendous shout from one end of the ship to the<lb/>
other stopped his guffaw. Nostromo had leaped overboard;<lb/>
and his black head bobbed up far away already<lb/>
from the ship. The General muttered an appalled<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">"Cielo!</hi> Sinner that I am!" in a thunderstruck tone.<lb/>
One anxious glance was enough to show him that Nostromo<lb/>
was swimming with perfect ease; and then he<lb/>
thundered terribly, "No! no! We shall not stop to<lb/>
pick up this impertinent fellow. Let him drown &mdash;<lb/>
that mad Capataz."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nothing short of main force would have kept Nostromo<lb/>
from leaping overboard. That empty boat,<lb/>
coming out to meet him mysteriously, as if rowed by<lb/>
an invisible spectre, exercised the fascination of some<lb/>
sign, of some warning, seemed to answer in a startling<lb/>
and enigmatic way the persistent thought of a treasure<lb/>
and of a man's fate. He would have leaped if there<lb/>
had been death in that half-mile of water. It was as<lb/>
smooth as a pond, and for some reason sharks are unknown<lb/>
in the Placid Gulf, though on the other side of<lb/>
the Punta Mala the coastline swarms with them.<lb/>


<pb n="492"/>

</p>

<p>     The Capataz seized hold of the stern and blew with<lb/>
force. A queer, faint feeling had come over him while<lb/>
he swam. He had got rid of his boots and coat in the<lb/>
water. He hung on for a time, regaining his breath. In<lb/>
the distance the transports, more in a bunch now, held<lb/>
on straight for Sulaco, with their air of friendly contest,<lb/>
of nautical sport, of a regatta; and the united smoke of<lb/>
their funnels drove like a thin, sulphurous fogbank<lb/>
right over his head. It was his daring, his courage, his<lb/>
act that had set these ships in motion upon the sea,<lb/>
hurrying on to save the lives and fortunes of the Blancos,<lb/>
the taskmasters of the people; to save the San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; mine; to save the children.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With a vigorous and skilful effort he clambered over<lb/>
the stern. The very boat! No doubt of it; no doubt<lb/>
whatever. It was the dinghy of the lighter No. 3 &mdash;<lb/>
the dinghy left with Martin Decoud on the Great Isabel<lb/>
so that he should have some means to help himself if<lb/>
nothing could be done for him from the shore. And<lb/>
here she had come out to meet him empty and inexplicable.<lb/>
What had become of Decoud? The Capataz<lb/>
made a minute examination. He looked for some<lb/>
scratch, for some mark, for some sign. All he discovered<lb/>
was a brown stain on the gunwale abreast of the<lb/>
thwart. He bent his face over it and rubbed hard<lb/>
with his finger. Then he sat down in the stern sheets,<lb/>
passive, with his knees close together and legs aslant.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Streaming from head to foot, with his hair and whiskers<lb/>
hanging lank and dripping and a lustreless stare<lb/>
fixed upon the bottom boards, the Capataz of the Sulaco<lb/>
Cargadores resembled a drowned corpse come up<lb/>
from the bottom to idle away the sunset hour in a small<lb/>
boat. The excitement of his adventurous ride, the<lb/>
excitement of the return in time, of achievement, of<lb/>
success, all this excitement centred round the associated<lb/>


<pb n="493"/>

ideas of the great treasure and of the only other<lb/>
man who knew of its existence, had departed from him.<lb/>
To the very last moment he had been cudgelling his<lb/>
brains as to how he could manage to visit the Great<lb/>
Isabel without loss of time and undetected. For the<lb/>
idea of secrecy had come to be connected with the<lb/>
treasure so closely that even to Barrios himself he had<lb/>
refrained from mentioning the existence of Decoud<lb/>
and of the silver on the island. The letters he carried<lb/>
to the General, however, made brief mention of the<lb/>
loss of the lighter, as having its bearing upon the situation<lb/>
in Sulaco. In the circumstances, the one-<lb/>
eyed tiger-slayer, scenting battle from afar, had not<lb/>
wasted his time in making inquiries from the messenger.<lb/>
In fact, Barrios, talking with Nostromo, assumed that<lb/>
both Don Martin Decoud and the ingots of San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
were lost together, and Nostromo, not questioned directly,<lb/>
had kept silent, under the influence of some indefinable<lb/>
form of resentment and distrust. Let Don<lb/>
Martin speak of everything with his own lips &mdash; was<lb/>
what he told himself mentally.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And now, with the means of gaining the Great Isabel<lb/>
thrown thus in his way at the earliest possible moment,<lb/>
his excitement had departed, as when the soul takes<lb/>
flight leaving the body inert upon an earth it knows no<lb/>
more. Nostromo did not seem to know the gulf.<lb/>
For a long time even his eyelids did not flutter once<lb/>
upon the glazed emptiness of his stare. Then slowly,<lb/>
without a limb having stirred, without a twitch of<lb/>
muscle or quiver of an eyelash, an expression, a living<lb/>
expression came upon the still features, deep thought<lb/>
crept into the empty stare &mdash; as if an outcast soul, a<lb/>
quiet, brooding soul, finding that untenanted body in<lb/>
its way, had come in stealthily to take possession.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Capataz frowned: and in the immense stillness<lb/>


<pb n="494"/>

of sea, islands, and coast, of cloud forms on the sky and<lb/>
trails of light upon the water, the knitting of that brow<lb/>
had the emphasis of a powerful gesture. Nothing<lb/>
else budged for a long time; then the Capataz shook<lb/>
his head and again surrendered himself to the universal<lb/>
repose of all visible things. Suddenly he seized the<lb/>
oars, and with one movement made the dinghy spin<lb/>
round, head-on to the Great Isabel. But before he<lb/>
began to pull he bent once more over the brown stain<lb/>
on the gunwale.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I know that thing," he muttered to himself, with a<lb/>
sagacious jerk of the head. "That's blood."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His stroke was long, vigorous, and steady. Now and<lb/>
then he looked over his shoulder at the Great Isabel,<lb/>
presenting its low cliff to his anxious gaze like an impenetrable<lb/>
face. At last the stem touched the strand.<lb/>
He flung rather than dragged the boat up the little<lb/>
beach. At once, turning his back upon the sunset, he<lb/>
plunged with long strides into the ravine, making the<lb/>
water of the stream spurt and fly upwards at every<lb/>
step, as if spurning its shallow, clear, murmuring spirit<lb/>
with his feet. He wanted to save every moment of daylight.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    A mass of earth, grass, and smashed bushes had fallen<lb/>
down very naturally from above upon the cavity under<lb/>
the leaning tree. Decoud had attended to the concealment<lb/>
of the silver as instructed, using the spade with<lb/>
some intelligence. But Nostromo's half-smile of approval<lb/>
changed into a scornful curl of the lip by the<lb/>
sight of the spade itself flung there in full view, as if in<lb/>
utter carelessness or sudden panic, giving away the<lb/>
whole thing. Ah! They were all alike in their folly,<lb/>
these <hi rend="italic">hombres finos</hi> that invented laws and governments<lb/>
and barren tasks for the people.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Capataz picked up the spade, and with the feel of<lb/>


<pb n="495"/>

the handle in his palm the desire of having a look at the<lb/>
horse-hide boxes of treasure came upon him suddenly.<lb/>
In a very few strokes he uncovered the edges and corners<lb/>
of several; then, clearing away more earth, became<lb/>
aware that one of them had been slashed with a knife.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He exclaimed at that discovery in a stifled voice, and<lb/>
dropped on his knees with a look of irrational apprehension<lb/>
over one shoulder, then over the other. The<lb/>
stiff hide had closed, and he hesitated before he pushed<lb/>
his hand through the long slit and felt the ingots inside.<lb/>
There they were. One, two, three. Yes, four gone.<lb/>
Taken away. Four ingots. But who? Decoud? Nobody<lb/>
else. And why? For what purpose? For what<lb/>
cursed fancy? Let him explain. Four ingots carried<lb/>
off in a boat, and &mdash; blood!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the face of the open gulf, the sun, clear, unclouded,<lb/>
unaltered, plunged into the waters in a grave and untroubled<lb/>
mystery of self-immolation consummated far<lb/>
from all mortal eyes, with an infinite majesty of silence<lb/>
and peace. Four ingots short! &mdash; and blood!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Capataz got up slowly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He might simply have cut his hand," he muttered.<lb/>
"But, then &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He sat down on the soft earth, unresisting, as if he<lb/>
had been chained to the treasure, his drawn-up legs<lb/>
clasped in his hands with an air of hopeless submission,<lb/>
like a slave set on guard. Once only he lifted his head<lb/>
smartly: the rattle of hot musketry fire had reached his<lb/>
ears, like pouring from on high a stream of dry peas<lb/>
upon a drum. After listening for a while, he said,<lb/>
half aloud &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He will never come back to explain."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And he lowered his head again.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Impossible!" he muttered, gloomily.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The sounds of firing died out. The loom of a great<lb/>


<pb n="496"/>

conflagration in Sulaco flashed up red above the coast,<lb/>
played on the clouds at the head of the gulf, seemed to<lb/>
touch with a ruddy and sinister reflection the forms of<lb/>
the Three Isabels. He never saw it, though he raised<lb/>
his head.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But, then, I cannot know," he pronounced, distinctly,<lb/>
and remained silent and staring for hours.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He could not know. Nobody was to know. As<lb/>
might have been supposed, the end of Don Martin<lb/>
Decoud never became a subject of speculation for any<lb/>
one except Nostromo. Had the truth of the facts<lb/>
been known, there would always have remained the<lb/>
question. Why? Whereas the version of his death<lb/>
at the sinking of the lighter had no uncertainty of<lb/>
motive. The young apostle of Separation had died<lb/>
striving for his idea by an ever-lamented accident.<lb/>
But the truth was that he died from solitude, the enemy<lb/>
known but to few on this earth, and whom only the<lb/>
simplest of us are fit to withstand. The brilliant Costaguanero<lb/>
of the boulevards had died from solitude and<lb/>
want of faith in himself and others.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     For some good and valid reasons beyond mere human<lb/>
comprehension, the sea-birds of the gulf shun the Isabels.<lb/>
The rocky head of Azuera is their haunt, whose<lb/>
stony levels and chasms resound with their wild and<lb/>
tumultuous clamour as if they were for ever quarrelling<lb/>
over the legendary treasure.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     At the end of his first day on the Great Isabel,<lb/>
Decoud, turning in his lair of coarse grass, under the<lb/>
shade of a tree, said to himself &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I have not seen as much as one single bird all day."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And he had not heard a sound, either, all day but that<lb/>
one now of his own muttering voice. It had been a<lb/>
day of absolute silence &mdash; the first he had known in his<lb/>
life. And he had not slept a wink. Not for all these<lb/>


<pb n="497"/>

wakeful nights and the days of fighting, planning, talking;<lb/>
not for all that last night of danger and hard physical<lb/>
toil upon the gulf, had he been able to close his eyes<lb/>
for a moment. And yet from sunrise to sunset he had<lb/>
been lying prone on the ground, either on his back or on<lb/>
his face.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He stretched himself, and with slow steps descended<lb/>
into the gully to spend the night by the side of the silver.<lb/>
If Nostromo returned &mdash; as he might have done at<lb/>
any moment &mdash; it was there that he would look first;<lb/>
and night would, of course, be the proper time for an attempt<lb/>
to communicate. He remembered with profound<lb/>
indifference that he had not eaten anything yet since<lb/>
he had been left alone on the island.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He spent the night open-eyed, and when the day<lb/>
broke he ate something with the same indifference.<lb/>
The brilliant "Son Decoud," the spoiled darling of the<lb/>
family, the lover of Antonia and journalist of Sulaco,<lb/>
was not fit to grapple with himself single-handed.<lb/>
Solitude from mere outward condition of existence becomes<lb/>
very swiftly a state of soul in which the affectations<lb/>
of irony and scepticism have no place. It takes<lb/>
possession of the mind, and drives forth the thought<lb/>
into the exile of utter unbelief. After three days of<lb/>
waiting for the sight of some human face, Decoud<lb/>
caught himself entertaining a doubt of his own individuality.<lb/>
It had merged into the world of cloud<lb/>
and water, of natural forces and forms of nature. In<lb/>
our activity alone do we find the sustaining illusion<lb/>
of an independent existence as against the whole<lb/>
scheme of things of which we form a helpless part.<lb/>
Decoud lost all belief in the reality of his action past<lb/>
and to come. On the fifth day an immense melancholy<lb/>
descended upon him palpably. He resolved<lb/>
not to give himself up to these people in Sulaco, who<lb/>


<pb n="498"/>

had beset him, unreal and terrible, like jibbering and<lb/>
obscene spectres. He saw himself struggling feebly in<lb/>
their midst, and Antonia, gigantic and lovely like an<lb/>
allegorical statue, looking on with scornful eyes at his<lb/>
weakness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Not a living being, not a speck of distant sail, appeared<lb/>
within the range of his vision; and, as if to escape<lb/>
from this solitude, he absorbed himself in his<lb/>
melancholy. The vague consciousness of a misdirected<lb/>
life given up to impulses whose memory left a bitter<lb/>
taste in his mouth was the first moral sentiment of his<lb/>
manhood. But at the same time he felt no remorse.<lb/>
What should he regret? He had recognized no other<lb/>
virtue than intelligence, and had erected passions into<lb/>
duties. Both his intelligence and his passion were<lb/>
swallowed up easily in this great unbroken solitude of<lb/>
waiting without faith. Sleeplessness had robbed his<lb/>
will of all energy, for he had not slept seven hours in<lb/>
the seven days. His sadness was the sadness of a sceptical<lb/>
mind. He beheld the universe as a succession of<lb/>
incomprehensible images. Nostromo was dead. Everything<lb/>
had failed ignominiously. He no longer dared to<lb/>
think of Antonia. She had not survived. But if she<lb/>
survived he could not face her. And all exertion<lb/>
seemed senseless.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On the tenth day, after a night spent without even<lb/>
dozing off once (it had occurred to him that Antonia<lb/>
could not possibly have ever loved a being so impalpable<lb/>
as himself), the solitude appeared like a great<lb/>
void, and the silence of the gulf like a tense, thin cord<lb/>
to which he hung suspended by both hands, without<lb/>
fear, without surprise, without any sort of emotion<lb/>
whatever. Only towards the evening, in the comparative<lb/>
relief of coolness, he began to wish that this cord<lb/>
would snap. He imagined it snapping with a report as<lb/>


<pb n="499"/>

of a pistol &mdash; a sharp, full crack. And that would be<lb/>
the end of him. He contemplated that eventuality<lb/>
with pleasure, because he dreaded the sleepless nights<lb/>
in which the silence, remaining unbroken in the<lb/>
shape of a cord to which he hung with both hands,<lb/>
vibrated with senseless phrases, always the same but<lb/>
utterly incomprehensible, about Nostromo, Antonia,<lb/>
Barrios, and proclamations mingled into an ironical<lb/>
and senseless buzzing. In the daytime he could look<lb/>
at the silence like a still cord stretched to breaking-<lb/>
point, with his life, his vain life, suspended to it like a<lb/>
weight.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I wonder whether I would hear it snap before I<lb/>
fell," he asked himself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The sun was two hours above the horizon when he got<lb/>
up, gaunt, dirty, white-faced, and looked at it with his<lb/>
red-rimmed eyes. His limbs obeyed him slowly, as if<lb/>
full of lead, yet without tremor; and the effect of that<lb/>
physical condition gave to his movements an unhesitating,<lb/>
deliberate dignity. He acted as if accomplishing<lb/>
some sort of rite. He descended into the gully;<lb/>
for the fascination of all that silver, with its potential<lb/>
power, survived alone outside of himself. He picked<lb/>
up the belt with the revolver, that was lying there, and<lb/>
buckled it round his waist. The cord of silence could<lb/>
never snap on the island. It must let him fall and<lb/>
sink into the sea, he thought. And sink! He was looking<lb/>
at the loose earth covering the treasure. In the sea!<lb/>
His aspect was that of a somnambulist. He lowered<lb/>
himself down on his knees slowly and went on grubbing<lb/>
with his fingers with industrious patience till he uncovered<lb/>
one of the boxes. Without a pause, as if doing<lb/>
some work done many times before, he slit it open and<lb/>
took four ingots, which he put in his pockets. He<lb/>
covered up the exposed box again and step by step<lb/>


<pb n="500"/>

came out of the gully. The bushes closed after him<lb/>
with a swish.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was on the third day of his solitude that he had<lb/>
dragged the dinghy near the water with an idea of rowing<lb/>
away somewhere, but had desisted partly at the<lb/>
whisper of lingering hope that Nostromo would return,<lb/>
partly from conviction of utter uselessness of all effort.<lb/>
Now she wanted only a slight shove to be set afloat.<lb/>
He had eaten a little every day after the first, and<lb/>
had some muscular strength left yet. Taking up the<lb/>
oars slowly, he pulled away from the cliff of the Great<lb/>
Isabel, that stood behind him warm with sunshine,<lb/>
as if with the heat of life, bathed in a rich light from<lb/>
head to foot as if in a radiance of hope and joy. He<lb/>
pulled straight towards the setting sun. When the gulf<lb/>
had grown dark, he ceased rowing and flung the sculls<lb/>
in. The hollow clatter they made in falling was the<lb/>
loudest noise he had ever heard in his life. It was a<lb/>
revelation. It seemed to recall him from far away,<lb/>
Actually the thought, "Perhaps I may sleep to-night,"<lb/>
passed through his mind. But he did not believe it.<lb/>
He believed in nothing; and he remained sitting on the<lb/>
thwart.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The dawn from behind the mountains put a gleam<lb/>
into his unwinking eyes. After a clear daybreak the<lb/>
sun appeared splendidly above the peaks of the range.<lb/>
The great gulf burst into a glitter all around the boat;<lb/>
and in this glory of merciless solitude the silence appeared<lb/>
again before him, stretched taut like a dark,<lb/>
thin string.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His eyes looked at it while, without haste, he shifted<lb/>
his seat from the thwart to the gunwale. They looked<lb/>
at it fixedly, while his hand, feeling about his waist,<lb/>
unbuttoned the flap of the leather case, drew the revolver,<lb/>
cocked it, brought it forward pointing at his<lb/>


<pb n="501"/>

breast, pulled the trigger, and, with convulsive force,<lb/>
sent the still-smoking weapon hurtling through the air.<lb/>
His eyes looked at it while he fell forward and hung<lb/>
with his breast on the gunwale and the fingers of his<lb/>
right hand hooked under the thwart. They looked &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is done," he stammered out, in a sudden flow of<lb/>
blood. His last thought was: "I wonder how that<lb/>
Capataz died." The stiffness of the fingers relaxed,<lb/>
and the lover of Antonia Avellanos rolled overboard<lb/>
without having heard the cord of silence snap in the<lb/>
solitude of the Placid Gulf, whose glittering surface<lb/>
remained untroubled by the fall of his body.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A victim of the disillusioned weariness which is the<lb/>
retribution meted out to intellectual audacity, the brilliant<lb/>
Don Martin Decoud, weighted by the bars of San<lb/>
Tom&eacute; silver, disappeared without a trace, swallowed<lb/>
up in the immense indifference of things. His sleepless,<lb/>
crouching figure was gone from the side of the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; silver; and for a time the spirits of good and<lb/>
evil that hover near every concealed treasure of the<lb/>
earth might have thought that this one had been forgotten<lb/>
by all mankind. Then, after a few days, another<lb/>
form appeared striding away from the setting<lb/>
sun to sit motionless and awake in the narrow black<lb/>
gully all through the night, in nearly the same pose, in<lb/>
the same place in which had sat that other sleepless man<lb/>
who had gone away for ever so quietly in a small boat,<lb/>
about the time of sunset. And the spirits of good and<lb/>
evil that hover about a forbidden treasure understood<lb/>
well that the silver of San Tom&eacute; was provided now with<lb/>
a faithful and lifelong slave.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The magnificent Capataz de Cargadores, victim of<lb/>
the disenchanted vanity which is the reward of audacious<lb/>
action, sat in the weary pose of a hunted outcast<lb/>
through a night of sleeplessness as tormenting as any<lb/>


<pb n="502"/>

known to Decoud, his companion in the most desperate<lb/>
affair of his life. And he wondered how Decoud had<lb/>
died. But he knew the part he had played himself.<lb/>
First a woman, then a man, abandoned both in their<lb/>
last extremity, for the sake of this accursed treasure.<lb/>
It was paid for by a soul lost and by a vanished life.<lb/>
The blank stillness of awe was succeeded by a gust of<lb/>
immense pride. There was no one in the world but<lb/>
Gian' Battista Fidanza, Capataz de Cargadores, the<lb/>
incorruptible and faithful Nostromo, to pay such a<lb/>
price.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He had made up his mind that nothing should be<lb/>
allowed now to rob him of his bargain. Nothing. Decoud<lb/>
had died. But how? That he was dead he had<lb/>
not a shadow of a doubt. But four ingots? . . .<lb/>
What for? Did he mean to come for more &mdash; some<lb/>
other time?<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The treasure was putting forth its latent power.<lb/>
It troubled the clear mind of the man who had paid<lb/>
the price. He was sure that Decoud was dead. The<lb/>
island seemed full of that whisper. Dead! Gone!<lb/>
And he caught himself listening for the swish of bushes<lb/>
and the splash of the footfalls in the bed of the brook.<lb/>
Dead! The talker, the novio of Do&ntilde;a Antonia!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ha!" he murmured, with his head on his knees,<lb/>
under the livid clouded dawn breaking over the liberated<lb/>
Sulaco and upon the gulf as gray as ashes. "It<lb/>
is to her that he will fly. To her that he will fly!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And four ingots! Did he take them in revenge, to<lb/>
cast a spell, like the angry woman who had prophesied<lb/>
remorse and failure, and yet had laid upon him the<lb/>
task of saving the children? Well, he had saved the<lb/>
children. He had defeated the spell of poverty and<lb/>
starvation. He had done it all alone &mdash; or perhaps<lb/>
helped by the devil. Who cared? He had done it,<lb/>


<pb n="503"/>

betrayed as he was, and saving by the same stroke the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mine, which appeared to him hateful and<lb/>
immense, lording it by its vast wealth over the valour,<lb/>
the toil, the fidelity of the poor, over war and peace,<lb/>
over the labours of the town, the sea, and the Campo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The sun lit up the sky behind the peaks of the Cordillera.<lb/>
The Capataz looked down for a time upon the<lb/>
fall of loose earth, stones, and smashed bushes, concealing<lb/>
the hiding-place of the silver.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I must grow rich very slowly," he meditated, aloud.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     SULACO outstripped Nostromo's prudence, growing<lb/>
rich swiftly on the hidden treasures of the earth, hovered<lb/>
over by the anxious spirits of good and evil, torn out<lb/>
by the labouring hands of the people. It was like a<lb/>
second youth, like a new life, full of promise, of unrest,<lb/>
of toil, scattering lavishly its wealth to the four corners<lb/>
of an excited world. Material changes swept along<lb/>
in the train of material interests. And other changes<lb/>
more subtle, outwardly unmarked, affected the minds<lb/>
and hearts of the workers. Captain Mitchell had gone<lb/>
home to live on his savings invested in the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
mine; and Dr. Monygham had grown older, with his<lb/>
head steel-grey and the unchanged expression of his<lb/>
face, living on the inexhaustible treasure of his devotion<lb/>
drawn upon in the secret of his heart like a store<lb/>
of unlawful wealth.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Inspector-General of State Hospitals (whose<lb/>
maintenance is a charge upon the Gould Concession),<lb/>
Official Adviser on Sanitation to the Municipality,<lb/>
Chief Medical Officer of the San Tom&eacute; Consolidated<lb/>
Mines (whose territory, containing gold, silver, copper,<lb/>
lead, cobalt, extends for miles along the foot-hills of<lb/>
the Cordillera), had felt poverty-stricken, miserable,<lb/>
and starved during the prolonged, second visit the<lb/>
Goulds paid to Europe and the United States of America.<lb/>
Intimate of the casa, proved friend, a bachelor<lb/>
without ties and without establishment (except of<lb/>
the professional sort), he had been asked to take up his<lb/>
quarters in the Gould house. In the eleven months<lb/>




<pb n="505"/>

of their absence the familiar rooms, recalling at every<lb/>
glance the woman to whom he had given all his loyalty,<lb/>
had grown intolerable. As the day approached for<lb/>
the arrival of the mail boat <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi> (the latest addition<lb/>
to the O. S. N. Co.'s splendid fleet), the doctor hobbled<lb/>
about more vivaciously, snapped more sardonically<lb/>
at simple and gentle out of sheer nervousness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He packed up his modest trunk with speed, with<lb/>
fury, with enthusiasm, and saw it carried out past the<lb/>
old porter at the gate of the Casa Gould with delight,<lb/>
with intoxication; then, as the hour approached, sitting<lb/>
alone in the great landau behind the white mules, a<lb/>
little sideways, his drawn-in face positively venomous<lb/>
with the effort of self-control, and holding a pair of new<lb/>
gloves in his left hand, he drove to the harbour.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His heart dilated within him so, when he saw the<lb/>
Goulds on the deck of the <hi rend="italic">Hermes</hi>, that his greetings<lb/>
were reduced to a casual mutter. Driving back to<lb/>
town, all three were silent. And in the patio the doctor,<lb/>
in a more natural manner, said &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I'll leave you now to yourselves. I'll call to-morrow<lb/>
if I may?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Come to lunch, dear Dr. Monygham, and come<lb/>
early," said Mrs. Gould, in her travelling dress and her<lb/>
veil down, turning to look at him at the foot of the<lb/>
stairs; while at the top of the flight the Madonna, in<lb/>
blue robes and the Child on her arm, seemed to welcome<lb/>
her with an aspect of pitying tenderness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Don't expect to find me at home," Charles Gould<lb/>
warned him. "I'll be off early to the mine."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     After lunch, Do&ntilde;a Emilia and the se&ntilde;or doctor came<lb/>
slowly through the inner gateway of the patio. The<lb/>
large gardens of the Casa Gould, surrounded by high<lb/>
walls, and the red-tile slopes of neighbouring roofs, lay<lb/>
open before them, with masses of shade under the trees<lb/>


<pb n="506"/>

and level surfaces of sunlight upon the lawns. A triple<lb/>
row of old orange trees surrounded the whole. Barefooted,<lb/>
brown gardeners, in snowy white shirts and wide<lb/>
calzoneras, dotted the grounds, squatting over flower-<lb/>
beds, passing between the trees, dragging slender India-<lb/>
rubber tubes across the gravel of the paths; and the<lb/>
fine jets of water crossed each other in graceful curves,<lb/>
sparkling in the sunshine with a slight pattering noise<lb/>
upon the bushes, and an effect of showered diamonds<lb/>
upon the grass.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Do&ntilde;a Emilia, holding up the train of a clear dress,<lb/>
walked by the side of Dr. Monygham, in a longish<lb/>
black coat and severe black bow on an immaculate shirt-<lb/>
front. Under a shady clump of trees, where stood scattered<lb/>
little tables and wicker easy-chairs, Mrs. Gould<lb/>
sat down in a low and ample seat.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Don't go yet," she said to Dr. Monygham, who was<lb/>
unable to tear himself away from the spot. His chin<lb/>
nestling within the points of his collar, he devoured her<lb/>
stealthily with his eyes, which, luckily, were round and<lb/>
hard like clouded marbles, and incapable of disclosing<lb/>
his sentiments. His pitying emotion at the marks of<lb/>
time upon the face of that woman, the air of frailty<lb/>
and weary fatigue that had settled upon the eyes and<lb/>
temples of the "Never-tired Se&ntilde;ora" (as Don P&eacute;p&eacute;<lb/>
years ago used to call her with admiration), touched<lb/>
him almost to tears. "Don't go yet. To-day is all<lb/>
my own," Mrs. Gould urged, gently. "We are not back<lb/>
yet officially. No one will come. It's only to-morrow<lb/>
that the windows of the Casa Gould are to be lit up for<lb/>
a reception."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor dropped into a chair.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Giving a tertulia?" he said, with a detached air.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A simple greeting for all the kind friends who care to<lb/>
come."<lb/>


<pb n="507"/>

</p>

<p>     "And only to-morrow?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. Charles would be tired out after a day at the<lb/>
mine, and so I &mdash; It would be good to have him to<lb/>
myself for one evening on our return to this house I love.<lb/>
It has seen all my life."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, yes!" snarled the doctor, suddenly. "Women<lb/>
count time from the marriage feast. Didn't you live a<lb/>
little before?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes; but what is there to remember? There were no<lb/>
cares."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould sighed. And as two friends, after a long<lb/>
separation, will revert to the most agitated period of<lb/>
their lives, they began to talk of the Sulaco Revolution.<lb/>
It seemed strange to Mrs. Gould that people who had<lb/>
taken part in it seemed to forget its memory and its<lb/>
lesson.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And yet," struck in the doctor, "we who played our<lb/>
part in it had our reward. Don P&eacute;p&eacute;, though superannuated,<lb/>
still can sit a horse. Barrios is drinking himself<lb/>
to death in jovial company away somewhere on his<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">fundacion</hi> beyond the Bolson de Tonoro. And the heroic<lb/>
Father Rom&agrave;n &mdash; I imagine the old padre blowing up<lb/>
systematically the San Tom&eacute; mine, uttering a pious<lb/>
exclamation at every bang, and taking handfuls of snuff<lb/>
between the explosions &mdash; the heroic Padre Rom&agrave;n says<lb/>
that he is not afraid of the harm Holroyd's missionaries<lb/>
can do to his flock, as long as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> is alive."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould shuddered a little at the allusion to the<lb/>
destruction that had come so near to the San Tom&eacute; mine.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah, but you, dear friend?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I did the work I was fit for."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You faced the most cruel dangers of all. Something<lb/>
more than death."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, Mrs. Gould! Only death &mdash; by hanging. And<lb/>
I am rewarded beyond my deserts."<lb/>


<pb n="508"/>

</p>

<p>     Noticing Mrs. Gould's gaze fixed upon him, he dropped<lb/>
his eyes.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I've made my career &mdash; as you see," said the Inspector-General<lb/>
of State Hospitals, taking up lightly<lb/>
the lapels of his superfine black coat. The doctor's<lb/>
self-respect marked inwardly by the almost complete<lb/>
disappearance from his dreams of Father Beron appeared<lb/>
visibly in what, by contrast with former carelessness,<lb/>
seemed an immoderate cult of personal appearance.<lb/>
Carried out within severe limits of form and<lb/>
colour, and in perpetual freshness, this change of apparel<lb/>
gave to Dr. Monygham an air at the same time<lb/>
professional and festive; while his gait and the unchanged<lb/>
crabbed character of his face acquired from it a<lb/>
startling force of incongruity.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes," he went on. "We all had our rewards &mdash; the<lb/>
engineer-in-chief, Captain Mitchell &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "We saw him," interrupted Mrs. Gould, in her<lb/>
charming voice. "The poor dear man came up from<lb/>
the country on purpose to call on us in our hotel in<lb/>
London. He comported himself with great dignity,<lb/>
but I fancy he regrets Sulaco. He rambled feebly<lb/>
about 'historical events' till I felt I could have a cry."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "H'm," grunted the doctor; "getting old, I suppose.<lb/>
Even Nostromo is getting older &mdash; though he is not<lb/>
changed. And, speaking of that fellow, I wanted to<lb/>
tell you something &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     For some time the house had been full of murmurs, of<lb/>
agitation. Suddenly the two gardeners, busy with rose<lb/>
trees at the side of the garden arch, fell upon their knees<lb/>
with bowed heads on the passage of Antonia Avellanos,<lb/>
who appeared walking beside her uncle.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Invested with the red hat after a short visit to Rome,<lb/>
where he had been invited by the Propaganda, Father<lb/>
Corbel&agrave;n, missionary to the wild Indians, conspirator,<lb/>


<pb n="509"/>

friend and patron of Hernandez the robber, advanced<lb/>
with big, slow strides, gaunt and leaning forward, with<lb/>
his powerful hands clasped behind his back. The first<lb/>
Cardinal-Archbishop of Sulaco had preserved his fanatical<lb/>
and morose air; the aspect of a chaplain of bandits.<lb/>
It was believed that his unexpected elevation to the<lb/>
purple was a counter-move to the Protestant invasion<lb/>
of Sulaco organized by the Holroyd Missionary Fund.<lb/>
Antonia, the beauty of her face as if a little blurred,<lb/>
her figure slightly fuller, advanced with her light walk<lb/>
and her high serenity, smiling from a distance at Mrs.<lb/>
Gould. She had brought her uncle over to see dear<lb/>
Emilia, without ceremony, just for a moment before the<lb/>
siesta.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     When all were seated again, Dr. Monygham, who had<lb/>
come to dislike heartily everybody who approached<lb/>
Mrs. Gould with any intimacy, kept aside, pretending<lb/>
to be lost in profound meditation. A louder phrase<lb/>
of Antonia made him lift his head.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "How can we abandon, groaning under oppression,<lb/>
those who have been our countrymen only a few years<lb/>
ago, who <hi rend="italic">are</hi> our countrymen now?" Miss Avellanos<lb/>
was saying.  "How can we remain blind, and deaf<lb/>
without pity to the cruel wrongs suffered by our<lb/>
brothers? There is a remedy."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Annex the rest of Costaguana to the order and prosperity<lb/>
of Sulaco," snapped the doctor. "There is no<lb/>
other remedy."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am convinced, se&ntilde;or doctor," Antonia said, with<lb/>
the earnest calm of invincible resolution, "that this<lb/>
was from the first poor Martin's intention."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes, but the material interests will not let you<lb/>
jeopardize their development for a mere idea of pity<lb/>
and justice," the doctor muttered grumpily. "And<lb/>
it is just as well perhaps."<lb/>


<pb n="510"/>

</p>

<p>     The Cardinal-Archbishop straightened up his gaunt,<lb/>
bony frame.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "We have worked for them; we have made them,<lb/>
these material interests of the foreigners," the last of<lb/>
the Corbel&agrave;ns uttered in a deep, denunciatory tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And without them you are nothing," cried the doctor<lb/>
from the distance. "They will not let you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Let them beware, then, lest the people, prevented<lb/>
from their aspirations, should rise and claim their share<lb/>
of the wealth and their share of the power," the popular<lb/>
Cardinal-Archbishop of Sulaco declared, significantly,<lb/>
menacingly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A silence ensued, during which his Eminence stared,<lb/>
frowning at the ground, and Antonia, graceful and rigid<lb/>
in her chair, breathed calmly in the strength of her convictions.<lb/>
Then the conversation took a social turn,<lb/>
touching on the visit of the Goulds to Europe. The<lb/>
Cardinal-Archbishop, when in Rome, had suffered from<lb/>
neuralgia in the head all the time. It was the climate<lb/>
&mdash; the bad air.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     When uncle and niece had gone away, with the servants<lb/>
again falling on their knees, and the old porter,<lb/>
who had known Henry Gould, almost totally blind<lb/>
and impotent now, creeping up to kiss his Eminence's<lb/>
extended hand, Dr. Monygham, looking after them,<lb/>
pronounced the one word &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Incorrigible!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould, with a look upwards, dropped wearily<lb/>
on her lap her white hands flashing with the gold and<lb/>
stones of many rings.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Conspiring. Yes!" said the doctor. "The last of<lb/>
the Avellanos and the last of the Corbel&agrave;ns are conspiring<lb/>
with the refugees from Sta. Marta that flock<lb/>
here after every revolution. The Caf&eacute; Lambroso at<lb/>
the corner of the Plaza is full of them; you can hear<lb/>


<pb n="511"/>

their chatter across the street like the noise of a parrot-<lb/>
house. They are conspiring for the invasion of Costaguana.<lb/>
And do you know where they go for strength,<lb/>
for the necessary force? To the secret societies amongst<lb/>
immigrants and natives, where Nostromo &mdash; I should<lb/>
say Captain Fidanza &mdash; is the great man. What gives<lb/>
him that position? Who can say? Genius? He has<lb/>
genius. He is greater with the populace than ever<lb/>
he was before. It is as if he had some secret power;<lb/>
some mysterious means to keep up his influence. He<lb/>
holds conferences with the Archbishop, as in those old<lb/>
days which you and I remember. Barrios is useless.<lb/>
But for a military head they have the pious Hernandez.<lb/>
And they may raise the country with the new cry of<lb/>
the wealth for the people."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Will there be never any peace? Will there be no<lb/>
rest?" Mrs. Gould whispered. "I thought that<lb/>
we &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No!" interrupted the doctor. "There is no peace<lb/>
and no rest in the development of material interests.<lb/>
They have their law, and their justice. But it is founded<lb/>
on expediency, and is inhuman; it is without rectitude,<lb/>
without the continuity and the force that can be found<lb/>
only in a moral principle. Mrs. Gould, the time approaches<lb/>
when all that the Gould Concession stands<lb/>
for shall weigh as heavily upon the people as the barbarism,<lb/>
cruelty, and misrule of a few years back."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "How can you say that, Dr. Monygham?" she cried<lb/>
out, as if hurt in the most sensitive place of her soul.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I can say what is true," the doctor insisted, obstinately.<lb/>
"It'll weigh as heavily, and provoke resentment,<lb/>
bloodshed, and vengeance, because the men have<lb/>
grown different. Do you think that now the mine<lb/>
would march upon the town to save their Se&ntilde;or Administrador?<lb/>
Do you think that?"<lb/>


<pb n="512"/>

</p>

<p>     She pressed the backs of her entwined hands on her<lb/>
eyes and murmured hopelessly &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Is it this we have worked for, then?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor lowered his head. He could follow her<lb/>
silent thought. Was it for this that her life had been<lb/>
robbed of all the intimate felicities of daily affection<lb/>
which her tenderness needed as the human body needs<lb/>
air to breathe? And the doctor, indignant with Charles<lb/>
Gould's blindness, hastened to change the conversation.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is about Nostromo that I wanted to talk to you.<lb/>
Ah! that fellow has some continuity and force. Nothing<lb/>
will put an end to him. But never mind that.<lb/>
There's something inexplicable going on &mdash; or perhaps<lb/>
only too easy to explain. You know, Linda is practically<lb/>
the lighthouse keeper of the Great Isabel light.<lb/>
The Garibaldino is too old now. His part is to clean<lb/>
the lamps and to cook in the house; but he can't get<lb/>
up the stairs any longer. The black-eyed Linda sleeps<lb/>
all day and watches the light all night. Not all day,<lb/>
though. She is up towards five in the afternoon, when<lb/>
our Nostromo, whenever he is in harbour with his<lb/>
schooner, comes out on his courting visit, pulling in a<lb/>
small boat."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Aren't they married yet?" Mrs. Gould asked.<lb/>
"The mother wished it, as far as I can understand,<lb/>
while Linda was yet quite a child. When I had the<lb/>
girls with me for a year or so during the War of Separation,<lb/>
that extraordinary Linda used to declare quite<lb/>
simply that she was going to be Gian' Battista's wife."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "They are not married yet," said the doctor, curtly.<lb/>
"I have looked after them a little."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Thank you, dear Dr. Monygham," said Mrs.<lb/>
Gould; and under the shade of the big trees her little,<lb/>
even teeth gleamed in a youthful smile of gentle malice.<lb/>
"People don't know how really good you are. You<lb/>


<pb n="513"/>

will not let them know, as if on purpose to annoy me,<lb/>
who have put my faith in your good heart long ago."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor, with a lifting up of his upper lip, as<lb/>
though he were longing to bite, bowed stiffly in his chair.<lb/>
With the utter absorption of a man to whom love<lb/>
comes late, not as the most splendid of illusions, but<lb/>
like an enlightening and priceless misfortune, the sight<lb/>
of that woman (of whom he had been deprived for<lb/>
nearly a year) suggested ideas of adoration, of kissing<lb/>
the hem of her robe. And this excess of feeling translated<lb/>
itself naturally into an augmented grimness of<lb/>
speech.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am afraid of being overwhelmed by too much<lb/>
gratitude. However, these people interest me. I<lb/>
went out several times to the Great Isabel light to look<lb/>
after old Giorgio."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He did not tell Mrs. Gould that it was because he<lb/>
found there, in her absence, the relief of an atmosphere<lb/>
of congenial sentiment in old Giorgio's austere admiration<lb/>
for the "English signora &mdash; the benefactress";<lb/>
in black-eyed Linda's voluble, torrential, passionate<lb/>
affection for "our Do&ntilde;a Emilia &mdash; that angel"; in the<lb/>
white-throated, fair Giselle's adoring upward turn of<lb/>
the eyes, which then glided towards him with a sidelong,<lb/>
half-arch, half-candid glance, which made the doctor<lb/>
exclaim to himself mentally, "If I weren't what I am,<lb/>
old and ugly, I would think the minx is making eyes<lb/>
at me. And perhaps she is. I dare say she would<lb/>
make eyes at anybody." Dr. Monygham said nothing<lb/>
of this to Mrs. Gould, the providence of the Viola<lb/>
family, but reverted to what he called "our great<lb/>
Nostromo."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What I wanted to tell you is this: Our great Nostromo<lb/>
did not take much notice of the old man and<lb/>
the children for some years. It's true, too, that he<lb/>


<pb n="514"/>

was away on his coasting voyages certainly ten months<lb/>
out of the twelve. He was making his fortune, as he<lb/>
told Captain Mitchell once. He seems to have done<lb/>
uncommonly well. It was only to be expected. He is<lb/>
a man full of resource, full of confidence in himself,<lb/>
ready to take chances and risks of every sort. I remember<lb/>
being in Mitchell's office one day, when he<lb/>
came in with that calm, grave air he always carries<lb/>
everywhere. He had been away trading in the Gulf of<lb/>
California, he said, looking straight past us at the wall,<lb/>
as his manner is, and was glad to see on his return<lb/>
that a lighthouse was being built on the cliff of the<lb/>
Great Isabel. Very glad, he repeated. Mitchell explained<lb/>
that it was the O. S. N. Co. who was building<lb/>
it, for the convenience of the mail service, on his own<lb/>
advice. Captain Fidanza was good enough to say that<lb/>
it was excellent advice. I remember him twisting up<lb/>
his moustaches and looking all round the cornice of the<lb/>
room before he proposed that old Giorgio should be<lb/>
made the keeper of that light."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I heard of this. I was consulted at the time," Mrs.<lb/>
Gould said. "I doubted whether it would be good for<lb/>
these girls to be shut up on that island as if in a prison."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The proposal fell in with the old Garibaldino's<lb/>
humour. As to Linda, any place was lovely and delightful<lb/>
enough for her as long as it was Nostromo's suggestion.<lb/>
She could wait for her Gian' Battista's good<lb/>
pleasure there as well as anywhere else. My opinion<lb/>
is that she was always in love with that incorruptible<lb/>
Capataz. Moreover, both father and sister were<lb/>
anxious to get Giselle away from the attentions of a<lb/>
certain Ramirez."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah!" said Mrs. Gould, interested. "Ramirez?<lb/>
What sort of man is that?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Just a mozo of the town. His father was a Cargador.<lb/>


<pb n="515"/>

As a lanky boy he ran about the wharf in rags,<lb/>
till Nostromo took him up and made a man of him.<lb/>
When he got a little older, he put him into a lighter<lb/>
and very soon gave him charge of the No. 3 boat &mdash; the<lb/>
boat which took the silver away, Mrs. Gould. Nostromo<lb/>
selected that lighter for the work because she was<lb/>
the best sailing and the strongest boat of all the Company's<lb/>
fleet. Young Ramirez was one of the five Cargadores<lb/>
entrusted with the removal of the treasure<lb/>
from the Custom House on that famous night. As the<lb/>
boat he had charge of was sunk, Nostromo, on leaving<lb/>
the Company's service, recommended him to Captain<lb/>
Mitchell for his successor. He had trained him in the<lb/>
routine of work perfectly, and thus Mr. Ramirez, from<lb/>
a starving waif, becomes a man and the Capataz of the<lb/>
Sulaco Cargadores."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Thanks to Nostromo," said Mrs. Gould, with warm<lb/>
approval.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Thanks to Nostromo," repeated Dr. Monygham.<lb/>
"Upon my word, the fellow's power frightens me when<lb/>
I think of it. That our poor old Mitchell was only too<lb/>
glad to appoint somebody trained to the work, who<lb/>
saved him trouble, is not surprising. What is wonderful<lb/>
is the fact that the Sulaco Cargadores accepted<lb/>
Ramirez for their chief, simply because such was Nostromo's<lb/>
good pleasure. Of course, he is not a second<lb/>
Nostromo, as he fondly imagined he would be; but still,<lb/>
the position was brilliant enough. It emboldened him<lb/>
to make up to Giselle Viola, who, you know, is the<lb/>
recognized beauty of the town. The old Garibaldino,<lb/>
however, took a violent dislike to him. I don't know<lb/>
why. Perhaps because he was not a model of perfection<lb/>
like his Gian' Battista, the incarnation of the<lb/>
courage, the fidelity, the honour of 'the people.' Signor<lb/>
Viola does not think much of Sulaco natives. Both of<lb/>


<pb n="516"/>

them, the old Spartan and that white-faced Linda,<lb/>
with her red mouth and coal-black eyes, were looking<lb/>
rather fiercely after the fair one. Ramirez was warned<lb/>
off. Father Viola, I am told, threatened him with his<lb/>
gun once."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "But what of Giselle herself?" asked Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She's a bit of a flirt, I believe," said the doctor. "I<lb/>
don't think she cared much one way or another. Of<lb/>
course she likes men's attentions. Ramirez was not<lb/>
the only one, let me tell you, Mrs. Gould. There was<lb/>
one engineer, at least, on the railway staff who got<lb/>
warned off with a gun, too. Old Viola does not allow<lb/>
any trifling with his honour. He has grown uneasy<lb/>
and suspicious since his wife died. He was very pleased<lb/>
to remove his youngest girl away from the town. But<lb/>
look what happens, Mrs. Gould. Ramirez, the honest,<lb/>
lovelorn swain, is forbidden the island. Very well.<lb/>
He respects the prohibition, but naturally turns his<lb/>
eyes frequently towards the Great Isabel. It seems as<lb/>
though he had been in the habit of gazing late at night<lb/>
upon the light. And during these sentimental vigils<lb/>
he discovers that Nostromo, Captain Fidanza that is,<lb/>
returns very late from his visits to the Violas. As<lb/>
late as midnight at times."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor paused and stared meaningly at Mrs.<lb/>
Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. But I don't understand," she began, looking<lb/>
puzzled.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Now comes the strange part," went on Dr. Monygham.<lb/>
"Viola, who is king on his island, will allow no<lb/>
visitor on it after dark. Even Captain Fidanza has<lb/>
got to leave after sunset, when Linda has gone up to<lb/>
tend the light. And Nostromo goes away obediently.<lb/>
But what happens afterwards? What does he do in the<lb/>
gulf between half-past six and midnight? He has been<lb/>


<pb n="517"/>

seen more than once at that late hour pulling quietly<lb/>
into the harbour. Ramirez is devoured by jealousy.<lb/>
He dared not approach old Viola; but he plucked up<lb/>
courage to rail at Linda about it on Sunday morning as<lb/>
she came on the mainland to hear mass and visit her<lb/>
mother's grave. There was a scene on the wharf, which,<lb/>
as a matter of fact, I witnessed. It was early morning.<lb/>
He must have been waiting for her on purpose. I was<lb/>
there by the merest chance, having been called to an<lb/>
urgent consultation by the doctor of the German gunboat<lb/>
in the harbour. She poured wrath, scorn, and<lb/>
flame upon Ramirez, who seemed out of his mind. It<lb/>
was a strange sight, Mrs. Gould: the long jetty, with<lb/>
this raving Cargador in his crimson sash and the girl<lb/>
all in black, at the end; the early Sunday morning<lb/>
quiet of the harbour in the shade of the mountains;<lb/>
nothing but a canoe or two moving between the ships<lb/>
at anchor, and the German gunboat's gig coming to<lb/>
take me off. Linda passed me within a foot. I noticed<lb/>
her wild eyes. I called out to her. She never heard<lb/>
me. She never saw me. But I looked at her face. It<lb/>
was awful in its anger and wretchedness."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould sat up, opening her eyes very wide.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What do you mean, Dr. Monygham? Do you<lb/>
mean to say that you suspect the younger sister?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Quien sabe!</hi> Who can tell?" said the doctor,<lb/>
shrugging his shoulders like a born Costaguanero.<lb/>
"Ramirez came up to me on the wharf. He reeled &mdash; he<lb/>
looked insane. He took his head into his hands. He<lb/>
had to talk to someone &mdash; simply had to. Of course<lb/>
for all his mad state he recognized me. People know<lb/>
me well here. I have lived too long amongst them to<lb/>
be anything else but the evil-eyed doctor, who can cure<lb/>
all the ills of the flesh, and bring bad luck by a glance.<lb/>
He came up to me. He tried to be calm. He tried<lb/>


<pb n="518"/>

to make it out that he wanted merely to warn me<lb/>
against Nostromo. It seems that Captain Fidanza at<lb/>
some secret meeting or other had mentioned me as the<lb/>
worst despiser of all the poor &mdash; of the people. It's very<lb/>
possible. He honours me with his undying dislike.<lb/>
And a word from the great Fidanza may be quite enough<lb/>
to send some fool's knife into my back. The Sanitary<lb/>
Commission I preside over is not in favour with the<lb/>
populace. 'Beware of him, se&ntilde;or doctor. Destroy<lb/>
him, se&ntilde;or doctor,' Ramirez hissed right into my face.<lb/>
And then he broke out. 'That man,' he spluttered,<lb/>
'has cast a spell upon both these girls.' As to himself,<lb/>
he had said too much. He must run away now &mdash; run<lb/>
away and hide somewhere. He moaned tenderly about<lb/>
Giselle, and then called her names that cannot be re-@@@<lb/>
peated. If he thought she could be made to love him<lb/>
by any means, he would carry her off from the island.<lb/>
Off into the woods. But it was no good. . . . He<lb/>
strode away, flourishing his arms above his head. Then<lb/>
I noticed an old negro, who had been sitting behind a<lb/>
pile of cases, fishing from the wharf. He wound up his<lb/>
lines and slunk away at once. But he must have heard<lb/>
something, and must have talked, too, because some of<lb/>
the old Garibaldino's railway friends, I suppose, warned<lb/>
him against Ramirez. At any rate, the father has been<lb/>
warned. But Ramirez has disappeared from the town."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I feel I have a duty towards these girls," said Mrs.<lb/>
Gould, uneasily. "Is Nostromo in Sulaco now?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He is, since last Sunday."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He ought to be spoken to &mdash; at once."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Who will dare speak to him? Even the love-mad<lb/>
Ramirez runs away from the mere shadow of Captain<lb/>
Fidanza."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I can. I will," Mrs. Gould declared. "A word<lb/>
will be enough for a man like Nostromo."<lb/>


<pb n="519"/>

</p>

<p>     The doctor smiled sourly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He must end this situation which lends itself to &mdash;<lb/>
I can't believe it of that child," pursued Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He's very attractive," muttered the doctor,<lb/>
gloomily.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He'll see it, I am sure. He must put an end to all<lb/>
this by marrying Linda at once," pronounced the first<lb/>
lady of Sulaco with immense decision.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Through the garden gate emerged Basilio, grown fat<lb/>
and sleek, with an elderly hairless face, wrinkles at the<lb/>
corners of his eyes, and his jet-black, coarse hair plastered<lb/>
down smoothly. Stooping carefully behind an<lb/>
ornamental clump of bushes, he put down with precaution<lb/>
a small child he had been carrying on his shoulder<lb/>
&mdash; his own and Leonarda's last born. The pouting,<lb/>
spoiled Camerista and the head mozo of the Casa Gould<lb/>
had been married for some years now.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He remained squatting on his heels for a time, gazing<lb/>
fondly at his offspring, which returned his stare with<lb/>
imperturbable gravity; then, solemn and respectable,<lb/>
walked down the path.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What is it, Basilio?" asked Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A telephone came through from the office of the<lb/>
mine. The master remains to sleep at the mountain<lb/>
to-night."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Dr. Monygham had got up and stood looking away.<lb/>
A profound silence reigned for a time under the shade<lb/>
of the biggest trees in the lovely gardens of the Casa<lb/>
Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Very well, Basilio," said Mrs. Gould. She watched<lb/>
him walk away along the path, step aside behind the<lb/>
flowering bush, and reappear with the child seated on<lb/>
his shoulder. He passed through the gateway between<lb/>
the garden and the patio with measured steps, careful<lb/>
of his light burden.<lb/>


<pb n="520"/>

</p>

<p>     The doctor, with his back to Mrs. Gould, contemplated<lb/>
a flower-bed away in the sunshine. People<lb/>
believed him scornful and soured. The truth of his<lb/>
nature consisted in his capacity for passion and in the<lb/>
sensitiveness of his temperament. What he lacked<lb/>
was the polished callousness of men of the world, the<lb/>
callousness from which springs an easy tolerance for<lb/>
oneself and others; the tolerance wide as poles asunder<lb/>
from true sympathy and human compassion. This<lb/>
want of callousness accounted for his sardonic turn<lb/>
of mind and his biting speeches.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In profound silence, and glaring viciously at the brilliant<lb/>
flower-bed, Dr. Monygham poured mental imprecations<lb/>
on Charles Gould's head. Behind him the<lb/>
immobility of Mrs. Gould added to the grace of her<lb/>
seated figure the charm of art, of an attitude caught<lb/>
and interpreted for ever. Turning abruptly, the doctor<lb/>
took his leave.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould leaned back in the shade of the big trees<lb/>
planted in a circle. She leaned back with her eyes<lb/>
closed and her white hands lying idle on the arms of<lb/>
her seat. The half-light under the thick mass of leaves<lb/>
brought out the youthful prettiness of her face; made<lb/>
the clear, light fabrics and white lace of her dress appear<lb/>
luminous. Small and dainty, as if radiating a light<lb/>
of her own in the deep shade of the interlaced boughs,<lb/>
she resembled a good fairy, weary with a long career<lb/>
of well-doing, touched by the withering suspicion of<lb/>
the uselessness of her labours, the powerlessness of her<lb/>
magic.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Had anybody asked her of what she was thinking,<lb/>
alone in the garden of the Casa, with her husband at the<lb/>
mine and the house closed to the street like an empty<lb/>
dwelling, her frankness would have had to evade the<lb/>
question. It had come into her mind that for life to<lb/>


<pb n="521"/>

be large and full, it must contain the care of the past<lb/>
and of the future in every passing moment of the present.<lb/>
Our daily work must be done to the glory of the<lb/>
dead, and for the good of those who come after. She<lb/>
thought that, and sighed without opening her eyes &mdash;<lb/>
without moving at all. Mrs. Gould's face became set and<lb/>
rigid for a second, as if to receive, without flinching, a<lb/>
great wave of loneliness that swept over her head. And<lb/>
it came into her mind, too, that no one would ever ask<lb/>
her with solicitude what she was thinking of. No one.<lb/>
No one, but perhaps the man who had just gone away.<lb/>
No; no one who could be answered with careless sincerity<lb/>
in the ideal perfection of confidence.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The word "incorrigible" &mdash; a word lately pronounced<lb/>
by Dr. Monygham &mdash; floated into her still and sad immobility.<lb/>
Incorrigible in his devotion to the great<lb/>
silver mine was the Se&ntilde;or Administrador! Incorrigible<lb/>
in his hard, determined service of the material interests<lb/>
to which he had pinned his faith in the triumph of order<lb/>
and justice. Poor boy! She had a clear vision of the<lb/>
grey hairs on his temples. He was perfect &mdash; perfect.<lb/>
What more could she have expected? It was a colossal<lb/>
and lasting success; and love was only a short moment<lb/>
of forgetfulness, a short intoxication, whose delight<lb/>
one remembered with a sense of sadness, as if it<lb/>
had been a deep grief lived through. There was something<lb/>
inherent in the necessities of successful action<lb/>
which carried with it the moral degradation of the idea.<lb/>
She saw the San Tom&eacute; mountain hanging over the<lb/>
Campo, over the whole land, feared, hated, wealthy;<lb/>
more soulless than any tyrant, more pitiless and autocratic<lb/>
than the worst Government; ready to crush<lb/>
innumerable lives in the expansion of its greatness.<lb/>
He did not see it. He could not see it. It was not his<lb/>
fault. He was perfect, perfect; but she would never<lb/>


<pb n="522"/>

have him to herself. Never; not for one short hour<lb/>
altogether to herself in this old Spanish house she loved<lb/>
so well! Incorrigible, the last of the Corbel&agrave;ns, the<lb/>
last of the Avellanos, the doctor had said; but she saw<lb/>
clearly the San Tom&eacute; mine possessing, consuming,<lb/>
burning up the life of the last of the Costaguana Goulds;<lb/>
mastering the energetic spirit of the son as it had mastered<lb/>
the lamentable weakness of the father. A terrible<lb/>
success for the last of the Goulds. The last! She had<lb/>
hoped for a long, long time, that perhaps &mdash; But no!<lb/>
There were to be no more. An immense desolation, the<lb/>
dread of her own continued life, descended upon the first<lb/>
lady of Sulaco. With a prophetic vision she saw herself<lb/>
surviving alone the degradation of her young ideal of<lb/>
life, of love, of work &mdash; all alone in the Treasure House<lb/>
of the World. The profound, blind, suffering expression<lb/>
of a painful dream settled on her face with its closed<lb/>
eyes. In the indistinct voice of an unlucky sleeper.<lb/>
lying passive in the grip of a merciless nightmare, she<lb/>
stammered out aimlessly the words &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Material interest."<lb/>
</p>

<pb n="523"/>


<p>     NOSTROMO had been growing rich very slowly. It was<lb/>
an effect of his prudence. He could command himself<lb/>
even when thrown off his balance. And to become the<lb/>
slave of a treasure with full self-knowledge is an occurrence<lb/>
rare and mentally disturbing. But it was also<lb/>
in a great part because of the difficulty of converting<lb/>
it into a form in which it could become available. The<lb/>
mere act of getting it away from the island piecemeal,<lb/>
little by little, was surrounded by difficulties, by the<lb/>
dangers of imminent detection. He had to visit the<lb/>
Great Isabel in secret, between his voyages along the<lb/>
coast, which were the ostensible source of his fortune.<lb/>
The crew of his own schooner were to be feared as if<lb/>
they had been spies upon their dreaded captain. He<lb/>
did not dare stay too long in port. When his coaster<lb/>
was unloaded, he hurried away on another trip, for he<lb/>
feared arousing suspicion even by a day's delay.<lb/>
Sometimes during a week's stay, or more, he could only<lb/>
manage one visit to the treasure. And that was all. A<lb/>
couple of ingots. He suffered through his fears as much<lb/>
as through his prudence. To do things by stealth humiliated<lb/>
him. And he suffered most from the concentration<lb/>
of his thought upon the treasure.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A transgression, a crime, entering a man's existence,<lb/>
eats it up like a malignant growth, consumes it like a<lb/>
fever. Nostromo had lost his peace; the genuineness of<lb/>
all his qualities was destroyed. He felt it himself,<lb/>
and often cursed the silver of San Tom&eacute;. His courage,<lb/>
his magnificence, his leisure, his work, everything was<lb/>




<pb n="524"/>

as before, only everything was a sham. But the treasure<lb/>
was real. He clung to it with a more tenacious,<lb/>
mental grip. But he hated the feel of the ingots.<lb/>
Sometimes, after putting away a couple of them in his<lb/>
cabin &mdash; the fruit of a secret night expedition to the<lb/>
Great Isabel &mdash; he would look fixedly at his fingers, as if<lb/>
surprised they had left no stain on his skin.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He had found means of disposing of the silver bars in<lb/>
distant ports. The necessity to go far afield made his<lb/>
coasting voyages long, and caused his visits to the Viola<lb/>
household to be rare and far between. He was fated<lb/>
to have his wife from there. He had said so once to<lb/>
Giorgio himself. But the Garibaldino had put the<lb/>
subject aside with a majestic wave of his hand, clutching<lb/>
a smouldering black briar-root pipe. There was<lb/>
plenty of time; he was not the man to force his girls<lb/>
upon anybody.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     As time went on, Nostromo discovered his preference<lb/>
for the younger of the two. They had some profound<lb/>
similarities of nature, which must exist for complete<lb/>
confidence and understanding, no matter what outward<lb/>
differences of temperament there may be to exercise<lb/>
their own fascination of contrast. His wife would<lb/>
have to know his secret or else life would be impossible.<lb/>
He was attracted by Giselle, with her candid gaze and<lb/>
white throat, pliable, silent, fond of excitement under<lb/>
her quiet indolence; whereas Linda, with her intense,<lb/>
passionately pale face, energetic, all fire and words,<lb/>
touched with gloom and scorn, a chip of the old block,<lb/>
true daughter of the austere republican, but with Teresa's<lb/>
voice, inspired him with a deep-seated mistrust.<lb/>
Moreover, the poor girl could not conceal her love for<lb/>
Gian' Battista. He could see it would be violent, exacting,<lb/>
suspicious, uncompromising &mdash; like her soul.<lb/>
Giselle, by her fair but warm beauty, by the surface<lb/>


<pb n="525"/>

placidity of her nature holding a promise of submissiveness,<lb/>
by the charm of her girlish mysteriousness, excited<lb/>
his passion and allayed his fears as to the future.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His absences from Sulaco were long. On returning<lb/>
from the longest of them, he made out lighters loaded<lb/>
with blocks of stone lying under the cliff of the Great<lb/>
Isabel; cranes and scaffolding above; workmen's figures<lb/>
moving about, and a small lighthouse already rising<lb/>
from its foundations on the edge of the cliff.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     At this unexpected, undreamt-of, startling sight, he<lb/>
thought himself lost irretrievably. What could save<lb/>
him from detection now? Nothing! He was struck<lb/>
with amazed dread at this turn of chance, that would<lb/>
kindle a far-reaching light upon the only secret spot of<lb/>
his life; that life whose very essence, value, reality,<lb/>
consisted in its reflection from the admiring eyes of<lb/>
men. All of it but that thing which was beyond common<lb/>
comprehension; which stood between him and<lb/>
the power that hears and gives effect to the evil intention<lb/>
of curses. It was dark. Not every man had<lb/>
such a darkness. And they were going to put a light<lb/>
there. A light! He saw it shining upon disgrace,<lb/>
poverty, contempt. Somebody was sure to. . . .<lb/>
Perhaps somebody had already. . . .<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The incomparable Nostromo, the Capataz, the respected<lb/>
and feared Captain Fidanza, the unquestioned<lb/>
patron of secret societies, a republican like old Giorgio,<lb/>
and a revolutionist at heart (but in another manner),<lb/>
was on the point of jumping overboard from the deck<lb/>
of his own schooner. That man, subjective almost to<lb/>
insanity, looked suicide deliberately in the face. But<lb/>
he never lost his head. He was checked by the thought<lb/>
that this was no escape. He imagined himself dead,<lb/>
and the disgrace, the shame going on. Or, rather, properly<lb/>
speaking, he could not imagine himself dead. He<lb/>


<pb n="526"/>

was possessed too strongly by the sense of his own existence,<lb/>
a thing of infinite duration in its changes, to<lb/>
grasp the notion of finality. The earth goes on for<lb/>
ever.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And he was courageous. It was a corrupt courage,<lb/>
but it was as good for his purposes as the other kind.<lb/>
He sailed close to the cliff of the Great Isabel, throwing<lb/>
a penetrating glance from the deck at the mouth of the<lb/>
ravine, tangled in an undisturbed growth of bushes.<lb/>
He sailed close enough to exchange hails with the workmen,<lb/>
shading their eyes on the edge of the sheer drop<lb/>
of the cliff overhung by the jib-head of a powerful crane.<lb/>
He perceived that none of them had any occasion even<lb/>
to approach the ravine where the silver lay hidden; let<lb/>
alone to enter it. In the harbour he learned that no<lb/>
one slept on the island. The labouring gangs returned<lb/>
to port every evening, singing chorus songs in the<lb/>
empty lighters towed by a harbour tug. For the<lb/>
moment he had nothing to fear.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But afterwards? he asked himself. Later, when a<lb/>
keeper came to live in the cottage that was being built<lb/>
some hundred and fifty yards back from the low light-<lb/>
tower, and four hundred or so from the dark, shaded,<lb/>
jungly ravine, containing the secret of his safety, of his<lb/>
influence, of his magnificence, of his power over the future,<lb/>
of his defiance of ill-luck, of every possible betrayal<lb/>
from rich and poor alike &mdash; what then? He could<lb/>
never shake off the treasure. His audacity, greater<lb/>
than that of other men, had welded that vein of silver<lb/>
into his life. And the feeling of fearful and ardent subjection,<lb/>
the feeling of his slavery &mdash; so irremediable and<lb/>
profound that often, in his thoughts, he compared<lb/>
himself to the legendary Gringos, neither dead nor<lb/>
alive, bound down to their conquest of unlawful wealth<lb/>
on Azuera &mdash; weighed heavily on the independent Captain<lb/>


<pb n="527"/>

Fidanza, owner and master of a coasting schooner,<lb/>
whose smart appearance (and fabulous good-luck in<lb/>
trading) were so well known along the western seaboard<lb/>
of a vast continent.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Fiercely whiskered and grave, a shade less supple in<lb/>
his walk, the vigour and symmetry of his powerful<lb/>
limbs lost in the vulgarity of a brown tweed suit, made<lb/>
by Jews in the slums of London, and sold by the clothing<lb/>
department of the Compa&ntilde;ia Anzani, Captain<lb/>
Fidanza was seen in the streets of Sulaco attending to<lb/>
his business, as usual, that trip. And, as usual, he allowed<lb/>
it to get about that he had made a great profit<lb/>
on his cargo. It was a cargo of salt fish, and Lent was<lb/>
approaching. He was seen in tramcars going to and<lb/>
fro between the town and the harbour; he talked with<lb/>
people in a caf&eacute; or two in his measured, steady voice.<lb/>
Captain Fidanza was <hi rend="italic">seen</hi>. The generation that would<lb/>
know nothing of the famous ride to Cayta was not born<lb/>
yet.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo, the miscalled Capataz de Cargadores, had<lb/>
made for himself, under his rightful name, another<lb/>
public existence, but modified by the new conditions,<lb/>
less picturesque, more difficult to keep up in the increased<lb/>
size and varied population of Sulaco, the progressive<lb/>
capital of the Occidental Republic.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Captain Fidanza, unpicturesque, but always a little<lb/>
mysterious, was recognized quite sufficiently under the<lb/>
lofty glass and iron roof of the Sulaco railway station.<lb/>
He took a local train, and got out in Rincon, where he<lb/>
visited the widow of the Cargador who had died of his<lb/>
wounds (at the dawn of the New Era, like Don Jos&eacute;<lb/>
Avellanos) in the patio of the Casa Gould. He consented<lb/>
to sit down and drink a glass of cool lemonade<lb/>
in the hut, while the woman, standing up, poured a<lb/>
perfect torrent of words to which he did not listen.<lb/>


<pb n="528"/>

He left some money with her, as usual. The orphaned<lb/>
children, growing up and well schooled, calling him<lb/>
uncle, clamoured for his blessing. He gave that, too;<lb/>
and in the doorway paused for a moment to look at the<lb/>
flat face of the San Tom&eacute; mountain with a faint frown.<lb/>
This slight contraction of his bronzed brow casting a<lb/>
marked tinge of severity upon his usual unbending expression,<lb/>
was observed at the Lodge which he attended<lb/>
&mdash; but went away before the banquet. He wore it at<lb/>
the meeting of some good comrades, Italians and Occidentals,<lb/>
assembled in his honour under the presidency<lb/>
of an indigent, sickly, somewhat hunchbacked little<lb/>
photographer, with a white face and a magnanimous<lb/>
soul dyed crimson by a bloodthirsty hate of all capitalists,<lb/>
oppressors of the two hemispheres. The heroic<lb/>
Giorgio Viola, old revolutionist, would have understood<lb/>
nothing of his opening speech; and Captain<lb/>
Fidanza, lavishly generous as usual to some poor comrades,<lb/>
made no speech at all. He had listened, frowning,<lb/>
with his mind far away, and walked off unapproachable,<lb/>
silent, like a man full of cares.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His frown deepened as, in the early morning, he<lb/>
watched the stone-masons go off to the Great Isabel,<lb/>
in lighters loaded with squared blocks of stone, enough<lb/>
to add another course to the squat light-tower. That<lb/>
was the rate of the work. One course per day.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And Captain Fidanza meditated. The presence of<lb/>
strangers on the island would cut him completely off the<lb/>
treasure. It had been difficult and dangerous enough<lb/>
before. He was afraid, and he was angry. He thought<lb/>
with the resolution of a master and the cunning of a<lb/>
cowed slave. Then he went ashore.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He was a man of resource and ingenuity; and, as<lb/>
usual, the expedient he found at a critical moment was<lb/>
effective enough to alter the situation radically. He<lb/>


<pb n="529"/>

had the gift of evolving safety out of the very danger,<lb/>
this incomparable Nostromo, this "fellow in a thousand."<lb/>
With Giorgio established on the Great Isabel,<lb/>
there would be no need for concealment. He would be<lb/>
able to go openly, in daylight, to see his daughters &mdash;<lb/>
one of his daughters &mdash; and stay late talking to the old<lb/>
Garibaldino. Then in the dark . . . Night after<lb/>
night . . . He would dare to grow rich quicker<lb/>
now. He yearned to clasp, embrace, absorb, subjugate<lb/>
in unquestioned possession this treasure, whose tyranny<lb/>
had weighed upon his mind, his actions, his very sleep.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He went to see his friend Captain Mitchell &mdash; and the<lb/>
thing was done as Dr. Monygham had related to Mrs.<lb/>
Gould. When the project was mooted to the Garibaldino,<lb/>
something like the faint reflection, the dim ghost<lb/>
of a very ancient smile, stole under the white and enormous<lb/>
moustaches of the old hater of kings and ministers.<lb/>
His daughters were the object of his anxious care. The<lb/>
younger, especially. Linda, with her mother's voice,<lb/>
had taken more her mother's place. Her deep, vibrating<lb/>
"Eh, Padre?" seemed, but for the change of the<lb/>
word, the very echo of the impassioned, remonstrating<lb/>
"Eh, Giorgio?" of poor Signora Teresa. It was his<lb/>
fixed opinion that the town was no proper place for<lb/>
his girls. The infatuated but guileless Ramirez was<lb/>
the object of his profound aversion, as resuming the<lb/>
sins of the country whose people were blind, vile<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">esclavos</hi>.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On his return from his next voyage, Captain Fidanza<lb/>
found the Violas settled in the light-keeper's cottage.<lb/>
His knowledge of Giorgio's idiosyncrasies had not<lb/>
played him false. The Garibaldino had refused to entertain<lb/>
the idea of any companion whatever, except<lb/>
his girls. And Captain Mitchell, anxious to please his<lb/>
poor Nostromo, with that felicity of inspiration which<lb/>


<pb n="530"/>

only true affection can give, had formally appointed<lb/>
Linda Viola as under-keeper of the Isabel's Light.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The light is private property," he used to explain.<lb/>
"It belongs to my Company. I've the power to nominate<lb/>
whom I like, and Viola it shall be. It's about the<lb/>
only thing Nostromo &mdash; a man worth his weight in gold,<lb/>
mind you &mdash; has ever asked me to do for him."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Directly his schooner was anchored opposite the New<lb/>
Custom House, with its sham air of a Greek temple, flat-<lb/>
roofed, with a colonnade, Captain Fidanza went pulling<lb/>
his small boat out of the harbour, bound for the Great<lb/>
Isabel, openly in the light of a declining day, before<lb/>
all men's eyes, with a sense of having mastered the<lb/>
fates. He must establish a regular position. He<lb/>
would ask him for his daughter now. He thought of<lb/>
Giselle as he pulled. Linda loved him, perhaps, but<lb/>
the old man would be glad to keep the elder, who had<lb/>
his wife's voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He did not pull for the narrow strand where he had<lb/>
landed with Decoud, and afterwards alone on his first<lb/>
visit to the treasure. He made for the beach at the<lb/>
other end, and walked up the regular and gentle slope<lb/>
of the wedge-shaped island. Giorgio Viola, whom he<lb/>
saw from afar, sitting on a bench under the front wall<lb/>
of the cottage, lifted his arm slightly to his loud hail.<lb/>
He walked up. Neither of the girls appeared.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is good here," said the old man, in his austere,<lb/>
far-away manner.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo nodded; then, after a short silence &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You saw my schooner pass in not two hours ago?<lb/>
Do you know why I am here before, so to speak, my<lb/>
anchor has fairly bitten into the ground of this port of<lb/>
Sulaco?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You are welcome like a son," the old man declared,<lb/>
quietly, staring away upon the sea.<lb/>


<pb n="531"/>

</p>

<p>     "Ah! thy son. I know. I am what thy son would<lb/>
have been. It is well, viejo. It is a very good welcome.<lb/>
Listen, I have come to ask you for &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A sudden dread came upon the fearless and incorruptible<lb/>
Nostromo. He dared not utter the name in his<lb/>
mind. The slight pause only imparted a marked weight<lb/>
and solemnity to the changed end of the phrase.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "For my wife!" . . . His heart was beating<lb/>
fast." It is time you &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Garibaldino arrested him with an extended arm.<lb/>
"That was left for you to judge."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He got up slowly. His beard, unclipped since<lb/>
Teresa's death, thick, snow-white, covered his powerful<lb/>
chest. He turned his head to the door, and called out<lb/>
in his strong voice &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Linda."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Her answer came sharp and faint from within; and the<lb/>
appalled Nostromo stood up, too, but remained mute,<lb/>
gazing at the door. He was afraid. He was not afraid<lb/>
of being refused the girl he loved &mdash; no mere refusal could<lb/>
stand between him and a woman he desired &mdash; but the<lb/>
shining spectre of the treasure rose before him, claiming<lb/>
his allegiance in a silence that could not be gainsaid.<lb/>
He was afraid, because, neither dead nor alive, like the<lb/>
Gringos on Azuera, he belonged body and soul to the<lb/>
unlawfulness of his audacity. He was afraid of being<lb/>
forbidden the island. He was afraid, and said<lb/>
nothing.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Seeing the two men standing up side by side to await<lb/>
her, Linda stopped in the doorway. Nothing could alter<lb/>
the passionate dead whiteness of her face; but her black<lb/>
eyes seemed to catch and concentrate all the light of the<lb/>
low sun in a flaming spark within the black depths,<lb/>
covered at once by the slow descent of heavy eyelids.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Behold thy husband, master, and benefactor." Old<lb/>


<pb n="532"/>

Viola's voice resounded with a force that seemed to fill<lb/>
the whole gulf.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She stepped forward with her eyes nearly closed, like a<lb/>
sleep-walker in a beatific dream.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo made a superhuman effort. "It is time,<lb/>
Linda, we two were betrothed," he said, steadily, in his<lb/>
level, careless, unbending tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She put her hand into his offered palm, lowering her<lb/>
head, dark with bronze glints, upon which her father's<lb/>
hand rested for a moment.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And so the soul of the dead is satisfied."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This came from Giorgio Viola, who went on talking<lb/>
for a while of his dead wife; while the two, sitting side by<lb/>
side, never looked at each other. Then the old man<lb/>
ceased; and Linda, motionless, began to speak.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ever since I felt I lived in the world, I have lived<lb/>
for you alone, Gian' Battista. And that you knew!<lb/>
You knew it . . . Battistino."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She pronounced the name exactly with her mother's<lb/>
intonation. A gloom as of the grave covered Nostromo's<lb/>
heart.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. I knew," he said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The heroic Garibaldino sat on the same bench bowing<lb/>
his hoary head, his old soul dwelling alone with its<lb/>
memories, tender and violent, terrible and dreary &mdash;<lb/>
solitary on the earth full of men.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     And Linda, his best-loved daughter, was saying, "I<lb/>
was yours ever since I can remember. I had only to<lb/>
think of you for the earth to become empty to my eyes.<lb/>
When you were there, I could see no one else. I was<lb/>
yours. Nothing is changed. The world belongs to<lb/>
you, and you let me live in it." . . . She dropped<lb/>
her low, vibrating voice to a still lower note, and found<lb/>
other things to say &mdash; torturing for the man at her side.<lb/>
Her murmur ran on ardent and voluble. She did not<lb/>


<pb n="533"/>

seem to see her sister, who came out with an altar-cloth<lb/>
she was embroidering in her hands, and passed in front<lb/>
of them, silent, fresh, fair, with a quick glance and a<lb/>
faint smile, to sit a little away on the other side of<lb/>
Nostromo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The evening was still. The sun sank almost to the<lb/>
edge of a purple ocean; and the white lighthouse, livid<lb/>
against the background of clouds filling the head of the<lb/>
gulf, bore the lantern red and glowing, like a live ember<lb/>
kindled by the fire of the sky. Giselle, indolent and<lb/>
demure, raised the altar-cloth from time to time to hide<lb/>
nervous yawns, as of a young panther.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Suddenly Linda rushed at her sister, and seizing her<lb/>
head, covered her face with kisses. Nostromo's brain<lb/>
reeled. When she left her, as if stunned by the violent<lb/>
caresses, with her hands lying in her lap, the slave of<lb/>
the treasure felt as if he could shoot that woman. Old<lb/>
Giorgio lifted his leonine head.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Where are you going, Linda?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "To the light, padre mio."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Si, si &mdash; to your duty."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He got up, too, looked after his eldest daughter; then,<lb/>
in a tone whose festive note seemed the echo of a mood<lb/>
lost in the night of ages &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I am going in to cook something. Aha! Son! The<lb/>
old man knows where to find a bottle of wine, too."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He turned to Giselle, with a change to austere tenderness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "And you, little one, pray not to the God of priests<lb/>
and slaves, but to the God of orphans, of the oppressed,<lb/>
of the poor, of little children, to give thee a man like<lb/>
this one for a husband."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His hand rested heavily for a moment on Nostromo's<lb/>
shoulder; then he went in. The hopeless slave of the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; silver felt at these words the venomous fangs<lb/>


<pb n="534"/>

of jealousy biting deep into his heart. He was appalled<lb/>
by the novelty of the experience, by its force,<lb/>
by its physical intimacy. A husband! A husband<lb/>
for her! And yet it was natural that Giselle should<lb/>
have a husband at some time or other. He had never<lb/>
realized that before. In discovering that her beauty<lb/>
could belong to another he felt as though he could<lb/>
kill this one of old Giorgio's daughters also. He muttered<lb/>
moodily &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "They say you love Ramirez."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She shook her head without looking at him. Coppery<lb/>
glints rippled to and fro on the wealth of her gold<lb/>
hair. Her smooth forehead had the soft, pure sheen<lb/>
of a priceless pearl in the splendour of the sunset, mingling<lb/>
the gloom of starry spaces, the purple of the sea, and<lb/>
the crimson of the sky in a magnificent stillness.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No," she said, slowly. "I never loved him. I<lb/>
think I never . . . He loves me &mdash; perhaps."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The seduction of her slow voice died out of the air,<lb/>
and her raised eyes remained fixed on nothing, as if<lb/>
indifferent and without thought.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ramirez told you he loved you?" asked Nostromo,<lb/>
restraining himself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! once &mdash; one evening . . ."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The miserable . . . Ha!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He had jumped up as if stung by a gad-fly, and stood<lb/>
before her mute with anger.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Misericordia Divina!</hi> You, too, Gian' Battista!<lb/>
Poor wretch that I am!" she lamented in ingenuous<lb/>
tones. "I told Linda, and she scolded &mdash; she scolded.<lb/>
Am I to live blind, dumb, and deaf in this world? And<lb/>
she told father, who took down his gun and cleaned it.<lb/>
Poor Ramirez! Then you came, and she told you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He looked at her. He fastened his eyes upon the<lb/>
hollow of her white throat, which had the invincible<lb/>


<pb n="535"/>

charm of things young, palpitating, delicate, and alive.<lb/>
Was this the child he had known? Was it possible?<lb/>
It dawned upon him that in these last years he had<lb/>
really seen very little &mdash; nothing &mdash; of her.   Nothing.<lb/>
She had come into the world like a thing unknown.<lb/>
She had come upon him unawares. She was a danger.<lb/>
A frightful danger. The instinctive mood of fierce<lb/>
determination that had never failed him before the<lb/>
perils of this life added its steady force to the violence<lb/>
of his passion. She, in a voice that recalled to him the<lb/>
song of running water, the tinkling of a silver bell,<lb/>
continued &mdash;<lb/>
    "And between you three you have brought me here<lb/>
into this captivity to the sky and water. Nothing else.<lb/>
Sky and water. Oh, <hi rend="italic">Sanctissima Madre</hi>. My hair<lb/>
shall turn grey on this tedious island. I could hate you,<lb/>
Gian' Battista!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He laughed loudly. Her voice enveloped him like a<lb/>
caress. She bemoaned her fate, spreading unconsciously,<lb/>
like a flower its perfume in the coolness of the evening,<lb/>
the indefinable seduction of her person. Was it her<lb/>
fault that nobody ever had admired Linda? Even<lb/>
when they were little, going out with their mother to<lb/>
Mass, she remembered that people took no notice of<lb/>
Linda, who was fearless, and chose instead to frighten<lb/>
her, who was timid, with their attention. It was her<lb/>
hair like gold, she supposed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He broke out &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Your hair like gold, and your eyes like violets, and<lb/>
your lips like the rose; your round arms, your white<lb/>
throat." . . .<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Imperturbable in the indolence of her pose, she<lb/>
blushed deeply all over to the roots of her hair. She<lb/>
was not conceited. She was no more self-conscious than<lb/>
a flower. But she was pleased. And perhaps even a<lb/>


<pb n="536"/>

flower loves to hear itself praised. He glanced down,<lb/>
and added, impetuously &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Your little feet!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Leaning back against the rough stone wall of the<lb/>
cottage, she seemed to bask languidly in the warmth<lb/>
of the rosy flush. Only her lowered eyes glanced at<lb/>
her little feet.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And so you are going at last to marry our Linda.<lb/>
She is terrible. Ah! now she will understand better<lb/>
since you have told her you love her. She will not be so<lb/>
fierce."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Chica!"</hi> said Nostromo, "I have not told her anything."<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "Then make haste. Come to-morrow. Come and<lb/>
tell her, so that I may have some peace from her scolding<lb/>
and &mdash; perhaps &mdash; who knows . . ."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Be allowed to listen to your Ramirez, eh? Is that<lb/>
it? You . . ."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Mercy of God! How violent you are, Giovanni,"<lb/>
she said, unmoved.   "Who is Ramirez .  .  .<lb/>
Ramirez .  .  . Who is he?" she repeated, dreamily,<lb/>
in the dusk and gloom of the clouded gulf, with a<lb/>
low red streak in the west like a hot bar of glowing<lb/>
iron laid across the entrance of a world sombre as a<lb/>
cavern, where the magnificent Capataz de Cargadores<lb/>
had hidden his conquests of love and wealth.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Listen, Giselle," he said, in measured tones; "I<lb/>
will tell no word of love to your sister. Do you want<lb/>
to know why?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Alas! I could not understand perhaps, Giovanni.<lb/>
Father says you are not like other men; that no one had<lb/>
ever understood you properly; that the rich will be<lb/>
surprised yet. . . . Oh! saints in heaven! I am<lb/>
weary."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She raised her embroidery to conceal the lower<lb/>


<pb n="537"/>

part of her face, then let it fall on her lap. The<lb/>
lantern was shaded on the land side, but slanting<lb/>
away from the dark column of the lighthouse they<lb/>
could see the long shaft of light, kindled by Linda, go<lb/>
out to strike the expiring glow in a horizon of purple<lb/>
and red.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Giselle Viola, with her head resting against the wall of<lb/>
the house, her eyes half closed, and her little feet, in<lb/>
white stockings and black slippers, crossed over each<lb/>
other, seemed to surrender herself, tranquil and fatal,<lb/>
to the gathering dusk. The charm of her body, the<lb/>
promising mysteriousness of her indolence, went out<lb/>
into the night of the Placid Gulf like a fresh and<lb/>
intoxicating fragrance spreading out in the shadows,<lb/>
impregnating the air. The incorruptible Nostromo<lb/>
breathed her ambient seduction in the tumultuous<lb/>
heaving of his breast. Before leaving the harbour<lb/>
he had thrown off the store clothing of Captain Fidanza,<lb/>
for greater ease in the long pull out to the islands. He<lb/>
stood before her in the red sash and check shirt as he<lb/>
used to appear on the Company's wharf &mdash; a Mediterranean<lb/>
sailor come ashore to try his luck in Costaguana.<lb/>
The dusk of purple and red enveloped him, too &mdash; close,<lb/>
soft, profound, as no more than fifty yards from that<lb/>
spot it had gathered evening after evening about the<lb/>
self-destructive passion of Don Martin Decoud's utter<lb/>
scepticism, flaming up to death in solitude.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have got to hear," he began at last, with perfect<lb/>
self-control. "I shall say no word of love to your<lb/>
sister, to whom I am betrothed from this evening,<lb/>
because it is you that I love. It is you!" . . .<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The dusk let him see yet the tender and voluptuous<lb/>
smile that came instinctively upon her lips shaped for<lb/>
love and kisses, freeze hard in the drawn, haggard lines<lb/>
of terror. He could not restrain himself any longer.<lb/>


<pb n="538"/>

While she shrank from his approach, her arms went<lb/>
out to him, abandoned and regal in the dignity of her<lb/>
languid surrender. He held her head in his two hands,<lb/>
and showered rapid kisses upon the upturned face that<lb/>
gleamed in the purple dusk. Masterful and tender,<lb/>
he was entering slowly upon the fulness of his possession.<lb/>
And he perceived that she was crying. Then the incomparable<lb/>
Capataz, the man of careless loves, became<lb/>
gentle and caressing, like a woman to the grief of a<lb/>
child. He murmured to her fondly. He sat down by<lb/>
her and nursed her fair head on his breast. He called<lb/>
her his star and his little flower.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It had grown dark. From the living-room of the<lb/>
light-keeper's cottage, where Giorgio, one of the Immortal<lb/>
Thousand, was bending his leonine and heroic<lb/>
head over a charcoal fire, there came the sound of<lb/>
sizzling and the aroma of an artistic <hi rend="italic">frittura</hi>.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the obscure disarray of that thing, happening like a<lb/>
cataclysm, it was in her feminine head that some gleam<lb/>
of reason survived. He was lost to the world in their<lb/>
embraced stillness. But she said, whispering into his<lb/>
ear &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "God of mercy! What will become of me &mdash; here &mdash; <lb/>
now &mdash; between this sky and this water I hate? Linda,<lb/>
Linda &mdash; I see her!" . . . She tried to get out of his<lb/>
arms, suddenly relaxed at the sound of that name. But<lb/>
there was no one approaching their black shapes, enlaced<lb/>
and struggling on the white background of the<lb/>
wall. "Linda! Poor Linda! I tremble! I shall die<lb/>
of fear before my poor sister Linda, betrothed to-day<lb/>
to Giovanni &mdash; my lover! Giovanni, you must have been<lb/>
mad! I cannot understand you! You are not like<lb/>
other men! I will not give you up &mdash; never &mdash; only to<lb/>
God himself! But why have you done this blind, mad,<lb/>
cruel, frightful thing?"<lb/>


<pb n="539"/>

</p>

<p>     Released, she hung her head, let fall her hands. The<lb/>
altar-cloth, as if tossed by a great wind, lay far away<lb/>
from them, gleaming white on the black ground.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "From fear of losing my hope of you," said Nostromo.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You knew that you had my soul! You know everything!<lb/>
It was made for you! But what could stand<lb/>
between you and me? What? Tell me!" she repeated,<lb/>
without impatience, in superb assurance.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Your dead mother," he said, very low.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ah! . . . Poor mother! She has always . . .<lb/>
She is a saint in heaven now, and I cannot give you<lb/>
up to her. No, Giovanni. Only to God alone. You<lb/>
were mad &mdash; but it is done. Oh! what have you done?<lb/>
Giovanni, my beloved, my life, my master, do not leave<lb/>
me here in this grave of clouds. You cannot leave me<lb/>
now. You must take me away &mdash; at once &mdash; this instant<lb/>
&mdash; in the little boat. Giovanni, carry me off to-night,<lb/>
from my fear of Linda's eyes, before I have to look at<lb/>
her again."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She nestled close to him. The slave of the San Tom&eacute;<lb/>
silver felt the weight as of chains upon his limbs, a pressure<lb/>
as of a cold hand upon his lips. He struggled<lb/>
against the spell.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I cannot," he said. "Not yet. There is something<lb/>
that stands between us two and the freedom of the<lb/>
world."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She pressed her form closer to his side with a subtle<lb/>
and na&iuml;ve instinct of seduction.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You rave, Giovanni &mdash; my lover!" she whispered,<lb/>
engagingly. "What can there be? Carry me off &mdash; in<lb/>
thy very hands &mdash; to Do&ntilde;a Emilia &mdash; away from here.<lb/>
I am not very heavy."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It seemed as though she expected him to lift her up at<lb/>
once in his two palms. She had lost the notion of all<lb/>
impossibility. Anything could happen on this night of<lb/>


<pb n="540"/>

wonder. As he made no movement, she almost cried<lb/>
aloud &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I tell you I am afraid of Linda!" And still he did not<lb/>
move. She became quiet and wily. "What can there<lb/>
be?" she asked, coaxingly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He felt her warm, breathing, alive, quivering in the<lb/>
hollow of his arm. In the exulting consciousness of his<lb/>
strength, and the triumphant excitement of his mind, he<lb/>
struck out for his freedom.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A treasure," he said. All was still. She did not<lb/>
understand. "A treasure. A treasure of silver to buy<lb/>
a gold crown for thy brow."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A treasure?" she repeated in a faint voice, as if<lb/>
from the depths of a dream. "What is it you say?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She disengaged herself gently. He got up and looked<lb/>
down at her, aware of her face, of her hair, her lips, the<lb/>
dimples on her cheeks &mdash; seeing the fascination of her<lb/>
person in the night of the gulf as if in the blaze of noonday.<lb/>
Her nonchalant and seductive voice trembled<lb/>
with the excitement of admiring awe and ungovernable<lb/>
curiosity.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "A treasure of silver!" she stammered out. Then<lb/>
pressed on faster: "What? Where? How did you<lb/>
get it, Giovanni?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He wrestled with the spell of captivity. It was as if<lb/>
striking a heroic blow that he burst out &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Like a thief!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The densest blackness of the Placid Gulf seemed to<lb/>
fall upon his head. He could not see her now. She had<lb/>
vanished into a long, obscure abysmal silence, whence<lb/>
her voice came back to him after a time with a faint<lb/>
glimmer, which was her face.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I love you! I love you!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     These words gave him an unwonted sense of freedom;<lb/>
they cast a spell stronger than the accursed spell of the<lb/>


<pb n="541"/>

treasure; they changed his weary subjection to that<lb/>
dead thing into an exulting conviction of his power.<lb/>
He would cherish her, he said, in a splendour as great<lb/>
as Do&ntilde;a Emilia's. The rich lived on wealth stolen<lb/>
from the people, but he had taken from the rich nothing<lb/>
&mdash; nothing that was not lost to them already by their<lb/>
folly and their betrayal. For he had been betrayed &mdash;<lb/>
he said &mdash; deceived, tempted. She believed him. . . .<lb/>
He had kept the treasure for purposes of revenge; but<lb/>
now he cared nothing for it. He cared only for her.<lb/>
He would put her beauty in a palace on a hill crowned<lb/>
with olive trees &mdash; a white palace above a blue sea. He<lb/>
would keep her there like a jewel in a casket. He would<lb/>
get land for her &mdash; her own land fertile with vines and<lb/>
corn &mdash; to set her little feet upon. He kissed them. . . .<lb/>
He had already paid for it all with the soul of a woman<lb/>
and the life of a man. . . . The Capataz de<lb/>
Cargadores tasted the supreme intoxication of his generosity.<lb/>
He flung the mastered treasure superbly at<lb/>
her feet in the impenetrable darkness of the gulf, in<lb/>
the darkness defying &mdash; as men said &mdash; the knowledge<lb/>
of God and the wit of the devil. But she must let him<lb/>
grow rich first &mdash; he warned her.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She listened as if in a trance. Her fingers stirred in<lb/>
his hair. He got up from his knees reeling, weak, empty,<lb/>
as though he had flung his soul away.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Make haste, then," she said. "Make haste,<lb/>
Giovanni, my lover, my master, for I will give thee<lb/>
up to no one but God. And I am afraid of Linda."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He guessed at her shudder, and swore to do his best.<lb/>
He trusted the courage of her love. She promised to be<lb/>
brave in order to be loved always &mdash; far away in a white<lb/>
palace upon a hill above a blue sea. Then with a timid,<lb/>
tentative eagerness she murmured &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Where is it? Where? Tell me that, Giovanni."<lb/>


<pb n="542"/>

</p>

<p>     He opened his mouth and remained silent &mdash; thunder-<lb/>
struck.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Not that! Not that!" he gasped out, appalled at<lb/>
the spell of secrecy that had kept him dumb before so<lb/>
many people falling upon his lips again with unimpaired<lb/>
force. Not even to her. Not even to her. It was too<lb/>
dangerous. "I forbid thee to ask," he cried at her,<lb/>
deadening cautiously the anger of his voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He had not regained his freedom. The spectre of the<lb/>
unlawful treasure arose, standing by her side like a figure<lb/>
of silver, pitiless and secret, with a finger on its pale lips.<lb/>
His soul died within him at the vision of himself creeping<lb/>
in presently along the ravine, with the smell of earth, of<lb/>
damp foliage in his nostrils &mdash; creeping in, determined in<lb/>
a purpose that numbed his breast, and creeping out<lb/>
again loaded with silver, with his ears alert to every<lb/>
sound. It must be done on this very night &mdash; that work<lb/>
of a craven slave!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He stooped low, pressed the hem of her skirt to his<lb/>
lips, with a muttered command &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Tell him I would not stay," and was gone suddenly<lb/>
from her, silent, without as much as a footfall in the<lb/>
dark night.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She sat still, her head resting indolently against the<lb/>
wall, and her little feet in white stockings and black<lb/>
slippers crossed over each other. Old Giorgio, coming<lb/>
out, did not seem to be surprised at the intelligence as<lb/>
much as she had vaguely feared. For she was full of<lb/>
inexplicable fear now &mdash; fear of everything and everybody<lb/>
except of her Giovanni and his treasure. But that was<lb/>
incredible.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The heroic Garibaldino accepted Nostromo's abrupt<lb/>
departure with a sagacious indulgence. He remembered<lb/>
his own feelings, and exhibited a masculine penetration<lb/>
of the true state of the case.<lb/>


<pb n="543"/>

</p>

<p>     <hi rend="italic">"Va bene</hi>. Let him go. Ha! ha! No matter how<lb/>
fair the woman, it galls a little. Liberty, liberty.<lb/>
There's more than one kind! He has said the great<lb/>
word, and son Gian' Battista is not tame." He seemed<lb/>
to be instructing the motionless and scared Giselle.<lb/>
. . . "A man should not be tame," he added, dogmatically<lb/>
out of the doorway. Her stillness and silence<lb/>
seemed to displease him. "Do not give way to the<lb/>
enviousness of your sister's lot," he admonished her,<lb/>
very grave, in his deep voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Presently he had to come to the door again to call in<lb/>
his younger daughter. It was late. He shouted her<lb/>
name three times before she even moved her head. Left<lb/>
alone, she had become the helpless prey of astonishment.<lb/>
She walked into the bedroom she shared with<lb/>
Linda like a person profoundly asleep. That aspect<lb/>
was so marked that even old Giorgio, spectacled, raising<lb/>
his eyes from the Bible, shook his head as she shut the<lb/>
door behind her.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She walked right across the room without looking at<lb/>
anything, and sat down at once by the open window.<lb/>
Linda, stealing down from the tower in the exuberance<lb/>
of her happiness, found her with a lighted candle at her<lb/>
back, facing the black night full of sighing gusts of wind<lb/>
and the sound of distant showers &mdash; a true night of the<lb/>
gulf, too dense for the eye of God and the wiles of the<lb/>
devil. She did not turn her head at the opening of the<lb/>
door.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There was something in that immobility which<lb/>
reached Linda in the depths of her paradise. The elder<lb/>
sister guessed angrily: the child is thinking of that<lb/>
wretched Ramirez. Linda longed to talk. She said<lb/>
in her arbitrary voice, "Giselle!" and was not answered<lb/>
by the slightest movement.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The girl that was going to live in a palace and walk on<lb/>


<pb n="544"/>

ground of her own was ready to die with terror. Not<lb/>
for anything in the world would she have turned her<lb/>
head to face her sister. Her heart was beating madly.<lb/>
She said with subdued haste &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Do not speak to me. I am praying."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda, disappointed, went out quietly; and Giselle<lb/>
sat on unbelieving, lost, dazed, patient, as if waiting for<lb/>
the confirmation of the incredible. The hopeless blackness<lb/>
of the clouds seemed part of a dream, too. She<lb/>
waited.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She did not wait in vain. The man whose soul was<lb/>
dead within him, creeping out of the ravine, weighted<lb/>
with silver, had seen the gleam of the lighted window,<lb/>
and could not help retracing his steps from the<lb/>
beach.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     On that impenetrable background, obliterating the<lb/>
lofty mountains by the seaboard, she saw the slave of<lb/>
the San Tom&eacute; silver, as if by an extraordinary power<lb/>
of a miracle. She accepted his return as if henceforth<lb/>
the world could hold no surprise for all eternity.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She rose, compelled and rigid, and began to speak long<lb/>
before the light from within fell upon the face of the<lb/>
approaching man.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have come back to carry me off. It is<lb/>
well! Open thy arms, Giovanni, my lover. I am<lb/>
coming."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     His prudent footsteps stopped, and with his eyes<lb/>
glistening wildly, he spoke in a harsh voice:<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Not yet. I must grow rich slowly." . . . A<lb/>
threatening note came into his tone. "Do not forget<lb/>
that you have a thief for your lover."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes! Yes!" she whispered, hastily. "Come nearer!<lb/>
Listen! Do not give me up, Giovanni! Never,<lb/>
never! . . . I will be patient! . . ."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Her form drooped consolingly over the low casement<lb/>


<pb n="545"/>

towards the slave of the unlawful treasure. The light in<lb/>
the room went out, and weighted with silver, the magnificent<lb/>
Capataz clasped her round her white neck in the<lb/>
darkness of the gulf as a drowning man clutches at a<lb/>
straw.<lb/>
</p>


</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="13" id="d39">
<head>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</head>

<pb n="546"/>


<p>     ON THE day Mrs. Gould was going, in Dr. Monygham's<lb/>
words, to "give a tertulia," Captain Fidanza<lb/>
went down the side of his schooner lying in Sulaco<lb/>
harbour, calm, unbending, deliberate in the way he sat<lb/>
down in his dinghy and took up his sculls. He was later<lb/>
than usual. The afternoon was well advanced before<lb/>
he landed on the beach of the Great Isabel, and with a<lb/>
steady pace climbed the slope of the island.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     From a distance he made out Giselle sitting in a chair<lb/>
tilted back against the end of the house, under the window<lb/>
of the girl's room. She had her embroidery in her<lb/>
hands, and held it well up to her eyes. The tranquillity<lb/>
of that girlish figure exasperated the feeling of perpetual<lb/>
struggle and strife he carried in his breast. He became<lb/>
angry. It seemed to him that she ought to hear the<lb/>
clanking of his fetters &mdash; his silver fetters, from afar.<lb/>
And while ashore that day, he had met the doctor with<lb/>
the evil eye, who had looked at him very hard.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The raising of her eyes mollified him. They smiled in<lb/>
their flower-like freshness straight upon his heart. Then<lb/>
she frowned. It was a warning to be cautious. He<lb/>
stopped some distance away, and in a loud, indifferent<lb/>
tone, said &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Good day, Giselle. Is Linda up yet?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. She is in the big room with father."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He approached then, and, looking through the window<lb/>
into the bedroom for fear of being detected by<lb/>
Linda returning there for some reason, he said, moving<lb/>
only his lips &mdash;<lb/>




<pb n="547"/>

</p>

<p>     "You love me?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "More than my life." She went on with her embroidery<lb/>
under his contemplating gaze and continued<lb/>
to speak, looking at her work, "Or I could not live. I<lb/>
could not, Giovanni. For this life is like death. Oh,<lb/>
Giovanni, I shall perish if you do not take me away."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He smiled carelessly. "I will come to the window<lb/>
when it's dark," he said.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, don't, Giovanni. Not-to-night. Linda and<lb/>
father have been talking together for a long time today."<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "What about?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ramirez, I fancy I heard. I do not know. I<lb/>
am afraid. I am always afraid. It is like dying a<lb/>
thousand times a day. Your love is to me like your<lb/>
treasure to you. It is there, but I can never get enough<lb/>
of it."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He looked at her very still. She was beautiful. His<lb/>
desire had grown within him. He had two masters<lb/>
now. But she was incapable of sustained emotion.<lb/>
She was sincere in what she said, but she slept placidly<lb/>
at night. When she saw him she flamed up always.<lb/>
Then only an increased taciturnity marked the change<lb/>
in her. She was afraid of betraying herself. She was<lb/>
afraid of pain, of bodily harm, of sharp words, of facing<lb/>
anger, and witnessing violence. For her soul was light<lb/>
and tender with a pagan sincerity in its impulses. She<lb/>
murmured &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Give up the palazzo, Giovanni, and the vineyard on<lb/>
the hills, for which we are starving our love."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She ceased, seeing Linda standing silent at the corner<lb/>
of the house.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo turned to his affianced wife with a greeting,<lb/>
and was amazed at her sunken eyes, at her hollow<lb/>
cheeks, at the air of illness and anguish in her face.<lb/>


<pb n="548"/>

</p>

<p>     "Have you been ill?" he asked, trying to put some<lb/>
concern into this question.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Her black eyes blazed at him. "Am I thinner?"<lb/>
she asked.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes &mdash; perhaps &mdash; a little."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And older?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Every day counts &mdash; for all of us."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I shall go grey, I fear, before the ring is on my<lb/>
finger," she said, slowly, keeping her gaze fastened upon<lb/>
him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She waited for what he would say, rolling down her<lb/>
turned-up sleeves.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No fear of that," he said, absently.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She turned away as if it had been something final, and<lb/>
busied herself with household cares while Nostromo<lb/>
talked with her father. Conversation with the old<lb/>
Garibaldino was not easy. Age had left his faculties<lb/>
unimpaired, only they seemed to have withdrawn somewhere<lb/>
deep within him. His answers were slow in coming,<lb/>
with an effect of august gravity. But that day<lb/>
he was more animated, quicker; there seemed to be<lb/>
more life in the old lion. He was uneasy for the integrity<lb/>
of his honour. He believed Sidoni's warning as<lb/>
to Ramirez's designs upon his younger daughter. And<lb/>
he did not trust her. She was flighty. He said nothing<lb/>
of his cares to "Son Gian' Battista." It was a touch<lb/>
of senile vanity. He wanted to show that he was equal<lb/>
yet to the task of guarding alone the honour of his house.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo went away early. As soon as he had disappeared,<lb/>
walking towards the beach, Linda stepped<lb/>
over the threshold and, with a haggard smile, sat down<lb/>
by the side of her father.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Ever since that Sunday, when the infatuated and<lb/>
desperate Ramirez had waited for her on the wharf, she<lb/>
had no doubts whatever. The jealous ravings of that<lb/>


<pb n="549"/>

man were no revelation. They had only fixed with<lb/>
precision, as with a nail driven into her heart, that sense<lb/>
of unreality and deception which, instead of bliss and<lb/>
security, she had found in her intercourse with her promised<lb/>
husband. She had passed on, pouring indignation<lb/>
and scorn upon Ramirez; but, that Sunday, she nearly<lb/>
died of wretchedness and shame, lying on the carved<lb/>
and lettered stone of Teresa's grave, subscribed for by<lb/>
the engine-drivers and the fitters of the railway workshops,<lb/>
in sign of their respect for the hero of Italian<lb/>
Unity. Old Viola had not been able to carry out his<lb/>
desire of burying his wife in the sea; and Linda wept<lb/>
upon the stone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The gratuitous outrage appalled her. If he wished to<lb/>
break her heart &mdash; well and good. Everything was permitted<lb/>
to Gian' Battista. But why trample upon the<lb/>
pieces; why seek to humiliate her spirit? Aha! He<lb/>
could not break that. She dried her tears. And<lb/>
Giselle! Giselle! The little one that, ever since she<lb/>
could toddle, had always clung to her skirt for protection.<lb/>
What duplicity! But she could not help it<lb/>
probably. When there was a man in the case the poor<lb/>
featherheaded wretch could not help herself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda had a good share of the Viola stoicism. She<lb/>
resolved to say nothing. But woman-like she put passion<lb/>
into her stoicism. Giselle's short answers, prompted<lb/>
by fearful caution, drove her beside herself by their<lb/>
curtness that resembled disdain. One day she flung<lb/>
herself upon the chair in which her indolent sister was<lb/>
lying and impressed the mark of her teeth at the base<lb/>
of the whitest neck in Sulaco. Giselle cried out. But<lb/>
she had her share of the Viola heroism. Ready to faint<lb/>
with terror, she only said, in a lazy voice, <hi rend="italic">"Madre de<lb/>
Dios!</hi> Are you going to eat me alive, Linda?" And<lb/>
this outburst passed off leaving no trace upon the situation.<lb/>


<pb n="550"/>

"She knows nothing. She cannot know any<lb/>
thing," reflected Giselle. "Perhaps it is not true.<lb/>
It cannot be true," Linda tried to persuade herself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But when she saw Captain Fidanza for the first time<lb/>
after her meeting with the distracted Ramirez, the<lb/>
certitude of her misfortune returned. She watched<lb/>
him from the doorway go away to his boat, asking herself<lb/>
stoically, "Will they meet to-night?" She made up<lb/>
her mind not to leave the tower for a second. When he<lb/>
had disappeared she came out and sat down by her<lb/>
father.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The venerable Garibaldino felt, in his own words, "a<lb/>
young man yet." In one way or another a good deal of<lb/>
talk about Ramirez had reached him of late; and his<lb/>
contempt and dislike of that man who obviously was<lb/>
not what his son would have been, had made him restless.<lb/>
He slept very little now; but for several nights<lb/>
past instead of reading &mdash; or only sitting, with Mrs.<lb/>
Gould's silver spectacles on his nose, before the open<lb/>
Bible, he had been prowling actively all about the island<lb/>
with his old gun, on watch over his honour.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda, laying her thin brown hand on his knee, tried<lb/>
to soothe his excitement. Ramirez was not in Sulaco.<lb/>
Nobody knew where he was. He was gone. His talk<lb/>
of what he would do meant nothing.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No," the old man interrupted. "But son Gian'<lb/>
Battista told me &mdash; quite of himself &mdash; that the cowardly<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">esclavo</hi> was drinking and gambling with the rascals of<lb/>
Zapiga, over there on the north side of the gulf. He<lb/>
may get some of the worst scoundrels of that scoundrelly<lb/>
town of negroes to help him in his attempt upon<lb/>
the little one. . . . But I am not so old. No!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She argued earnestly against the probability of any<lb/>
attempt being made; and at last the old man fell silent,<lb/>
chewing his white moustache.  Women had their obstinate<lb/>


<pb n="551"/>

notions which must be humoured &mdash; his poor wife<lb/>
was like that, and Linda resembled her mother. It was<lb/>
not seemly for a man to argue. "May be. May be,"<lb/>
he mumbled.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She was by no means easy in her mind. She loved<lb/>
Nostromo. She turned her eyes upon Giselle, sitting at<lb/>
a distance, with something of maternal tenderness, and<lb/>
the jealous anguish of a rival outraged in her defeat.<lb/>
Then she rose and walked over to her.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Listen &mdash; you," she said, roughly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The invincible candour of the gaze, raised up all violet<lb/>
and dew, excited her rage and admiration. She had<lb/>
beautiful eyes &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">Chica</hi> &mdash; this vile thing of white flesh<lb/>
and black deception. She did not know whether she<lb/>
wanted to tear them out with shouts of vengeance or<lb/>
cover up their mysterious and shameless innocence with<lb/>
kisses of pity and love. And suddenly they became<lb/>
empty, gazing blankly at her, except for a little fear not<lb/>
quite buried deep enough with all the other emotions<lb/>
in Giselle's heart.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda said, "Ramirez is boasting in town that he will<lb/>
carry you off from the island."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What folly!" answered the other, and in a perversity<lb/>
born of long restraint, she added: "He is not the<lb/>
man," in a jesting tone with a trembling audacity.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No?" said Linda, through her clenched teeth. "Is<lb/>
he not? Well, then, look to it; because father has been<lb/>
walking about with a loaded gun at night."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is not good for him. You must tell him not to,<lb/>
Linda. He will not listen to me."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I shall say nothing &mdash; never any more &mdash; to anybody,"<lb/>
cried Linda, passionately.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     This could not last, thought Giselle. Giovanni must<lb/>
take her away soon &mdash; the very next time he came. She<lb/>
would not suffer these terrors for ever so much silver.<lb/>


<pb n="552"/>

To speak with her sister made her ill. But she was not<lb/>
uneasy at her father's watchfulness. She had begged<lb/>
Nostromo not to come to the window that night. He<lb/>
had promised to keep away for this once. And she<lb/>
did not know, could not guess or imagine, that he had<lb/>
another reason for coming on the island.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda had gone straight to the tower. It was time to<lb/>
light up. She unlocked the little door, and went heavily<lb/>
up the spiral staircase, carrying her love for the magnificent<lb/>
Capataz de Cargadores like an ever-increasing load<lb/>
of shameful fetters. No; she could not throw it off.<lb/>
No; let Heaven dispose of these two. And moving<lb/>
about the lantern, filled with twilight and the sheen of<lb/>
the moon, with careful movements she lighted the lamp.<lb/>
Then her arms fell along her body.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And with our mother looking on," she murmured.<lb/>
"My own sister &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">Chica!"</hi><lb/>
</p>

<p>     The whole refracting apparatus, with its brass fittings<lb/>
and rings of prisms, glittered and sparkled like a dome-<lb/>
shaped shrine of diamonds, containing not a lamp, but<lb/>
some sacred flame, dominating the sea. And Linda, the<lb/>
keeper, in black, with a pale face, drooped low in a<lb/>
wooden chair, alone with her jealousy, far above the<lb/>
shames and passions of the earth. A strange, dragging<lb/>
pain as if somebody were pulling her about brutally<lb/>
by her dark hair with bronze glints, made her put her<lb/>
hands up to her temples. They would meet. They<lb/>
would meet. And she knew where, too. At the window.<lb/>
The sweat of torture fell in drops on her cheeks, while<lb/>
the moonlight in the offing closed as if with a colossal<lb/>
bar of silver the entrance of the Placid Gulf &mdash; the sombre<lb/>
cavern of clouds and stillness in the surf-fretted seaboard.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    Linda Viola stood up suddenly with a finger on her lip.<lb/>
He loved neither her nor her sister. The whole thing<lb/>


<pb n="553"/>

seemed so objectless as to frighten her, and also give her<lb/>
some hope. Why did he not carry her off? What prevented<lb/>
him? He was incomprehensible. What were<lb/>
they waiting for? For what end were these two lying<lb/>
and deceiving? Not for the ends of their love. There<lb/>
was no such thing. The hope of regaining him for<lb/>
herself made her break her vow of not leaving the tower<lb/>
that night. She must talk at once to her father, who<lb/>
was wise, and would understand. She ran down the<lb/>
spiral stairs. At the moment of opening the door at<lb/>
the bottom she heard the sound of the first shot ever<lb/>
fired on the Great Isabel.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She felt a shock, as though the bullet had struck her<lb/>
breast. She ran on without pausing. The cottage was<lb/>
dark. She cried at the door, "Giselle! Giselle!" then<lb/>
dashed round the corner and screamed her sister's name<lb/>
at the open window, without getting an answer; but<lb/>
as she was rushing, distracted, round the house, Giselle<lb/>
came out of the door, and darted past her, running<lb/>
silently, her hair loose, and her eyes staring straight<lb/>
ahead. She seemed to skim along the grass as if on<lb/>
tiptoe, and vanished.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda walked on slowly, with her arms stretched out<lb/>
before her. All was still on the island; she did not know<lb/>
where she was going. The tree under which Martin<lb/>
Decoud spent his last days, beholding life like a succession<lb/>
of senseless images, threw a large blotch of<lb/>
black shade upon the grass. Suddenly she saw her<lb/>
father, standing quietly all alone in the moonlight.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The Garibaldino &mdash; big, erect, with his snow-white<lb/>
hair and beard &mdash; had a monumental repose in his immobility,<lb/>
leaning upon a rifle. She put her hand upon<lb/>
his arm lightly. He never stirred.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "What have you done?" she asked, in her ordinary<lb/>
voice.<lb/>


<pb n="554"/>

</p>

<p>     "I have shot Ramirez &mdash; <hi rend="italic">infame!"</hi> he answered, with<lb/>
his eyes directed to where the shade was blackest.<lb/>
"Like a thief he came, and like a thief he fell. The<lb/>
child had to be protected."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He did not offer to move an inch, to advance a single<lb/>
step. He stood there, rugged and unstirring, like a<lb/>
statue of an old man guarding the honour of his house.<lb/>
Linda removed her trembling hand from his arm, firm<lb/>
and steady like an arm of stone, and, without a word,<lb/>
entered the blackness of the shade. She saw a stir of<lb/>
formless shapes on the ground, and stopped short. A<lb/>
murmur of despair and tears grew louder to her strained<lb/>
hearing.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I entreated you not to come to-night. Oh, my<lb/>
Giovanni! And you promised. Oh! Why &mdash; why did<lb/>
you come, Giovanni?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was her sister's voice. It broke on a heartrending<lb/>
sob. And the voice of the resourceful Capataz de<lb/>
Cargadores, master and slave of the San Tom&eacute; treasure,<lb/>
who had been caught unawares by old Giorgio while<lb/>
stealing across the open towards the ravine to get some<lb/>
more silver, answered careless and cool, but sounding<lb/>
startlingly weak from the ground.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It seemed as though I could not live through the<lb/>
night without seeing thee once more &mdash; my star, my little<lb/>
flower."<lb/>

</p>

<p>       *         *         *         *         *<lb/>

</p>

<p>     The brilliant tertulia was just over, the last guests had<lb/>
departed, and the Se&ntilde;or Administrador had gone to his<lb/>
room already, when Dr. Monygham, who had been expected<lb/>
in the evening but had not turned up, arrived<lb/>
driving along the wood-block pavement under the<lb/>
electric-lamps of the deserted Calle de la Constitucion,<lb/>
and found the great gateway of the Casa still open.<lb/>


<pb n="555"/>

</p>

<p>     He limped in, stumped up the stairs, and found the<lb/>
fat and sleek Basilio on the point of turning off the<lb/>
lights in the sala. The prosperous majordomo remained<lb/>
open-mouthed at this late invasion.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Don't put out the lights," commanded the doctor.<lb/>
"I want to see the se&ntilde;ora."<lb/>
</p>

<p> "The se&ntilde;ora is in the Se&ntilde;or Adminstrador's cancillaria,"<lb/>
said Basilio, in an unctuous voice. "The Se&ntilde;or<lb/>
Administrador starts for the mountain in an hour.<lb/>
There is some trouble with the workmen to be feared, it<lb/>
appears. A shameless people without reason and decency.<lb/>
And idle, se&ntilde;or. Idle."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You are shamelessly lazy and imbecile yourself,"<lb/>
said the doctor, with that faculty for exasperation which<lb/>
made him so generally beloved. "Don't put the lights<lb/>
out."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Basilio retired with dignity. Dr. Monygham, waiting<lb/>
in the brilliantly lighted sala, heard presently a door close<lb/>
at the further end of the house. A jingle of spurs<lb/>
died out. The Se&ntilde;or Administrador was off to the<lb/>
mountain.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     With a measured swish of her long train, flashing with<lb/>
jewels and the shimmer of silk, her delicate head bowed<lb/>
as if under the weight of a mass of fair hair, in which<lb/>
the silver threads were lost, the "first lady of Sulaco,"<lb/>
as Captain Mitchell used to describe her, moved along<lb/>
the lighted <hi rend="italic">corredor</hi>, wealthy beyond great dreams of<lb/>
wealth, considered, loved, respected, honoured, and as<lb/>
solitary as any human being had ever been, perhaps,<lb/>
on this earth.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor's "Mrs. Gould! One minute!" stopped<lb/>
her with a start at the door of the lighted and empty<lb/>
sala. From the similarity of mood and circumstance,<lb/>
the sight of the doctor, standing there all alone amongst<lb/>
the groups of furniture, recalled to her emotional memory<lb/>


<pb n="556"/>

her unexpected meeting with Martin Decoud; she<lb/>
seemed to hear in the silence the voice of that man,<lb/>
dead miserably so many years ago, pronounce the<lb/>
words, "Antonia left her fan here." But it was the<lb/>
doctor's voice that spoke, a little altered by his excitement.<lb/>
She remarked his shining eyes.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Mrs. Gould, you are wanted. Do you know what<lb/>
has happened? You remember what I told you yesterday<lb/>
about Nostromo. Well, it seems that a lancha,<lb/>
a decked boat, coming from Zapiga, with four negroes<lb/>
in her, passing close to the Great Isabel, was hailed<lb/>
from the cliff by a woman's voice &mdash; Linda's, as a matter<lb/>
of fact &mdash; commanding them (it's a moonlight night) to<lb/>
go round to the beach and take up a wounded man to<lb/>
the town. The <hi rend="italic">patron</hi> (from whom I've heard all this),<lb/>
of course, did so at once. He told me that when they<lb/>
got round to the low side of the Great Isabel, they<lb/>
found Linda Viola waiting for them. They followed<lb/>
her: she led them under a tree not far from the cottage.<lb/>
There they found Nostromo lying on the ground with<lb/>
his head in the younger girl's lap, and father Viola<lb/>
standing some distance off leaning on his gun. Under<lb/>
Linda's direction they got a table out of the cottage for a<lb/>
stretcher, after breaking off the legs. They are here,<lb/>
Mrs. Gould. I mean Nostromo and &mdash; and Giselle.<lb/>
The negroes brought him in to the first-aid hospital<lb/>
near the harbour. He made the attendant send for<lb/>
me. But it was not me he wanted to see &mdash; it was you,<lb/>
Mrs. Gould! It was you."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Me?" whispered Mrs. Gould, shrinking a little.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes, you!" the doctor burst out. "He begged me<lb/>
&mdash; his enemy, as he thinks &mdash; to bring you to him at once.<lb/>
It seems he has something to say to you alone."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Impossible!" murmured Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He said to me, 'Remind her that I have done something<lb/>


<pb n="557"/>

to keep a roof over her head.' . . . Mrs.<lb/>
Gould," the doctor pursued, in the greatest excitement.<lb/>
"Do you remember the silver? The silver in<lb/>
the lighter &mdash; that was lost?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould remembered. But she did not say she<lb/>
hated the mere mention of that silver. Frankness<lb/>
personified, she remembered with an exaggerated horror<lb/>
that for the first and last time of her life she had concealed<lb/>
the truth from her husband about that very<lb/>
silver. She had been corrupted by her fears at that<lb/>
time, and she had never forgiven herself. Moreover,<lb/>
that silver, which would never have come down if her<lb/>
husband had been made acquainted with the news<lb/>
brought by Decoud, had been in a roundabout way<lb/>
nearly the cause of Dr. Monygham's death. And these<lb/>
things appeared to her very dreadful.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Was it lost, though?" the doctor exclaimed. "I've<lb/>
always felt that there was a mystery about our Nostromo<lb/>
ever since. I do believe he wants now, at the<lb/>
point of death &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The point of death?" repeated Mrs. Gould.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes. Yes. . . . He wants perhaps to tell<lb/>
you something concerning that silver which &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Oh, no! No!" exclaimed Mrs. Gould, in a low<lb/>
voice. "Isn't it lost and done with? Isn't there<lb/>
enough treasure without it to make everybody in the<lb/>
world miserable?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The doctor remained still, in a submissive, disappointed<lb/>
silence. At last he ventured, very low &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "And there is that Viola girl, Giselle. What are<lb/>
we to do? It looks as though father and sister had &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould admitted that she felt in duty bound to<lb/>
do her best for these girls.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I have a volante here," the doctor said. "If you<lb/>
don't mind getting into that &mdash;"<lb/>


<pb n="558"/>

</p>

<p>     He waited, all impatience, till Mrs. Gould reappeared,<lb/>
having thrown over her dress a grey cloak<lb/>
with a deep hood.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     It was thus that, cloaked and monastically hooded<lb/>
over her evening costume, this woman, full of endurance<lb/>
and compassion, stood by the side of the bed on which<lb/>
the splendid Capataz de Cargadores lay stretched out<lb/>
motionless on his back. The whiteness of sheets and<lb/>
pillows gave a sombre and energetic relief to his bronzed.<lb/>
face, to the dark, nervous hands, so good on a tiller,<lb/>
upon a bridle and on a trigger, lying open and idle<lb/>
upon a white coverlet.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She is innocent," the Capataz was saying in a deep<lb/>
and level voice, as though afraid that a louder word<lb/>
would break the slender hold his spirit still kept upon<lb/>
his body. "She is innocent. It is I alone. But no<lb/>
matter. For these things I would answer to no man<lb/>
or woman alive."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He paused. Mrs. Gould's face, very white within the<lb/>
shadow of the hood, bent over him with an invincible<lb/>
and dreary sadness. And the low sobs of Giselle Viola,<lb/>
kneeling at the end of the bed, her gold hair with coppery<lb/>
gleams loose and scattered over the Capataz's<lb/>
feet, hardly troubled the silence of the room.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ha! Old Giorgio &mdash; the guardian of thine honour!<lb/>
Fancy the Vecchio coming upon me so light of foot, so<lb/>
steady of aim. I myself could have done no better.<lb/>
But the price of a charge of powder might have been<lb/>
saved. The honour was safe. . . . Se&ntilde;ora, she<lb/>
would have followed to the end of the world Nostromo<lb/>
the thief. . . . I have said the word. The spell<lb/>
is broken!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A low moan from the girl made him cast his eyes<lb/>
down.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I cannot see her. . . . No matter," he went on,<lb/>


<pb n="559"/>

with the shadow of the old magnificent carelessness in<lb/>
his voice. "One kiss is enough, if there is no time for<lb/>
more. An airy soul, se&ntilde;ora! Bright and warm, like<lb/>
sunshine &mdash; soon clouded, and soon serene. They would<lb/>
crush it there between them. Se&ntilde;ora, cast on her the<lb/>
eye of your compassion, as famed from one end of the<lb/>
land to the other as the courage and daring of the man<lb/>
who speaks to you. She will console herself in time.<lb/>
And even Ramirez is not a bad fellow. I am not angry.<lb/>
No! It is not Ramirez who overcame the Capataz<lb/>
of the Sulaco Cargadores." He paused, made an effort,<lb/>
and in louder voice, a little wildly, declared &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I die betrayed &mdash; betrayed by &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But he did not say by whom or by what he was dying<lb/>
betrayed.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She would not have betrayed me," he began again,<lb/>
opening his eyes very wide. "She was faithful. We<lb/>
were going very far &mdash; very soon. I could have torn<lb/>
myself away from that accursed treasure for her. For<lb/>
that child I would have left boxes and boxes of it &mdash; full.<lb/>
And Decoud took four. Four ingots. Why? <hi rend="italic">Picardia!</hi><lb/>
To betray me? How could I give back the treasure<lb/>
with four ingots missing? They would have said I<lb/>
had purloined them. The doctor would have said that.<lb/>
Alas! it holds me yet!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould bent low, fascinated &mdash; cold with apprehension.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "What became of Don Martin on that night, Nostromo?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    "Who knows? I wondered what would become of<lb/>
me. Now I know. Death was to come upon me unawares.<lb/>
He went away! He betrayed me. And you<lb/>
think I have killed him! You are all alike, you fine<lb/>
people. The silver has killed me. It has held me. It<lb/>
holds me yet. Nobody knows where it is. But you are<lb/>


<pb n="560"/>

the wife of Don Carlos, who put it into my hands and<lb/>
said, 'Save it on your life.' And when I returned, and<lb/>
you all thought it was lost, what do I hear? 'It was<lb/>
nothing of importance. Let it go. Up, Nostromo, the<lb/>
faithful, and ride away to save us, for dear life!'"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Nostromo!" Mrs. Gould whispered, bending very<lb/>
low. "I, too, have hated the idea of that silver from<lb/>
the bottom of my heart."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Marvellous! &mdash; that one of you should hate the<lb/>
wealth that you know so well how to take from the<lb/>
hands of the poor. The world rests upon the poor,<lb/>
as old Giorgio says. You have been always good to the<lb/>
poor. But there is something accursed in wealth.<lb/>
Se&ntilde;ora, shall I tell you where the treasure is? To you<lb/>
alone. . . . Shining! Incorruptible!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     A pained, involuntary reluctance lingered in his tone,<lb/>
in his eyes, plain to the woman with the genius of sympathetic<lb/>
intuition. She averted her glance from the<lb/>
miserable subjection of the dying man, appalled, wishing<lb/>
to hear no more of the silver.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, Capataz," she said. "No one misses it now.<lb/>
Let it be lost for ever."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     After hearing these words, Nostromo closed his eyes,<lb/>
uttered no word, made no movement. Outside the<lb/>
door of the sick-room Dr. Monygham, excited to the<lb/>
highest pitch, his eyes shining with eagerness, came up<lb/>
to the two women.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Now, Mrs. Gould," he said, almost brutally in his<lb/>
impatience, "tell me, was I right? There is a mystery.<lb/>
You have got the word of it, have you not? He told<lb/>
you &mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He told me nothing," said Mrs. Gould, steadily.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The light of his temperamental enmity to Nostromo<lb/>
went out of Dr. Monygham's eyes. He stepped back<lb/>
submissively. He did not believe Mrs. Gould. But<lb/>

her word was law. He accepted her denial like an<lb/>
inexplicable fatality affirming the victory of Nostromo's<lb/>
genius over his own. Even before that woman, whom<lb/>
he loved with secret devotion, he had been defeated<lb/>
by the magnificent Capataz de Cargadores, the man<lb/>
who had lived his own life on the assumption of unbroken<lb/>
fidelity, rectitude, and courage!<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Pray send at once somebody for my carriage,"<lb/>
spoke Mrs. Gould from within her hood. Then, turning<lb/>
to Giselle Viola, "Come nearer me, child; come<lb/>
closer. We will wait here."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Giselle Viola, heartbroken and childlike, her face<lb/>
veiled in her falling hair, crept up to her side. Mrs.<lb/>
Gould slipped her hand through the arm of the unworthy<lb/>
daughter of old Viola, the immaculate republican,<lb/>
the hero without a stain. Slowly, gradually,<lb/>
as a withered flower droops, the head of the girl, who<lb/>
would have followed a thief to the end of the world,<lb/>
rested on the shoulder of Do&ntilde;a Emilia, the first lady<lb/>
of Sulaco, the wife of the Se&ntilde;or Administrador of the<lb/>
San Tom&eacute; mine. And Mrs. Gould, feeling her suppressed<lb/>
sobbing, nervous and excited, had the first<lb/>
and only moment of bitterness in her life. It was<lb/>
worthy of Dr. Monygham himself.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Console yourself, child. Very soon he would have<lb/>
forgotten you for his treasure."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Se&ntilde;ora, he loved me. He loved me," Giselle whispered,<lb/>
despairingly. "He loved me as no one had ever<lb/>
been loved before."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "I have been loved, too," Mrs. Gould said in a severe<lb/>
tone.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Giselle clung to her convulsively. "Oh, se&ntilde;ora,<lb/>
but you shall live adored to the end of your life," she<lb/>
sobbed out.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Mrs. Gould kept an unbroken silence till the carriage<lb/>


<pb n="562"/>

arrived. She helped in the half-fainting girl. After<lb/>
the doctor had shut the door of the landau, she leaned<lb/>
over to him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You can do nothing?" she whispered.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "No, Mrs. Gould. Moreover, he won't let us touch<lb/>
him. It does not matter. I just had one look. . . .<lb/>
Useless."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     But he promised to see old Viola and the other girl<lb/>
that very night. He could get the police-boat to take<lb/>
him off to the island. He remained in the street, looking<lb/>
after the landau rolling away slowly behind the<lb/>
white mules.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The rumour of some accident &mdash; an accident to Captain<lb/>
Fidanza &mdash; had been spreading along the new quays<lb/>
with their rows of lamps and the dark shapes of towering<lb/>
cranes. A knot of night prowlers &mdash; the poorest of<lb/>
the poor &mdash; hung about the door of the first-aid hospital,<lb/>
whispering in the moonlight of the empty street.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     There was no one with the wounded man but the pale<lb/>
photographer, small, frail, bloodthirsty, the hater of<lb/>
capitalists, perched on a high stool near the head of the<lb/>
bed with his knees up and his chin in his hands. He<lb/>
had been fetched by a comrade who, working late on<lb/>
the wharf, had heard from a negro belonging to a lancha,<lb/>
that Captain Fidanza had been brought ashore mortally<lb/>
wounded.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Have you any dispositions to make, comrade?"<lb/>
he asked, anxiously. "Do not forget that we want<lb/>
money for our work. The rich must be fought with<lb/>
their own weapons."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Nostromo made no answer. The other did not insist,<lb/>
remaining huddled up on the stool, shock-headed,<lb/>
wildly hairy, like a hunchbacked monkey. Then, after<lb/>
a long silence &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Comrade Fidanza," he began, solemnly, "you have<lb/>


<pb n="563"/>

refused all aid from that doctor. Is he really a dangerous<lb/>
enemy of the people?"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     In the dimly lit room Nostromo rolled his head slowly<lb/>
on the pillow and opened his eyes, directing at the weird<lb/>
figure perched by his bedside a glance of enigmatic and<lb/>
profound inquiry. Then his head rolled back, his eyelids<lb/>
fell, and the Capataz de Cargadores died without a<lb/>
word or moan after an hour of immobility, broken by<lb/>
short shudders testifying to the most atrocious sufferings.<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    Dr. Monygham, going out in the police-galley to the<lb/>
islands, beheld the glitter of the moon upon the gulf<lb/>
and the high black shape of the Great Isabel sending<lb/>
a shaft of light afar, from under the canopy of clouds.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Pull easy," he said, wondering what he would find<lb/>
there. He tried to imagine Linda and her father, and<lb/>
discovered a strange reluctance within himself. "Pull<lb/>
easy," he repeated.<lb/>

</p>

<p>     *        *        *        *        *        *<lb/>

</p>

<p>     From the moment he fired at the thief of his honour,<lb/>
Giorgio Viola had not stirred from the spot. He stood,<lb/>
his old gun grounded, his hand grasping the barrel near<lb/>
the muzzle. After the lancha carrying off Nostromo<lb/>
for ever from her had left the shore, Linda, coming up,<lb/>
stopped before him. He did not seem to be aware of<lb/>
her presence, but when, losing her forced calmness,<lb/>
she cried out &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Do you know whom you have killed?" he answered<lb/>
&mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Ramirez the vagabond."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     White, and staring insanely at her father, Linda<lb/>
laughed in his face. After a time he joined her faintly<lb/>
in a deep-toned and distant echo of her peals. Then<lb/>
she stopped, and the old man spoke as if startled &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "He cried out in son Gian' Battista's voice."<lb/>


<pb n="564"/>

</p>

<p>     The gun fell from his opened hand, but the arm remained<lb/>
extended for a moment as if still supported.<lb/>
Linda seized it roughly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You are too old to understand. Come into the<lb/>
house."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     He let her lead him. On the threshold he stumbled<lb/>
heavily, nearly coming to the ground together with<lb/>
his daughter. His excitement, his activity of the last<lb/>
few days, had been like the flare of a dying lamp. He<lb/>
caught at the back of his chair.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "In son Gian' Battista's voice," he repeated in a<lb/>
severe tone. "I heard him &mdash; Ramirez &mdash; the miserable<lb/>
&mdash;"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda helped him into the chair, and, bending low,<lb/>
hissed into his ear &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "You have killed Gian' Battista."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The old man smiled under his thick moustache.<lb/>
Women had strange fancies.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Where is the child?" he asked, surprised at the penetrating<lb/>
chilliness of the air and the unwonted dimness<lb/>
of the lamp by which he used to sit up half the night<lb/>
with the open Bible before him.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda hesitated a moment, then averted her eyes.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "She is asleep," she said. "We shall talk of her tomorrow."<lb/>
</p>

<p>
    She could not bear to look at him. He filled her with<lb/>
terror and with an almost unbearable feeling of pity.<lb/>
She had observed the change that came over him. He<lb/>
would never understand what he had done; and even<lb/>
to her the whole thing remained incomprehensible.<lb/>
He said with difficulty &mdash;<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Give me the book."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda laid on the table the closed volume in its worn<lb/>
leather cover, the Bible given him ages ago by an<lb/>
Englishman in Palermo.<lb/>


<pb n="565"/>

</p>

<p>     "The child had to be protected," he said, in a strange,<lb/>
mournful voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Behind his chair Linda wrung her hands, crying without<lb/>
noise. Suddenly she started for the door. He<lb/>
heard her move.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Where are you going? "he asked.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "To the light," she answered, turning round to look<lb/>
at him balefully.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "The light! Si &mdash; duty."<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Very upright, white-haired, leonine, heroic in his<lb/>
absorbed quietness, he felt in the pocket of his red shirt<lb/>
for the spectacles given him by Do&ntilde;a Emilia. He put<lb/>
them on. After a long period of immobility he opened<lb/>
the book, and from on high looked through the glasses<lb/>
at the small print in double columns. A rigid, stern<lb/>
expression settled upon his features with a slight frown,<lb/>
as if in response to some gloomy thought or unpleasant<lb/>
sensation. But he never detached his eyes from the<lb/>
book while he swayed forward, gently, gradually, till<lb/>
his snow-white head rested upon the open pages. A<lb/>
wooden clock ticked methodically on the white-washed<lb/>
wall, and growing slowly cold the Garibaldino lay<lb/>
alone, rugged, undecayed, like an old oak uprooted by<lb/>
a treacherous gust of wind.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     The light of the Great Isabel burned unfailing above<lb/>
the lost treasure of the San Tom&eacute; mine. Into the<lb/>
bluish sheen of a night without stars the lantern sent<lb/>
out a yellow beam towards the far horizon. Like a<lb/>
black speck upon the shining panes, Linda, crouching<lb/>
in the outer gallery, rested her head on the rail.   The<lb/>
moon, drooping in the western board, looked at her<lb/>
radiantly.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Below, at the foot of the cliff, the regular splash of<lb/>
oars from a passing boat ceased, and Dr. Monygham<lb/>
stood up in the stern sheets.<lb/>


<pb n="566"/>

</p>

<p>     "Linda!" he shouted, throwing back his head.<lb/>
"Linda!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda stood up. She had recognized the voice.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Is he dead?" she cried, bending over.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Yes, my poor girl. I am coming round," the doctor<lb/>
answered from below. "Pull to the beach," he said<lb/>
to the rowers.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Linda's black figure detached itself upright on the<lb/>
light of the lantern with her arms raised above her head<lb/>
as though she were going to throw herself over.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "It is I who loved you," she whispered, with a face<lb/>
as set and white as marble in the moonlight. "I!<lb/>
Only I! She will forget thee, killed miserably for<lb/>
her pretty face. I cannot understand. I cannot understand.<lb/>
But I shall never forget thee. Never!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     She stood silent and still, collecting her strength to<lb/>
throw all her fidelity, her pain, bewilderment, and despair<lb/>
into one great cry.<lb/>
</p>

<p>     "Never! Gian' Battista!"<lb/>
</p>

<p>     Dr. Monygham, pulling round in the police-galley,<lb/>
heard the name pass over his head. It was another<lb/>
of Nostromo's triumphs, the greatest, the most enviable,<lb/>
the most sinister of all. In that true cry of<lb/>
undying passion that seemed to ring aloud from Punta<lb/>
Mala to Azuera and away to the bright line of the<lb/>
horizon, overhung by a big white cloud shining like a<lb/>
mass of solid silver, the genius of the magnificent Capataz<lb/>
de Cargadores dominated the dark gulf containing<lb/>
his conquests of treasure and love.<lb/>
