</head>

<head type="main"> MY FIRST DAY.</head>
 
<p> THOUGH an illness left me unable to continue my college 
course, my pride kept me from returning to my mother.  Had she 
known of my worn condition, she would have said the white man's 
papers were not worth the freedom and health I had lost by them.  
Such a rebuke from my mother would have been unbearable, and as I 
felt then it would be far too true to be comfortable. 
</p><p> Since the winter when I had my first dreams about red apples 
I had been traveling slowly toward the morning horizon.  There had 
been no doubt about <pb n="382"/>  the direction in which I wished to go 
to spend my energies in a work for the Indian race.  Thus I had 
written my mother briefly, saying my plan for the year was to teach 
in an Eastern Indian school.  Sending this message to her in the 
West, I started at once eastward. 
</p><p> Thus I found myself, tired and hot, in a black veiling of car 
smoke, as I stood wearily on a street corner of an old-fashioned 
town, waiting for a car.  In a few moments more I should be on the 
school grounds, where a new work was ready for my inexperienced 
hands. 
</p><p> Upon entering the school campus, I was surprised at the 
thickly clustered buildings which made it a quaint little village, 
much more interesting than the town itself.  The large trees among 
the house gave the place a cool, refreshing shade, and the grass a 
deeper green.  Within this large court of grass and trees stood a 
low green pump.  The queer boxlike case had a revolving handle on 
its side, which clanked and creaked constantly. 
</p><p> I made myself known and was shown to my room,&mdash;a small, 
carpeted room, with ghastly walls and ceiling.  The two windows, 
both on the same side, were curtained with heavy muslin yellowed 
with age.  A clean white bed was in one corner of the room, and 
opposite it was a square pine table covered with a black woolen 
blanket. 
</p><p> Without removing my hat from my head, I seated myself in one 
of the two stiff-backed chairs that were placed beside the table.  
For several heart throbs I sat still, looking from ceiling to 
floor, from wall to wall, trying hard to imagine years of 
contentment there.  Even while I was wondering if my exhausted 
strength would sustain me through this undertaking, I heard a heavy 
tread stop at my door.  Opening it, I met the imposing figure of a 
stately gray-haired man.  With a light straw hat in one hand, and 
the right hand extended for greeting, he smiled kindly upon me.  
For some reason I was awed by his wondrous height and his strong 
square shoulders, which I felt were a finger's length above my 
head. 
</p><p> I was always slight, and my serious illness in the early 
spring had made me look rather frail and languid.  His quick eye 
measured my height and breadth.  Then he looked into my face.  I 
imagined that a visible shadow flitted across his countenance as he 
let my hand fall.  I knew he was no other than my employer. 
</p><p> "Ah ha! so you are the little Indian girl who created the 
excitement among the college orators!" he said, more to himself 
than to me.  I thought I heard a subtle note of disappointment in 
his voice.  Looking in from where he stood, with one sweeping 
glance, he asked if I lacked anything for my room. 
</p><p> After he turned to go, I listened to his step until it grew 
faint and was lost in the distance.  I was aware that my car-smoked 
appearance had not concealed the lines of pain on my face. 
</p><p> For a short moment my spirit laughed at my ill fortune, and I 
entertained the idea of exerting myself to make an improvement.  
But as I tossed my hat off a leaden weakness came over me, and I 
felt as if years of weariness lay like water-soaked logs upon me.  
I threw myself upon the bed, and, closing my eyes, forgot my good 
intention.

<div1 type="chapter" n="II" id="d4"> 
<head> A TRIP WESTWARD.</head> 
 
<p> One sultry month I sat at a desk heaped up with work.  Now, as 
I recall it, I wonder how I could have dared to disregard nature's 
warning with such recklessness.  Fortunately, my inheritance of a 
marvelous endurance enabled me to bend without breaking. 
</p><p> Though I had gone to and fro, from my room to the office, in 
an unhappy <pb n="383"/>  silence, I was watched by those around me.  On 
an early morning I was summoned to the superintendent's office.  
For a half hour I listened to his words, and when I returned to my 
room I remembered one sentence above the rest.  It was this: "I am 
going to turn you loose to pasture!"  He was sending me West to 
gather Indian pupils for the school, and this was his way of 
expressing it. 
</p><p> I needed nourishment, but the mid-summer's travel across the 
continent to search the hot prairies for overconfident parents who 
would intrust their children to strangers was a lean pasturage.  
However, I dwelt on the hope of seeing my mother.  I tried to 
reason that a change was a rest.  Within a couple of days I started 
toward my mother's home. 
</p><p> The intense heat and the sticky car smoke that followed my 
homeward trail did not noticeably restore my vitality.  Hour after 
hour I gazed upon the country which was receding rapidly from me.  
I noticed the gradual expansion of the horizon as we emerged out of 
the forests into the plains.  The great high buildings, whose 
towers overlooked the dense woodlands, and whose gigantic clusters 
formed large cities, diminished, together with the groves, until 
only little log cabins lay snugly in the bosom of the vast prairie.  
The cloud shadows which drifted about on the waving yellow of long-dried grasses thrilled me like the meeting of old friends. 
</p><p> At a small station, consisting of a single frame house with a 
rickety board walk around it, I alighted from the iron horse, just 
thirty miles from my mother and my brother Dawee.  A strong hot 
wind seemed determined to blow my hat off, and return me to olden 
days when I roamed bareheaded over the hills.  After the puffing 
engine of my train was gone, I stood on the platform in deep 
solitude.  In the distance I saw the gently rolling land leap up 
into bare hills.  At their bases a broad gray road was winding 
itself round about them until it came by the station.  Among these 
hills I rode in a light conveyance, with a trusty driver, whose 
unkempt flaxen hair hung shaggy about his ears and his leather neck 
of reddish tan.  From accident or decay he had lost one of his long 
front teeth. 
</p><p> Though I call him a paleface, his cheeks were of a brick red.  
His moist blue eyes, blurred and bloodshot, twitched involuntarily.  
For a long time he had driven through grass and snow from this 
solitary station to the Indian village.  His weather-stained 
clothes fitted badly his warped shoulders.  He was stooped, and his 
protruding chin, with its tuft of dry flax, nodded as monotonously 
as did the head of his faithful beast. 
</p><p> All the morning I looked about me, recognizing old familiar 
sky lines of rugged bluffs and round-topped hills.  By the roadside 
I caught glimpses of various plants whose sweet roots were 
delicacies among my people.  When I saw the first cone-shaped 
wigwam, I could not help uttering an exclamation which caused my 
driver a sudden jump out of his drowsy nodding. 
</p><p> At noon, as we drove through the eastern edge of the 
reservation, I grew very impatient and restless.  Constantly I 
wondered what my mother would say upon seeing her little daughter 
grown tall.  I had not written her the day of my arrival, thinking 
I would surprise her.  Crossing a ravine thicketed with low shrubs 
and plum bushes, we approached a large yellow acre of wild 
sunflowers.  Just beyond this nature's garden we drew near to my 
mother's cottage.  Close by the log cabin stood a little canvas-covered wigwam.  The driver stopped in front of the open door, and 
in a long moment my mother appeared at the threshold. 
</p><p> I had expected her to run out to greet me, but she stood 
still, all the while staring at the weather-beaten man at my  
<pb n="384"/>   
side.  At length, when her loftiness became unbearable, I 
called to her, "Mother, why do you stop?" 
</p><p> This seemed to break the evil moment, and she hastened to hold 
my head against her cheek. 
</p><p> "My daughter, what madness possessed you to bring home such a 
fellow?" she asked, pointing at the driver, who was fumbling in his 
pockets for change while he held the bill I gave him between his 
jagged teeth. 
</p><p> "Bring him!  Why, no, mother, he has brought me!  He is a 
driver!" I exclaimed. 
</p><p> Upon this revelation, my mother threw her arms about me and 
apologized for her mistaken inference.  We laughed away the 
momentary hurt.  Then she built a brisk fire on the ground in the 
tepee, and hung a blackened coffeepot on one of the prongs of a 
forked pole which leaned over the flames.  Placing a pan on a heap 
of red embers, she baked some unleavened bread.  This light 
luncheon she brought into the cabin, and arranged on a table 
covered with a checkered oilcloth. 
</p><p> My mother had never gone to school, and though she meant 
always to give up her own customs for such of the white man's ways 
as pleased her, she made only compromises.  Her two windows, 
directly opposite each other, she curtained with a pink-flowered 
print.  The naked logs were unstained, and rudely carved with the 
axe so as to fit into one another.  The sod roof was trying to 
boast of tiny sunflowers, the seeds of which had probably been 
planted by the constant wind.  As I leaned my head against the 
logs, I discovered the peculiar odor that I could not forget.  The 
rains had soaked the earth and roof so that the smell of damp clay 
was but the natural breath of such a dwelling. 
</p><p> "Mother, why is not your house cemented?  Do you have no 
interest in a more comfortable shelter?" I asked, when the apparent 
inconveniences of her home seemed to suggest indifference on her 
part. 
</p><p> "You forget, my child, that I am now old, and I do not work 
with beads any more.  Your brother Dawee, too, has lost his 
position, and we are left without means to buy even a morsel of 
food," she replied. 
</p><p> Dawee was a government clerk in our reservation when I last 
heard from him.  I was surprised upon hearing what my mother said 
concerning his lack of employment.  Seeing the puzzled expression 
on my face, she continued: "Dawee!  Oh, has he not told you that 
the Great Father at Washington sent a white son to take your 
brother's pen from him?  Since then Dawee has not been able to make 
use of the education the Eastern school has given him." 
</p><p> I found no words with which to answer satisfactorily.  I found 
no reason with which to cool my inflamed feelings. 
</p><p> Dawee was a whole day's journey off on the prairie, and my 
mother did not expect him until the next day.  We were silent. 
</p><p> When, at length, I raised my head to hear more clearly the 
moaning of the wind in the corner logs, I noticed the daylight 
streaming into the dingy room through several places where the logs 
fitted unevenly.  Turning to my mother, I urged her to tell me more 
about Dawee's trouble, but she only said: "Well, my daughter, this 
village has been these many winters a refuge for white robbers.  
The Indian cannot complain to the Great Father in Washington 
without suffering outrage for it here.  Dawee tried to secure 
justice for our tribe in a small matter, and to-day you see the 
folly of it." 
</p><p> Again, though she stopped to hear what I might say, I was 
silent. 
</p><p> "My child, there is only one source of justice, and I have 
been praying steadfastly to the Great Spirit to avenge our wrongs," 
she said, seeing I did not move my lips. <pb n="385"/>  
</p><p> My shattered energy was unable to hold longer any faith, and 
I cried out desperately: "Mother, don't pray again!  The Great 
Spirit does not care if we live or die!  Let us not look for good 
or justice: then we shall not be disappointed!" 
</p><p> "Sh! my child, do not talk so madly.  There is Taku Iyotan 
Wasaka, 
<note n="1" place="foot"><p> An absolute Power.</p></note>  
to which I pray," she answered, as she stroked my head 
again as she used to do when I was a smaller child. 
 
</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="III" id="d5"> 
<head> MY MOTHER'S CURSE UPON WHITE SETTLERS.</head> 
 
<p> One black night mother and I sat alone in the dim starlight, 
in front of our wigwam.  We were facing the river, as we talked 
about the shrinking limits of the village.  She told me about the 
poverty-stricken white settlers, who lived in caves dug in the long 
ravines of the high hills across the river. 
</p><p> A whole tribe of broad-footed white beggars had rushed hither 
to make claims on those wild lands.  Even as she was telling this 
I spied a small glimmering light in the bluffs. 
</p><p> "That is a white man's lodge where you see the burning fire," 
she said.  Then, a short distance from it, only a little lower than 
the first, was another light.  As I became accustomed to the night, 
I saw more and more twinkling lights, here and there, scattered all 
along the wide black margin of the river. 
</p><p> Still looking toward the distant firelight, my mother 
continued: "My daughter, beware of the paleface.  It was the cruel 
paleface who caused the death of your sister and your uncle, my 
brave brother.  It is this same paleface who offers in one palm the 
holy papers, and with the other gives a holy baptism of firewater.  
He is the hypocrite who reads with one eye, 'Thou shalt not kill,' 
and with the other gloats upon the sufferings of the Indian race."  
Then suddenly discovering a new fire in the bluffs, she exclaimed, 
"Well, well, my daughter, there is the light of another white 
rascal!" 
</p><p> She sprang to her feet, and, standing firm beside her wigwam, 
she sent a curse upon those who sat around the hated white man's 
light.  Raising her right arm forcibly into line with her eye, she 
threw her whole might into her doubled fist as she shot it 
vehemently at the strangers.  Long she held her outstretched 
fingers toward the settler's lodge, as if an invisible power passed 
from them to the evil at which she aimed. 
 
</p>                             
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="IV" id="d6"> 
<head> RETROSPECTION.</head> 
 
<p> Leaving my mother, I returned to the school in the East.  As 
months passed over me, I slowly comprehended that the large army of 
white teachers in Indian schools had a larger missionary creed than 
I had suspected. 
</p><p> It was one which included self-preservation quite as much as 
Indian education.  When I saw an opium-eater holding a position as 
teacher of Indians, I did not understand what good was expected, 
until a Christian in power replied that this pumpkin-colored 
creature had a feeble mother to support.  An inebriate paleface sat 
stupid in a doctor's chair, while Indian patients carried their 
ailments to untimely graves, because his fair wife was dependent 
upon him for her daily food. 
</p><p> I find it hard to count that white man a teacher who tortured 
an ambitious Indian youth by frequently reminding the brave 
changeling that he was nothing but a "government pauper." 
</p><p> Though I burned with indignation upon discovering on every 
side instances no less shameful than those I have mentioned, there 
was no present help.  Even <pb n="386"/>  the few rare ones who have 
worked nobly for my race were powerless to choose workmen like 
themselves.  To be sure, a man was sent from the Great Father to 
inspect Indian schools, but what he saw was usually the students' 
sample work <hi rend="italic">made</hi> for exhibition.  I was nettled by this sly 
cunning of the workmen who hoodwinked the Indian's pale Father at 
Washington. 
</p><p> My illness, which prevented the conclusion of my college 
course, together with my mother's stories of the encroaching 
frontier settlers, left me in no mood to strain my eyes in 
searching for latent good in my white co-workers. 
</p><p> At this stage of my own evolution, I was ready to curse men of 
small capacity for being the dwarfs their God had made them.  In 
the process of my education I had lost all consciousness of the 
nature world about me.  Thus, when a hidden rage took me to the 
small white-walled prison which I then called my room, I 
unknowingly turned away from my one salvation. 
</p><p> Alone in my room, I sat like the petrified Indian woman of 
whom my mother used to tell me.  I wished my heart's burdens would 
turn me to unfeeling stone.  But alive, in my tomb, I was 
destitute! 
</p><p> For the white man's papers I had given up my faith in the 
Great Spirit.  For these same papers I had forgotten the healing in 
trees and brooks.  On account of my mother's simple view of life, 
and my lack of any, I gave her up, also.  I made no friends among 
the race of people I loathed.  Like a slender tree, I had been 
uprooted from my mother, nature, and God.  I was shorn of my 
branches, which had waved in sympathy and love for home and 
friends.  The natural coat of bark which had protected my 
oversensitive nature was scraped off to the very quick. 
</p><p> Now a cold bare pole I seemed to be, planted in a strange 
earth.  Still, I seemed to hope a day would come when my mute 
aching head, reared upward to the sky, would flash a zigzag 
lightning across the heavens.  With this dream of vent for a long-pent consciousness, I walked again amid the crowds. 
</p><p> At last, one weary day in the school-room, a new idea 
presented itself to me.  It was a new way of solving the problem of 
my inner self.  I liked it.  Thus I resigned my position as 
teacher; and now I am in an Eastern city, following the long course 
of study I have set for myself.  Now, as I look back upon the 
recent past, I see it from a distance, as a whole.  I remember how, 
from morning till evening, many specimens of civilized peoples 
visited the Indian school.  The city folks with canes and 
eyeglasses, the countrymen with sunburnt cheeks and clumsy feet, 
forgot their relative social ranks in an ignorant curiosity.  Both 
sorts of these Christian palefaces were alike astounded at seeing 
the children of savage warriors so docile and industrious. 
</p><p> As answers to their shallow inquiries they received the 
students' sample work to look upon.  Examining the neatly figured 
pages, and gazing upon the Indian girls and boys bending over their 
books, the white visitors walked out of the schoolhouse well 
satisfied: they were educating the children of the red man!  They 
were paying a liberal fee to the government employees in whose able 
hands lay the small forest of Indian timber. 
</p><p> In this fashion many have passed idly through the Indian 
schools during the last decade, afterward to boast of their charity 
to the North American Indian.  But few there are who have paused to 
question whether real life or long-lasting death lies beneath this 
semblance of civilization.</p>
