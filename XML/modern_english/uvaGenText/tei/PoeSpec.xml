<pb n="333"/>   
<p>Many years ago, it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of 
'love at first sight'; but those who think, not less than those 
who feel deeply, have always advocated its existence.  Modern 
discoveries, indeed, in what may be termed ethical magnetism or 
magneto-aesthetics, render it probable that the most natural, 
and, consequently, the truest and most intense of the human 
affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric 
sympathy &mdash; in a word, that the brightest and most enduring of the 
psychal fetters are those which are riveted by a glance.  The 
confession I am about to make will add another to the already 
almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position. 
</p><p>My story requires that I should be somewhat minute.  I am 
still a very young man &mdash; not yet twenty-two years of age.  My 
name, at present, is a very usual and rather plebeian one &mdash; 
Simpson.  I say 'at present'; for it is only lately that I have 
been so called &mdash; having legislatively adopted this surname within 
the last year, in order to receive a large inheritance left me by 
a distant male relative, Adolphus Simpson, Esq.  The bequest 
<pb n="334"/>  
was 
conditioned upon my taking the name of the testator &mdash; the family, 
not the Christian name; my Christian name is Napoleon Bonaparte &mdash; 
or, more properly, these are my first and middle appellations. 
</p><p>I assumed the name, Simpson, with some reluctance, as in my 
true patronym, Froissart, I felt a very pardonable pride &mdash; 
believing that I could trace a descent from the immortal author 
of the Chronicles.  While on the subject of names, by-the-by, I 
may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names 
of some of my immediate predecessors.  My father was a Monsieur 
Froissart, of Paris.  His wife &mdash; my mother, whom he married at 
fifteen &mdash; was a Mademoiselle Croissart, eldest daughter of 
Croissart the banker; whose wife, again, being only sixteen when 
married, was the eldest daughter of one Victor Voissart. 
Monsieur Voissart, very singularly, had married a lady of similar 
name &mdash; a Mademoiselle Moissart.  She, too, was quite a child when 
married; and her mother, also, Madame Moissart, was only fourteen 
when led to the altar.  These early marriages are usual in 
France.  Here, however, are Moissart, Voissart, Croissart, and 
Froissart, all in the direct line of descent.  My own name, 
though, as I say, became Simpson, by act of Legislature and with 
so much repugnance on my part, that, at one period, I actually 
hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and 
annoying proviso attached. 
</p><p>As to personal endowments, I am by no means deficient.  On 
the contrary, I believe that I am well made, and possess what 
nine-tenths of the world would call a handsome face.  In height I 
am five feet eleven.  My hair is black and curling.  My nose is 
sufficiently good.  My eyes are large and grey; and although, in 
fact, they are weak to a very inconvenient degree, still no 
defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance. 
The weakness itself, however, has always much annoyed me, and I 
have resorted to every remedy &mdash; short of wearing glasses.  Being 
youthful and good-looking, I naturally dislike these, and have 
absolutely refused to employ them.  I know nothing, indeed, which 
so disfigures the countenance of a young person, or so impresses 
every feature with an air of demureness, if not altogether of 
sanctimoniousness and of age.  An eye-glass, on the other hand, 
has a savour of downright foppery and affectation.  I have 
hitherto managed as well as I could without either.  But 
something too much of these merely personal details, which, after 
all, are of little importance.  I will content myself with 
saying, in addition, that my temperament is sanguine, rash, 
<pb n="335"/>  
ardent, enthusiastic &mdash; and that all my life I have been a devoted 
admirer of the women. 
</p><p>One night last winter I entered a box at the P&mdash; Theatre, 
in company with a friend, Mr Talbot.  It was an opera night, and 
the bills presented a very rare attraction, so that the house was 
excessively crowded.  We were in time, however, to obtain the 
front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with 
some little difficulty, we elbowed our way. 
</p><p>For two hours my companion, who was a musical fanatico, gave 
his undivided attention to the stage; and, in the meantime, I 
amused myself by observing the audience, which consisted, in 
chief part, of the very elite of the city.  Having satisfied 
myself upon this point, I was about turning my eyes to the prima 
donna, when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of 
the private boxes which had escaped my observation. 
</p><p>If I live a thousand years I can never forget the intense 
emotion with which I regarded this figure.  It was that of a 
female, the most exquisite I had ever beheld.  The face was so 
far turned towards the stage that, for some minutes, I could not 
obtain a view of it, &mdash; but the form was divine; no other word can 
sufficiently express its magnificent proportion &mdash; and even the 
term 'divine' seems ridiculously feeble as I write it. 
</p><p>The magic of a lovely form in woman &mdash; the necromancy of 
female gracefulness &mdash; was always a power which I had found it 
impossible to resist; but here was grace personified, incarnate, 
the beau ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions.  The 
figure, almost all of which the construction of the box permitted 
to be seen, was somewhat above the medium height, and nearly 
approached, without positively reaching, the majestic.  Its 
perfect fulness and tournure were delicious.  The head, of which 
only the back was visible, rivalled in outline that of the Greek 
Psyche, and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap 
of gaze aerienne, which put me in mind of the ventum textilem of 
Apuleius.  The right arm hung over the balustrade of the box, and 
thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry. 
Its upper portion was draperied by one of the loose open sleeves 
now in fashion.  This extended but little below the elbow. 
Beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material, close-fitting, and terminated by a cuff of rich lace, which fell 
gracefully over the top of the hand revealing only the delicate 
fingers, upon one of which sparkled a diamond ring, which I at 
once saw was of extraordinary value.  The admirable roundness of 
the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it, and 
<pb n="336"/>  
which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent aigrette 
of jewels, &mdash; telling, in words that could not be mistaken, at once 
of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer. 
</p><p>I gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an 
hour, as if I had been suddenly converted to stone; and, during 
this period, I felt the full force and truth of all that has been 
said or sung concerning 'love at first sight'.  My feelings were 
totally different from any which I had hitherto experienced, in 
the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female 
loveliness.  An unaccountable, and what I am compelled to 
consider a magnetic, sympathy of soul for soul, seemed to rivet, 
not only my vision, but my whole powers of thought and feeling, 
upon the admirable object before me.  I saw &mdash; I felt &mdash; I knew that 
I was deeply, madly, irrevocably in love &mdash; and this even before 
seeing the face of the person beloved.  So intense, indeed, was 
the passion that consumed me, that I really believed it would 
have received little if any abatement had the features, yet 
unseen, proved of merely ordinary character; so anomalous is the 
nature of the only true love &mdash; of the love at first sight &mdash; and so 
little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which 
only seem to create and control it. 
</p><p>While I was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely 
vision, a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to 
turn her head partially towards me, so that I beheld the entire 
profile of the face.  Its beauty even exceeded my anticipations &mdash; 
and yet there was something about it which disappointed me 
without my being able to tell exactly what it was.  I said 
'disappointed', but this is not altogether the word.  My 
sentiments were at once quieted and exalted.  They partook less 
of transport and more of calm enthusiasm &mdash; of enthusiastic repose. 
This state of feeling arose, perhaps, from the Madonna-like and 
matronly air of the face; and yet I at once understood that it 
could not have arisen entirely from this.  There was something 
else &mdash; some mystery which I could not develop &mdash; some expression 
about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it 
greatly heightened my interest.  In fact, I was just in that 
condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for 
any act of extravagance.  Had the lady been alone, I should 
undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards; 
but, fortunately, she was attended by two companions &mdash; a 
gentleman, and a strikingly beautiful woman, to all appearances a 
few years younger than herself. 
</p><p>I revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which I might 
<pb n="337"/>  
obtain, hereafter, an introduction to the elder lady, or, for the 
present, at all events, a more distinct view of her beauty.  I 
would have removed my position to one nearer her own, but the 
crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible; and the 
stern decrees of Fashion had, of late, imperatively prohibited 
the use of the opera-glass, in a case such as this, even had I 
been so fortunate as to have one with me &mdash; but I had not &mdash; and was 
thus in despair. 
</p><p>At length I bethought me of applying to my companion. 
</p><p>'Talbot,' I said, 'you have an opera-glass.  Let me have 
it.' 
</p><p>'An opera-glass! &mdash; no! &mdash; what do you suppose I would be doing 
with an opera-glass?'  Here he turned impatiently towards the 
stage. 
</p><p>'But, Talbot,' I continued, pulling him by the shoulder, 
'listen to me, will you?  Do you see the stage-box? &mdash; there! &mdash; no, 
the next. &mdash;   Did you ever behold as lovely a woman?' 
</p><p>'She is very beautiful, no doubt,' he said. 
</p><p>'I wonder who she can be?' 
</p><p>'Why, in the name of all that is angelic, don't you know who 
she is?  "Not to know her argues yourself unknown."  She is the 
celebrated Madame Lalande &mdash; the beauty of the day par excellence, 
and the talk of the whole town.  Immensely wealthy too &mdash; a widow &mdash; 
and a great match &mdash; has just arrived from Paris.' 
</p><p>'Do you know her?' 
</p><p>'Yes &mdash; I have the honour.' 
</p><p>'Will you introduce me?' 
</p><p>'Assuredly &mdash; with the greatest pleasure; when shall it be?' 
</p><p>'To-morrow, at one, I will call upon you at B&mdash;'s.' 
</p><p>'Very good; and now do hold your tongue, if you can.' 
</p><p>In this latter respect I was forced to take Talbot's advice; 
for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or 
suggestion, and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the 
evening with what was transacting upon the stage. 
</p><p>In the meantime I kept my eyes riveted on Madame Lalande, 
and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of 
her face.  It was exquisitely lovely: this, of course, my heart 
had told me before, even had not Talbot fully satisfied me upon 
the point &mdash; but still the unintelligible something disturbed me. 
I finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain 
air of gravity, sadness, or, still more properly, of weariness, 
which took something from the youth and freshness of the 
countenance, 
<pb n="338"/>  
only to endow it with a seraphic tenderness and 
majesty, and thus, of course, to my enthusiastic and romantic 
temperament, with an interest tenfold. 
</p><p>While I thus feasted my eyes, I perceived, at last, to my 
great trepidation, by an almost imperceptible start on the part 
of the lady, that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity 
of my gaze.  Still, I was absolutely fascinated, and could not 
withdraw it, even for an instant.  She turned aside her face, and 
again I saw only the chiselled contour of the back portion of the 
head.  After some minutes, as if urged by curiosity to see if I 
was still looking, she gradually brought her face again around 
and again encountered my burning gaze.  Her large dark eyes fell 
instantly, and a deep blush mantled her cheek.  But what was my 
astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second 
time avert her head, but that she actually took from her girdle a 
double eye-glass &mdash; elevated it &mdash; adjusted it &mdash; and then regarded me 
through it, intently and deliberately, for the space of several 
minutes. 
</p><p>Had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet I could not have been 
more thoroughly astounded &mdash; astounded only &mdash; not offended or 
disgusted in the slightest degree; although an action so bold in 
any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust.  But 
the whole thing was done with so much quietude &mdash; so much 
nonchalance &mdash; so much repose &mdash; with so evident an air of the 
highest breeding, in short &mdash; that nothing of mere effrontery was 
perceptible, and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and 
surprise. 
</p><p>I observed that, upon her first elevation of the glass, she 
had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person, 
and was withdrawing the instrument, when, as if struck by a 
second thought, she resumed it, and so continued to regard me 
with fixed attention for the space of several minutes &mdash; for five 
minutes, at the very least, I am sure. 
</p><p>This action, so remarkable in an American theatre, attracted 
very general observation, and gave rise to an indefinite 
movement, or buzz, among the audience, which, for a moment, 
filled me with confusion, but produced no visible effect upon the 
countenance of Madame Lalande. 
</p><p>Having satisfied her curiosity &mdash; if such it was &mdash; she dropped 
the glass, and quietly gave her attention again to the stage; her 
profile now being turned towards myself, as before.  I continued 
to watch her unremittingly, although I was fully conscious of my 
rudeness in so doing.  Presently I saw the head 
<pb n="339"/>  
slowly and 
slightly change its position; and soon I became convinced that 
the lady, while pretending to look at the stage was, in fact, 
attentively regarding myself.  It is needless to say what effect 
this conduct, on the part of so fascinating a woman, had upon my 
excitable mind. 
</p><p>Having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour, 
the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who 
attended her, and, while she spoke, I saw distinctly, by the 
glances of both, that the conversation had reference to myself. 
</p><p>Upon its conclusion, Madame Lalande again turned towards the 
stage, and, for a few minutes, seemed absorbed in the 
performances.  At the expiration of this period, however, I was 
thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold, for 
the second time, the eye-glass which hung at her side, fully 
confront me as before, and, disregarding the renewed buzz of the 
audience, survey me, from head to foot, with the same miraculous 
composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my 
soul. 
</p><p>This extraordinary behaviour, by throwing me into a perfect 
fever of excitement &mdash; into an absolute delirium of love &mdash; served 
rather to embolden than to disconcert me.  In the mad intensity 
of my devotion, I forgot everything but the presence and the 
majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze. 
Watching my opportunity, when I thought the audience were fully 
engaged with the opera, I at length caught the eyes of Madame 
Lalande, and, upon the instant, made a slight but unmistakable 
bow. 
</p><p>She blushed very deeply &mdash; then averted her eyes &mdash; then slowly 
and cautiously looked around, apparently to see if my rash action 
had been noticed &mdash; then leaned over towards the gentleman who sat 
by her side. 
</p><p>I now felt a burning sense of the impropriety I had 
committed, and expected nothing less than instant exposure; while 
a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and 
uncomfortably through my brain.  I was greatly and immediately 
relieved, however, when I saw the lady merely hand the gentleman 
a play-bill, without speaking; but the reader may form some 
feeble conception of my astonishment &mdash; of my profound amazement &mdash; 
my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul &mdash; when, instantly 
afterward, having again glanced furtively around, she allowed her 
bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own, and then, with 
a faint smile, disclosing a bright line of her 
<pb n="340"/>  
pearly teeth, made 
two distinct, pointed, and unequivocal affirmative inclinations 
of the head. 
</p><p>It is useless, of course, to dwell upon my joy &mdash; upon my 
transport &mdash; upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart.  If ever man was 
mad with excess of happiness, it was myself at that moment.  I 
loved.  This was my first love &mdash; so I felt it to be.  It was love supreme &mdash; 
indescribable.  It was 'love at first sight'; and at 
first sight, too, it had been appreciated and returned. 
</p><p>Yes, returned.  How and why should I doubt it for an 
instant?  What other construction could I possibly put upon such 
conduct, on the part of a lady so beautiful &mdash; so wealthy &mdash; 
evidently so accomplished &mdash; of so high breeding &mdash; of so lofty a 
position in society &mdash; in every regard so entirely respectable as I 
felt assured was Madame Lalande?  Yes, she loved me &mdash; she returned 
the enthusiasm of my love, with an enthusiasm as blind &mdash; as 
uncompromising &mdash; as uncalculating &mdash; as abandoned &mdash; and as utterly 
unbounded as my own!  These delicious fancies and reflections, 
however, were now interrupted by the falling of the drop-curtain. 
The audience rose; and the usual tumult immediately supervened. 
Quitting Talbot abruptly, I made every effort to force my way 
into closer proximity with Madame Lalande.  Having failed in 
this, on account of the crowd, I at length gave up the chase, and 
bent my steps homeward; consoling myself for my disappointment in 
not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe, by the 
reflection that I should be introduced by Talbot, in due form, 
upon the morrow. 
</p><p>This morrow at last came; that is to say, a day finally 
dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience; and then the 
hours until 'one' were snail-paced, dreary, and innumerable.  But 
even Stamboul, it is said, shall have an end, and there came an 
end to this long delay.  The clock struck.  As the last echo 
ceased, I stepped into B&mdash;'s and inquired for Talbot. 
</p><p>'Out!' said the footman &mdash; Talbot's own. 
</p><p>'Out!' I replied, staggering back half a dozen paces &mdash; 'let 
me tell you, my fine fellow, that this thing is thoroughly 
impossible and impracticable; Mr Talbot is not out.  What do you 
mean?' 
</p><p>'Nothing, sir; only Mr Talbot is not in.  That's all.  He 
rode over to S&mdash;, immediately after breakfast, and left word 
that he would not be in town again for a week.' 
</p><p>I stood petrified with horror and rage.  I endeavoured to 
reply, but my tongue refused its office.  At length I turned on 
my heel, livid with wrath, and inwardly consigning the whole 
<pb n="341"/>  
tribe of the Talbots to the innermost regions of Erebus.  It was 
evident that my considerate friend, il fanatico, had quite 
forgotten his appointment with myself &mdash; had forgotten it as soon 
as it was made.  At no time was he a very scrupulous man of his 
word.  There was no help for it; so smothering my vexation as 
well as I could, I strolled moodily up the street, propounding 
futile inquiries about Madame Lalande to every male acquaintance 
I met.  By report she was known, I found, to all &mdash; to many by 
sight &mdash; but she had been in town only a few weeks, and there were 
very few, therefore, who claimed her personal acquaintance. 
These few, being still comparatively strangers, could not, or 
would not, take the liberty of introducing me through the 
formality of a morning call.  While I stood thus, in despair, 
conversing with a trio of friends upon the all-absorbing subject 
of my heart, it so happened that the subject itself passed by. 
</p><p>'As I live, there she is!' cried one. 
</p><p>'Surprisingly beautiful!' exclaimed a second. 
</p><p>'An angel upon earth!' ejaculated a third. 
</p><p>I looked; and in an open carriage which approached us, 
passing slowly down the street, saw the enchanting vision of the 
opera, accompanied by the younger lady who had occupied a portion 
of her box. 
</p><p>'Her companion also wears remarkably well,' said the one of 
my trio who had spoken first. 
</p><p>'Astonishingly,' said the second, 'still quite a brilliant 
air; but art will do wonders.  Upon my word, she looks better 
than she did at Paris five years ago.  A beautiful woman still; &mdash; 
don't you think so, Froissart? &mdash; Simpson, I mean.' 
</p><p>'Still!' said I, 'and why shouldn't she be?  But compared 
with her friend she is as a rushlight to the evening star &mdash; a 
glow-worm to Antares.' 
</p><p>'Ha! ha! ha! &mdash; why Simpson, you have an astonishing tact at 
making discoveries &mdash; original ones, I mean.'  And here we 
separated, while one of the trio began humming a gay vaudeville, 
of which I caught only the lines &mdash; 
</p> 
<l>          Ninon, Ninon, Ninon a bas &mdash; </l> 
<l>            A bas Ninon De L'Enclos!</l> 
 
<p>During this little scene, however, one thing had served 
greatly to console me, although it fed the passion by which I was 
consumed.  As the carriage of Madame Lalande rolled by our group, 
I had observed that she recognized me; and more than this, 
<pb n="342"/>  
she 
had blessed me, by the most seraphic of all imaginable smiles, 
with no equivocal mark of the recognition. 
</p><p>As for an introduction, I was obliged to abandon all hope of 
it, until such time as Talbot should think proper to return from 
the country.  In the meantime I perseveringly frequented every 
reputable place of public amusement; and, at length, at the 
theatre, where I first saw her, I had the supreme bliss of 
meeting her, and of exchanging glances with her once again.  This 
did not occur, however, until the lapse of a fortnight.  Every 
day, in the interim, I had inquired for Talbot at his hotel, and 
every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the 
everlasting 'Not come home yet' of his footman. 
</p><p>Upon the evening in question, therefore, I was in a 
condition little short of madness.  Madame Lalande, I had been 
told, was a Parisian &mdash; had lately arrived from Paris &mdash; might she 
not suddenly return? &mdash; return before Talbot came back &mdash; and might 
she not be thus lost to me for ever?  The thought was too 
terrible to bear.  Since my future happiness was at issue, I 
resolved to act with a manly decision.  In a word, upon the 
breaking up of the play, I traced the lady to her residence, 
noted the address, and the next morning sent her a full and 
elaborate letter, in which I poured out my whole heart. 
</p><p>I spoke boldly, freely &mdash; in a word, I spoke with passion.  I 
concealed nothing &mdash; not even of my weakness.  I alluded to the 
romantic circumstances of our first meeting &mdash; even to the glances 
which had passed between us.  I went so far as to say that I felt 
assured of her love; while I offered this assurance, and my own 
intensity of devotion, as two excuses for my otherwise 
unpardonable conduct.  As a third, I spoke of my fear that she 
might quit the city before I could have the opportunity of a 
formal introduction.  I concluded the most wildly enthusiastic 
epistle ever penned, with a frank declaration of my worldly 
circumstances &mdash; of my affluence &mdash; and with an offer of my heart and 
of my hand. 
</p><p>In an agony of expectation I awaited the reply.  After what 
seemed the lapse of a century it came. 
</p><p>Yes, actually came.  Romantic as all this may appear, 
I really received a letter from Madame Lalande &mdash; the beautiful, the 
wealthy, the idolized Madame Lalande.  Her eyes &mdash; her magnificent 
eyes, had not belied her noble heart.  Like a true Frenchwoman, 
as she was, she had obeyed the frank dictates of her reason &mdash; the 
generous impulses of her nature &mdash; despising the conventional 
pruderies of the world.  She had not scorned my 
<pb n="343"/>  
proposals.  She 
had not sheltered herself in silence.  She had not returned my 
letter unopened.  She had even sent me, in reply, one penned by 
her own exquisite fingers.  It ran thus: 
</p> 

<p>Monsieur Simpson vill pardonne me for not compose de 
butefull tong of his contree so vell as might.  It is only de 
late dat I am arrive, and not yet ave de opportunite for to &mdash; 
l'etudier. 
</p><p>Vid dis apologie for the maniere, I vill now say dat, 
helas! &mdash; Monsieur Simpson ave guess but de too true.  Need I say 
de more?  Helas! am I not ready speak de too moshe? 
                                        EUGENIE LALANDE<lb/> 
</p> 

<p>This noble-spirited note I kissed a million times, and 
committed no doubt, on its account, a thousand other 
extravagances that have now escaped my memory.  Still Talbot 
would not return.  Alas! could he have formed the even vaguest 
idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend, 
would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my 
relief?  Still, however, he came not.  I wrote.  He replied.  He 
was detained by urgent business &mdash; but would shortly return.  He 
begged me not to be impatient &mdash; to moderate my transports &mdash; to read 
soothing books &mdash; to drink nothing stronger than Hock &mdash; and to bring 
the consolations of philosophy in my aid.  The fool! if he could 
not come himself, why, in the name of everything rational, could 
he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation?  I wrote him 
again, entreating him to forward one forthwith.  My letter was 
returned by that footman, with the following endorsement in 
pencil.  The scoundrel had joined his master in the country: 
</p> 

<p>Left S&mdash; yesterday, for parts unknown &mdash; did not say where &mdash; 
or when be back &mdash; so thought best to return letter, knowing your 
handwriting, and as how you is always, more or less, in a hurry. 
               Yours sincerely,<lb/> 
                                             STUBBS<lb/> 
</p> 

<p>After this, it is needless to say, that I devoted to the 
infernal deities both master and valet: &mdash; but there was little use 
in anger, and no consolation at all in complaint. 
</p><p>But I had yet a resource left, in my constitutional 
audacity.  Hitherto it had served me well, and I now resolved to 
make it avail me to the end.  Besides, after the correspondence 
which had passed between us, what act of mere informality could I 
commit, within bounds, that ought to be regarded as indecorous by 
Madame Lalande?  Since the affair of the letter, I had been in 
the habit of watching her house, and thus discovered that, about 
twilight, it was her custom to promenade, attended only by a 
negro in livery, in a public square overlooked by her 
<pb n="344"/>  
windows. 
Here, amid the luxuriant and shadowing groves, in the grey gloom 
of a sweet midsummer evening, I observed my opportunity and 
accosted her. 
</p><p>The better to deceive the servant in attendance, I did this 
with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance.  With a 
presence of mind truly Parisian, she took the cue at once, and, 
to greet me, held out the most bewitchingly little of hands.  The 
valet at once fell into the rear, and now, with hearts full to 
overflowing, we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love. 
</p><p>As Madame Lalande spoke English even less fluently than she 
wrote it, our conversation was necessarily in French.  In this 
sweet tongue, so adapted to passion, I gave loose to the 
impetuous enthusiasm of my nature, and, with all the eloquence I 
could command, besought her to consent to an immediate marriage. 
</p><p>At this impatience she smiled.  She urged the old story of 
decorum &mdash; that bug-bear which deters so many from bliss until the 
opportunity for bliss has for ever gone by.  I had most 
imprudently made it known among my friends, she observed, that I 
desired her acquaintance &mdash; thus that I did not possess it &mdash; thus, 
again, there was no possibility of concealing the date of our 
first knowledge of each other.  And then she adverted, with a 
blush, to the extreme recency of this date.  To wed immediately 
would be improper &mdash; would be indecorous &mdash; would be outre.  All this 
she said with a charming air of naivete which enraptured while it 
grieved and convinced me.  She went even so far as to accuse me, 
laughingly, of rashness &mdash; of imprudence.  She bade me remember 
that I really even knew not who she was &mdash; what were her prospects, 
her connections, her standing in society.  She begged me, but 
with a sigh, to reconsider my proposal, and termed my love an 
infatuation &mdash; a will o' the wisp &mdash; a fancy or fantasy of the 
moment, a baseless and unstable creation rather of the 
imagination than of the heart.  These things she uttered as the 
shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around 
us &mdash; and then, with a gentle pressure of her fairy-like 
hand, overthrew in a single sweet instant, all the argumentative 
fabric she had reared. 
</p><p>I replied as best I could &mdash; as only a true lover can.  I 
spoke at length, and perseveringly of my devotion, of my passion &mdash; 
of her exceeding beauty, and of my own enthusiastic admiration. 
In conclusion, I dwelt, with convincing energy, upon the perils 
that encompass the course of love &mdash; 
<pb n="345"/>  
that course of true love that 
never did run smooth &mdash; and thus deduced the manifest danger of 
rendering that course unnecessarily long. 
</p><p>This latter argument seemed finally to soften the rigour of 
her determination.  She relented; but there was yet an obstacle, 
she said, which she felt assured I had not properly considered. 
This was a delicate point &mdash; for a woman to urge, especially so; in 
mentioning it, she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her 
feelings; still, for me, every sacrifice should be made.  She 
alluded to the topic of age.  Was I aware &mdash; was I fully aware of 
this discrepancy between us?  That the age of the husband should 
surpass by a few years &mdash; even by fifteen or twenty &mdash; the age of the 
wife, was regarded by the world as admissible, and indeed, as 
even proper: but she had always entertained the belief that the 
years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the 
husband.  A discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise, too 
frequently, alas! to a life of unhappiness.  Now she was aware 
that my own age did not exceed two and twenty; and I, on the 
contrary, perhaps was not aware that the years of my Eugenie 
extended very considerably beyond that number. 
</p><p>About all this there was a nobility of soul &mdash; a dignity of 
candour &mdash; which delighted &mdash; which enchanted me &mdash; which eternally 
riveted my chains.  I could scarcely restrain the excessive 
transport which possessed me. 
</p><p>'My sweetest Eugenie,' I cried, 'what is all this about 
which you are discoursing?  Your years surpass in some measure my 
own.  But what then?  The customs of the world are so many 
conventional follies.  To those who love as ourselves, in what 
respect differs a year from an hour?  I am twenty-two, you say; 
granted: indeed, you may as well call me, at once, twenty-three. 
Now you yourself, my dearest Eugenie, can have numbered no more 
than &mdash; can have numbered no more than &mdash; no more than &mdash; than &mdash; than &mdash; 
than &mdash; ' 
</p><p>Here I paused for an instant, in the expectation that Madame 
Lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age.  But a 
Frenchwoman is seldom direct, and has always, by way of answering 
to an embarrassing query, some little practical reply of her own. 
In the present instance, Eugenie, who for a few moments past had 
seemed to be searching for something in her bosom, at length let 
fall upon the grass a miniature, which I immediately picked up 
and presented to her. 
</p><p>'Keep it!' she said, with one of her most ravishing smiles. 
'Keep it for my sake &mdash; for the sake of her whom it too 
flatteringly 
<pb n="346"/>  
represents.  Besides, upon the back of the trinket 
you may discover, perhaps, the very information you seem to 
desire.  It is now, to be sure, growing rather dark &mdash; but you can 
examine it at your leisure in the morning.  In the meantime, you 
shall be my escort home to-night.  My friends are about holding a 
little musical levee.  I can promise you, too, some good singing. 
We French are not nearly so punctilious as you Americans, and I shall 
have no difficulty in smuggling you in, in the character of 
an old acquaintance.' 
</p><p>With this, she took my arm, and I attended her home.  The 
mansion was quite a fine one, and, I believe, furnished in good 
taste.  Of this latter point, however, I am scarcely qualified to 
judge; for it was just dark as we arrived; and in American 
mansions of the better sort lights seldom, during the heat of 
summer, make their appearance at this, the most pleasant period 
of the day.  In about an hour after my arrival, to be sure, a 
single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room; 
and this apartment, I could thus see, was arranged with unusual 
good taste and even splendour; but two other rooms of the suite, 
and in which the company chiefly assembled, remained, during the 
whole evening, in a very agreeable shadow.  This is a well-conceived custom, giving the party at least a choice of light or 
shade, and one which our friends over the water could not do 
better than immediately adopt. 
</p><p>The evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious 
of my life.  Madame Lalande had not overrated the musical 
abilities of her friends; and the singing I here heard I had 
never heard excelled in any private circle out of Vienna.  The 
instrumental performers were many and of superior talents.  The 
vocalists were chiefly ladies, and no individual sang less than 
well. At length, upon a peremptory call for 'Madame Lalande', she 
arose at once, without affectation or demur, from the chaise 
longue upon which she had sat by my side, and, accompanied by one 
or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera, repaired to 
the piano in the main drawing-room.  I would have escorted her 
myself, but felt that, under the circumstances of my introduction 
to the house, I had better remain unobserved where I was.  I was 
thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing, although not of hearing, 
her sing. 
</p><p>The impression she produced upon the company seemed 
electric &mdash; but the effect upon myself was something even more.  I 
know not how adequately to describe it.  It arose in part, no 
doubt, from the sentiment of love with which I was imbued; 
<pb n="347"/>  
but 
chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the 
singer.  It is beyond the reach of art to endow either air or 
recitative with more impassioned expression than was hers.  Her 
utterance of the romance in Othello &mdash; the tone with which she gave 
the words 'Sul mio sasso', in the Capuletti &mdash; is ringing in my 
memory yet.  Her lower tones were absolutely miraculous.  Her 
voice embraced three complete octaves, extending from the 
contralto D to the D upper soprano, and, though sufficiently 
powerful to have filled the San Carlos, executed, with the 
minutest precision, every difficulty of vocal composition &mdash; 
ascending and descending scales, cadences, or fiorituri.  In the 
finale of the Sonambula, she brought about a most remarkable 
effect at the words: 
</p> 
<l>          Ah! non guinge uman pensiero</l> 
<l>          Al contento one' io son piena.</l> 
 
<p>Here, in imitation of Malibran, she modified the original 
phrase of Bellini, so as to let her voice descend to the tenor G, 
when, by a rapid transition, she struck the G above the treble 
stave, springing over an interval of two octaves. 
</p><p>Upon rising from the piano after these miracles of 
vocal execution, she resumed her seat by my side; when I expressed to 
her, in terms of the deepest enthusiasm, my delight at her 
performance.  Of my surprise I said nothing, and yet was I most 
unfeignedly surprised; for a certain feebleness, or rather a 
certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation, 
had prepared me to anticipate that, in singing, she would not 
acquit herself with any remarkable ability. 
</p><p>Our conversation was now long, earnest, uninterrupted, and 
totally unreserved.  She made me relate many of the earlier 
passages of my life, and listened with breathless attention to 
every word of the narrative.  I concealed nothing &mdash; felt that I 
had a right to conceal nothing &mdash; from her confiding affection. 
Encouraged by her candour upon the delicate point of her age, I 
entered, with perfect frankness, not only into a detail of my 
many minor vices, but made full confession of those moral and 
even of those physical infirmities, the disclosure of which, in 
demanding so much higher a degree of courage, is so much surer an 
evidence of love.  I touched upon my college indiscretions &mdash; upon 
my extravagances &mdash; upon my carousals &mdash; upon my debts &mdash; upon my 
flirtations.  I even went so far as to speak of a slightly hectic 
cough with which, at one time, I had been troubled &mdash; of a chronic 
rheumatism &mdash; of a twinge of hereditary 
<pb n="348"/>  
gout &mdash; and, in conclusion, 
of the disagreeable and inconvenient, but hitherto carefully 
concealed, weakness of my eyes. 
</p><p>'Upon this latter point,' said Madame Lalande, laughingly, 
'you have been surely injudicious in coming to confession; for 
without the confession, I take it for granted that no one would 
have accused you of the crime.  By the by,' she continued, 'have 
you any recollection &mdash; ' and here I fancied that a blush, even 
through the gloom of the apartment, became distinctly visible 
upon her cheek &mdash; 'have you any recollection, mon cher ami, of this 
little ocular assistant which now depends from my neck?' 
</p><p>As she spoke, she twirled in her fingers the identical 
double eye-glass, which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at 
the opera. 
</p><p>'Full well &mdash; alas! do I remember it,' I exclaimed, pressing 
passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my 
inspection.  They formed a complex and magnificent toy, richly 
chased and filigreed, and gleaming with jewels which, even in the 
deficient light, I could not help perceiving were of high value. 
</p><p>'Eh bien! mon ami,' she resumed with a certain empressement 
of manner that rather surprised me &mdash; 'Eh bien! mon ami, you have 
earnestly besought of me a favour which you have been pleased to 
denominate priceless.  You have demanded of me my hand upon the 
morrow.  Should I yield to your entreaties &mdash; and, I may add, to 
the pleadings of my own bosom &mdash; would I not be entitled to demand 
of you a very &mdash; a very little boon in return?' 
</p><p>'Name it!' I exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn 
upon us the observation of the company, and restrained by their 
presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet. 
'Name it, my beloved, my Eugenie, my own! &mdash; name it! &mdash; but, alas! 
it is already yielded ere named.' 
</p><p>'You shall conquer, then, mon ami,' said she, 'for the sake 
of the Eugenie whom you love, this little weakness which you have 
at last confessed &mdash; this weakness more moral than physical &mdash; and 
which, let me assure you, is so unbecoming the nobility of your 
real nature &mdash; so inconsistent with the candour of your 
usual character &mdash; and which, if permitted further control, will 
assuredly involve you, sooner or later, in some very disagreeable 
scrape.  You shall conquer, for my sake, this affectation which 
leads you, as you yourself acknowledge, to the tacit or implied 
denial of your infirmity of vision.  For, this infirmity you 
virtually deny, in refusing to employ the customary means for its 
relief.  You 
<pb n="349"/>  
will understand me to say, then, that I wish you to 
wear spectacles: &mdash; ah, hush! &mdash; you have already consented to wear 
them, for my sake.  You shall accept the little toy which I now 
hold in my hand, and which, though admirable as an aid to vision, 
is really of no immense value as a gem.  You perceive that, by a 
trifling modification thus &mdash; or thus &mdash; it can be adapted to the 
eyes in the form of spectacles, or worn in the waistcoat pocket 
as an eye-glass.  It is in the former mode, however, and 
habitually, that you have already consented to wear it for my 
sake.' 
</p><p>This request &mdash; must I confess it? &mdash; confused me in no little 
degree.  But the condition with which it was coupled rendered 
hesitation, of course, a matter altogether out of the question. 
</p><p>'It is done!' I cried, with all the enthusiasm that I could 
muster at the moment.  'It is done &mdash; it is most cheerfully agreed. 
I sacrifice every feeling for your sake.  To-night I wear this 
dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my heart; but with the 
earliest dawn of that morning which gives me the pleasure of 
calling you wife, I will place it upon my &mdash; upon my nose, &mdash; and 
there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, and less 
fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form, which 
you desire.' 
</p><p>Our conversation now turned upon the details of our 
arrangements for the morrow.  Talbot, I learned from my 
betrothed, had just arrived in town.  I was to see him at once, 
and procure a carriage.  The soiree would scarcely break up 
before two; and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door; 
when, in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the 
company, Madame L. could easily enter it unobserved.  We were 
then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting; 
there to be married, drop Talbot, and proceed on a short tour to 
the East; leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever 
comments upon the matter it thought best. 
</p><p>Having planned all this, I immediately took leave, and went 
in search of Talbot, but, on the way, I could not refrain from 
stepping into a hotel, for the purpose of inspecting the 
miniature; and this I did by the powerful aid of the glasses. 
The countenance was a surpassingly beautiful one!  Those large 
luminous eyes! &mdash; that proud Grecian nose! &mdash; those dark luxuriant 
curls! &mdash; 'Ah!' said I, exultingly to myself, 'this is indeed the 
speaking image of my beloved!'  I turned the reverse, and 
discovered the words &mdash; 'Eugenie Lalande &mdash; aged twenty-seven years 
and seven months.' 
<pb n="350"/>  
</p><p>I found Talbot at home, and proceeded at once to acquaint 
him with my good fortune.  He professed excessive astonishment, 
of course, but congratulated me most cordially, and proffered 
every assistance in his power.  In a word, we carried out our 
arrangements to the letter; and at two in the morning, just ten 
minutes after the ceremony, I found myself in a close carriage 
with Madame Lalande &mdash; with Mrs. Simpson, I should say &mdash; and driving 
at a great rate out of town, in a direction north-east by north, 
half-north. 
</p><p>It had been determined for us by Talbot, that, as we were to 
be up all night, we should make our first stop at C&mdash;, a 
village about twenty miles from the city, and there get an early 
breakfast and some repose, before proceeding upon our route.  At 
four, precisely, therefore, the carriage drew up at the door of 
the principal inn.  I handed my adored wife out, and ordered 
breakfast forthwith.  In the meantime we were shown into a small 
parlour, and sat down. 
</p><p>It was now nearly if not altogether daylight; and, as I 
gazed, enraptured, at the angel at my side, the singular idea 
came, all at once, into my head, that this was really the very 
first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness 
of Madame Lalande, that I had enjoyed a near inspection of that 
loveliness by daylight at all. 
</p><p>'And now, mon ami,' said she, taking my hand, and so 
interrupting this train of reflection, 'and now, mon cher ami, 
since we are indissolubly one &mdash; since I have yielded to your 
passionate entreaties, and performed my portion of our agreement &mdash; 
I presume you have not forgotten that you also have a little 
favour to bestow &mdash; a little promise which it is your intention to 
keep.  Ah! let me see!  Let me remember!  Yes; full easily do I 
call to mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to 
Eugenie last night.  Listen!  You spoke thus: "It is done! &mdash; it is 
most cheerfully agreed!  I sacrifice every feeling for your sake. 
To-night I wear this dear eye-glass, as an eye-glass, and upon my 
heart; but with the earliest dawn of that morning which gives me 
the privilege of calling you wife, I will place it upon my &mdash; upon 
my nose, &mdash; and there wear it ever afterward, in the less romantic, 
and less fashionable, but certainly in the more serviceable, form 
which you desire."  These were the exact words, my beloved 
husband, were they not?' 
</p><p>'They were,' I said; 'you have an excellent memory; and 
assuredly, my beautiful Eugenie, there is no disposition of my 
part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply. 
<pb n="351"/>  
See!  Behold?  They are becoming &mdash; rather &mdash; are they not?'  And 
here, having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of 
spectacles, I slipped them gingerly in their proper position; 
while Madame Simpson, adjusting her cap, and folding her arms, 
sat bolt upright in her chair, in a somewhat stiff and prim, and 
indeed, in a somewhat undignified position. 
</p><p>'Goodness gracious me!' I exclaimed, almost at the very 
instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose &mdash; 
'My! goodness gracious me! &mdash; why what can be the matter with 
these glasses?' and taking them quickly off, I wiped them 
carefully with a silk handkerchief, and adjusted them again. 
</p><p>But if, in the first instance, there had occurred something 
which occasioned me surprise; in the second, this surprise became 
elevated into astonishment; and this astonishment was profound &mdash; 
was extreme &mdash; indeed I may say it was horrific.  What, in the name 
of everything hideous, did this mean?  Could I believe my eyes? &mdash; 
could I? &mdash; that was the question.  Was that &mdash; was that &mdash; was that 
rouge?  And were those &mdash; and were those &mdash; were those wrinkles, upon 
the visage of Eugenie Lalande?  And oh! Jupiter, and every one of 
the gods and goddesses, little and big! &mdash; what &mdash; what &mdash; what &mdash; what 
had become of her teeth?  I dashed the spectacles violently to 
the ground, and, leaping to my feet, stood erect in the middle of 
the floor, confronting Mrs Simpson, with my arms set a-kimbo, and 
grinning and foaming, but, at the same time, utterly speechless 
with terror and rage. 
</p><p>Now I have already said that Madame Eugenie Lalande &mdash; that is 
to say, Simpson &mdash; spoke the English language but very little 
better than she wrote it; and for this reason she very properly 
never attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions.  But rage 
will carry a lady to any extreme; and in the present case it 
carried Mrs Simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of 
attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not 
altogether understand. 
</p><p>'Vell, monsieur,' said she, after surveying me, in great 
apparent astonishment, for some moments &mdash; 'Vell, monsieur! &mdash; and 
vat den? &mdash; vat de matter now?  It is de dance of de Saint Vitusse 
dut you ave?  If not like me, vat for vy buy de pig in de poke?' 
</p><p>'You wretch!' said I, catching my breath &mdash; 'you &mdash; you &mdash; you 
villainous old hag!' 
</p><p>'Ag? &mdash; ole? &mdash; me not so ver ole, after all! me not one single 
day more dan de eighty-doo.' 
<pb n="352"/>  
</p><p>'Eighty-two!' I ejaculated, staggering to the wall &mdash; 'eighty-two hundred thousand baboons!  The miniature said twenty-seven 
years and seven months!' 
</p><p>'To be sure! &mdash; dat is so! &mdash; ver true! but den de portraite has 
been take for dese fifty-five year.  Ven I go marry my segonde 
usbande, Monsieur Lalande, at dat time I had de portraite take 
for my daughter by my first usbande, Monsieur Moissart!' 
</p><p>'Moissart!' said I. 
</p><p>'Yes, Moissart,' said she, mimicking my pronunciation, 
which, to speak the truth, was none of the best; 'and vat den? 
Vat you know about de Moissart?' 
</p><p>'Nothing, you old fright! &mdash; I know nothing about him at all; 
only I had an ancestor of that name, once upon a time.' 
</p><p>'Dat name! and vat you ave for say to dat name?  'Tis ver 
goot name; and so is Voissart &mdash; dat is ver goot name too.  My 
daughter, Mademoiselle Moissart, she marry von Monsieur Voissart; 
and de name is both ver respectaable name.' 
</p><p>'Moissart?' I exclaimed, 'and Voissart! why, what is it you 
mean?' 
</p><p>'Vat I mean? &mdash; I mean Moissart and Voissart; and for de 
matter of dat, I mean Croissart and Froissart, too, if I only 
tink proper to mean it.  My daughter's daughter, Mademoiselle 
Voissart, she marry von Monsieur Croissart, and den agin, my 
daughter's grande-daughter, Mademoiselle Croissart, she marry von 
Monsieur Froissart; and I suppose you say dat dat is not von ver 
respectable name.' 
</p><p>'Froissart!' said I, beginning to faint, 'why surely you 
don't say Moissart, and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart?' 
</p><p>'Yes,' she replied, leaning fully back in her chair, and 
stretching out her lower limbs at great length; 'yes, Moissart, 
and Voissart, and Croissart, and Froissart.  But Monsieur 
Froissart, he has von ver big vat you call fool &mdash; he was von ver 
great big donce like yourself &mdash; for he lef la belle France for 
come to dis stupide Amerique &mdash; and ven he get here he vent and ave 
von ver stupide, von ver stupide sonn, so I hear, dough I not yet 
av ad de plaisir to meet vid him &mdash; neither me nor my companion, de 
Madame Stephanie Lalande.  He is name de Napoleon Bonaparte 
Froissart, and I suppose you say dat dat, too, is not von ver 
respectable name.' 
</p><p>Either the length or the nature of this speech, had the 
effect of working up Mrs Simpson into a very extraordinary 
passion indeed; and as she made an end of it, with great labour, 
she jumped up from her chair like somebody bewitched, dropping 
<pb n="353"/>  
upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she jumped.  Once 
upon her feet, she gnashed her gums, brandished her arms, rolled 
up her sleeves, shook her fist in my face, and concluded the 
performance by tearing the cap from her head, and with it an 
immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair, the 
whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell, and there 
trampled and danced a fandango upon it, in an absolute ecstasy 
and agony of rage. 
</p><p>Meantime I sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated. 
'Moissart and Voissart!' I repeated thoughtfully, as she cut one 
of her pigeon-wings, 'and Croissart and Froissart!' as she 
completed another &mdash; 'Moissart and Voissart and Croissart and 
Napoleon Bonaparte Froissart! &mdash; why, you ineffable old serpent, 
that's me &mdash; that's me &mdash; d'ye hear? &mdash; that's me' &mdash; here I screamed at 
the top of my voice &mdash; 'that's me-e-e!  I am Napoleon Bonaparte 
Froissart! and if I haven't married my great, great, grandmother, 
I wish I may be everlastingly confounded!' 
</p><p>Madame Eugene Lalande, quasi Simpson &mdash; formerly Moissart &mdash; 
was, in sober fact, my great, great, grandmother.  In her youth 
she had been beautiful, and even at eighty-two, retained the 
majestic height, the sculptural contour of head, the fine eyes 
and the Grecian nose of her girlhood.  By the aid of these, of 
pearl-powder, of rouge, of false hair, false teeth, and false 
tournure, as well as of the most skilful modistes of Paris, she 
contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en peu 
passees of the French metropolis.  In this respect, indeed, she 
might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the 
celebrated Ninon De L'Enclos. 
</p><p>She was immensely wealthy, and being left, for the second 
time, a widow without children, she bethought herself of my 
existence in America, and for the purpose of making me her heir, 
paid a visit to the United States, in company with a distant and 
exceedingly lovely relative of her second husband's &mdash; a Madame 
Stephanie Lalande. 
</p><p>At the opera, my great, great, grandmother's attention was 
arrested by my notice; and, upon surveying me through her eye-glass, she was struck with a certain family resemblance to 
herself.  Thus interested, and knowing that the heir she sought 
was actually in the city, she made inquiries of her party 
respecting me.  The gentleman who attended her knew my person, 
and told her who I was.  The information thus obtained induced 
her to renew her scrutiny; and this scrutiny it was 
<pb n="354"/>  
which so 
emboldened me that I behaved in the absurd manner already 
detailed.  She returned my bow, however, under the impression 
that, by some odd accident, I had discovered her identity.  When, 
deceived by my weakness of vision, and the arts of the toilet, in 
respect to the age and charms of the strange lady, I demanded so 
enthusiastically of Talbot who she was, he concluded that I meant 
the younger beauty, as a matter of course, and so informed me, 
with perfect truth, that she was 'the celebrated widow, Madame 
Lalande'. 
</p><p>In the street next morning, my great, great, grandmother 
encountered Talbot, an old Parisian acquaintance; and the 
conversation, very naturally, turned upon myself.  My 
deficiencies of vision were then explained; for these were 
notorious, although I was entirely ignorant of their notoriety; 
and my good old relative discovered, much to her chagrin, that 
she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity, and 
that I had been merely making a fool of myself in making open 
love, in a theatre, to an old woman unknown.  By way of punishing 
me for this imprudence, she concocted with Talbot a plot.  He 
purposely kept out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction. 
My street inquiries about 'the lovely widow, Madame Lalande', 
were supposed to refer to the younger lady, of course; and thus 
the conversation with the three gentlemen whom I encountered 
shortly after leaving Talbot's hotel will be easily explained, as 
also their allusion to Ninon De L'Enclos.  I had no opportunity 
of seeing Madame Lalande closely during daylight, and, at her 
musical soiree, my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses 
effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age. 
When 'Madame Lalande' was called upon to sing, the younger lady 
was intended; and it was she who arose to obey the call; my 
great, great, grandmother, to further the deception, arising at 
the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main 
drawing-room.  Had I decided upon escorting her thither it had 
been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where I 
was; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary.  The 
songs which I so much admired, and which so confirmed my 
impression of the youth of my mistress, were executed by Madame 
Stephanie Lalande.  The eye-glass was presented by way of adding 
a reproof to the hoax &mdash; a sting to the epigram of the deception. 
Its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture 
upon affectation with which I was so especially edified.  It is almost 
superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument, as worn by 
the old lady, 
<pb n="355"/>  
had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted 
to my years.  They suited me, in fact, to a T. 
</p><p>The clergyman, who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot, 
was a boon companion of Talbot's, and no priest.  He was an 
excellent 'whip', however; and having doffed his cassock to put 
on a greatcoat, he drove the hack which conveyed the 'happy 
couple' out of town.  Talbot took a seat at his side.  The two 
scoundrels were thus 'in at the death', and through a half open 
window of the back parlour of the inn, amused themselves in 
grinning at the denouement of the drama.  I believe I shall be 
forced to call them both out. 
</p><p>Nevertheless, I am not the husband of my great, great, 
grandmother; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite 
relief; &mdash; but I am the husband of Madame Lalande &mdash; of Madame 
Stephanie Lalande &mdash; with whom my good old relative, besides making 
me her sole heir when she dies &mdash; if ever she does &mdash; has been at the 
trouble of concocting me a match.  In conclusion: I am done for 
ever with billets doux, and am never to be met without 
SPECTACLES.
