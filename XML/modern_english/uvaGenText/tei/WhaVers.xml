<l>   And in my own you saw no tear.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>You heard me laugh and talk and jest,</l>

<l>You saw the rose upon my breast,</l>  
<l>   But not the breaking heart below.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And when you came and took my hand,</l>  
<l>   It scarcely fluttered in your hold.</l>  
<l>Alas, you did not understand!</l>  
<l>   For you were blind, and I was cold.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And now you cannot see my tears,</l>  
<l>   And now you cannot hear my cry.</l>  
<l>A month ago?  Nay, years and years</l>

<lg type="verse">  
<l>O WIFE, wife, wife!  As if the sacred name</l>  
<l>Could weary one with saying!  Once again</l>  
<l>Laying against my brow your lips' soft flame,</l>  
<l>Join with me, Sweetest, in love's new refrain,</l>  
<l>Since the whole music of my late-found life</l>  
<l>Is that we call each other "husband&mdash;wife."</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And yet, stand back, and let your cloth of gold</l>  
<l>Straighten its sumptuous lines from waist to knee,</l>  
<l>And, flowing firmly outward, fold on fold,</l>  
<l>Invest your slim young form with majesty</l>  
<l>As when, in those calm bridal robes arrayed,</l>  
<l>You stood beside me, and I was afraid.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>I was afraid&mdash;O sweetness, whiteness, youth,</l>  
<l>Best gift of God, I feared you!  I, indeed,</l>  
<l>For whom all womanhood has been, forsooth,</l>  
<l>Summed up in the sole Virgin of the Creed,</l>  
<l>I thought that day our Lady's self stood there</l>  
<l>And bound herself to me with vow and prayer.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Ah, yes, that day.  I sat, remember well,</l>  
<l>Half-crook'd above a missal, and laid in</l>  
<l>The gold-leaf slowly; silence in my cell;</l>  
<l>The picture, Satan tempting Christ to sin</l>  
<l>Upon the mount's blue, pointed pinnacle,</l>  
<l>The world outspread beneath as fair as hell&mdash;</l>  
<pb n="406"/>   
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>When suddenly they summoned me.  I stood</l>  
<l>Abashed before the Abbot, who reclined</l>  
<l>Full-bellied in his chair beneath the rood,</l>  
<l>And roseate with having lately dined;</l>  
<l>And then&mdash;I standing there abashed&mdash;he said:</l>  
<l>"The house of Giustiniani all lie dead."</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>It scarcely seemed to touch me (I had led</l>  
<l>A grated life so long) that oversea</l>  
<l>My kinsmen in their knighthood should lie dead,</l>  
<l>Nor that this sudden death should set me free,</l>  
<l>Me, the last Giustiniani&mdash;well, what then?</l>  
<l>A monk!&mdash;The Giustiniani had been men.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So when the Abbot said: "The state decrees</l>  
<l>That you, the latest scion of the house</l>  
<l>Which died in vain for Venice overseas,</l>  
<l>Should be exempted from your sacred vows,</l>  
<l>And straightway, when you leave this cloistered place,</l>  
<l>Take wife, and add new honors to the race,"</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>I hardly heard him&mdash;would have crept again</l>  
<l>To the warped missal&mdash;but he snatched a sword</l>  
<l>And girded me, and all the heart of men</l>  
<l>Rushed through me, as he laughed and hailed me lord,</l>  
<l>And, with my hand upon the hilt, I cried,</l>  
<l>"Viva San Marco!" like my kin who died.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>But, straightway, when, a new-made knight, I stood</l>  
<l>Beneath the bridal arch, and saw you come,</l>  
<l>A certain monkish warping of the blood</l>  
<l>Ran up and struck the man's heart in me dumb;</l>  
<l>I breathed an Ave to our Lady's grace,</l>  
<l>And did not dare to look upon your face.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And when we swept the waters side by side,</l>  
<l>With timbrelled gladness clashing on the air,</l>  
<l>I trembled at your image in the tide,</l>  
<l>And warded off the devil with a prayer,</l>  
<l>Still seeming in a golden dream to move</l>  
<l>Through fiendish labyrinths of forbidden love.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>But when they left us, and we stood alone,</l>  
<l>I, the last Giustiniani, face to face</l>  
<l>With your unvisioned beauty, made my own</l>  
<l>In this, the last strange bridal of our race,</l>  
<l>And, looking up at last to meet your eyes,</l>  
<l>Saw in their depths the star of love arise,</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Ah, then the monk's garb shrivelled from my heart,</l>  
<l>And left me man to face your womanhood.</l>  
<l>Without a prayer to keep our lips apart</l>  
<l>I turned about and kissed you where you stood,</l>  
<l>And gathering all the gladness of my life</l>  
<l>Into a new-found word, I called you "wife!"</l>

<lg type="stanza" n="1"> 
<l>AT that lost hour disowned of day and night,</l> 
<l>The after-birth of midnight, when life's face</l> 
<l>Turns to the wall and the last lamp goes out</l> 
<l>Before the incipient irony of dawn&mdash;</l> 
<l>In that obliterate interval of time</l> 
<l>Between the oil's last flicker and the first</l> 
<l>Reluctant shudder of averted day,</l> 
<l>Threading the city's streets (like mine own ghost</l> 
<l>Wakening the echoes of dispeopled dreams),</l> 
<l>I smiled to see how the last light that fought</l> 
<l>Extinction was the old familiar glare</l> 
<l>Of supper tables under gas-lit ceilings,</l> 
<l>The same old stale monotonous carouse</l> 
<l>Of greed and surfeit nodding face to face</l> 
<l>O'er the picked bones of pleasure . . .</l> 
<l>So that the city seemed, at that waste hour,</l> 
<l>Like some expiring planet from whose face</l> 
<l>All nobler life had perished&mdash;love and hate,</l> 
<l>And labor and the ecstasy of thought&mdash;</l> 
<l>Leaving the eyeless creatures of the ooze,</l> 
<l>Dull offspring of its first inchoate birth,</l> 
<l>The last to cling to its exhausted breast.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg type="stanza" n="2"> 
 
<l>And threading thus the aimless streets that strayed</l> 
<l>Conjectural through a labyrinth of death,</l> 
<l>Strangely I came upon two hooded nuns,</l> 
<l>Hands in their sleeves, heads bent as if beneath</l> 
<l>Some weight of benediction, gliding by</l> 
<l>Punctual as shadows that perform their round</l> 
<l>Upon the inveterate bidding of the sun</l> 
<l>Again and yet again their ordered course</l> 
<l>At the same hour crossed mine: obedient shades</l> 
<l>Cast by some high-orbed pity on the waste</l> 
<l>Of midnight evil! and my wondering thoughts</l> 
<l>Tracked them from the hushed convent where there kin</l> 
<l>Lay hived in sweetness of their prayer built cells.</l> 
<l>What wind of fate had loosed them from the lee</l> 
<l>Of that dear anchorage where their sisters slept?</l> 
<l>On what emprise of heavenly piracy</l> 
<l>Did such frail craft put forth upon this world;</l> 
<l>In what incalculable currents caught </l> 
<pb n="584"/>  
<l>And swept beyond the signal-lights of home</l> 
<l>Did their white coifs set sail against the night?</l> 
</lg> 
<lg type="stanza" n="3"> 
 
<l>At last, upon my wonder drawn, I followed</l> 
<l>The secret wanderers till I saw them pause</l> 
<l>Before the dying glare of those tall panes</l> 
<l>Where greed and surfeit nodded face to face</l> 
<l>O'er the picked bones of pleasure . . .</l> 
<l>And the door opened and the nuns went in.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg type="stanza" n="4"> 
<l>Again I met them, followed them again.</l> 
<l>Straight as a thought of mercy to its goal</l> 
<l>To the same door they sped.  I stood alone.</l> 
<l>And suddenly the silent city shook</l> 
<l>With inarticulate clamor of gagged lips,</l> 
<l>As in Jerusalem when the veil was rent</l> 
<l>And the dead drove the living from the streets.</l> 
<l>And all about me stalked the shrouded dead,</l> 
<l>Dead hopes, dead efforts, loves and sorrows dead,</l> 
<l>With empty orbits groping for their dead</l> 
<l>In that blind mustering of murdered faiths . . .</l> 
<l>And the door opened and the nuns came out.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg type="stanza" n="5"> 
<l>I turned and followed.  Once again we came</l> 
<l>To such a threshold, such a door received them,</l> 
<l>They vanished, and I waited.  The grim round</l> 
<l>Ceased only when the festal panes grew dark</l> 
<l>And the last door had shot its tardy bolt.</l> 
<l>"Too late!" I heard one murmur; and "Too late!"</l> 
<l>The other, in unholy antiphon.</l> 
<l>And with dejected steps they turned away.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg type="stanza" n="6"> 
<l>They turned, and still I tracked them, till they bent</l> 
<l>Under the lee of a calm convent wall</l> 
<l>Bounding a quiet street.  I knew the street,</l> 
<l>One of those village byways strangely trapped</l> 
<l>In the city's meshes, where at loudest noon</l> 
<l>The silence spreads like moss beneath the foot,</l> 
<l>And all the tumult of the town becomes</l> 
<l>Idle as Ocean's fury in a shell.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg type="stanza" n="7"> 
<l>Silent at noon&mdash;but now, at this void hour,</l> 
<l>When the blank sky hung over the blank streets</l> 
<l>Clear as a mirror held above dead lips,</l> 
<l>Came footfalls, and a thronging of dim shapes</l> 
<l>About the convent door: a suppliant line</l> 
<l>Of pallid figures, ghosts of happier folk,</l> 
<l>Moving in some gray underworld of want</l> 
<l>On which the sun of plenty never dawns.</l>  
</lg> 
<lg type="stanza" n="8"> 
<pb n="585"/>  
 
<l>And as the nuns approached I saw the throng</l> 
<l>Pale emanation of that outcast hour,</l> 
<l>Divide like vapor when the sun breaks through</l> 
<l>And take the glory on its tattered edge.</l> 
<l>For so a brightness ran from face to face,</l> 
<l>Faint as a diver's light beneath the sea</l> 
<l>And as a wave draws up the beach, the crowd</l> 
<l>Drew to the nuns.</l> 
<l>                   I waited.  Then those two</l> 
<l>Strange pilgrims of the sanctuaries of sin</l> 
<l>Brought from beneath their large conniving cloaks</l> 
<l>Two hidden baskets brimming with rich store</l> 
<l>Of broken viands&mdash;pasties, jellies, meats,</l> 
<l>Crumbs of Belshazzar's table, evil waste</l> 
<l>Of that interminable nightly feast</l> 
<l>Of greed and surfeit, nodding face to face</l> 
<l>O'er the picked bones of pleasure . . .</l> 
<l>And piteous hands were stretched to take the bread</l> 
<l>Of this strange sacrament&mdash;this manna brought</l> 
<l>Out of the antique wilderness of sin.</l> 
</lg> 
<lg type="stanza" n="9"> 
 
<l>Each seized a portion, turning comforted</l> 
<l>From this new breaking of the elements;</l> 
<l>And while I watched the mystery of renewal</l> 
<l>Whereby the dead bones of old sins become</l> 
<l>The living body of the love of God,</l> 
<l>It seemed to me that a like change transformed</l> 
<l>The city's self . . . a little wandering air</l> 
<l>Ruffled the ivy on the convent wall;</l> 
<l>A bird piped doubtfully; the dawn replied;</l> 
<l>And in that ancient gray necropolis</l> 
<l>Somewhere a child awoke and took the breast.</l>

<lg type="verse">  
<l>SET wide the window.  Let me drink the day.</l>  
<l>I loved light ever, light in eye and brain&mdash;</l>  
<l>No tapers mirrored in long palace floors,</l>  
<l>Nor dedicated depths of silent aisles,</l>  
<l>But just the common dusty wind-blown day</l>  
<l>That roofs earth's millions.</l>  
<l>               O, too long I walked</l>  
<l>In that thrice-sifted air that princes breathe,</l>  
<l>Nor felt the heaven-wide jostling of the winds</l>  
<l>And all the ancient outlawry of earth!</l>  
<l>Now let me breathe and see.</l>  
<l>               This pilgrimage</l>  
<l>They call a penance&mdash;let them call it that!</l>  
<l>I set my face to the East to shrive my soul</l>  
<l>Of mortal sin?  So be it.  If my blade</l>  
<l>Once questioned living flesh, if once I tore</l>  
<l>The pages of the Book in opening it,</l>  
<l>See what the torn page yielded ere the light</l>  
<l>Had paled its buried characters&mdash;and judge!</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>The girl they brought me, pinioned hand and foot</l>  
<l>In catalepsy&mdash;say I should have known</l>  
<l>That trance had not yet darkened into death,</l>  
<l>And held my scalpel.  Well, suppose I <hi rend="italic"> knew?</hi></l>  
<l>Sum up the facts&mdash;her life against her death.</l>  
<l>Her life?  The scum upon the pools of pleasure</l>  
<l>Breeds such by thousands.  And her death?  Perchance</l> <pb n="626"/>   
<l>The obolus to appease the ferrying Shade,</l>  
<l>And waft her into immortality.</l>  
<l>Think what she purchased with that one heart-flutter</l>  
<l>That whispered its deep secret to my blade!</l>  
<l>For, just because her bosom fluttered still,</l>  
<l>It told me more than many rifled graves;</l>  
<l>Because I spoke too soon, she answered me,</l>  
<l>Her vain life ripened to this bud of death</l>  
<l>As the whole plant is forced into one flower,</l>  
<l>All her blank past a scroll on which God wrote</l>  
<l>His word of healing&mdash;so that the poor flesh,</l>  
<l>Which spread death living, died to purchase life!</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Ah, no!  The sin I sinned was mine, not theirs.</l>  
<l>Not <hi rend="italic"> that</hi> they sent me forth to wash away&mdash;</l>  
<l>None of their tariffed frailties, but a deed</l>  
<l>So far beyond their grasp of good or ill</l>  
<l>That, set to weigh it in the Church's balance,</l>  
<l>Scarce would they know which scale to cast it in.</l>  
<l>But I, I know.  I sinned against my will,</l>  
<l>Myself, my soul&mdash;the God within the breast:</l>  
<l>Can any penance wash such sacrilege?</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>When I was young in Venice, years ago,</l>  
<l>I walked the hospice with a Spanish monk,</l>  
<l>A solitary cloistered in high thoughts,</l>  
<l>The great Loyola, whom I reckoned then</l>  
<l>A mere refurbisher of faded creeds,</l>  
<l>Expert to edge anew the arms of faith,</l>  
<l>As who should say, a Galenist, resolved</l>  
<l>To hold the walls of dogma against fact,</l>  
<l>Experience, insight, his own self, if need be!</l>  
<l>Ah, how I pitied him, mine own eyes set</l>  
<l>Straight in the level beams of Truth, who groped</l>  
<l>In error's old deserted catacombs</l>  
<l>And lit his tapers upon empty graves!</l>  
<l>Ay, but he held his own, the monk&mdash;more man</l>  
<l>Than any laurelled cripple of the wars,</l>  
<l>Charles's spent shafts; for what he willed he willed,</l>  
<l>As those do that forerun the wheels of fate,</l> <pb n="627"/>   
<l>Not take their dust&mdash;that force the virgin hours,</l>  
<l>Hew life into the likeness of themselves</l>  
<l>And wrest the stars from their concurrences.</l>  
<l>So firm his mould; but mine the ductile soul</l>  
<l>That wears the livery of circumstance</l>  
<l>And hangs obsequious on its suzerain's eye.</l>  
<l>For who rules now?  The twilight-flitting monk,</l>  
<l>Or I, that took the morning like an Alp?</l>  
<l>He held his own, I let mine slip from me,</l>  
<l>The birthright that no sovereign can restore;</l>  
<l>And so ironic Time beholds us now</l>  
<l>Master and slave&mdash;he lord of half the earth,</l>  
<l>I ousted from my narrow heritage.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>For there's the sting!  My kingdom knows me not.</l>  
<l>Reach me that folio&mdash;my usurper's title!</l>  
<l>Fallopius reigning, <hi rend="italic"> vice</hi>&mdash;nay, not so:</l>  
<l>Successor, not usurper.  I am dead.</l>  
<l>My throne stood empty; he was heir to it.</l>  
<l>Ay, but who hewed his kingdom from the waste,</l>  
<l>Cleared, inch by inch, the acres for his sowing,</l>  
<l>Won back for man that ancient fief o' the Church,</l>  
<l>His body?  Who flung Galen from his seat,</l>  
<l>And founded the great dynasty of truth</l>  
<l>In error's central kingdom?</l>  
<l>               Ask men that,</l>  
<l>And see their answer: just a wondering stare,</l>  
<l>To learn things were not always as they are&mdash;</l>  
<l>The very fight forgotten with the fighter;</l>  
<l>Already grows the moss upon my grave!</l>  
<l>Ay, and so meet&mdash;hold fast to that, Vesalius.</l>  
<l>They only, who re-conquer day by day</l>  
<l>The inch of ground they camped on over-night,</l>  
<l>Have right of foothold on this crowded earth.</l>  
<l>I left mine own; he seized it; with it went</l>  
<l>My name, my fame, my very self, it seems,</l>  
<l>Till I am but the symbol of a man,</l>  
<l>The sign-board creaking o'er an empty inn.</l>  
<l>He names me&mdash;true!  <hi rend="italic"> "Oh, give the door its due</hi></l>

<l><hi rend="italic">Had breached the crazy wall"</hi>&mdash;he seems to say.</l>  
<l>So meet&mdash;and yet a word of thanks, of praise,</l>  
<l>Of recognition that the clue was found,</l>  
<l>Seized, followed, clung to, by some hand now dust&mdash;</l>  
<l>Had this obscured his quartering of my shield?</l>  
</lg> 
<lg type="verse">  
<l>How the one weakness stirs again!  I thought</l>  
<l>I had done with that old thirst for gratitude</l>  
<l>That lured me to the desert years ago.</l>  
<l>I did my work&mdash;and was not that enough?</l>  
<l>No; but because the idlers sneered and shrugged,</l>  
<l>The envious whispered, the traducers lied,</l>  
<l>And friendship doubted where it should have cheered,</l>  
<l>I flung aside the unfinished task, sought praise</l>  
<l>Outside my soul's esteem, and learned too late</l>  
<l>That victory, like God's kingdom, is within.</l>  
<l>(Nay, let the folio rest upon my knee.</l>  
<l>I do not feel its weight.)  Ingratitude?</l>  
<l>The hurrying traveller does not ask the name</l>  
<l>Of him who points him on his way; and this</l>  
<l>Fallopius sits in the mid-heart of me,</l>  
<l>Because he keeps his eye upon the goal,</l>  
<l>Cuts a straight furrow to the end in view,</l>  
<l>Cares not who oped the fountain by the way,</l>  
<l>But drinks to draw fresh courage for his journey.</l>  
<l>That was the lesson that Ignatius taught&mdash;</l>  
<l>The one I might have learned from him, but would not&mdash;</l>  
<l>That we are but stray atoms on the wind,</l>  
<l>A dancing transiency of summer eves,</l>  
<l>Till we become one with our purpose, merged</l>  
<l>In that vast effort of the race which makes</l>  
<l>Mortality immortal.</l>
<l>               <hi rend="italic"> "He that loseth</hi></l>  
<l><hi rend="italic">His life shall find it"</hi>: so the Scripture runs.</l>  
<l>But I so hugged the fleeting self in me,</l>  
<l>So loved the lovely perishable hours,</l>  
<l>So kissed myself to death upon their lips,</l>  
<l>That on one pyre we perished in the end&mdash;</l>  
<l>A grimmer bonfire than the Church e'er lit!</l> <pb n="629"/>   
<l>Yet all was well&mdash;or seemed so&mdash;till I heard</l>  
<l>That younger voice, an echo of my own,</l>  
<l>And, like a wanderer turning to his home,</l>  
<l>Who finds another on the hearth, and learns,</l>  
<l>Half-dazed, that other is his actual self</l>  
<l>In name and claim, as the whole parish swears,</l>  
<l>So strangely, suddenly, stood dispossessed</l>  
<l>Of that same self I had sold all to keep,</l>  
<l>A baffled ghost that none would see or hear!</l>  
<l><hi rend="italic"> "Vesalius?  Who's Vesalius?  This Fallopius</hi></l>  
<l><hi rend="italic">It is who dragged the Galen-idol down,</hi></l>  
<l><hi rend="italic">Who rent the veil of flesh and forced a way</hi></l>  
<l><hi rend="italic">Into the secret fortalice of life"</hi>&mdash;</l>  
<l>Yet it was I that bore the brunt of it!</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Well, better so!  Better awake and live</l>  
<l>My last brief moment, as the man I was,</l>  
<l>Than lapse from life's long lethargy to death</l>  
<l>Without one conscious interval.  At least</l>  
<l>I repossess my past, am once again</l>  
<l>No courtier med'cining the whims of kings</l>  
<l>In muffled palace-chambers, but the free</l>  
<l>Friendless Vesalius, with his back to the wall</l>  
<l>And all the world against him.  O, for that</l>  
<l>Best gift of all, Fallopius, take my thanks&mdash;</l>  
<l>That, and much more.  At first, when Padua wrote:</l>  
<l>"Master, Fallopius dead, resume again</l>  
<l>The chair even he could not completely fill,</l>  
<l>And see what usury age shall take of youth</l>  
<l>In honors forfeited"&mdash;why, just at first,</l>  
<l>I was quite simply credulously glad</l>  
<l>To think the old life stood ajar for me,</l>  
<l>Like a fond woman's unforgetting heart.</l>  
<l>But now that death waylays me&mdash;now I know</l>  
<l>This isle is the circumference of my days,</l>  
<l>And I shall die here in a little while&mdash;</l>  
<l>So also best, Fallopius!</l>  
<l>               For I see</l>  
<l>The gods may give anew, but not restore;</l>  
<l>And though I think that, in my chair again,</l> <pb n="630"/>   
<l>I might have argued my supplanters wrong</l>  
<l>In this or that&mdash;this Cesalpinus, say,</l>  
<l>With all his hot-foot blundering in the dark,</l>  
<l>Fabricius, with his over-cautious clutch</l>  
<l>On Galen (systole and diastole</l>  
<l>Of Truth's mysterious heart!)&mdash;yet, other ways,</l>  
<l>It may be that this dying serves the cause.</l>  
<l>For Truth stays not to build her monument</l>  
<l>For this or that co-operating hand,</l>  
<l>But props it with her servants' failures&mdash;nay,</l>  
<l>Cements its courses with their blood and brains,</l>  
<l>A living substance that shall clinch her walls</l>  
<l>Against the assaults of time.  Already, see,</l>  
<l>Her scaffold rises on my hidden toil,</l>  
<l>I but the accepted premiss whence must spring</l>  
<l>The airy structure of her argument;</l>  
<l>Nor could the bricks it rests on serve to build</l>  
<l>The crowning finials.  I abide her law:</l>  
<l>A different substance for a different end&mdash;</l>  
<l>Content to know I hold the building up;</l>  
<l>Though men, agape at dome and pinnacles,</l>  
<l>Guess not, the whole must crumble like a dream</l>  
<l>But for that buried labor underneath.</l>  
<l>Yet, Padua, I had still my word to say!</l>  
<l><hi rend="italic"> Let others say it!</hi>&mdash;Ah, but will they guess</l>  
<l>Just the one word&mdash;?  Nay, Truth is many-tongued.</l>  
<l>What one man failed to speak, another finds</l>  
<l>Another word for.  May not all converge</l>  
<l>In some vast utterance, of which you and I,</l>  
<l>Fallopius, were but halting syllables?</l>  
<l>So knowledge come, no matter how it comes!</l>  
<l>No matter whence the light falls, so it fall!</l>  
<l>Truth's way, not mine&mdash;that I, whose service failed</l>  
<l>In action, yet may make amends in praise.</l>  
<l>Fabricius, Cesalpinus, say your word,</l>  
<l>Not yours, or mine, but Truth's, as you receive it!</l>  
<l>You miss a point I saw?  See others, then!</l>  
<l>Misread my meaning?  Yet expound your own!</l>  
<l>Obscure one space I cleared?  The sky is wide,</l>  
<l>And you may yet uncover other stars.</l> <pb n="631"/>   
<l>For thus I read the meaning of this end:</l>  
<l>There are two ways of spreading light; to be</l>  
<l>The candle or the mirror that reflects it.</l>  
<l>I let my wick burn out&mdash;there yet remains</l>  
<l>To spread an answering surface to the flame</l>  
<l>That others kindle.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="verse">  
<l>               Turn me in my bed.</l>  
<l>The window darkens as the hours swing round;</l>  
<l>But yonder, look, the other casement glows!</l>  
<l>Let me face westward as my sun goes down.</l>

<note><p><hi rend="italic"> Note</hi>.&mdash;Vesalius, the great anatomist, studied at Louvain  
and Paris, and was called by Venice to the chair of surgery in the  
University of Padua.  He was one of the first physiologists to  
dissect the human body, and his great work "The Structure of the  
Human Body" was an open attack on the physiology of Galen.  The  
book excited such violent opposition, not only in the Church, bu  
in the University, that in a fit of discouragement he burned his  
remaining manuscripts and accepted the post of physician at the  
Court of Charles V., and afterward of his son, Philip II. of Spain.   
This closed his life of free enquiry, for the Inquisition forbade  
all scientific research, and the dissection of corpses was  
prohibited in Spain.  Vesalius sank into the rich and successful  
court physician, but regrets for his past life were never wholly  
extinguished, and in 1561 they were roused afresh by the reading of  
an anatomical treatise by Gabriel Fallopius, his successor in the  
chair at Padua.  From that moment life in Spain became intolerable  
to Vesalius, and in 1563 he set out for the East.  Tradition  
reports that this journey was a penance to which the Church  
condemned him for having opened the body of a woman before she was  
actually dead; but more probably Vesalius, sick of his long   
servitude, made the pilgrimage a pretext to escape from Spain.  
Fallopius had meanwhile died, and the Venetian Senate is said  
to have offered Vesalius his old chair; but on the way home from  
Jerusalem he was seized with illness, and died at Zante in 1564.]

<l>GREAT cities rise and have their fall; the brass</l>  
<l>That held their glories moulders in its turn,</l>  
<l>Hard granite rots like an uprooted weed,</l>  
<l>And ever on the palimpsest of earth</l>  
<l>Impatient Time rubs out the word he writ.</l>  
<l>But one thing makes the years its pedestal,</l>  
<l>Springs from the ashes of its pyre, and claps</l>  
<l>A skyward wing above its epitaph&mdash;</l>  
<l>The will of man willing immortal things.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>The ages are but baubles hung upon</l>  
<l>The thread of some strong lives&mdash;and one slight wrist</l>  
<l>May lift a century above the dust;</l>  
<l>For Time,</l>  
<l>The Sisyphean load of little lives,</l>  
<l>Becomes the globe and sceptre of the great.</l>  
<l>But who are these that, linking hand in hand,</l>  
<l>Transmit across the twilight waste of years</l>  
<l>The flying brightness of a kindled hour?</l>  
<l>Not always, nor alone, the lives that search</l>  
<l>How they may snatch a glory out of heaven</l>  
<l>Or add a height to Babel; oftener they</l>  
<l>That in the still fulfilment of each day's</l>  
<l>Pacific order hold great deeds in leash,</l>  
<l>That in the sober sheath of tranquil tasks</l>  
<l>Hide the attempered blade of high emprise,</l>  
<l>And leap like lightning to the clap of fate.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So greatly gave he, nurturing 'gainst the call</l>  
<l>Of one rare moment all the daily store</l> <pb n="505"/>   
<l>Of joy distilled from the acquitted task,</l>  
<l>And that deliberate rashness which bespeaks</l>  
<l>The pondered action passed into the blood;</l>  
<l>So swift to harden purpose into deed</l>  
<l>That, with the wind of ruin in his hair,</l>  
<l>Soul sprang full-statured from the broken flesh,</l>  
<l>And at one stroke he lived the whole of life,</l>  
<l>Poured all in one libation to the truth,</l>  
<l>A brimming cup whose drops shall overflow</l>  
<l>On deserts of the soul long beaten down</l>  
<l>By the brute hoof of habit, till they spring</l>  
<l>In manifold upheaval to the sun.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Call here no high artificer to raise</l>  
<l>His wordy monument&mdash;such lives as these</l>  
<l>Make death a dull misnomer and its pomp</l>  
<l>An empty vesture.  Let resounding lives</l>  
<l>Re-echo splendidly through high-piled vaults</l>  
<l>And make the grave their spokesman&mdash;such as he</l>  
<l>Are as the hidden streams that, underground,</l>  
<l>Sweeten the pastures for the grazing kine,</l>  
<l>Or as spring airs that bring through prison bars</l>  
<l>The scent of freedom; or a light that burns</l>  
<l>Immutably across the shaken seas,</l>  
<l>Forevermore by nameless hands renewed,</l>  
<l>Where else were darkness and a glutted shore.</l>

<lg type="verse">  
<l>BEFORE the clepsydra had bound the days</l>  
<l>Man tethered Change to his fixed star, and said:</l>  
<l>"The elder races, that long since are dead,</l>  
<l>Marched by that light; it swerves not from its base</l>  
<l>Though all the worlds about it wax and fade."</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>When Egypt saw it, fast in reeling spheres,</l>  
<l>Her Pyramids shaft-centred on its ray</l>  
<l>She reared and said: "Long as this star holds sway</l>  
<l>In uninvaded ether, shall the years</l>  
<l>Revere my monuments&mdash;" and went her way.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>The Pyramids abide; but through the shaft</l>  
<l>That held the polar pivot, eye to eye,</l>  
<l>Look now&mdash;blank nothingness!  As though Change laughed</l>  
<l>At man's presumption and his puny craft,</l>  
<l>The star has slipped its leash and roams the sky.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Yet could the immemorial piles be swung</l>  
<l>A skyey hair's breadth from their rooted base,</l>  
<l>Back to the central anchorage of space,</l>  
<l>Ah, then again, as when the race was young,</l>  
<l>Should they behold the beacon of the race!</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Of old men said: "The Truth is there: we rear</l>  
<l>Our faith full-centred on it.  It was known</l>  
<l>Thus of the elders who foreran us here,</l>  
<l>Mapped out its circuit in the shifting sphere,</l>  
<l>And found it, 'mid mutation, fixed alone."</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Change laughs again, again the sky is cold,</l>  
<l>And down that fissure now no star-beam glides.</l>  
<l>Yet they whose sweep of vision grows not old</l>  
<l>Still at the central point of space behold</l>  
<l>Another pole-star: for the Truth abides.</l>

<lg type="verse">  
<l>NOW the high holocaust of hours is done,</l>  
<l>   And all the west empurpled with their death,</l>  
<l>How swift oblivion drinks the fallen sun,</l>  
<l>   How little while the dusk remembereth!</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Though some there were, proud hours that marched in mail,</l>  
<l>   And took the morning on auspicious crest,</l>  
<l>Crying to Fortune, "Back!  For I prevail!"&mdash;</l>  
<l>   Yet now they lie disfeatured with the rest;</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And some that stole so soft on Destiny</l>  
<l>   Methought they had surprised her to a smile;</l>  
<l>But these fled frozen when she turned to see,</l>  
<l>   And moaned and muttered through my heart awhile.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>But now the day is emptied of them all,</l>  
<l>   And night absorbs their life-blood at a draught;</l>  
<l>And so my life lies, as the gods let fall</l>  
<l>   An empty cup from which their lips have quaffed.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Yet see&mdash;night is not: by translucent ways,</l>  
<l>   Up the gray void of autumn afternoon</l>  
<l>Steals a mild crescent, charioted in haze,</l>  
<l>   And all the air is merciful as June.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>The lake is a forgotten streak of day</l>  
<l>   That trembles through the hemlocks' darkling bars,</l>

<l>   Upon the threshold holds the earliest stars.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>O pale equivocal hour, whose suppliant feet</l>  
<l>   Haunt the mute reaches of the sleeping wind,</l>

<l>Poor plaintive waif of a predestined race,</l>  
<l>   Their ruin gapes for thee.  Why linger here?</l>  
<l>Go hence in silence.  Veil thine orphaned face,</l>  
<l>   Lest I should look on it and call it dear.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>For if I love thee thou wilt sooner die;</l>  
<l>   Some sudden ruin will plunge upon thy head,</l>  
<l>Midnight will fall from the revengeful sky</l>  
<l>   And hurl thee down among thy shuddering dead.</l> <pb n="357"/>   
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Avert thine eyes.  Lapse softly from my sight,</l>

<l>So shalt thou sink through mitigated night</l>  
<l>   And bathe thee in the all-effacing wave.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>But upward still thy perilous footsteps fare</l>  
<l>   Along a high-hung heaven drenched in light,</l>  
<l>Dilating on a tide of crystal air</l>  
<l>   That floods the dark hills to their utmost height.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Strange hour, is this thy waning face that leans</l>  
<l>   Out of mid-heaven and makes my soul its glass?</l>  
<l>What victory is imaged there?  What means</l>  
<l>   Thy tarrying smile?  Oh, veil thy lips and pass!</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Nay&mdash;pause and let me name thee!  For I see,</l>  
<l>   Oh, with what flooding ecstasy of light,</l>  
<l>Strange hour that wilt not loose thy hold on me,</l>  
<l>   Thou'rt not day's latest, but the first of night!</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And after thee the gold-foot stars come thick;</l>  
<l>   From hand to hand they toss the flying fire,</l>  
<l>Till all the zenith with their dance is quick,</l>  
<l>   About the wheeling music of the Lyre.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Dread hour that leadst the immemorial round,</l>  
<l>   With lifted torch revealing one by one</l>  
<l>The thronging splendors that the day held bound,</l>  
<l>   And how each blue abyss enshrines its sun&mdash;</l>

<l>Leaping the barriers of ephemeral cares,</l>  
<l>   To where our lives are but the ages' tread,</l>

<lg type="verse">  
<l>NAY, lift me to thy lips, Life, and once more</l>  
<l>Pour the wild music through me&mdash;</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>    I quivered in the reed-bed with my kind,</l>  
<l>Rooted in Lethe-bank, when at the dawn</l>  
<l>There came a groping shape of mystery</l>  
<l>Moving among us, that with random stroke</l>  
<l>Severed, and rapt me from my silent tribe,</l>  
<l>Pierced, fashioned, lipped me, sounding for a voice,</l>  
<l>Laughing on Lethe-bank&mdash;and in my throat</l>  
<l>I felt the wing-beat of the fledgeling notes,</l>  
<l>The bubble of godlike laughter in my throat.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Such little songs she sang,</l>  
<l>Pursing her lips to fit the tiny pipe,</l>  
<l>They trickled from me like a slender spring</l>  
<l>That strings frail wood-growths on its crystal thread,</l>  
<l>Nor dreams of glassing cities, bearing ships.</l>  
<l>She sang, and bore me through the April world</l>  
<l>Matching the birds, doubling the insect-hum</l>  
<l>In the meadows, under the low-moving airs,</l>  
<l>And breathings of the scarce-articulate air</l>  
<l>When it makes mouths of grasses&mdash;but when the sky</l>  
<l>Burst into storm, and took great trees for pipes,</l>  
<l>She thrust me in her breast, and warm beneath</l>  
<l>Her cloudy vesture, on her terrible heart,</l>  
<l>I shook, and heard the battle.</l>  
<l>                           But more oft,</l>  
<l>Those early days, we moved in charmed woods,</l>  
<l>Where once, at dusk, she piped against a faun,</l>  
<l>And one warm dawn a tree became a nymph</l>  
<l>Listening; and trembled; and Life laughed and passed.</l>  
<l>And once we came to a great stream that bore</l>  
<l>The stars upon its bosom like a sea,</l>  
<l>And ships like stars; so to the sea we came.</l>  
<l>One wild pang through me; then refrained her hand,</l>  
<l>And whispered: "Hear&mdash;" and into my frail flanks,</l>  
<l>Into my bursting veins, the whole sea poured</l>  
<l>Its spaces and its thunder; and I feared.</l> <pb n="502"/>   
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>We came to cities, and Life piped on me</l>  
<l>Low calls to dreaming girls,</l>  
<l>In counting-house windows, through the chink of gold,</l>  
<l>Flung cries that fired the captive brain of youth,</l>  
<l>And made the heavy merchant at his desk</l>  
<l>Curse us for a cracked hurdy-gurdy; Life</l>  
<l>Mimicked the hurdy-gurdy, and we passed.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>We climbed the slopes of solitude, and there</l>  
<l>Life met a god, who challenged her and said:</l>  
<l>"Thy pipe against my lyre!"  But "Wait!" she laughed,</l>  
<l>And in my live flank dug a finger-hole,</l>  
<l>And wrung new music from it.  Ah, the pain!</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>We climbed and climbed, and left the god behind.</l>  
<l>We saw the earth spread vaster than the sea,</l>  
<l>With infinite surge of mountains surfed with snow,</l>  
<l>And a silence that was louder than the deep;</l>  
<l>But on the utmost pinnacle Life again</l>  
<l>Hid me, and I heard the terror in her hair.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Safe in new vales, I ached for the old pang,</l>  
<l>And clamoured "Play me against a god again!"</l>  
<l>  "Poor Marsyas-mortal&mdash;he shall bleed thee yet,"</l>  
<l>   She breathed and kissed me, stilling the dim need.</l>  
<l>But evermore it woke, and stabbed my flank</l>  
<l>With yearnings for new music and new pain.</l>  
<l>"Another note against another god!"</l>  
<l>I clamoured; and she answered: "Bide my time.</l>  
<l>Of every heart-wound I will make a stop.</l>  
<l>And drink thy life in music, pang by pang.</l>  
<l>But first thou must yield the notes I stored in thee</l>  
<l>At dawn beside the river.  Take my lips."</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>She kissed me like a lover, but I wept,</l>  
<l>Remembering that high song against the god,</l>  
<l>And the old songs slept in me, and I was dumb.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>We came to cavernous foul places, blind</l>  
<l>With harpy-wings, and sulphurous with the glare</l>  
<l>Of sinful furnaces&mdash;where hunger toiled,</l>  
<l>And pleasure gathered in a starveling prey,</l>  
<l>And death fed delicately on young bones.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>"Now sing!" cried Life, and set her lips to me.</l>  
<l>"Here are gods also.  Wilt thou pipe for Dis?"</l> <pb n="503"/>   
<l>My cry was drowned beneath the furnace roar,</l>  
<l>Choked by the sulphur-fumes; and beast-lipped gods</l>  
<l>Laughed down on me, and mouthed the flutes of hell.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>"Now sing!" said Life, reissuing to the stars;</l>  
<l>And wrung a new note from my wounded side.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So came we to clear spaces, and the sea.</l>  
<l>And now I felt its volume in my heart,</l>  
<l>And my heart waxed with it, and Life played on me</l>  
<l>The song of the Infinite.  "Now the stars," she said.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Then from the utmost pinnacle again</l>  
<l>She poured me on the wild sidereal stream,</l>  
<l>And I grew with her great breathings, till we swept</l>  
<l>The interstellar spaces like new worlds</l>  
<l>Loosed from the fiery ruin of a star.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Cold, cold we rested on black peaks again,</l>  
<l>Under black skies, under a groping wind,</l>  
<l>And life, grown old, hugged me to a numb breast,</l>  
<l>Pressing numb lips against me.  Suddenly</l>  
<l>A blade of silver severed the black peaks</l>  
<l>>From the black sky, and earth was born again,</l>  
<l>Breathing and various, under a god's feet.</l>  
<l>A god!  A god!  I felt the heart of Life</l>  
<l>Leap under me, and my cold flanks shook again.</l>  
<l>He bore no lyre, he rang no challenge out,</l>  
<l>But Life warmed to him, warming me with her,</l>  
<l>And as he neared I felt beneath her hands</l>  
<l>The stab of a new wound that sucked my soul</l>  
<l>Forth in a new song from my throbbing throat.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>"His name&mdash;his name?" I whispered, but she poured</l>  
<l>The music faster, and I grew with it,</l>  
<l>Became a part of it, while Life and I</l>  
<l>Clung lip to lip, and I from her wrung song</l>  
<l>As she from me, one song, one ecstasy,</l>  
<l>In indistinguishable union blent,</l>  
<l>Till she became the flute and I the player.</l>  
<l>And lo! the song I played on her was more</l>  
<l>Than any she had drawn from me; it held</l>  
<l>The stars, the peaks, the cities, and the sea,</l>  
<l>The faun's catch, the nymph's tremor, and the heart</l>  
<l>Of dreaming girls, of toilers at the desk,</l>  
<l>Apollo's challenge on the sunrise slope,</l> <pb n="504"/>   
<l>And the hiss of the night-gods mouthing flutes of hell&mdash;</l>  
<l>All, to the dawn-wind's whisper in the reeds,</l>  
<l>When Life first came, a shape of mystery,</l>  
<l>Moving among us, and with random stroke</l>  
<l>Severed, and rapt me from my silent tribe.</l>  
<l>All this I wrung from her in that deep hour,</l>  
<l>While Love stood murmuring: "Play the god, poor grass!"</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Now, by that hour, I am a mate to thee</l>  
<l>Forever, Life, however spent and clogged,</l>  
<l>And tossed back useless to my native mud!</l>  
<l>Yea, groping for new reeds to fashion thee</l>  
<l>New instruments of anguish and delight,</l>  
<l>Thy hand shall leap to me, thy broken reed,</l>  
<l>Thine ear remember me, thy bosom thrill</l>  
<l>With the old subjection, then when Love and I</l>  
<l>Held thee, and fashioned thee, and made thee dance</l>  
<l>Like a slave-girl to her pipers&mdash;yea, thou yet</l>  
<l>Shalt hear my call, and dropping all thy toys</l>  
<l>Thou'lt lift me to thy lips, Life, and once more</l>  
<l>Pour the wild music through me&mdash;</l>

<l><hi rend="italic"> Ogrin the Hermit in old age set forth</hi></l>  
<l><hi rend="italic">This tale to them that sought him in the extreme</hi></l>  
<l><hi rend="italic">Ancient grey wood where he and silence housed:</hi></l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="verse">  
<l>Long years ago, when yet my sight was keen,</l>  
<l>My hearing knew the word of wind in bough,</l>  
<l>And all the low fore-runners of the storm,</l>  
<l>There reached me, where I sat beneath my thatch,</l>  
<l>A crash as of tracked quarry in the brake,</l>  
<l>And storm-flecked, fugitive, with straining breasts</l>  
<l>And backward eyes and hands inseparable,</l>  
<l>Tristan and Iseult, swooning at my feet,</l>  
<l>Sought hiding from their hunters.  Here they lay.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>For pity of their great extremity,</l>  
<l>Their sin abhorring, yet not them with it,</l>  
<l>I nourished, hid, and suffered them to build</l>  
<l>Their branched hut in sight of this grey cross,</l>  
<l>That haply, falling on their guilty sleep,</l>  
<l>Its shadow should part them like the blade of God,</l>  
<l>And they should shudder at each other's eyes.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So dwelt they in this solitude with me,</l>  
<l>And daily, Tristan forth upon the chase,</l>  
<l>The tender Iseult sought my door and heard</l>  
<l>The words of holiness.  Abashed she heard,</l>  
<l>Like one in wisdom nurtured from a child,</l>  
<l>Yet in whose ears an alien language dwells</l>  
<l>Of some far country whence the traveller brings</l>  
<l>Magical treasure, and still images</l>  
<l>Of gods forgotten, and the scent of groves</l>  
<l>That sleep by painted rivers.  As I have seen</l>  
<l>Oft-times returning pilgrims with the spell</l> <pb n="845"/>   
<l>Of these lost lands upon their lids, she moved</l>  
<l>Among familiar truths, accustomed sights,</l>  
<l>As she to them were strange, not they to her.</l>  
<l>And often, reasoning with her, have I felt</l>  
<l>Some ancient lore was in her, dimly drawn</l>  
<l>>From springs of life beyond the four-fold stream</l>  
<l>That makes a silver pale to Paradise;</l>  
<l>For she was calm as some forsaken god</l>  
<l>Who knows not that his power is passed from him,</l>  
<l>But sees with tranced eyes rich pilgrim-trains</l>  
<l>In sands the desert blows about his feet.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Abhorring first, I heard her; yet her speech</l>  
<l>Warred not with pity, or the contrite heart,</l>  
<l>Or hatred of things evil: rather seemed</l>  
<l>The utterance of some world where these are not,</l>  
<l>And the heart lives in heathen innocence</l>  
<l>With earth's innocuous creatures.  For she said:</l>  
<l>"Love is not, as the shallow adage goes,</l>  
<l>A witch's filter, brewed to trick the blood.</l>  
<l>The cup we drank of on the flying deck</l>  
<l>Was the blue vault of air, the round world's lip,</l>  
<l>Brimmed with life's hydromel, and pressed to ours</l>  
<l>By myriad hands of wind and sun and sea.</l>  
<l>For these are all the cup-bearers of youth,</l>  
<l>That bend above it at the board of life,</l>  
<l>Solicitous accomplices: there's not</l>  
<l>A leaf on bough, a foam-flash on the wave,</l>  
<l>So brief and glancing but it serves them too;</l>  
<l>No scent the pale rose spends upon the night,</l>  
<l>Nor sky-lark's rapture trusted to the blue,</l>  
<l>But these, from the remotest tides of air</l>  
<l>Brought in mysterious salvage, breathe and sing</l>  
<l>In lovers' lips and eyes; and two that drink</l>  
<l>Thus onely of the strange commingled cup</l>  
<l>Of mortal fortune shall into their blood</l>  
<l>Take magic gifts.  Upon each others' hearts</l>  
<l>They shall surprise the heart-beat of the world,</l>  
<l>And feel a sense of life in things inert;</l>  
<l>For as love's touch upon the yielded body</l>  
<l>Is a diviner's wand, and where it falls</l> <pb n="846"/>   
<l>A hidden treasure trembles: so their eyes,</l>  
<l>Falling upon the world of clod and brute,</l>  
<l>And cold hearts plotting evil, shall discern</l>  
<l>The inextinguishable flame of life</l>  
<l>That girdles the remotest frame of things</l>  
<l>With influences older than the stars."</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So spake Iseult; and thus her passion found</l>  
<l>Far-flying words, like birds against the sunset</l>  
<l>That look on lands we see not.  Yet I know</l>  
<l>It was not any argument she found,</l>  
<l>But that she was, the colour that life took</l>  
<l>About her, that thus reasoned in her stead,</l>  
<l>Making her like a lifted lantern borne</l>  
<l>Through midnight thickets, where the flitting ray</l>  
<l>Momently from inscrutable darkness draws</l>  
<l>A myriad-veined branch, and its shy nest</l>  
<l>Quivering with startled life: so moved Iseult.</l>  
<l>And all about her this deep solitude</l>  
<l>Stirred with responsive motions.  Oft I knelt</l>  
<l>In night-long vigil while the lovers slept</l>  
<l>Under their outlawed thatch, and with long prayers</l>  
<l>Sought to disarm the indignant heavens; but lo,</l>  
<l>Thus kneeling in the intertidal hour</l>  
<l>'Twixt dark and dawning, have mine eyes beheld</l>  
<l>How the old gods that hide in these hoar woods,</l>  
<l>And were to me but shapings of the air,</l>  
<l>And flit and murmur of the breathing trees,</l>  
<l>Or slant of moon on pools&mdash;how these stole forth,</l>  
<l>Grown living presences, yet not of bale,</l>  
<l>But innocent-eyed as fawns that come to drink,</l>  
<l>Thronging the threshold where the lovers lay,</l>  
<l>In service of the great god housed within</l>  
<l>Who hides in his breast, beneath his mighty plumes,</l>  
<l>The purposes and penalties of life.</l>  
<l>Or in yet deeper hours, when all was still,</l>  
<l>And the hushed air bowed over them alone,</l>  
<l>Such music of the heart as lovers hear,</l>  
<l>When close as lips lean, lean the thoughts between&mdash;</l>  
<l>When the cold world, no more a lonely orb</l>  
<l>Circling the unimagined track of Time,</l> <pb n="847"/>   
<l>Is like a beating heart within their hands,</l>  
<l>A numb bird that they warm, and feel its wings&mdash;</l>  
<l>Such music have I heard; and through the prayers</l>  
<l>Wherewith I sought to shackle their desires,</l>  
<l>And bring them humbled to the feet of God,</l>  
<l>Caught the loud quiring of the fruitful year,</l>  
<l>The leap of springs, the throb of loosened earth,</l>  
<l>And the sound of all the streams that seek the sea.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So fell it, that when pity moved their hearts,</l>  
<l>And those high lovers, one unto the end,</l>  
<l>Bowed to the sundering will, and each his way</l>  
<l>Went through a world that could not make them twain,</l>  
<l>Knowing that a great vision, passing by,</l>  
<l>Had swept mine eye-lids with its fringe of fire,</l>  
<l>I, with the wonder of it on my head,</l>  
<l>And with the silence of it in my heart,</l>  
<l>Forth to Tintagel went by secret ways,</l>  
<l>A long lone journey; and from them that loose</l>  
<l>Their spiced bales upon the wharves, and shake</l>  
<l>Strange silks to the sun, or covertly unbosom</l>  
<l>Rich hoard of pearls and amber, or let drip</l>  
<l>Through swarthy fingers links of sinuous gold,</l>  
<l>Chose their most delicate treasures.  Though I knew</l>  
<l>No touch more silken than this knotted gown,</l>  
<l>My hands, grown tender with the sense of her,</l>  
<l>Discerned the airiest tissues, light to cling</l>  
<l>As shower-loosed petals, veils like meadow-smoke,</l>  
<l>Fur soft as snow, amber like sun congealed,</l>  
<l>Pearls pink as may-buds in an orb of dew;</l>  
<l>And laden with these wonders, that to her</l>  
<l>Were natural as the vesture of a flower,</l>  
<l>Fared home to lay my booty at her feet.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And she, consenting, nor with useless words</l>  
<l>Proving my purpose, robed herself therein</l>  
<l>To meet her lawful lord; but while she thus</l>  
<l>Prisoned the wandering glory of her hair,</l>  
<l>Dimmed her bright breast with jewels, and subdued</l>  
<l>Her light to those dull splendours, well she knew</l>  
<l>The lord that I adorned her thus to meet</l> <pb n="848"/>   
<l>Was not Tintagel's shadowy King, but he,</l>  
<l>That other lord beneath whose plumy feet</l>  
<l>The currents of the seas of life run gold</l>  
<l>As from eternal sunrise; well she knew</l>  
<l>That when I laid my hands upon her head,</l>  
<l>Saying, "Fare forth forgiven," the words I spoke</l>  
<l>Were the breathings of his pity, who beholds</l>  
<l>How, swept on his inexorable wings</l>  
<l>Too far beyond the planetary fires</l>  
<l>On the last coasts of darkness, plunged too deep</l>  
<l>In light ineffable, the heart amazed</l>  
<l>Swoons of its glory, and dropping back to earth</l>  
<l>Craves the dim shelter of familiar sounds,</l>  
<l>The rain on the roof, the noise of flocks that pass,</l>  
<l>And the slow world waking to its daily round. . . .</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And thus, as one who speeds a banished queen,</l>  
<l>I set her on my mule, and hung about</l>  
<l>With royal ornament she went her way;</l>  
<l>For meet it was that this great Queen should pass</l>  
<l>Crowned and forgiven from the face of Love.</l>

<lg type="verse">  
<l>WILD winged thing, O brought I know not whence</l>  
<l>To beat your life out in my life's low cage;</l>  
<l>You strange familiar, nearer than my flesh</l>  
<l>Yet distant as a star, that were at first</l>  
<l>A child with me a child, yet elfin-far,</l>  
<l>And visibly of some unearthly breed;</l>  
<l>Mirthfullest mate of all my mortal games,</l>  
<l>Yet shedding on them some evasive gleam</l>  
<l>Of Latmian loneliness&mdash;O seven then</l>  
<l>Expert to lift the latch of our low door</l>  
<l>And profit by the hours when, dusked about</l>  
<l>By human misintelligence, our first</l>  
<l>Weak fledgling flights were safeliest essayed;</l>  
<l>Divine accomplice of those perilous-sweet</l>  
<l>Low moth-flights of the unadventured soul</l>  
<l>Above the world's dim garden!&mdash;now we sit,</l>  
<l>After what stretch of years, what stretch of wings,</l>  
<l>In the same cage together&mdash;still as near</l>  
<l>And still as strange!</l>  
<l>                  Only I know at last</l>  
<l>That we are fellows till the last night falls,</l>  
<l>And that I shall not miss your comrade hands</l>  
<l>Till they have closed my lids, and by them set</l>  
<l>A taper that&mdash;who knows!&mdash;may yet shine through.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Sister, my comrade, I have ached for you,</l>  
<l>Sometimes, to see you curb your pace to mine,</l>  
<l>And bow your Maenad crest to the dull forms</l>  
<l>Of human usage; I have loosed your hand</l>  
<l>And whispered: 'Go!  Since I am tethered here;'</l>  
<l>And you have turned, and breathing for reply,</l>  
<l>'I too am pinioned, as you too are free,'</l>  
<l>Have caught me to such undreamed distances</l>  
<l>As the last planets see, when they look forth,</l> <pb n="786"/>   
<l>To the sentinel pacings of the outmost stars&mdash;</l>  
<l>Nor these alone,</l>  
<l>Comrade, my sister, were your gifts.  More oft</l>  
<l>Has your impalpable wing-brush bared for me</l>  
<l>The heart of wonder in familiar things,</l>  
<l>Unroofed dull rooms, and hung above my head</l>  
<l>The cloudy glimpses of a vernal moon,</l>  
<l>Or all the autumn heaven ripe with stars.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And you have made a secret pact with Sleep,</l>  
<l>And when she comes not, or her feet delay,</l>  
<l>Toiled in low meadows of gray asphodel</l>  
<l>Under a pale sky where no shadows fall,</l>  
<l>Then, hooded like her, to my side you steal,</l>  
<l>And the night grows like a great rumouring sea,</l>  
<l>And you a boat, and I your passenger,</l>  
<l>And the tide lifts us with an indrawn breath</l>  
<l>Out, out upon the murmurs and the scents,</l>  
<l>Through spray of splintered star-beams, or white rage</l>  
<l>Of desperate moon-drawn waters&mdash;on and on</l>  
<l>To some blue ocean immarcescible</l>  
<l>That ever like a slow-swung mirror rocks</l>  
<l>The balanced breasts of sea-birds motionless.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Yet other nights, my sister, you have been</l>  
<l>The storm, and I the leaf that fled on it</l>  
<l>Terrifically down voids that never knew</l>  
<l>The pity of creation&mdash;or have felt</l>  
<l>The immitigable anguish of a soul</l>  
<l>Left last in a long-ruined world alone;</l>  
<l>And then your touch has drawn me back to earth,</l>  
<l>As in the night, upon an unknown road,</l>  
<l>A scent of lilac breathing from the hedge</l>  
<l>Bespeaks the hidden farm, the bedded cows,</l>  
<l>And safety, and the sense of human kind . . .</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And I have climbed with you by hidden ways</l>  
<l>To meet the dews of morning, and have seen</l>  
<l>The shy gods like retreating shadows fade,</l>  
<l>Or on the thymy reaches have surprised</l>  
<l>Old Chiron sleeping, and have waked him not . . .</l> <pb n="787"/>   
<l>Yet farther have I fared with you, and known</l>  
<l>Love and his sacred tremors, and the rites</l>  
<l>Of his most inward temple; and beyond</l>  
<l>His temple lights, have seen the long gray waste</l>  
<l>Where lonely thoughts, like creatures of the night,</l>  
<l>Listen and wander where a city stood.</l>  
<l>And creeping down by waterless defiles</l>  
<l>Under an iron midnight, have I kept</l>  
<l>My vigil in the waste till dawn began</l>  
<l>To move among the ruins, and I saw</l>  
<l>A sapling rooted in a fissured plinth,</l>  
<l>And a wren's nest in the thunder-threatening hand</l>  
<l>Of some old god of granite in the dust . . .</l>

<l>THOU couldst not look on me and live: so runs</l>  
<l>The mortal legend&mdash;thou that couldst not live</l>  
<l>Nor look on me (so the divine decree)!</l>  
<l>That sawst me in the cloud, the wave, the bough,</l>  
<l>The clod commoved with April, and the shapes</l>

<l>The lake is a forgotten streak of day</l>

<lg type="verse">  
<l>NAY, lift me to thy lips, Life, and once more</l>  
<l>Pour the wild music through me&mdash;</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>    I quivered in the reed-bed with my kind,</l>  
<l>Rooted in Lethe-bank, when at the dawn</l>  
<l>There came a groping shape of mystery</l>  
<l>Moving among us, that with random stroke</l>  
<l>Severed, and rapt me from my silent tribe,</l>  
<l>Pierced, fashioned, lipped me, sounding for a voice,</l>  
<l>Laughing on Lethe-bank&mdash;and in my throat</l>  
<l>I felt the wing-beat of the fledgeling notes,</l>  
<l>The bubble of godlike laughter in my throat.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Such little songs she sang,</l>  
<l>Pursing her lips to fit the tiny pipe,</l>  
<l>They trickled from me like a slender spring</l>  
<l>That strings frail wood-growths on its crystal thread,</l>  
<l>Nor dreams of glassing cities, bearing ships.</l>  
<l>She sang, and bore me through the April world</l>  
<l>Matching the birds, doubling the insect-hum</l>  
<l>In the meadows, under the low-moving airs,</l>  
<l>And breathings of the scarce-articulate air</l>  
<l>When it makes mouths of grasses&mdash;but when the sky</l>  
<l>Burst into storm, and took great trees for pipes,</l>  
<l>She thrust me in her breast, and warm beneath</l>  
<l>Her cloudy vesture, on her terrible heart,</l>  
<l>I shook, and heard the battle.</l>  
<l>                           But more oft,</l>  
<l>Those early days, we moved in charmed woods,</l>  
<l>Where once, at dusk, she piped against a faun,</l>  
<l>And one warm dawn a tree became a nymph</l>  
<l>Listening; and trembled; and Life laughed and passed.</l>  
<l>And once we came to a great stream that bore</l>  
<l>The stars upon its bosom like a sea,</l>  
<l>And ships like stars; so to the sea we came.</l>  
<l>One wild pang through me; then refrained her hand,</l>  
<l>And whispered: "Hear&mdash;" and into my frail flanks,</l>  
<l>Into my bursting veins, the whole sea poured</l>  
<l>Its spaces and its thunder; and I feared.</l> <pb n="502"/>   
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>We came to cities, and Life piped on me</l>  
<l>Low calls to dreaming girls,</l>  
<l>In counting-house windows, through the chink of gold,</l>  
<l>Flung cries that fired the captive brain of youth,</l>  
<l>And made the heavy merchant at his desk</l>  
<l>Curse us for a cracked hurdy-gurdy; Life</l>  
<l>Mimicked the hurdy-gurdy, and we passed.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>We climbed the slopes of solitude, and there</l>  
<l>Life met a god, who challenged her and said:</l>  
<l>"Thy pipe against my lyre!"  But "Wait!" she laughed,</l>  
<l>And in my live flank dug a finger-hole,</l>  
<l>And wrung new music from it.  Ah, the pain!</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>We climbed and climbed, and left the god behind.</l>  
<l>We saw the earth spread vaster than the sea,</l>  
<l>With infinite surge of mountains surfed with snow,</l>  
<l>And a silence that was louder than the deep;</l>  
<l>But on the utmost pinnacle Life again</l>  
<l>Hid me, and I heard the terror in her hair.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Safe in new vales, I ached for the old pang,</l>  
<l>And clamoured "Play me against a god again!"</l>  
<l>  "Poor Marsyas-mortal&mdash;he shall bleed thee yet,"</l>  
<l>   She breathed and kissed me, stilling the dim need.</l>  
<l>But evermore it woke, and stabbed my flank</l>  
<l>With yearnings for new music and new pain.</l>  
<l>"Another note against another god!"</l>  
<l>I clamoured; and she answered: "Bide my time.</l>  
<l>Of every heart-wound I will make a stop.</l>  
<l>And drink thy life in music, pang by pang.</l>  
<l>But first thou must yield the notes I stored in thee</l>  
<l>At dawn beside the river.  Take my lips."</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>She kissed me like a lover, but I wept,</l>  
<l>Remembering that high song against the god,</l>  
<l>And the old songs slept in me, and I was dumb.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>We came to cavernous foul places, blind</l>  
<l>With harpy-wings, and sulphurous with the glare</l>  
<l>Of sinful furnaces&mdash;where hunger toiled,</l>  
<l>And pleasure gathered in a starveling prey,</l>  
<l>And death fed delicately on young bones.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>"Now sing!" cried Life, and set her lips to me.</l>  
<l>"Here are gods also.  Wilt thou pipe for Dis?"</l> <pb n="503"/>   
<l>My cry was drowned beneath the furnace roar,</l>  
<l>Choked by the sulphur-fumes; and beast-lipped gods</l>  
<l>Laughed down on me, and mouthed the flutes of hell.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>"Now sing!" said Life, reissuing to the stars;</l>  
<l>And wrung a new note from my wounded side.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So came we to clear spaces, and the sea.</l>  
<l>And now I felt its volume in my heart,</l>  
<l>And my heart waxed with it, and Life played on me</l>  
<l>The song of the Infinite.  "Now the stars," she said.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Then from the utmost pinnacle again</l>  
<l>She poured me on the wild sidereal stream,</l>  
<l>And I grew with her great breathings, till we swept</l>  
<l>The interstellar spaces like new worlds</l>  
<l>Loosed from the fiery ruin of a star.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Cold, cold we rested on black peaks again,</l>  
<l>Under black skies, under a groping wind,</l>  
<l>And life, grown old, hugged me to a numb breast,</l>  
<l>Pressing numb lips against me.  Suddenly</l>  
<l>A blade of silver severed the black peaks</l>  
<l>>From the black sky, and earth was born again,</l>  
<l>Breathing and various, under a god's feet.</l>  
<l>A god!  A god!  I felt the heart of Life</l>  
<l>Leap under me, and my cold flanks shook again.</l>  
<l>He bore no lyre, he rang no challenge out,</l>  
<l>But Life warmed to him, warming me with her,</l>  
<l>And as he neared I felt beneath her hands</l>  
<l>The stab of a new wound that sucked my soul</l>  
<l>Forth in a new song from my throbbing throat.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>"His name&mdash;his name?" I whispered, but she poured</l>  
<l>The music faster, and I grew with it,</l>  
<l>Became a part of it, while Life and I</l>  
<l>Clung lip to lip, and I from her wrung song</l>  
<l>As she from me, one song, one ecstasy,</l>  
<l>In indistinguishable union blent,</l>  
<l>Till she became the flute and I the player.</l>  
<l>And lo! the song I played on her was more</l>  
<l>Than any she had drawn from me; it held</l>  
<l>The stars, the peaks, the cities, and the sea,</l>  
<l>The faun's catch, the nymph's tremor, and the heart</l>  
<l>Of dreaming girls, of toilers at the desk,</l>  
<l>Apollo's challenge on the sunrise slope,</l> <pb n="504"/>   
<l>And the hiss of the night-gods mouthing flutes of hell&mdash;</l>  
<l>All, to the dawn-wind's whisper in the reeds,</l>  
<l>When Life first came, a shape of mystery,</l>  
<l>Moving among us, and with random stroke</l>  
<l>Severed, and rapt me from my silent tribe.</l>  
<l>All this I wrung from her in that deep hour,</l>  
<l>While Love stood murmuring: "Play the god, poor grass!"</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Now, by that hour, I am a mate to thee</l>  
<l>Forever, Life, however spent and clogged,</l>  
<l>And tossed back useless to my native mud!</l>  
<l>Yea, groping for new reeds to fashion thee</l>  
<l>New instruments of anguish and delight,</l>  
<l>Thy hand shall leap to me, thy broken reed,</l>  
<l>Thine ear remember me, thy bosom thrill</l>  
<l>With the old subjection, then when Love and I</l>  
<l>Held thee, and fashioned thee, and made thee dance</l>  
<l>Like a slave-girl to her pipers&mdash;yea, thou yet</l>  
<l>Shalt hear my call, and dropping all thy toys</l>  
<l>Thou'lt lift me to thy lips, Life, and once more</l>  
<l>Pour the wild music through me&mdash;</l>

<l><hi rend="italic">This tale to them that sought him in the extreme</hi></l>  
<l><hi rend="italic">Ancient grey wood where he and silence housed:</hi></l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="verse">  
<l>Long years ago, when yet my sight was keen,</l>  
<l>My hearing knew the word of wind in bough,</l>  
<l>And all the low fore-runners of the storm,</l>  
<l>There reached me, where I sat beneath my thatch,</l>  
<l>A crash as of tracked quarry in the brake,</l>  
<l>And storm-flecked, fugitive, with straining breasts</l>  
<l>And backward eyes and hands inseparable,</l>  
<l>Tristan and Iseult, swooning at my feet,</l>  
<l>Sought hiding from their hunters.  Here they lay.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>For pity of their great extremity,</l>  
<l>Their sin abhorring, yet not them with it,</l>  
<l>I nourished, hid, and suffered them to build</l>  
<l>Their branched hut in sight of this grey cross,</l>  
<l>That haply, falling on their guilty sleep,</l>  
<l>Its shadow should part them like the blade of God,</l>  
<l>And they should shudder at each other's eyes.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So dwelt they in this solitude with me,</l>  
<l>And daily, Tristan forth upon the chase,</l>  
<l>The tender Iseult sought my door and heard</l>  
<l>The words of holiness.  Abashed she heard,</l>  
<l>Like one in wisdom nurtured from a child,</l>  
<l>Yet in whose ears an alien language dwells</l>  
<l>Of some far country whence the traveller brings</l>  
<l>Magical treasure, and still images</l>  
<l>Of gods forgotten, and the scent of groves</l>  
<l>That sleep by painted rivers.  As I have seen</l>  
<l>Oft-times returning pilgrims with the spell</l> <pb n="845"/>   
<l>Of these lost lands upon their lids, she moved</l>  
<l>Among familiar truths, accustomed sights,</l>  
<l>As she to them were strange, not they to her.</l>  
<l>And often, reasoning with her, have I felt</l>  
<l>Some ancient lore was in her, dimly drawn</l>  
<l>>From springs of life beyond the four-fold stream</l>  
<l>That makes a silver pale to Paradise;</l>  
<l>For she was calm as some forsaken god</l>  
<l>Who knows not that his power is passed from him,</l>  
<l>But sees with tranced eyes rich pilgrim-trains</l>  
<l>In sands the desert blows about his feet.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Abhorring first, I heard her; yet her speech</l>  
<l>Warred not with pity, or the contrite heart,</l>  
<l>Or hatred of things evil: rather seemed</l>  
<l>The utterance of some world where these are not,</l>  
<l>And the heart lives in heathen innocence</l>  
<l>With earth's innocuous creatures.  For she said:</l>  
<l>"Love is not, as the shallow adage goes,</l>  
<l>A witch's filter, brewed to trick the blood.</l>  
<l>The cup we drank of on the flying deck</l>  
<l>Was the blue vault of air, the round world's lip,</l>  
<l>Brimmed with life's hydromel, and pressed to ours</l>  
<l>By myriad hands of wind and sun and sea.</l>  
<l>For these are all the cup-bearers of youth,</l>  
<l>That bend above it at the board of life,</l>  
<l>Solicitous accomplices: there's not</l>  
<l>A leaf on bough, a foam-flash on the wave,</l>  
<l>So brief and glancing but it serves them too;</l>  
<l>No scent the pale rose spends upon the night,</l>  
<l>Nor sky-lark's rapture trusted to the blue,</l>  
<l>But these, from the remotest tides of air</l>  
<l>Brought in mysterious salvage, breathe and sing</l>  
<l>In lovers' lips and eyes; and two that drink</l>  
<l>Thus onely of the strange commingled cup</l>  
<l>Of mortal fortune shall into their blood</l>  
<l>Take magic gifts.  Upon each others' hearts</l>  
<l>They shall surprise the heart-beat of the world,</l>  
<l>And feel a sense of life in things inert;</l>  
<l>For as love's touch upon the yielded body</l>  
<l>Is a diviner's wand, and where it falls</l> <pb n="846"/>   
<l>A hidden treasure trembles: so their eyes,</l>  
<l>Falling upon the world of clod and brute,</l>  
<l>And cold hearts plotting evil, shall discern</l>  
<l>The inextinguishable flame of life</l>  
<l>That girdles the remotest frame of things</l>  
<l>With influences older than the stars."</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So spake Iseult; and thus her passion found</l>  
<l>Far-flying words, like birds against the sunset</l>  
<l>That look on lands we see not.  Yet I know</l>  
<l>It was not any argument she found,</l>  
<l>But that she was, the colour that life took</l>  
<l>About her, that thus reasoned in her stead,</l>  
<l>Making her like a lifted lantern borne</l>  
<l>Through midnight thickets, where the flitting ray</l>  
<l>Momently from inscrutable darkness draws</l>  
<l>A myriad-veined branch, and its shy nest</l>  
<l>Quivering with startled life: so moved Iseult.</l>  
<l>And all about her this deep solitude</l>  
<l>Stirred with responsive motions.  Oft I knelt</l>  
<l>In night-long vigil while the lovers slept</l>  
<l>Under their outlawed thatch, and with long prayers</l>  
<l>Sought to disarm the indignant heavens; but lo,</l>  
<l>Thus kneeling in the intertidal hour</l>  
<l>'Twixt dark and dawning, have mine eyes beheld</l>  
<l>How the old gods that hide in these hoar woods,</l>  
<l>And were to me but shapings of the air,</l>  
<l>And flit and murmur of the breathing trees,</l>  
<l>Or slant of moon on pools&mdash;how these stole forth,</l>  
<l>Grown living presences, yet not of bale,</l>  
<l>But innocent-eyed as fawns that come to drink,</l>  
<l>Thronging the threshold where the lovers lay,</l>  
<l>In service of the great god housed within</l>  
<l>Who hides in his breast, beneath his mighty plumes,</l>  
<l>The purposes and penalties of life.</l>  
<l>Or in yet deeper hours, when all was still,</l>  
<l>And the hushed air bowed over them alone,</l>  
<l>Such music of the heart as lovers hear,</l>  
<l>When close as lips lean, lean the thoughts between&mdash;</l>  
<l>When the cold world, no more a lonely orb</l>  
<l>Circling the unimagined track of Time,</l> <pb n="847"/>   
<l>Is like a beating heart within their hands,</l>  
<l>A numb bird that they warm, and feel its wings&mdash;</l>  
<l>Such music have I heard; and through the prayers</l>  
<l>Wherewith I sought to shackle their desires,</l>  
<l>And bring them humbled to the feet of God,</l>  
<l>Caught the loud quiring of the fruitful year,</l>  
<l>The leap of springs, the throb of loosened earth,</l>  
<l>And the sound of all the streams that seek the sea.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>So fell it, that when pity moved their hearts,</l>  
<l>And those high lovers, one unto the end,</l>  
<l>Bowed to the sundering will, and each his way</l>  
<l>Went through a world that could not make them twain,</l>  
<l>Knowing that a great vision, passing by,</l>  
<l>Had swept mine eye-lids with its fringe of fire,</l>  
<l>I, with the wonder of it on my head,</l>  
<l>And with the silence of it in my heart,</l>  
<l>Forth to Tintagel went by secret ways,</l>  
<l>A long lone journey; and from them that loose</l>  
<l>Their spiced bales upon the wharves, and shake</l>  
<l>Strange silks to the sun, or covertly unbosom</l>  
<l>Rich hoard of pearls and amber, or let drip</l>  
<l>Through swarthy fingers links of sinuous gold,</l>  
<l>Chose their most delicate treasures.  Though I knew</l>  
<l>No touch more silken than this knotted gown,</l>  
<l>My hands, grown tender with the sense of her,</l>  
<l>Discerned the airiest tissues, light to cling</l>  
<l>As shower-loosed petals, veils like meadow-smoke,</l>  
<l>Fur soft as snow, amber like sun congealed,</l>  
<l>Pearls pink as may-buds in an orb of dew;</l>  
<l>And laden with these wonders, that to her</l>  
<l>Were natural as the vesture of a flower,</l>  
<l>Fared home to lay my booty at her feet.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And she, consenting, nor with useless words</l>  
<l>Proving my purpose, robed herself therein</l>  
<l>To meet her lawful lord; but while she thus</l>  
<l>Prisoned the wandering glory of her hair,</l>  
<l>Dimmed her bright breast with jewels, and subdued</l>  
<l>Her light to those dull splendours, well she knew</l>  
<l>The lord that I adorned her thus to meet</l> <pb n="848"/>   
<l>Was not Tintagel's shadowy King, but he,</l>  
<l>That other lord beneath whose plumy feet</l>  
<l>The currents of the seas of life run gold</l>  
<l>As from eternal sunrise; well she knew</l>  
<l>That when I laid my hands upon her head,</l>  
<l>Saying, "Fare forth forgiven," the words I spoke</l>  
<l>Were the breathings of his pity, who beholds</l>  
<l>How, swept on his inexorable wings</l>  
<l>Too far beyond the planetary fires</l>  
<l>On the last coasts of darkness, plunged too deep</l>  
<l>In light ineffable, the heart amazed</l>  
<l>Swoons of its glory, and dropping back to earth</l>  
<l>Craves the dim shelter of familiar sounds,</l>  
<l>The rain on the roof, the noise of flocks that pass,</l>  
<l>And the slow world waking to its daily round. . . .</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>And thus, as one who speeds a banished queen,</l>  
<l>I set her on my mule, and hung about</l>  
<l>With royal ornament she went her way;</l>  
<l>For meet it was that this great Queen should pass</l>  
<l>Crowned and forgiven from the face of Love.</l>

<l>And you have turned, and breathing for reply,</l>

<l>Nor these alone,</l>

<l>Toiled in low meadows of gray asphodel</l>  
<l>Under a pale sky where no shadows fall,</l>  
<l>Then, hooded like her, to my side you steal,</l>  
<l>And the night grows like a great rumouring sea,</l>  
<l>And you a boat, and I your passenger,</l>  
<l>And the tide lifts us with an indrawn breath</l>  
<l>Out, out upon the murmurs and the scents,</l>  
<l>Through spray of splintered star-beams, or white rage</l>  
<l>Of desperate moon-drawn waters&mdash;on and on</l>

<l>The pity of creation&mdash;or have felt</l>  
<l>The immitigable anguish of a soul</l>  
<l>Left last in a long-ruined world alone;</l>

<l>Yet farther have I fared with you, and known</l>  
<l>Love and his sacred tremors, and the rites</l>  
<l>Of his most inward temple; and beyond</l>  
<l>His temple lights, have seen the long gray waste</l>  
<l>Where lonely thoughts, like creatures of the night,</l>  
<l>Listen and wander where a city stood.</l>  
<l>And creeping down by waterless defiles</l>  
<l>Under an iron midnight, have I kept</l>  
<l>My vigil in the waste till dawn began</l>  
<l>To move among the ruins, and I saw</l>

<l>NOT all the wasteful beauty of the year</l>

<l>Of sea-caves quivering in a tidal lull,</l>  
<l>Those tranced towers and long unruined walls,</l>  
<l>Moat-girdled from the world's dissolving touch,</l>  
<l>The rook-flights lessening over evening woods,</l>  
<l>And, down the unfrequented grassy slopes,</l>  
<l>The shadows of old oaks contemplative</l>  
<l>Reaching behind them like the thoughts of age.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>High overhead hung the long Sussex ridge,</l>  
<l>Sun-cinctured, as a beaker's rim of gold</l>

<l>The clouds moved white before the herding airs</l>  
<l>That in the hollow, by the moated walls,</l>  
<l>Stirred not one sleeping lily from its sleep.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Deeper the hush fell; more remote the earth</l>  
<l>Fled onward with the flight of cloud and sun,</l>  
<l>And cities strung upon the flashing reel</l>  
<l>Of nights and days.  We knew no more of these</l> <pb n="278"/>   
<l>Than the grey towers redoubling in the moat</l>  
<l>The image of a bygone strength transformed</l>  
<l>To beauty's endless uses; and like them</l>  
<l>We felt the touch of that renewing power</l>  
<l>That turns the landmarks of man's ruined toil</l>  
<l>To high star-haunted reservoirs of peace.</l>  
<l>And with that sense there came the deeper sense</l>  
<l>Of moments that, between the beats of time,</l>  
<l>May thus insphere in some transcendent air</l>  
<l>The plenitude of being.</l>  
<l>Far currents feed them, from those slopes of soul</l>  
<l>That know the rise and set of other stars</l>  
<l>White-roaring downward through remote defiles</l>  
<l>Dim-forested with unexplored thought;</l>

<l>That drink the blood of battle, sweat of earth,</l>  
<l>And the broached vats of cities revelling.</l>  
<l>All these the moments hold; yet these resolved</l>  
<l>To such clear wine of beauty as shall flush</l>  
<l>The blood to richer living. . . .  Thus we mused,</l>

<l>And such a moment held us.  As, at times,</l>

<l>We have reached some secret hallowed silent place</l>  
<l>That a god visits at the turn of night&mdash;</l>  
<l>In such a solitude the moment held us.</l>  
<l>And one were thought and sense in that profound</l>  
<l>Submersion of all being deep below</l>  
<l>The vexed waves of action.  Clear we saw,</l>  
<l>Through the clear nether stillness of the place,</l>  
<l>The gliding images of words and looks</l>  
<l>Swept from us down the gusty tides of time,</l>  
<l>And here unfolding to completer life;</l>  
<l>And like dull pebbles from a sunless shore</l>  
<l>Plunged into crystal waters, suddenly</l>  
<l>We took the hues of beauty, and became,</l>  
<l>Each to the other, all that each had sought.</l>  
</lg><lg type="verse">  
<l>Thus did we feel the moment and the place</l>  
<l>One in the heart of beauty; while far off</l>  
<l>The rooks' last cry died on the fading air,</l>

<l>Hail, goddess, from the midmost caverned vale</l>  
<l>Of Samothracia, where with darksome rites</l>  
<l>Unnameable, and sacrificial lambs,</l>  
<l>Pale priests salute thy triple-headed form,</l>  
<l>Borne hither by swift Hermes o'er the sea:</l>  
<l>Hail, Hecate, what word soe'er thou bring</l>  
<l>To me, undaughtered, of my vanished child.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="verse">

<l>Word have I, but no Samothracian wild</l>  
<l>Last saw me, and mine aged footsteps pine</l>  
<l>For the bleak vale, my dusky-pillared house,</l>  
<l>And the cold murmur of incessant rites</l>  
<l>Forever falling down mine altar-steps</l>  
<l>Into black pools of fear . . . for I am come</l>  
<l>Even now from that blue-cinctured westward isle,</l>  
<l>Trinacria, where, till thou withheldst thy face,</l>  
<l>Yearly three harvests yellowed to the sun,</l>  
<l>And vines deep-laden yoked the heavier boughs&mdash;</l>  
<l>Trinacria, that last saw Persephone.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="verse">

<l>Now, triune goddess, may the black ewe-lambs</l>  
<l>Pour a red river down thine altar-steps,</l>  
<l>Fruit, loaves and honey, at the cross-roads laid,</l>  
<l>With each young moon by pious hands renewed,</l>  
<l>Appease thee, and the Thracian vale resound</l>  
<l>With awful homage to thine oracle!</l>  
<l>What bring'st thou of Persephone, my child?</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="verse">

<l>Thy daughter lives, yet never sees the sun.</l>

<lg type="verse">

<l>Blind am I in her blindness.  Tell no more.</l>

<l>Blind is she not, and yet beholds no light.</l>

<lg type="verse">

<l>Dark as her doom is, are thy words to me.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="verse">  
<head>HECATE</head>  
  
<l>When the wild chariot of the flying sea</l>  
<l>Bore me to Etna, 'neath his silver slope</l> <pb n="285"/>   
<l>Herding their father's flocks three maids I found,</l>  
<l>The daughters of the god whose golden house</l>  
<l>Rears in the east its cloudy peristyle.</l>  
<l>"Helios, our father," to my quest they cried,</l>  
<l>"Was last to see Persephone on earth."</l>

<l>On earth?  What nameless region holds her now?</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="verse">

<l>Even as I put thy question to the three,</l>  
<l>Etna became as one who knows a god,</l>  
<l>And wondrously, across the waiting deep,</l>  
<l>Wave after wave the golden portent bore,</l>  
<l>Till Helios rose before us.</l>  
</lg>

<head>DEMETER</head>  
  
<l>                          O, I need</l>

</lg>  
<lg type="verse">

<l>May the draught slake thee!  Thus the god replied:</l>  
<l>When the first suns of March with verdant flame</l>  
<l>Relume the fig-trees in the crannied hills,</l>  
<l>And the pale myrtle scents the rain-washed air&mdash;</l>  
<l>Ere oleanders down the mountain stream</l>  
<l>Pass the wild torch of summer, and my kine</l>  
<l>Breathe of gold gorse and honey-laden sage;</l>  
<l>Between the first white flowering of the bay</l>  
<l>And the last almond's fading from the hill,</l>  
<l>Along the fields of Enna came a maid</l>  
<l>Who seemed among her mates to move alone,</l>  
<l>As the full moon will mow the sky of stars,</l>  
<l>And whom, by that transcendence, I divined</l>  
<l>Of breed Olympian, and Demeter's child.</l>

<l>Persephone (so spake the god of day)</l>  
<l>Ran here and there with footsteps that out-shone</l>  
<l>The daffodils she gathered, while her maids,</l>  
<l>Like shadows of herself by noon fore-shortened,</l>  
<l>On every side her laughing task prolonged;</l>  
<l>When suddenly the warm and trusted earth</l>  
<l>Widened black jaws beneath them, and therefrom</l>  
<l>Rose Aides, whom with averted head</l>  
<l>Pale mortals worship, as the poplar turns,</l>  
<l>Whitening, her fearful foliage from the gale.</l>  
<l>Like thunder rolling up against the wind</l>  
<l>He dusked the sky with midnight ere he came,</l>  
<l>Whirling his cloak of subterraneous cloud</l>  
<l>In awful coils about the fated maid,</l>  
<l>Till nothing marked the place where she had stood</l>

<hi rend="italic"> Saturday Evening Post</hi> 191, 29 Mar. 1919: 8.  
</head>  
 
<lg type="verse"> 
<l>SOMEWHERE I read, in an old book whose name</l> 
<l>Is gone from me, I read that when the days</l> 
<l>Of a man are counted, and his business done,</l> 
<l>There comes up the shore at evening, with the tide,</l> 
<l>To the place where he sits, a boat &mdash;</l> 
<l>And in the boat, from the place where he sits, he sees,</l> 
<l>Dim in the dusk, dim and yet so familiar,</l> 
<l>The faces of his friends long dead; and knows</l> 
<l>They come for him, brought in upon the tide,</l> 
<l>To take him where men go at set of day.</l> 
<l>Then rising, with his hands in theirs, he goes</l> 
<l>Between them his last steps, that are the first</l> 
<l>Of the new life &mdash; and with the ebb they pass,</l> 
<l>Their shaken sail grown small upon the moon.</l> 
</lg><lg type="verse"> 
<l>Often I thought of this, and pictured me</l> 
<l>How many a man who lives with throngs about him,</l> 
<l>Yet straining through the twilight for that boat</l> 
<l>Shall scarce make out one figure in the stern,</l> 
<l>And that so faint its features shall perplex him </l> 
<l>With doubtful memories &mdash; and his heart hang back.</l> 
<l>But others, rising as they see the sail</l> 
<l>Increase upon the sunset, hasten down,</l> 
<l>Hands out and eyes elated; for they see</l> 
<l>Head over head, crowding from bow to stern,</l> 
<l>Repeopling their long loneliness with smiles,</l> 
<l>The faces of their friends; and such go forth</l> 
<l>Content upon the ebb tide, with safe hearts.</l> 
</lg><lg type="verse"> 
<l>But never</l> 
<l>To worker summoned when his day was done</l> 
<l>Did mounting tide bring in such freight of friends</l> 
<l>As stole to you up the white wintry shingle</l> 
<l>That night while they that watched you thought you slept.</l> 
<l>Softly they came, and beached the boat, and gathered</l> 
<l>In the still cove under the icy stars,</l> 
<l>Your last-born, and the dear loves of your heart,</l> 
<l>And all men that have loved right more than ease,</l> 
<l>And honor above honors; all who gave</l> 
<l>Free-handed of their best for other men,</l> 
<l>And thought their giving taking: they who knew</l> 
<l>Man's natural state is effort, up and up &mdash; </l> 
<l>All these were there, so great a company</l> 
<l>Perchance you marveled, wondering what great ship</l> 
<l>Had brought that throng unnumbered to the cove</l> 
<l>Where the boys used to beach their light canoe</l> 
<l>After old happy picnics &mdash;</l> 
</lg><lg type="verse"> 
<l>But these, your friends and children, to whose hands</l> 
<l>Committed, in the silent night you rose</l> 
<l>And took your last faint steps &mdash; </l> 
<l>These led you down, O great American,</l> 
<l>Down to the winter night and the white beach,</l> 
<l>And there you saw that the huge hull that waited</l> 
<l>Was not as are the boats of the other dead,</l> 
<l>Frail craft for a brief passage; no, for this</l> 
<l>Was first of a long line of towering transports,</l> 
<l>Storm-worn and ocean-weary every one,</l> 
<l>The ships you launched, the ships you manned, the ships</l> 
<l>That now, returning from their sacred quest</l>
