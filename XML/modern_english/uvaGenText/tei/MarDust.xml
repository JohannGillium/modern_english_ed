<head>THIS IS ANOTHER DAY</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>I AM mine own priest, and I shrive myself
</l><l>Of all my wasted yesterdays.  Though sin
</l><l>And sloth and foolishness, and all ill weeds
</l><l>Of error, evil, and neglect grow rank
</l><l>And ugly there, I dare forgive myself
</l><l>That error, sin, and sloth and foolishness.
</l><l>God knows that yesterday I played the fool;
</l><l>God knows that yesterday I played the knave;
</l><l>But shall I therefore cloud this new dawn o'er
</l><l>With fog of futile sighs and vain regrets?

</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>This is another day!  And flushed Hope walks
</l><l>Adown the sunward slopes with golden shoon.
</l><l>This is another day; and its young strength
</l><l>Is laid upon the quivering hills until,
</l><l>Like Egypt's Memnon, they grow quick with song.
</l><l>This is another day, and the bold world
</l><l>Leaps up and grasps its light, and laughs, as leapt
</l><l>Prometheus up and wrenched the fire from Zeus.
</l></lg><lg type="stanza">

<pb n="4"/>

<l>This is another day&mdash;are its eyes blurred
</l><l>With maudlin grief for any wasted past?
</l><l>A thousand thousand failures shall not daunt!
</l><l>Let dust clasp dust; death, death&mdash;I am alive!
</l><l>And out of all the dust and death of mine
</l><l>Old selves I dare to lift a singing heart
</l><l>And living faith; my spirit dares drink deep
</l><l>Of the red mirth mantling in the cup of morn.

</l></lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>Or dreaming in old chapels where
