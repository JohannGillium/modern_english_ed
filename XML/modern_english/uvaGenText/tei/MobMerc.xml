<p><stage>Venice. A street.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:<lb/>
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;<lb/>
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<lb/>
What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,<lb/>
I am to learn;<lb/>
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,<lb/>
That I have much ado to know myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<lb/>
There, where your argosies with portly sail,<lb/>
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<lb/>
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,<lb/>
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<lb/>
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<lb/>
As they fly by them with their woven wings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<lb/>
The better part of my affections would<lb/>
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<lb/>
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,<lb/>
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;<lb/>
And every object that might make me fear<lb/>
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<lb/>
Would make me sad.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>My wind cooling my broth<lb/>
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<lb/>
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.<lb/>
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<lb/>
But I should think of shallows and of flats,<lb/>
And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,<lb/>
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs<lb/>
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<lb/>
And see the holy edifice of stone,<lb/>
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<lb/>
Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,<lb/>
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<lb/>
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<lb/>
And, in a word, but even now worth this,<lb/>
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<lb/>
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<lb/>
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<lb/>
But tell not me; I know, Antonio<lb/>
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,<lb/>
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<lb/>
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<lb/>
Upon the fortune of this present year:<lb/>
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Why, then you are in love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Fie, fie!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,<lb/>
Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy<lb/>
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,<lb/>
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,<lb/>
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:<lb/>
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes<lb/>
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,<lb/>
And other of such vinegar aspect<lb/>
That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,<lb/>
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,<lb/>
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:<lb/>
We leave you now with better company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,<lb/>
If worthier friends had not prevented me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Your worth is very dear in my regard.<lb/>
I take it, your own business calls on you<lb/>
And you embrace the occasion to depart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, my good lords.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?<lb/>
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Salarino and Salanio</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,<lb/>
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,<lb/>
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>I will not fail you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>You look not well, Signior Antonio;<lb/>
You have too much respect upon the world:<lb/>
They lose it that do buy it with much care:<lb/>
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;<lb/>
A stage where every man must play a part,<lb/>
And mine a sad one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Let me play the fool:<lb/>
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,<lb/>
And let my liver rather heat with wine<lb/>
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.<lb/>
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,<lb/>
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?<lb/>
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice<lb/>
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio&mdash;<lb/>
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks&mdash;<lb/>
There are a sort of men whose visages<lb/>
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,<lb/>
And do a wilful stillness entertain,<lb/>
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion<lb/>
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,<lb/>
As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,<lb/>
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'<lb/>
O my Antonio, I do know of these<lb/>
That therefore only are reputed wise<lb/>
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,<lb/>
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,<lb/>
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.<lb/>
I'll tell thee more of this another time:<lb/>
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,<lb/>
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.<lb/>
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:<lb/>
I'll end my exhortation after dinner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:<lb/>
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,<lb/>
For Gratiano never lets me speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Well, keep me company but two years moe,<lb/>
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable<lb/>
In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Is that any thing now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more<lb/>
than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two<lb/>
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you<lb/>
shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you<lb/>
have them, they are not worth the search.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Well, tell me now what lady is the same<lb/>
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,<lb/>
That you to-day promised to tell me of?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,<lb/>
How much I have disabled mine estate,<lb/>
By something showing a more swelling port<lb/>
Than my faint means would grant continuance:<lb/>
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged<lb/>
From such a noble rate; but my chief care<lb/>
Is to come fairly off from the great debts<lb/>
Wherein my time something too prodigal<lb/>
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,<lb/>
I owe the most, in money and in love,<lb/>
And from your love I have a warranty<lb/>
To unburden all my plots and purposes<lb/>
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;<lb/>
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,<lb/>
Within the eye of honour, be assured,<lb/>
My purse, my person, my extremest means,<lb/>
Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,<lb/>
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight<lb/>
The self-same way with more advised watch,<lb/>
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both<lb/>
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,<lb/>
Because what follows is pure innocence.<lb/>
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,<lb/>
That which I owe is lost; but if you please<lb/>
To shoot another arrow that self way<lb/>
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<lb/>
As I will watch the aim, or to find both<lb/>
Or bring your latter hazard back again<lb/>
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>You know me well, and herein spend but time<lb/>
To wind about my love with circumstance;<lb/>
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong<lb/>
In making question of my uttermost<lb/>
Than if you had made waste of all I have:<lb/>
Then do but say to me what I should do<lb/>
That in your knowledge may by me be done,<lb/>
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>In Belmont is a lady richly left;<lb/>
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,<lb/>
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes<lb/>
I did receive fair speechless messages:<lb/>
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued<lb/>
To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:<lb/>
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<lb/>
For the four winds blow in from every coast<lb/>
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks<lb/>
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;<lb/>
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,<lb/>
And many Jasons come in quest of her.<lb/>
O my Antonio, had I but the means<lb/>
To hold a rival place with one of them,<lb/>
I have a mind presages me such thrift,<lb/>
That I should questionless be fortunate!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;<lb/>
Neither have I money nor commodity<lb/>
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;<lb/>
Try what my credit can in Venice do:<lb/>
That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,<lb/>
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.<lb/>
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,<lb/>
Where money is, and I no question make<lb/>
To have it of my trust or for my sake.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p></div2><div2 type="scene" n="2" id="d7">
<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of<lb/>
this great world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in<lb/>
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and<lb/>
yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit<lb/>
with too much as they that starve with nothing. It<lb/>
is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the<lb/>
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but<lb/>
competency lives longer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Good sentences and well pronounced.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>They would be better, if well followed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>If to do were as easy as to know what were good to<lb/>
do, chapels had been churches and poor men's<lb/>
cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that<lb/>
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach<lb/>
twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the<lb/>
twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may<lb/>
devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps<lb/>
o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the<lb/>
youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the<lb/>
cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to<lb/>
choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may<lb/>
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I<lb/>
dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed<lb/>
by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,<lb/>
Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their<lb/>
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,<lb/>
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,<lb/>
silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning<lb/>
chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any<lb/>
rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what<lb/>
warmth is there in your affection towards any of<lb/>
these princely suitors that are already come?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest<lb/>
them, I will describe them; and, according to my<lb/>
description, level at my affection.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>First, there is the Neapolitan prince.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but<lb/>
talk of his horse; and he makes it a great<lb/>
appropriation to his own good parts, that he can<lb/>
shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his<lb/>
mother played false with a smith.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Then there is the County Palatine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you<lb/>
will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and<lb/>
smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping<lb/>
philosopher when he grows old, being so full of<lb/>
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be<lb/>
married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth<lb/>
than to either of these. God defend me from these<lb/>
two!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.<lb/>
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,<lb/>
he! why, he hath a horse better than the<lb/>
Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than<lb/>
the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a<lb/>
throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will<lb/>
fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I<lb/>
should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me<lb/>
I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I<lb/>
shall never requite him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron<lb/>
of England?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>You know I say nothing to him, for he understands<lb/>
not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,<lb/>
nor Italian, and you will come into the court and<lb/>
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.<lb/>
He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can<lb/>
converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!<lb/>
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round<lb/>
hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his<lb/>
behavior every where.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he<lb/>
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and<lb/>
swore he would pay him again when he was able: I<lb/>
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed<lb/>
under for another.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and<lb/>
most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when<lb/>
he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and<lb/>
when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:<lb/>
and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall<lb/>
make shift to go without him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>If he should offer to choose, and choose the right<lb/>
casket, you should refuse to perform your father's<lb/>
will, if you should refuse to accept him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a<lb/>
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,<lb/>
for if the devil be within and that temptation<lb/>
without, I know he will choose it. I will do any<lb/>
thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>You need not fear, lady, the having any of these<lb/>
lords: they have acquainted me with their<lb/>
determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their<lb/>
home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless<lb/>
you may be won by some other sort than your father's<lb/>
imposition depending on the caskets.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as<lb/>
chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner<lb/>
of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers<lb/>
are so reasonable, for there is not one among them<lb/>
but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant<lb/>
them a fair departure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a<lb/>
Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither<lb/>
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish<lb/>
eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of<lb/>
thy praise.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Serving-man</stage></p>


<p>
How now! what news?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take<lb/>
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a<lb/>
fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the<lb/>
prince his master will be here to-night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a<lb/>
heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should<lb/>
be glad of his approach: if he have the condition<lb/>
of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had<lb/>
rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,<lb/>
Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.<lb/>
Whiles we shut the gates<lb/>
upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>Venice. A public place.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Three thousand ducats; well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir, for three months.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>For three months; well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Antonio shall become bound; well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I<lb/>
know your answer?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Your answer to that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Antonio is a good man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a<lb/>
good man is to have you understand me that he is<lb/>
sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he<lb/>
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the<lb/>
Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he<lb/>
hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and<lb/>
other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships<lb/>
are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats<lb/>
and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I<lb/>
mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,<lb/>
winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,<lb/>
sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may<lb/>
take his bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Be assured you may.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,<lb/>
I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>If it please you to dine with us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which<lb/>
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I<lb/>
will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,<lb/>
walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat<lb/>
with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What<lb/>
news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ANTONIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>This is Signior Antonio.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  How like a fawning publican he looks!<lb/>
I hate him for he is a Christian,<lb/>
But more for that in low simplicity<lb/>
He lends out money gratis and brings down<lb/>
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.<lb/>
If I can catch him once upon the hip,<lb/>
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.<lb/>
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,<lb/>
Even there where merchants most do congregate,<lb/>
On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,<lb/>
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,<lb/>
If I forgive him!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Shylock, do you hear?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I am debating of my present store,<lb/>
And, by the near guess of my memory,<lb/>
I cannot instantly raise up the gross<lb/>
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?<lb/>
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,<lb/>
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months<lb/>
Do you desire?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To ANTONIO</stage></p>


<p>
Rest you fair, good signior;<lb/>
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow<lb/>
By taking nor by giving of excess,<lb/>
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,<lb/>
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd<lb/>
How much ye would?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>And for three months.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I had forgot; three months; you told me so.<lb/>
Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;<lb/>
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow<lb/>
Upon advantage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I do never use it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep&mdash;<lb/>
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,<lb/>
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,<lb/>
The third possessor; ay, he was the third&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>And what of him? did he take interest?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>No, not take interest, not, as you would say,<lb/>
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.<lb/>
When Laban and himself were compromised<lb/>
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied<lb/>
Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,<lb/>
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,<lb/>
And, when the work of generation was<lb/>
Between these woolly breeders in the act,<lb/>
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,<lb/>
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,<lb/>
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,<lb/>
Who then conceiving did in eaning time<lb/>
Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.<lb/>
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:<lb/>
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;<lb/>
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,<lb/>
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.<lb/>
Was this inserted to make interest good?<lb/>
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:<lb/>
But note me, signior.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Mark you this, Bassanio,<lb/>
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.<lb/>
An evil soul producing holy witness<lb/>
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,<lb/>
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:<lb/>
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.<lb/>
Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Signior Antonio, many a time and oft<lb/>
In the Rialto you have rated me<lb/>
About my moneys and my usances:<lb/>
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,<lb/>
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.<lb/>
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,<lb/>
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,<lb/>
And all for use of that which is mine own.<lb/>
Well then, it now appears you need my help:<lb/>
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say<lb/>
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;<lb/>
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard<lb/>
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur<lb/>
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit<lb/>
What should I say to you? Should I not say<lb/>
'Hath a dog money? is it possible<lb/>
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or<lb/>
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,<lb/>
With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;<lb/>
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;<lb/>
You spurn'd me such a day; another time<lb/>
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies<lb/>
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I am as like to call thee so again,<lb/>
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.<lb/>
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not<lb/>
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take<lb/>
A breed for barren metal of his friend?<lb/>
But lend it rather to thine enemy,<lb/>
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face<lb/>
Exact the penalty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Why, look you, how you storm!<lb/>
I would be friends with you and have your love,<lb/>
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,<lb/>
Supply your present wants and take no doit<lb/>
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:<lb/>
This is kind I offer.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>This were kindness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>This kindness will I show.<lb/>
Go with me to a notary, seal me there<lb/>
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,<lb/>
If you repay me not on such a day,<lb/>
In such a place, such sum or sums as are<lb/>
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit<lb/>
Be nominated for an equal pound<lb/>
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken<lb/>
In what part of your body pleaseth me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond<lb/>
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>You shall not seal to such a bond for me:<lb/>
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:<lb/>
Within these two months, that's a month before<lb/>
This bond expires, I do expect return<lb/>
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>O father Abram, what these Christians are,<lb/>
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect<lb/>
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;<lb/>
If he should break his day, what should I gain<lb/>
By the exaction of the forfeiture?<lb/>
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man<lb/>
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,<lb/>
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,<lb/>
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:<lb/>
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;<lb/>
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;<lb/>
Give him direction for this merry bond,<lb/>
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,<lb/>
See to my house, left in the fearful guard<lb/>
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently<lb/>
I will be with you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Hie thee, gentle Jew.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Shylock</stage></p>


<p>
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Come on: in this there can be no dismay;<lb/>
My ships come home a month before the day.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>MOROCCO</speaker>
<p>Mislike me not for my complexion,<lb/>
The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,<lb/>
To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.<lb/>
Bring me the fairest creature northward born,<lb/>
Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,<lb/>
And let us make incision for your love,<lb/>
To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.<lb/>
I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine<lb/>
Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear<lb/>
The best-regarded virgins of our clime<lb/>
Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,<lb/>
Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>In terms of choice I am not solely led<lb/>
By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;<lb/>
Besides, the lottery of my destiny<lb/>
Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:<lb/>
But if my father had not scanted me<lb/>
And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself<lb/>
His wife who wins me by that means I told you,<lb/>
Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair<lb/>
As any comer I have look'd on yet<lb/>
For my affection.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOROCCO</speaker>
<p>Even for that I thank you:<lb/>
Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets<lb/>
To try my fortune. By this scimitar<lb/>
That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince<lb/>
That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,<lb/>
I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,<lb/>
Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,<lb/>
Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,<lb/>
Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,<lb/>
To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!<lb/>
If Hercules and Lichas play at dice<lb/>
Which is the better man, the greater throw<lb/>
May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:<lb/>
So is Alcides beaten by his page;<lb/>
And so may I, blind fortune leading me,<lb/>
Miss that which one unworthier may attain,<lb/>
And die with grieving.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>You must take your chance,<lb/>
And either not attempt to choose at all<lb/>
Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong<lb/>
Never to speak to lady afterward<lb/>
In way of marriage: therefore be advised.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOROCCO</speaker>
<p>Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>First, forward to the temple: after dinner<lb/>
Your hazard shall be made.<lb/>

<p><stage>Venice. A street.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LAUNCELOT</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from<lb/>
this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and<lb/>
tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good<lb/>
Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot<lb/>
Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My<lb/>
conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;<lb/>
take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest<lb/>
Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy<lb/>
heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me<lb/>
pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the<lb/>
fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'<lb/>
says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,<lb/>
hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely<lb/>
to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest<lb/>
man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,<lb/>
indeed, my father did something smack, something<lb/>
grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience<lb/>
says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the<lb/>
fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.<lb/>
'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'<lb/>
say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my<lb/>
conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,<lb/>
who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to<lb/>
run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the<lb/>
fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil<lb/>
himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil<lb/>
incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is<lb/>
but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel<lb/>
me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more<lb/>
friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are<lb/>
at your command; I will run.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way<lb/>
to master Jew's?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!<lb/>
who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,<lb/>
knows me not: I will try confusions with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way<lb/>
to master Jew's?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,<lb/>
at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at<lb/>
the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn<lb/>
down indirectly to the Jew's house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can<lb/>
you tell me whether one Launcelot,<lb/>
that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Talk you of young Master Launcelot?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you<lb/>
of young Master Launcelot?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,<lb/>
though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man<lb/>
and, God be thanked, well to live.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of<lb/>
young Master Launcelot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,<lb/>
talk you of young Master Launcelot?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master<lb/>
Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,<lb/>
according to Fates and Destinies and such odd<lb/>
sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of<lb/>
learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say<lb/>
in plain terms, gone to heaven.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my<lb/>
age, my very prop.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or<lb/>
a prop? Do you know me, father?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:<lb/>
but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his<lb/>
soul, alive or dead?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Do you not know me, father?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of<lb/>
the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his<lb/>
own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of<lb/>
your son: give me your blessing: truth will come<lb/>
to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son<lb/>
may, but at the length truth will out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not<lb/>
Launcelot, my boy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but<lb/>
give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy<lb/>
that was, your son that is, your child that shall<lb/>
be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>I cannot think you are my son.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>I know not what I shall think of that: but I am<lb/>
Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your<lb/>
wife is my mother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou<lb/>
be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.<lb/>
Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou<lb/>
got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than<lb/>
Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows<lb/>
backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail<lb/>
than I have of my face when I last saw him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy<lb/>
master agree? I have brought him a present. How<lb/>
'gree you now?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set<lb/>
up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I<lb/>
have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give<lb/>
him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in<lb/>
his service; you may tell every finger I have with<lb/>
my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me<lb/>
your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,<lb/>
gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I<lb/>
will run as far as God has any ground. O rare<lb/>
fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I<lb/>
am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper<lb/>
be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See<lb/>
these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,<lb/>
and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit a Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>To him, father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>God bless your worship!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that<lb/>
would, sir, as my father shall specify&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,<lb/>
and have a desire, as my father shall specify&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,<lb/>
are scarce cater-cousins&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having<lb/>
done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I<lb/>
hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon<lb/>
your worship, and my suit is&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as<lb/>
your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,<lb/>
though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>One speak for both. What would you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Serve you, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOBBO</speaker>
<p>That is the very defect of the matter, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:<lb/>
Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,<lb/>
And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment<lb/>
To leave a rich Jew's service, to become<lb/>
The follower of so poor a gentleman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>The old proverb is very well parted between my<lb/>
master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of<lb/>
God, sir, and he hath enough.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.<lb/>
Take leave of thy old master and inquire<lb/>
My lodging out. Give him a livery<lb/>
More guarded than his fellows': see it done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have<lb/>
ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in<lb/>
Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear<lb/>
upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,<lb/>
here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle<lb/>
of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven<lb/>
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one<lb/>
man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be<lb/>
in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;<lb/>
here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a<lb/>
woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,<lb/>
come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.<lb/>

<p>I have a suit to you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>You have obtain'd it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;<lb/>
Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;<lb/>
Parts that become thee happily enough<lb/>
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;<lb/>
But where thou art not known, why, there they show<lb/>
Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain<lb/>
To allay with some cold drops of modesty<lb/>
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior<lb/>
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,<lb/>
And lose my hopes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Signior Bassanio, hear me:<lb/>
If I do not put on a sober habit,<lb/>
Talk with respect and swear but now and then,<lb/>
Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,<lb/>
Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes<lb/>
Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'<lb/>
Use all the observance of civility,<lb/>
Like one well studied in a sad ostent<lb/>
To please his grandam, never trust me more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Well, we shall see your bearing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me<lb/>
By what we do to-night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>No, that were pity:<lb/>
I would entreat you rather to put on<lb/>
Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends<lb/>

I have some business.<lb/>

Clamber not you up to the casements then,<lb/>
Nor thrust your head into the public street<lb/>

I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Go draw aside the curtains and discover<lb/>
The several caskets to this noble prince.<lb/>
Now make your choice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOROCCO</speaker>
<p>The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,<lb/>
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'<lb/>
The second, silver, which this promise carries,<lb/>
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'<lb/>
This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,<lb/>
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'<lb/>
How shall I know if I do choose the right?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>The one of them contains my picture, prince:<lb/>
If you choose that, then I am yours withal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOROCCO</speaker>
<p>Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;<lb/>
I will survey the inscriptions back again.<lb/>
What says this leaden casket?<lb/>
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'<lb/>
Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?<lb/>
This casket threatens. Men that hazard all<lb/>
Do it in hope of fair advantages:<lb/>
A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;<lb/>
I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.<lb/>
What says the silver with her virgin hue?<lb/>
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'<lb/>
As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,<lb/>
And weigh thy value with an even hand:<lb/>
If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,<lb/>
Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough<lb/>
May not extend so far as to the lady:<lb/>
And yet to be afeard of my deserving<lb/>
Were but a weak disabling of myself.<lb/>
As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:<lb/>
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,<lb/>
In graces and in qualities of breeding;<lb/>
But more than these, in love I do deserve.<lb/>
What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?<lb/>
Let's see once more this saying graved in gold<lb/>
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'<lb/>
Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;<lb/>
From the four corners of the earth they come,<lb/>
To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:<lb/>
The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds<lb/>
Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now<lb/>
For princes to come view fair Portia:<lb/>
The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head<lb/>
Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar<lb/>
To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,<lb/>
As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.<lb/>
One of these three contains her heavenly picture.<lb/>
Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation<lb/>
To think so base a thought: it were too gross<lb/>
To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.<lb/>
Or shall I think in silver she's immured,<lb/>
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?<lb/>
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem<lb/>
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England<lb/>
A coin that bears the figure of an angel<lb/>
Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;<lb/>
But here an angel in a golden bed<lb/>
Lies all within. Deliver me the key:<lb/>
Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,<lb/>
Then I am yours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOROCCO</speaker>

A carrion Death, within whose empty eye<lb/>
There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>

All that glitters is not gold;<lb/>
Often have you heard that told:<lb/>
Many a man his life hath sold<lb/>
But my outside to behold:<lb/>
Gilded tombs do worms enfold.<lb/>
Had you been as wise as bold,<lb/>
Young in limbs, in judgment old,<lb/>
Your answer had not been inscroll'd:<lb/>
Fare you well; your suit is cold.<lb/>
Cold, indeed; and labour lost:<lb/>
Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!<lb/>
Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart<lb/>
To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:<lb/>
With him is Gratiano gone along;<lb/>
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,<lb/>
Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>He came too late, the ship was under sail:<lb/>
But there the duke was given to understand<lb/>
That in a gondola were seen together<lb/>
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:<lb/>
Besides, Antonio certified the duke<lb/>
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>I never heard a passion so confused,<lb/>
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,<lb/>
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:<lb/>
'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!<lb/>
Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!<lb/>
Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!<lb/>
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,<lb/>
Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!<lb/>
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,<lb/>
Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;<lb/>
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,<lb/>
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>Let good Antonio look he keep his day,<lb/>
Or he shall pay for this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Marry, well remember'd.<lb/>
I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,<lb/>
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part<lb/>
The French and English, there miscarried<lb/>
A vessel of our country richly fraught:<lb/>
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;<lb/>
And wish'd in silence that it were not his.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;<lb/>
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.<lb/>
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:<lb/>
Bassanio told him he would make some speed<lb/>
Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;<lb/>
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio<lb/>
But stay the very riping of the time;<lb/>
And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,<lb/>
Let it not enter in your mind of love:<lb/>
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts<lb/>
To courtship and such fair ostents of love<lb/>
As shall conveniently become you there:'<lb/>
And even there, his eye being big with tears,<lb/>
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,<lb/>
And with affection wondrous sensible<lb/>
He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>I think he only loves the world for him.<lb/>
I pray thee, let us go and find him out<lb/>

<p><stage>Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter NERISSA with a Servitor</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:<lb/>
The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,<lb/>
And comes to his election presently.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,	PORTIA, and their trains</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:<lb/>
If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,<lb/>
Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:<lb/>
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,<lb/>
You must be gone from hence immediately.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARRAGON</speaker>
<p>I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:<lb/>
First, never to unfold to any one<lb/>
Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail<lb/>
Of the right casket, never in my life<lb/>
To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,<lb/>
If I do fail in fortune of my choice,<lb/>
Immediately to leave you and be gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>To these injunctions every one doth swear<lb/>
That comes to hazard for my worthless self.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARRAGON</speaker>
<p>And so have I address'd me. Fortune now<lb/>
To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.<lb/>
'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'<lb/>
You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.<lb/>
What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:<lb/>
'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'<lb/>
What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant<lb/>
By the fool multitude, that choose by show,<lb/>
Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;<lb/>
Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,<lb/>
Builds in the weather on the outward wall,<lb/>
Even in the force and road of casualty.<lb/>
I will not choose what many men desire,<lb/>
Because I will not jump with common spirits<lb/>
And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.<lb/>
Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;<lb/>
Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:<lb/>
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'<lb/>
And well said too; for who shall go about<lb/>
To cozen fortune and be honourable<lb/>
Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume<lb/>
To wear an undeserved dignity.<lb/>
O, that estates, degrees and offices<lb/>
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour<lb/>
Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!<lb/>
How many then should cover that stand bare!<lb/>
How many be commanded that command!<lb/>
How much low peasantry would then be glean'd<lb/>
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour<lb/>
Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times<lb/>
To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:<lb/>
'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'<lb/>
I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,<lb/>
And instantly unlock my fortunes here.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He opens the silver casket</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Too long a pause for that which you find there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARRAGON</speaker>
<p>What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,<lb/>
Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.<lb/>
How much unlike art thou to Portia!<lb/>
How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!<lb/>
'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'<lb/>
Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?<lb/>
Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>To offend, and judge, are distinct offices<lb/>
And of opposed natures.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARRAGON</speaker>
<p>What is here?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
The fire seven times tried this:<lb/>
Seven times tried that judgment is,<lb/>
That did never choose amiss.<lb/>
Some there be that shadows kiss;<lb/>
Such have but a shadow's bliss:<lb/>
There be fools alive, I wis,<lb/>
Silver'd o'er; and so was this.<lb/>
Take what wife you will to bed,<lb/>
I will ever be your head:<lb/>
So be gone: you are sped.<lb/>
Still more fool I shall appear<lb/>
By the time I linger here<lb/>
With one fool's head I came to woo,<lb/>
But I go away with two.<lb/>
Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,<lb/>
Patiently to bear my wroth.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Arragon and train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Thus hath the candle singed the moth.<lb/>
O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,<lb/>
They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>The ancient saying is no heresy,<lb/>
Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Where is my lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Here: what would my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Madam, there is alighted at your gate<lb/>
A young Venetian, one that comes before<lb/>
To signify the approaching of his lord;<lb/>
From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,<lb/>
To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,<lb/>
Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen<lb/>
So likely an ambassador of love:<lb/>
A day in April never came so sweet,<lb/>
To show how costly summer was at hand,<lb/>
As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard<lb/>
Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,<lb/>
Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.<lb/>
Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see<lb/>
Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.<lb/>

<head>Scene 1</head>

<p><stage>Venice. A street.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter SALANIO and SALARINO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>Now, what news on the Rialto?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath<lb/>
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;<lb/>
the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very<lb/>
dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many<lb/>
a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip<lb/>
Report be an honest woman of her word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever<lb/>
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she<lb/>
wept for the death of a third husband. But it is<lb/>
true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the<lb/>
plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the<lb/>
honest Antonio,&mdash;O that I had a title good enough<lb/>
to keep his name company!&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Come, the full stop.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath<lb/>
lost a ship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>I would it might prove the end of his losses.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my<lb/>
prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SHYLOCK</stage></p>


<p>
How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my<lb/>
daughter's flight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor<lb/>
that made the wings she flew withal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was<lb/>
fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all<lb/>
to leave the dam.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>She is damned for it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>My own flesh and blood to rebel!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>There is more difference between thy flesh and hers<lb/>
than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods<lb/>
than there is between red wine and rhenish. But<lb/>
tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any<lb/>
loss at sea or no?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a<lb/>
prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the<lb/>
Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon<lb/>
the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to<lb/>
call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was<lb/>
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him<lb/>
look to his bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take<lb/>
his flesh: what's that good for?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,<lb/>
it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and<lb/>
hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,<lb/>
mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my<lb/>
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine<lb/>
enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath<lb/>
not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,<lb/>
dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with<lb/>
the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject<lb/>
to the same diseases, healed by the same means,<lb/>
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as<lb/>
a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?<lb/>
if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison<lb/>
us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not<lb/>
revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will<lb/>
resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,<lb/>
what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian<lb/>
wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by<lb/>
Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you<lb/>
teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I<lb/>
will better the instruction.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and<lb/>
desires to speak with you both.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>We have been up and down to seek him.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter TUBAL</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALANIO</speaker>
<p>Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be<lb/>
matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou<lb/>
found my daughter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
<p>I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,<lb/>
cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse<lb/>
never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it<lb/>
till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other<lb/>
precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter<lb/>
were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!<lb/>
would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in<lb/>
her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know<lb/>
not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon<lb/>
loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to<lb/>
find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:<lb/>
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my<lb/>
shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears<lb/>
but of my shedding.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
<p>Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I<lb/>
heard in Genoa,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
<p>Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
<p>I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!<lb/>
ha, ha! where? in Genoa?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
<p>Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one<lb/>
night fourscore ducats.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my<lb/>
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!<lb/>
fourscore ducats!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
<p>There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my<lb/>
company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture<lb/>
him: I am glad of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
<p>One of them showed me a ring that he had of your<lb/>
daughter for a monkey.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my<lb/>
turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:<lb/>
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TUBAL</speaker>
<p>But Antonio is certainly undone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee<lb/>
me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I<lb/>
will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were<lb/>
he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I<lb/>
will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;<lb/>
go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and	Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two<lb/>
Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,<lb/>
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.<lb/>
There's something tells me, but it is not love,<lb/>
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,<lb/>
Hate counsels not in such a quality.<lb/>
But lest you should not understand me well,&mdash;<lb/>
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,&mdash;<lb/>
I would detain you here some month or two<lb/>
Before you venture for me. I could teach you<lb/>
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;<lb/>
So will I never be: so may you miss me;<lb/>
But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,<lb/>
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,<lb/>
They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;<lb/>
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,<lb/>
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,<lb/>
And so all yours. O, these naughty times<lb/>
Put bars between the owners and their rights!<lb/>
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,<lb/>
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.<lb/>
I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,<lb/>
To eke it and to draw it out in length,<lb/>
To stay you from election.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Let me choose<lb/>
For as I am, I live upon the rack.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess<lb/>
What treason there is mingled with your love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>None but that ugly treason of mistrust,<lb/>
Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:<lb/>
There may as well be amity and life<lb/>
'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,<lb/>
Where men enforced do speak anything.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Well then, confess and live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>'Confess' and 'love'<lb/>
Had been the very sum of my confession:<lb/>
O happy torment, when my torturer<lb/>
Doth teach me answers for deliverance!<lb/>
But let me to my fortune and the caskets.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:<lb/>
If you do love me, you will find me out.<lb/>
Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.<lb/>
Let music sound while he doth make his choice;<lb/>
Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,<lb/>
Fading in music: that the comparison<lb/>
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream<lb/>
And watery death-bed for him. He may win;<lb/>
And what is music then? Then music is<lb/>
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow<lb/>
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is<lb/>
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day<lb/>
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,<lb/>
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,<lb/>
With no less presence, but with much more love,<lb/>
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem<lb/>
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy<lb/>
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice<lb/>
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,<lb/>
With bleared visages, come forth to view<lb/>
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!<lb/>
Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay<lb/>
I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself</stage></p>


<p>

SONG.<lb/>
Tell me where is fancy bred,<lb/>
Or in the heart, or in the head?<lb/>
How begot, how nourished?<lb/>
Reply, reply.<lb/>
It is engender'd in the eyes,<lb/>
With gazing fed; and fancy dies<lb/>
In the cradle where it lies.<lb/>
Let us all ring fancy's knell<lb/>
I'll begin it,&mdash;Ding, dong, bell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>Ding, dong, bell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>So may the outward shows be least themselves:<lb/>
The world is still deceived with ornament.<lb/>
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,<lb/>
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,<lb/>
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,<lb/>
What damned error, but some sober brow<lb/>
Will bless it and approve it with a text,<lb/>
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?<lb/>
There is no vice so simple but assumes<lb/>
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:<lb/>
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false<lb/>
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins<lb/>
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;<lb/>
Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;<lb/>
And these assume but valour's excrement<lb/>
To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,<lb/>
And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;<lb/>
Which therein works a miracle in nature,<lb/>
Making them lightest that wear most of it:<lb/>
So are those crisped snaky golden locks<lb/>
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,<lb/>
Upon supposed fairness, often known<lb/>
To be the dowry of a second head,<lb/>
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.<lb/>
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore<lb/>
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf<lb/>
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,<lb/>
The seeming truth which cunning times put on<lb/>
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,<lb/>
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;<lb/>
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge<lb/>
'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,<lb/>
Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,<lb/>
Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;<lb/>
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  How all the other passions fleet to air,<lb/>
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,<lb/>
And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,<lb/>
Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,<lb/>
In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.<lb/>
I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,<lb/>
For fear I surfeit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>What find I here?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Opening the leaden casket</stage></p>


<p>
Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god<lb/>
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?<lb/>
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,<lb/>
Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,<lb/>
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar<lb/>
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs<lb/>
The painter plays the spider and hath woven<lb/>
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,<lb/>
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,&mdash;<lb/>
How could he see to do them? having made one,<lb/>
Methinks it should have power to steal both his<lb/>
And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far<lb/>
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow<lb/>
In underprizing it, so far this shadow<lb/>
Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,<lb/>
The continent and summary of my fortune.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
You that choose not by the view,<lb/>
Chance as fair and choose as true!<lb/>
Since this fortune falls to you,<lb/>
Be content and seek no new,<lb/>
If you be well pleased with this<lb/>
And hold your fortune for your bliss,<lb/>
Turn you where your lady is<lb/>
And claim her with a loving kiss.<lb/>
A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;<lb/>
I come by note, to give and to receive.<lb/>
Like one of two contending in a prize,<lb/>
That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,<lb/>
Hearing applause and universal shout,<lb/>
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt<lb/>
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;<lb/>
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;<lb/>
As doubtful whether what I see be true,<lb/>
Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,<lb/>
Such as I am: though for myself alone<lb/>
I would not be ambitious in my wish,<lb/>
To wish myself much better; yet, for you<lb/>
I would be trebled twenty times myself;<lb/>
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;<lb/>
That only to stand high in your account,<lb/>
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,<lb/>
Exceed account; but the full sum of me<lb/>
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,<lb/>
Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;<lb/>
Happy in this, she is not yet so old<lb/>
But she may learn; happier than this,<lb/>
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;<lb/>
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit<lb/>
Commits itself to yours to be directed,<lb/>
As from her lord, her governor, her king.<lb/>
Myself and what is mine to you and yours<lb/>
Is now converted: but now I was the lord<lb/>
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,<lb/>
Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,<lb/>
This house, these servants and this same myself<lb/>
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;<lb/>
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,<lb/>
Let it presage the ruin of your love<lb/>
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Madam, you have bereft me of all words,<lb/>
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;<lb/>
And there is such confusion in my powers,<lb/>
As after some oration fairly spoke<lb/>
By a beloved prince, there doth appear<lb/>
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;<lb/>
Where every something, being blent together,<lb/>
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,<lb/>
Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring<lb/>
Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:<lb/>
O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>My lord and lady, it is now our time,<lb/>
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,<lb/>
To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,<lb/>
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;<lb/>
For I am sure you can wish none from me:<lb/>
And when your honours mean to solemnize<lb/>
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,<lb/>
Even at that time I may be married too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>I thank your lordship, you have got me one.<lb/>
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:<lb/>
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;<lb/>
You loved, I loved for intermission.<lb/>
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.<lb/>
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,<lb/>
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;<lb/>
For wooing here until I sweat again,<lb/>
And sweating until my very roof was dry<lb/>
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,<lb/>
I got a promise of this fair one here<lb/>
To have her love, provided that your fortune<lb/>
Achieved her mistress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Is this true, Nerissa?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Yes, faith, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>What, and stake down?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.<lb/>
But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,<lb/>
and my old Venetian friend Salerio?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger	from Venice</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;<lb/>
If that the youth of my new interest here<lb/>
Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,<lb/>
I bid my very friends and countrymen,<lb/>
Sweet Portia, welcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>So do I, my lord:<lb/>
They are entirely welcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,<lb/>
My purpose was not to have seen you here;<lb/>
But meeting with Salerio by the way,<lb/>
He did entreat me, past all saying nay,<lb/>
To come with him along.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALERIO</speaker>
<p>I did, my lord;<lb/>
And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio<lb/>
Commends him to you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Gives Bassanio a letter</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Ere I ope his letter,<lb/>
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALERIO</speaker>
<p>Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;<lb/>
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there<lb/>
Will show you his estate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.<lb/>
Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?<lb/>
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?<lb/>
I know he will be glad of our success;<lb/>
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALERIO</speaker>
<p>I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,<lb/>
That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:<lb/>
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world<lb/>
Could turn so much the constitution<lb/>
Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!<lb/>
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,<lb/>
And I must freely have the half of anything<lb/>
That this same paper brings you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>O sweet Portia,<lb/>
Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words<lb/>
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,<lb/>
When I did first impart my love to you,<lb/>
I freely told you, all the wealth I had<lb/>
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;<lb/>
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,<lb/>
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see<lb/>
How much I was a braggart. When I told you<lb/>
My state was nothing, I should then have told you<lb/>
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,<lb/>
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,<lb/>
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,<lb/>
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;<lb/>
The paper as the body of my friend,<lb/>
And every word in it a gaping wound,<lb/>
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?<lb/>
Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?<lb/>
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,<lb/>
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?<lb/>
And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch<lb/>
Of merchant-marring rocks?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALERIO</speaker>
<p>Not one, my lord.<lb/>
Besides, it should appear, that if he had<lb/>
The present money to discharge the Jew,<lb/>
He would not take it. Never did I know<lb/>
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,<lb/>
So keen and greedy to confound a man:<lb/>
He plies the duke at morning and at night,<lb/>
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,<lb/>
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,<lb/>
The duke himself, and the magnificoes<lb/>
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;<lb/>
But none can drive him from the envious plea<lb/>
Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>When I was with him I have heard him swear<lb/>
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,<lb/>
That he would rather have Antonio's flesh<lb/>
Than twenty times the value of the sum<lb/>
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,<lb/>
If law, authority and power deny not,<lb/>
It will go hard with poor Antonio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,<lb/>
The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit<lb/>
In doing courtesies, and one in whom<lb/>
The ancient Roman honour more appears<lb/>
Than any that draws breath in Italy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>What sum owes he the Jew?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>For me three thousand ducats.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>What, no more?<lb/>
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;<lb/>
Double six thousand, and then treble that,<lb/>
Before a friend of this description<lb/>
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.<lb/>
First go with me to church and call me wife,<lb/>
And then away to Venice to your friend;<lb/>
For never shall you lie by Portia's side<lb/>
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold<lb/>
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:<lb/>
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.<lb/>
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime<lb/>
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!<lb/>
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:<lb/>
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:<lb/>
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.<lb/>
But let me hear the letter of your friend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all<lb/>
miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is<lb/>
very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since<lb/>
in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all<lb/>
debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but<lb/>
see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your<lb/>
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,<lb/>
let not my letter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Since I have your good leave to go away,<lb/>
I will make haste: but, till I come again,<lb/>
No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,<lb/>
No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;<lb/>
This is the fool that lent out money gratis:<lb/>
Gaoler, look to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Hear me yet, good Shylock.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:<lb/>
I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.<lb/>
Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;<lb/>
But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:<lb/>
The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,<lb/>
Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, hear me speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:<lb/>
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.<lb/>
I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,<lb/>

I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.<lb/>

I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.<lb/>
He seeks my life; his reason well I know:<lb/>
I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures<lb/>
Many that have at times made moan to me;<lb/>
Therefore he hates me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALARINO</speaker>
<p>I am sure the duke<lb/>
Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>The duke cannot deny the course of law:<lb/>
For the commodity that strangers have<lb/>
With us in Venice, if it be denied,<lb/>
Will much impeach the justice of his state;<lb/>
Since that the trade and profit of the city<lb/>
Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:<lb/>
These griefs and losses have so bated me,<lb/>
That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh<lb/>
To-morrow to my bloody creditor.<lb/>
Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and	BALTHASAR</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Madam, although I speak it in your presence,<lb/>
You have a noble and a true conceit<lb/>
Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly<lb/>
In bearing thus the absence of your lord.<lb/>
But if you knew to whom you show this honour,<lb/>
How true a gentleman you send relief,<lb/>
How dear a lover of my lord your husband,<lb/>
I know you would be prouder of the work<lb/>
Than customary bounty can enforce you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I never did repent for doing good,<lb/>
Nor shall not now: for in companions<lb/>
That do converse and waste the time together,<lb/>
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,<lb/>
There must be needs a like proportion<lb/>
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;<lb/>
Which makes me think that this Antonio,<lb/>
Being the bosom lover of my lord,<lb/>
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,<lb/>
How little is the cost I have bestow'd<lb/>
In purchasing the semblance of my soul<lb/>
From out the state of hellish misery!<lb/>
This comes too near the praising of myself;<lb/>
Therefore no more of it: hear other things.<lb/>
Lorenzo, I commit into your hands<lb/>
The husbandry and manage of my house<lb/>
Until my lord's return: for mine own part,<lb/>
I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow<lb/>
To live in prayer and contemplation,<lb/>
Only attended by Nerissa here,<lb/>
Until her husband and my lord's return:<lb/>
There is a monastery two miles off;<lb/>
And there will we abide. I do desire you<lb/>
Not to deny this imposition;<lb/>
The which my love and some necessity<lb/>
Now lays upon you.<lb/>

<p>Shall they see us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,<lb/>
That they shall think we are accomplished<lb/>
With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,<lb/>
When we are both accoutred like young men,<lb/>
I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,<lb/>
And wear my dagger with the braver grace,<lb/>
And speak between the change of man and boy<lb/>
With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps<lb/>
Into a manly stride, and speak of frays<lb/>
Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,<lb/>
How honourable ladies sought my love,<lb/>
Which I denying, they fell sick and died;<lb/>
I could not do withal; then I'll repent,<lb/>
And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;<lb/>
And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,<lb/>
That men shall swear I have discontinued school<lb/>
Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind<lb/>
A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,<lb/>
Which I will practise.<lb/>

<p>Why, shall we turn to men?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Fie, what a question's that,<lb/>

<p><stage>The same. A garden.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father<lb/>
are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I<lb/>
promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with<lb/>
you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:<lb/>
therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you<lb/>
are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do<lb/>
you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard<lb/>
hope neither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>And what hope is that, I pray thee?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you<lb/>
not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the<lb/>
sins of my mother should be visited upon me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and<lb/>
mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I<lb/>
fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are<lb/>
gone both ways.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a<lb/>
Christian.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians<lb/>
enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by<lb/>
another. This making Christians will raise the<lb/>
price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we<lb/>
shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LORENZO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if<lb/>
you thus get my wife into corners.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I<lb/>
are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for<lb/>
me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he<lb/>
says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,<lb/>
for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the<lb/>
price of pork.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than<lb/>
you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the<lb/>
Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:<lb/>
but if she be less than an honest woman, she is<lb/>
indeed more than I took her for.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>How every fool can play upon the word! I think the<lb/>
best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,<lb/>
and discourse grow commendable in none only but<lb/>
parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid<lb/>
them prepare dinner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Will you cover then, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show<lb/>
the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray<lb/>
tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:<lb/>
go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve<lb/>
in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the<lb/>
meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in<lb/>
to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and<lb/>
conceits shall govern.<lb/>

<p>O dear discretion, how his words are suited!<lb/>
The fool hath planted in his memory<lb/>
An army of good words; and I do know<lb/>
A many fools, that stand in better place,<lb/>
Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word<lb/>
Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?<lb/>
And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,<lb/>
How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>Past all expressing. It is very meet<lb/>
The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;<lb/>
For, having such a blessing in his lady,<lb/>
He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;<lb/>
And if on earth he do not mean it, then<lb/>
In reason he should never come to heaven<lb/>
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match<lb/>
And on the wager lay two earthly women,<lb/>
And Portia one, there must be something else<lb/>
Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world<lb/>
Hath not her fellow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Even such a husband<lb/>
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>What, is Antonio here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Ready, so please your grace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer<lb/>
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch<lb/>
uncapable of pity, void and empty<lb/>
From any dram of mercy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I have heard<lb/>
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify<lb/>
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate<lb/>
And that no lawful means can carry me<lb/>
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose<lb/>
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd<lb/>
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,<lb/>
The very tyranny and rage of his.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>Go one, and call the Jew into the court.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALERIO</speaker>
<p>He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter SHYLOCK</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>Make room, and let him stand before our face.<lb/>
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,<lb/>
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice<lb/>
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought<lb/>
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange<lb/>
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;<lb/>
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,<lb/>
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,<lb/>
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,<lb/>
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,<lb/>
Forgive a moiety of the principal;<lb/>
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,<lb/>
That have of late so huddled on his back,<lb/>
Enow to press a royal merchant down<lb/>
And pluck commiseration of his state<lb/>
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,<lb/>
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd<lb/>
To offices of tender courtesy.<lb/>
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;<lb/>
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn<lb/>
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:<lb/>
If you deny it, let the danger light<lb/>
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.<lb/>
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have<lb/>
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive<lb/>
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:<lb/>
But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?<lb/>
What if my house be troubled with a rat<lb/>
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats<lb/>
To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?<lb/>
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;<lb/>
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;<lb/>
And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,<lb/>
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,<lb/>
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood<lb/>
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:<lb/>
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,<lb/>
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;<lb/>
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;<lb/>
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force<lb/>
Must yield to such inevitable shame<lb/>
As to offend, himself being offended;<lb/>
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,<lb/>
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing<lb/>
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus<lb/>
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?<lb/>

<p>This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,<lb/>
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I am not bound to please thee with my answers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Do all men kill the things they do not love?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Hates any man the thing he would not kill?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Every offence is not a hate at first.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I pray you, think you question with the Jew:<lb/>
You may as well go stand upon the beach<lb/>
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;<lb/>
You may as well use question with the wolf<lb/>
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;<lb/>
You may as well forbid the mountain pines<lb/>
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,<lb/>
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;<lb/>
You may as well do anything most hard,<lb/>
As seek to soften that&mdash;than which what's harder?&mdash;<lb/>
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,<lb/>
Make no more offers, use no farther means,<lb/>
But with all brief and plain conveniency<lb/>
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>For thy three thousand ducats here is six.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>What judgment shall I dread, doing<lb/>
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,<lb/>
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?<lb/>
You have among you many a purchased slave,<lb/>
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,<lb/>
You use in abject and in slavish parts,<lb/>
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,<lb/>
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?<lb/>
Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds<lb/>
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates<lb/>
Be season'd with such viands? You will answer<lb/>
'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:<lb/>
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,<lb/>
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.<lb/>
If you deny me, fie upon your law!<lb/>
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.<lb/>
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>Upon my power I may dismiss this court,<lb/>
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,<lb/>
Whom I have sent for to determine this,<lb/>
Come here to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALERIO</speaker>
<p>My lord, here stays without<lb/>
A messenger with letters from the doctor,<lb/>
New come from Padua.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>Bring us the letter; call the messenger.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!<lb/>
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,<lb/>
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I am a tainted wether of the flock,<lb/>
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit<lb/>
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me<lb/>
You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,<lb/>
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>Came you from Padua, from Bellario?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Presenting a letter</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,<lb/>
Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,<lb/>
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness<lb/>
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!<lb/>
And for thy life let justice be accused.<lb/>
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith<lb/>
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,<lb/>
That souls of animals infuse themselves<lb/>
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit<lb/>
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,<lb/>
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,<lb/>
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,<lb/>
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires<lb/>
Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,<lb/>
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:<lb/>
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall<lb/>
To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>This letter from Bellario doth commend<lb/>
A young and learned doctor to our court.<lb/>
Where is he?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>He attendeth here hard by,<lb/>
To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>With all my heart. Some three or four of you<lb/>
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.<lb/>
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clerk</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of<lb/>
your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that<lb/>
your messenger came, in loving visitation was with<lb/>
me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I<lb/>
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between<lb/>
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er<lb/>
many books together: he is furnished with my<lb/>
opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the<lb/>
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes<lb/>
with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's<lb/>
request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of<lb/>
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend<lb/>
estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so<lb/>
old a head. I leave him to your gracious<lb/>
acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his<lb/>
commendation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:<lb/>
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws</stage></p>


<p>
Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I did, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>You are welcome: take your place.<lb/>
Are you acquainted with the difference<lb/>
That holds this present question in the court?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I am informed thoroughly of the cause.<lb/>
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Is your name Shylock?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Shylock is my name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;<lb/>
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law<lb/>
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.<lb/>
You stand within his danger, do you not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Ay, so he says.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Do you confess the bond?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Then must the Jew be merciful.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>On what compulsion must I? tell me that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>The quality of mercy is not strain'd,<lb/>
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<lb/>
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;<lb/>
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:<lb/>
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes<lb/>
The throned monarch better than his crown;<lb/>
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<lb/>
The attribute to awe and majesty,<lb/>
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<lb/>
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;<lb/>
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,<lb/>
It is an attribute to God himself;<lb/>
And earthly power doth then show likest God's<lb/>
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<lb/>
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<lb/>
That, in the course of justice, none of us<lb/>
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;<lb/>
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<lb/>
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much<lb/>
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;<lb/>
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<lb/>
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,<lb/>
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Is he not able to discharge the money?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;<lb/>
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,<lb/>
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,<lb/>
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:<lb/>
If this will not suffice, it must appear<lb/>
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,<lb/>
Wrest once the law to your authority:<lb/>
To do a great right, do a little wrong,<lb/>
And curb this cruel devil of his will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>It must not be; there is no power in Venice<lb/>
Can alter a decree established:<lb/>
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,<lb/>
And many an error by the same example<lb/>
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!<lb/>
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I pray you, let me look upon the bond.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:<lb/>
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?<lb/>
No, not for Venice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Why, this bond is forfeit;<lb/>
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim<lb/>
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off<lb/>
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:<lb/>
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>When it is paid according to the tenor.<lb/>
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;<lb/>
You know the law, your exposition<lb/>
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,<lb/>
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,<lb/>
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear<lb/>
There is no power in the tongue of man<lb/>
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Most heartily I do beseech the court<lb/>
To give the judgment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Why then, thus it is:<lb/>
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>O noble judge! O excellent young man!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>For the intent and purpose of the law<lb/>
Hath full relation to the penalty,<lb/>
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!<lb/>
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Therefore lay bare your bosom.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Ay, his breast:<lb/>
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?<lb/>
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>It is so. Are there balance here to weigh<lb/>
The flesh?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I have them ready.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,<lb/>
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Is it so nominated in the bond?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>It is not so express'd: but what of that?<lb/>
'Twere good you do so much for charity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>You, merchant, have you any thing to say?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.<lb/>
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!<lb/>
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;<lb/>
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind<lb/>
Than is her custom: it is still her use<lb/>
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,<lb/>
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow<lb/>
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance<lb/>
Of such misery doth she cut me off.<lb/>
Commend me to your honourable wife:<lb/>
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;<lb/>
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;<lb/>
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge<lb/>
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.<lb/>
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,<lb/>
And he repents not that he pays your debt;<lb/>
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,<lb/>
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Antonio, I am married to a wife<lb/>
Which is as dear to me as life itself;<lb/>
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,<lb/>
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:<lb/>
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all<lb/>
Here to this devil, to deliver you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Your wife would give you little thanks for that,<lb/>
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:<lb/>
I would she were in heaven, so she could<lb/>
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>'Tis well you offer it behind her back;<lb/>
The wish would make else an unquiet house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;<lb/>
Would any of the stock of Barrabas<lb/>
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:<lb/>
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Most rightful judge!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:<lb/>
The law allows it, and the court awards it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Tarry a little; there is something else.<lb/>
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;<lb/>
The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'<lb/>
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;<lb/>
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed<lb/>
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods<lb/>
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate<lb/>
Unto the state of Venice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Is that the law?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Thyself shalt see the act:<lb/>
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured<lb/>
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice<lb/>
And let the Christian go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Here is the money.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Soft!<lb/>
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:<lb/>
He shall have nothing but the penalty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.<lb/>
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more<lb/>
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more<lb/>
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much<lb/>
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,<lb/>
Or the division of the twentieth part<lb/>
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn<lb/>
But in the estimation of a hair,<lb/>
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!<lb/>
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Give me my principal, and let me go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>I have it ready for thee; here it is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>He hath refused it in the open court:<lb/>
He shall have merely justice and his bond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!<lb/>
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Shall I not have barely my principal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,<lb/>
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Why, then the devil give him good of it!<lb/>
I'll stay no longer question.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Tarry, Jew:<lb/>
The law hath yet another hold on you.<lb/>
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,<lb/>
If it be proved against an alien<lb/>
That by direct or indirect attempts<lb/>
He seek the life of any citizen,<lb/>
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive<lb/>
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half<lb/>
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;<lb/>
And the offender's life lies in the mercy<lb/>
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.<lb/>
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;<lb/>
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,<lb/>
That indirectly and directly too<lb/>
Thou hast contrived against the very life<lb/>
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd<lb/>
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.<lb/>
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:<lb/>
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,<lb/>
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;<lb/>
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,<lb/>
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:<lb/>
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;<lb/>
The other half comes to the general state,<lb/>
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:<lb/>
You take my house when you do take the prop<lb/>
That doth sustain my house; you take my life<lb/>
When you do take the means whereby I live.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>What mercy can you render him, Antonio?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>So please my lord the duke and all the court<lb/>
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,<lb/>
I am content; so he will let me have<lb/>
The other half in use, to render it,<lb/>
Upon his death, unto the gentleman<lb/>
That lately stole his daughter:<lb/>
Two things provided more, that, for this favour,<lb/>
He presently become a Christian;<lb/>
The other, that he do record a gift,<lb/>
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,<lb/>
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>He shall do this, or else I do recant<lb/>
The pardon that I late pronounced here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I am content.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Clerk, draw a deed of gift.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHYLOCK</speaker>
<p>I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;<lb/>
I am not well: send the deed after me,<lb/>
And I will sign it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>Get thee gone, but do it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:<lb/>
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,<lb/>
To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:<lb/>
I must away this night toward Padua,<lb/>
And it is meet I presently set forth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE</speaker>
<p>I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.<lb/>
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,<lb/>
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Duke and his train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend<lb/>
Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted<lb/>
Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,<lb/>
Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,<lb/>
We freely cope your courteous pains withal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>And stand indebted, over and above,<lb/>
In love and service to you evermore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>He is well paid that is well satisfied;<lb/>
And I, delivering you, am satisfied<lb/>
And therein do account myself well paid:<lb/>
My mind was never yet more mercenary.<lb/>
I pray you, know me when we meet again:<lb/>
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:<lb/>
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,<lb/>
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,<lb/>
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>You press me far, and therefore I will yield.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To ANTONIO</stage></p>


<p>
Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To BASSANIO</stage></p>


<p>
And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:<lb/>
Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;<lb/>
And you in love shall not deny me this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!<lb/>
I will not shame myself to give you this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I will have nothing else but only this;<lb/>
And now methinks I have a mind to it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>There's more depends on this than on the value.<lb/>
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,<lb/>
And find it out by proclamation:<lb/>
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I see, sir, you are liberal in offers<lb/>
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks<lb/>
You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;<lb/>
And when she put it on, she made me vow<lb/>
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.<lb/>

<p>That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.<lb/>
An if your wife be not a mad-woman,<lb/>
And know how well I have deserved the ring,<lb/>
She would not hold out enemy for ever,<lb/>
For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Portia and Nerissa</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:<lb/>
Let his deservings and my love withal<lb/>
Be valued against your wife's commandment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;<lb/>
Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,<lb/>
Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.<lb/>

<p>
Come, you and I will thither presently;<lb/>
And in the morning early will we both<lb/>
Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en<lb/>
My Lord Bassanio upon more advice<lb/>
Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat<lb/>
Your company at dinner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>That cannot be:<lb/>
His ring I do accept most thankfully:<lb/>
And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,<lb/>

<head>Scene 1</head>

<p><stage>Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LORENZO and JESSICA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,<lb/>
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees<lb/>
And they did make no noise, in such a night<lb/>
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls<lb/>
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,<lb/>
Where Cressid lay that night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>In such a night<lb/>
Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew<lb/>
And saw the lion's shadow ere himself<lb/>
And ran dismay'd away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>In such a night<lb/>
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand<lb/>
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love<lb/>
To come again to Carthage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>In such a night<lb/>
Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs<lb/>
That did renew old AEson.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>In such a night<lb/>
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew<lb/>
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice<lb/>
As far as Belmont.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>In such a night<lb/>
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,<lb/>
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith<lb/>
And ne'er a true one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>In such a night<lb/>
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,<lb/>
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>I would out-night you, did no body come;<lb/>
But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter STEPHANO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Who comes so fast in silence of the night?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>A friend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>Stephano is my name; and I bring word<lb/>
My mistress will before the break of day<lb/>
Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about<lb/>
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays<lb/>
For happy wedlock hours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Who comes with her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STEPHANO</speaker>
<p>None but a holy hermit and her maid.<lb/>
I pray you, is my master yet return'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>He is not, nor we have not heard from him.<lb/>
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,<lb/>
And ceremoniously let us prepare<lb/>
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LAUNCELOT</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Who calls?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?<lb/>
Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Leave hollaing, man: here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Sola! where? where?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAUNCELOT</speaker>
<p>Tell him there's a post come from my master, with<lb/>
his horn full of good news: my master will be here<lb/>
ere morning.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.<lb/>
And yet no matter: why should we go in?<lb/>
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,<lb/>
Within the house, your mistress is at hand;<lb/>
And bring your music forth into the air.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Stephano</stage></p>


<p>
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!<lb/>
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music<lb/>
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night<lb/>
Become the touches of sweet harmony.<lb/>
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven<lb/>
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:<lb/>
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st<lb/>
But in his motion like an angel sings,<lb/>
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;<lb/>
Such harmony is in immortal souls;<lb/>
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay<lb/>
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Musicians</stage></p>


<p>
Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!<lb/>
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,<lb/>
And draw her home with music.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Music</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JESSICA</speaker>
<p>I am never merry when I hear sweet music.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>The reason is, your spirits are attentive:<lb/>
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,<lb/>
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,<lb/>
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<lb/>
Which is the hot condition of their blood;<lb/>
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,<lb/>
Or any air of music touch their ears,<lb/>
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<lb/>
Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze<lb/>
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet<lb/>
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;<lb/>
Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,<lb/>
But music for the time doth change his nature.<lb/>
The man that hath no music in himself,<lb/>
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,<lb/>
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;<lb/>
The motions of his spirit are dull as night<lb/>
And his affections dark as Erebus:<lb/>
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PORTIA and NERISSA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>That light we see is burning in my hall.<lb/>
How far that little candle throws his beams!<lb/>
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>So doth the greater glory dim the less:<lb/>
A substitute shines brightly as a king<lb/>
Unto the king be by, and then his state<lb/>
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook<lb/>
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>It is your music, madam, of the house.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Nothing is good, I see, without respect:<lb/>
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,<lb/>
When neither is attended, and I think<lb/>
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,<lb/>
When every goose is cackling, would be thought<lb/>
No better a musician than the wren.<lb/>
How many things by season season'd are<lb/>
To their right praise and true perfection!<lb/>
Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion<lb/>
And would not be awaked.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Music ceases</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>That is the voice,<lb/>
Or I am much deceived, of Portia.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,<lb/>
By the bad voice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Dear lady, welcome home.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>We have been praying for our husbands' healths,<lb/>
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.<lb/>
Are they return'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Madam, they are not yet;<lb/>
But there is come a messenger before,<lb/>
To signify their coming.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Go in, Nerissa;<lb/>
Give order to my servants that they take<lb/>
No note at all of our being absent hence;<lb/>
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A tucket sounds</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:<lb/>
We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>This night methinks is but the daylight sick;<lb/>
It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,<lb/>
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and	their followers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>We should hold day with the Antipodes,<lb/>
If you would walk in absence of the sun.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Let me give light, but let me not be light;<lb/>
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,<lb/>
And never be Bassanio so for me:<lb/>
But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.<lb/>
This is the man, this is Antonio,<lb/>
To whom I am so infinitely bound.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>You should in all sense be much bound to him.<lb/>
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>No more than I am well acquitted of.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Sir, you are very welcome to our house:<lb/>
It must appear in other ways than words,<lb/>
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p><stage>[To NERISSA]</stage></p><p>  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;<lb/>
In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:<lb/>
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,<lb/>
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring<lb/>
That she did give me, whose posy was<lb/>
For all the world like cutler's poetry<lb/>
Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>What talk you of the posy or the value?<lb/>
You swore to me, when I did give it you,<lb/>
That you would wear it till your hour of death<lb/>
And that it should lie with you in your grave:<lb/>
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,<lb/>
You should have been respective and have kept it.<lb/>
Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,<lb/>
The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>He will, an if he live to be a man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Ay, if a woman live to be a man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,<lb/>
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,<lb/>
No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,<lb/>
A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:<lb/>
I could not for my heart deny it him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>You were to blame, I must be plain with you,<lb/>
To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:<lb/>
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger<lb/>
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.<lb/>
I gave my love a ring and made him swear<lb/>
Never to part with it; and here he stands;<lb/>
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it<lb/>
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth<lb/>
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,<lb/>
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:<lb/>
An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off<lb/>
And swear I lost the ring defending it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away<lb/>
Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed<lb/>
Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,<lb/>
That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;<lb/>
And neither man nor master would take aught<lb/>
But the two rings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>What ring gave you my lord?<lb/>
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>If I could add a lie unto a fault,<lb/>
I would deny it; but you see my finger<lb/>
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Even so void is your false heart of truth.<lb/>
By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed<lb/>
Until I see the ring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Nor I in yours<lb/>
Till I again see mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Sweet Portia,<lb/>
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,<lb/>
If you did know for whom I gave the ring<lb/>
And would conceive for what I gave the ring<lb/>
And how unwillingly I left the ring,<lb/>
When nought would be accepted but the ring,<lb/>
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>If you had known the virtue of the ring,<lb/>
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,<lb/>
Or your own honour to contain the ring,<lb/>
You would not then have parted with the ring.<lb/>
What man is there so much unreasonable,<lb/>
If you had pleased to have defended it<lb/>
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty<lb/>
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?<lb/>
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:<lb/>
I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,<lb/>
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,<lb/>
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me<lb/>
And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him<lb/>
And suffer'd him to go displeased away;<lb/>
Even he that did uphold the very life<lb/>
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?<lb/>
I was enforced to send it after him;<lb/>
I was beset with shame and courtesy;<lb/>
My honour would not let ingratitude<lb/>
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;<lb/>
For, by these blessed candles of the night,<lb/>
Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd<lb/>
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:<lb/>
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,<lb/>
And that which you did swear to keep for me,<lb/>
I will become as liberal as you;<lb/>
I'll not deny him any thing I have,<lb/>
No, not my body nor my husband's bed:<lb/>
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:<lb/>
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:<lb/>
If you do not, if I be left alone,<lb/>
Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,<lb/>
I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>And I his clerk; therefore be well advised<lb/>
How you do leave me to mine own protection.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;<lb/>
For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;<lb/>
And, in the hearing of these many friends,<lb/>
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,<lb/>
Wherein I see myself&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Mark you but that!<lb/>
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;<lb/>
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,<lb/>
And there's an oath of credit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, but hear me:<lb/>
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear<lb/>
I never more will break an oath with thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I once did lend my body for his wealth;<lb/>
Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,<lb/>
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,<lb/>
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord<lb/>
Will never more break faith advisedly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Then you shall be his surety. Give him this<lb/>
And bid him keep it better than the other.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;<lb/>
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;<lb/>
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,<lb/>
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Why, this is like the mending of highways<lb/>
In summer, where the ways are fair enough:<lb/>
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:<lb/>
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;<lb/>
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:<lb/>
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,<lb/>
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here<lb/>
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you<lb/>
And even but now return'd; I have not yet<lb/>
Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;<lb/>
And I have better news in store for you<lb/>
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;<lb/>
There you shall find three of your argosies<lb/>
Are richly come to harbour suddenly:<lb/>
You shall not know by what strange accident<lb/>
I chanced on this letter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I am dumb.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Were you the doctor and I knew you not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,<lb/>
Unless he live until he be a man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSANIO</speaker>
<p>Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:<lb/>
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;<lb/>
For here I read for certain that my ships<lb/>
Are safely come to road.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>How now, Lorenzo!<lb/>
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NERISSA</speaker>
<p>Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.<lb/>
There do I give to you and Jessica,<lb/>
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,<lb/>
After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORENZO</speaker>
<p>Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way<lb/>
Of starved people.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>It is almost morning,<lb/>
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied<lb/>
Of these events at full. Let us go in;<lb/>
And charge us there upon inter'gatories,<lb/>
And we will answer all things faithfully.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GRATIANO</speaker>
<p>Let it be so: the first inter'gatory<lb/>
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,<lb/>
Whether till the next night she had rather stay,<lb/>
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:<lb/>
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,<lb/>
That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.<lb/>
Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing<lb/>
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>
