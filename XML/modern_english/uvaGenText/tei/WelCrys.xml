<head>THE CRYSTAL EGG</head> 

<pb n="111"/>  

<p>There was, until a year ago, a little and very grimy-looking shop near 
Seven Dials over which, in weather-worn yellow lettering, the name of 
"C. Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities," was inscribed.  The 
contents of its window were curiously variegated.  They comprised 
some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and 
weapons, a box of eyes, two skulls of tigers and one human, several 
moth-eaten stuffed monkeys (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned 
cabinet, a flyblown ostrich egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an  
extraordinarily dirty, empty glass fish tank.  There was also, at the 
moment the story begins, a mass of crystal, worked into the shape of 
an egg and brilliantly polished.  And at that two people, who stood 
outside the window, were looking, one of them a tall, thin clergyman, 
the other a black-bearded young man of dusky complexion and  
unobtrusive costume.  The dusky young man spoke with eager  
gestulation, and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the article. 
</p><p>While they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his beard still 
wagging with the bread and butter of his tea.  When he saw these men 
and the object of their regard, his countenance fell.  He glanced 
guiltily over his shoulder, and softly shut the door.  He was a little 
old man, with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes; his hair was a 
dirty grey, and he wore a shabby blue frock-coat, an ancient silk hat, 
and carpet slippers very much down at heel.  He remained watching 
the two men as they talked.  The clergyman went deep into his trouser 
pocket, examined a handful of money, and showed his teeth in an 
agreeable smile.  Mr. Cave seemed still more depressed when they came 
into the shop. 
 
<pb n="112"/>  
 
</p><p>The clergyman, without any ceremony, asked the price of the 
crystal egg.  Mr. Cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into 
the parlour, and said five pounds.  The clergyman protested that the 
price was high, to his companion as well as to Mr. Cave&mdash;it was, 
indeed, very much more than Mr. Cave had intended to ask, when 
he had stocked the article&mdash;and an attempt at bargaining ensued.  Mr. 
Cave stepped to the shop-door, and held it open.  "Five pounds is 
my price," he said, as though he wished to save himself the trouble of 
unprofitable discussion.  As he did so, the upper portion of a woman's 
face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door 
leading into the parlour, and stared curiously at the two customers.  
"Five pounds is my price," said Mr. Cave, with a quiver in his voice. 
</p><p>The swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator, watching 
Cave keenly.  Now he spoke.  "Give him five pounds," he said.  The 
clergyman glanced at him to see if he were in earnest, and, when he 
looked at Mr. Cave again, he saw that the latter's face was white.  "It's 
a lot of money," said the clergyman, and, diving into his pocket,  
began counting his resources.  He had little more than thirty shillings, 
and he appealed to his companion, with whom he seemed to be on 
terms of considerable intimacy.  This gave Mr. Cave an opportunity of 
collecting his thoughts, and he began to explain in an agitated manner 
that the crystal was not, as a matter of fact, entirely free for sale.  His 
two customers were naturally surprised at this, and inquired why 
he had not thought of that before he began to bargain.  Mr. Cave 
became confused, but he stuck to his story, that the crystal was not 
in the market that afternoon, that a probable purchaser of it had 
already appeared.  The two, treating this as an attempt to raise the 
price still further, made as if they would leave the shop.  But at this 
point the parlour door opened, and the owner of the dark fringe and 
the little eyes appeared. 
</p><p>She was a coarse-featured, corpulent woman, younger and very 
much larger than Mr. Cave; she walked heavily, and her face was 
flushed.  "That crystal is for sale, she said.  "And five pounds is a 
good enough price for it.  I can't think what you're about, Cave, not 
to take the gentleman's offer!" 
</p><p>Mr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at 
her over the rims of his spectacles, and, without excessive assurance, 
asserted his right to manage his business in his own way.  An  
altercation began.  The two customers watched the scene with interest 
and some amusement, occasionally assisting Mrs. Cave with suggestions. 
Mr. Cave, hard driven, persisted in a confused and impossible 
story of an enquiry for the crystal that morning, and his agitation 
became painful.  But he stuck to his point with extraordinary  
persistence. 
 
<pb n="113"/>  
 
It was the young Oriental who ended this curious controversy. 
He proposed that they should call again in the course of two 
days&mdash;so as to give the alleged enquirer a fair chance.  "And then we 
must insist," said the clergyman.  "Five pounds." Mrs. Cave took it on 
herself to apologise for her husband, explaining that he was sometimes 
"a little odd," and as the two customers left, the couple prepared for 
a free discussion of the incident in all its bearings. 
</p><p>Mrs. Cave talked to her husband with singular directness.  The poor 
little man, quivering with emotion, muddled himself between his 
stories, maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer 
in view, and on the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth 
ten guineas.  "Why did you ask five pounds?" said his wife.  "Do let 
me manage my business my own way!" said Mr. Cave. 
</p><p>Mr. Cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son, and 
at supper that night the transaction was re-discussed.  None of them 
had a high opinion of Mr. Cave's business methods, and this action 
seemed a culminating folly. 
</p><p>"It's my opinion he's refused that crystal before," said the step-son, 
a loose-limbed lout of eighteen. 
</p><p>"But Five Pounds!" said the step-daughter, an argumentative young 
woman of six-and-twenty. 
</p><p>Mr. Cave's answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak 
assertions that he knew his own business best.  They drove him from 
his half-eaten supper into the shop, to close it for the night, his ears 
aflame and tears of vexation behind his spectacles.  "Why had he 
left the crystal in the window so long? The folly of it!" That was the 
trouble closest in his mind.  For a time he could see no way of evading 
sale. 
</p><p>After supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves 
up and went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the  
business aspects of the crystal, over a little sugar and lemon and so 
forth in hot water.  Mr. Cave went into the shop, and stayed there 
until late, ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for gold-fish cases 
but really for a private purpose that will be better explained later.  
The next day Mrs. Cave found that the crystal had been removed 
from the window, and was lying behind some second-hand books on 
angling.  She replaced it in a conspicuous position.  But she did not 
argue further about it, as a nervous headache disinclined her from 
debate.  Mr. Cave was always disinclined.  The day passed disagreeably. 
Mr. Cave was, if anything, more absent-minded than usual, and 
uncommonly irritable withal.  In the afternoon, when his wife was  
taking her customary sleep, he removed the crystal from the window 
again. 
 
<pb n="114"/>  
 
</p><p>The next day Mr. Cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish 
at one of the hospital schools, where they were needed for dissection.  
In his absence Mrs. Cave's mind reverted to the topic of the crystal, 
and the methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds.  
She had already devised some very agreeable expedients, among others 
a dress of green silk for herself and a trip to Richmond, when a 
jangling of the front door bell summoned her into the shop.  The  
customer was an examination coach who came to complain of the non-delivery of certain frogs asked for the previous day.  Mrs. Cave did 
not approve of this particular branch of Mr. Cave's business, and 
the gentleman, who had called in a somewhat aggressive mood, 
retired after a brief exchange of words&mdash;entirely civil so far as he 
was concerned.  Mrs. Cave's eye then naturally turned to the window; 
for the sight of the crystal was an assurance of the five pounds and 
of her dreams.  What was her surprise to find it gone! 
</p><p>She went to the place behind the locker on the counter, where 
she had discovered it the day before.  It was not there; and she  
immediately began an eager search about the shop. 
</p><p>When Mr. Cave returned from his business with the dog-fish, about 
a quarter to two in the afternoon, he found the shop in some  
confusion, and his wife, extremely exasperated and on her knees behind 
the counter, routing among his taxidermic material.  Her face came 
up hot and angry over the counter, as the jangling bell announced 
his return, and she forthwith accused him of "hiding it." 
</p><p>"Hid what?" asked Mr. Cave. 
</p><p>"The crystal!" 
</p><p>At that Mr. Cave, apparently much surprised, rushed to the window.  
"Isn't it here?" he said.  "Great Heavens! what has become of it?" 
</p><p>Just then, Mr. Cave's step-son re-entered the shop from the inner 
room&mdash;he had come home a minute or so before Mr. Cave&mdash;and he 
was blaspheming freely.  He was apprenticed to a second-hand furniture 
dealer down the road, but he had his meals at home, and he was  
naturally annoyed to find no dinner ready. 
</p><p>But, when he heard of the loss of the crystal, he forgot his meal, 
and his anger was diverted from his mother to his step-father.  Their 
first idea, of course, was that he had hidden it.  But Mr. Cave stoutly 
denied all knowledge of its fate&mdash;freely offering his bedabbled  
affidavit in the matter&mdash;and at last was worked up to the point of  
accusing, first, his wife and then his step-son of having taken it with a 
view to a private sale.  So began an exceedingly acrimonious and  
emotional discussion, which ended for Mrs. Cave in a peculiar nervous 
condition midway between hysterics and amuck, and caused the step-son to be half-an-hour late at the furniture establishment in the  
afternoon. 
<pb n="115"/>  
 
Mr. Cave took refuge from his wife's emotions in the shop. 
</p><p>In the evening the matter was resumed, with less passion and in 
a judicial spirit, under the presidency of the step-daughter.  The supper 
passed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene.  Mr. Cave gave 
way at last to extreme exasperation, and went out banging the front 
door violently.  The rest of the family, having discussed him with 
the freedom his absence warranted, hunted the house from garret to 
cellar, hoping to light upon the crystal. 
</p><p>The next day the two customers called again.  They were received 
by Mrs. Cave almost in tears.  It transpired that no one could imagine 
all that she had stood from Cave at various times in her married  
pilgrimage. . . .   She also gave a garbled account of the disappearance.  
The clergyman and the Oriental laughed silently at one another, and 
said it was very extraordinary.  As Mrs. Cave seemed disposed to give 
them the complete history of her life they made to leave the shop.  
Thereupon Mrs. Cave, still clinging to hope, asked for the clergyman's 
address, so that, if she could get anything out of Cave, she might 
communicate it.  The address was duly given, but apparently was 
afterwards mislaid.  Mrs. Cave can remember nothing about it. 
</p><p>In the evening of that day, the Caves seem to have exhausted their 
emotions, and Mr. Cave, who had been out in the afternoon, supped 
in a gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned 
controversy of the previous days.  For some time matters were very 
badly strained in the Cave household, but neither crystal nor  
customer reappeared. 
</p><p>Now, without mincing the matter, we must admit that Mr. Cave was 
a liar.  He knew perfectly well where the crystal was.  It was in the 
rooms of Mr. Jacoby Wace, Assistant Demonstrator at St. Catherine's 
Hospital, Westbourne Street.  It stood on the sideboard partially  
covered by a black velvet cloth, and beside a decanter of American 
whisky.  It is from Mr. Wace, indeed, that the particulars upon 
which this narrative is based were derived.  Cave had taken off the 
thing to the hospital hidden in the dog-fish sack, and there had pressed 
the young investigator to keep it for him.  Mr. Wace was a little  
dubious at first.  His relationship to Cave was peculiar.  He had a taste 
for singular characters, and he had more than once invited the old 
man to smoke and drink in his rooms, and to unfold his rather  
amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular.  Mr. Wace 
had encountered Mrs. Cave, too, on occasions when Mr. Cave was 
not at home to attend to him.  He knew the constant interference to 
which Cave was subjected, and having weighed the story judicially, he 
decided to give the crystal a refuge.  Mr. Cave promised to explain 
the reasons for his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully 
 
<pb n="116"/>  
 
on a later occasion, but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein.  
He called on Mr. Wace the same evening. 
</p><p>He told a complicated story.  The crystal he said had come into his 
possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another  
curiosity dealer's effects, and not knowing what its value might be, he 
had ticketed it at ten shillings.  It had hung upon his hands at that 
price for some months, and he was thinking of "reducing the figure," 
when he made a singular discovery. 
</p><p>At that time his health was very bad&mdash;and it must be borne in mind 
that, throughout all this experience, his physical condition was one of 
ebb&mdash;and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence, 
the positive ill-treatment even, he received from his wife and step-children.  His wife was vain, extravagant, unfeeling and had a growing 
taste for private drinking; his step-daughter was mean and over-reaching; 
and his step-son had conceived a violent dislike for him, and 
lost no chance of showing it.  The requirements of his business pressed 
heavily upon him, and Mr. Wace does not think that he was  
altogether free from occasional intemperance.  He had begun life in a 
comfortable position, he was a man of fair education, and he suffered, 
for weeks at a stretch, from melancholia and insomnia.  Afraid to  
disturb his family, he would slip quietly from his wife's side, when his 
thoughts became intolerable, and wander about the house.  And about 
three o'clock one morning, late in August, chance directed him into 
the shop. 
</p><p>The dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot, 
where he perceived an unusual glow of light.  Approaching this, he 
discovered it to be the crystal egg, which was standing on the corner 
of the counter towards the window.  A thin ray smote through a crack 
in the shutters, impinged upon the object, and seemed as it were to 
fill its entire interior. 
</p><p>It occurred to Mr. Cave that this was not in accordance with the 
laws of optics as he had known them in his younger days.  He could 
understand the rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a 
focus in its interior, but this diffusion jarred with his physical  
conceptions.  He approached the crystal nearly, peering into it and round 
it, with a transient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth 
had determined his choice of a calling.  He was surprised to find the 
light not steady, but writhing within the substance of the egg, as 
though that object was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapour.  
In moving about to get different points of view, he suddenly found 
that he had come between it and the ray, and that the crystal none 
the less remained luminous.  Greatly astonished, he lifted it out of 
the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop.  It  
remained 
 
<pb n="117"/>  
 
bright for some four or five minutes, when it slowly faded 
and went out.  He placed it in the thin streak of daylight, and its 
luminousness was almost immediately restored. 
</p><p>So far, at least, Mr. Wace was able to verify the remarkable story 
of Mr. Cave.  He has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray 
of light (which had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre).  
And in a perfect darkness, such as could be produced by velvet  
wrapping, the crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent.  
It would seem, however, that the luminousness was of some exceptional 
sort, and not equally visible to all eyes; for Mr. Harbinger&mdash; 
whose name will be familiar to the scientific reader in connection 
with the Pasteur Institute&mdash;was quite unable to see any light  
whatever.  And Mr. Wace's own capacity for its appreciation was out of 
comparison inferior to that of Mr. Cave's.  Even with Mr. Cave the 
power varied very considerably: his vision was most vivid during 
states of extreme weakness and fatigue. 
</p><p>Now, from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious 
fascination upon Mr. Cave.  And it says more for his loneliness of soul 
than a volume of pathetic writing could do, that he told no human 
being of his curious observations.  He seems to have been living in 
such an atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a 
pleasure would have been to risk the loss of it.  He found that as 
the dawn advanced, and the amount of diffused light increased, the 
crystal became to all appearance non-luminous.  And for some time 
he was unable to see anything in it, except at night-time, in dark 
corners of the shop. 
</p><p>But the use of an old velvet cloth, which he used as a background 
for a collection of minerals, occurred to him, and by doubling this, 
and putting it over his head and hands, he was able to get a sight of 
the luminous movement within the crystal even in the day-time.  He 
was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife, and 
he practised this occupation only in the afternoons, while she was 
asleep upstairs, and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter.  
And one day, turning the crystal about in his hands, he saw  
something.  It came and went like a flash, but it gave him the impression 
that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide 
and spacious and strange country; and, turning it about, he did, just 
as the light faded, see the same vision again. 
</p><p>Now, it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of 
Mr. Cave's discovery from this point.  Suffice that the effect was this: 
the crystal, being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from 
the direction of the illuminating ray, gave a clear and consistent  
picture of a wide and peculiar country-side.  It was not dream-like 
at 
 
<pb n="118"/>  
 
all: it produced a definite impression of reality, and the better the 
light the more real and solid it seemed.  It was a moving picture: 
that is to say, certain objects moved in it, but slowly in an orderly 
manner like real things, and, according as the direction of the lighting 
and vision changed, the picture changed also.  It must, indeed, have 
been like looking through an oval glass at a view, and turning the 
glass about to get at different aspects. 
</p><p>Mr. Cave's statements, Mr. Wace assures me, were extremely  
circumstantial, and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that 
taints hallucinatory impressions.  But it must be remembered that 
all the efforts of Mr. Wace to see any similar clarity in the faint  
opalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful, try as he would.  The 
difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men 
was very great, and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to 
Mr. Cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to Mr. Wace. 
</p><p>The view, as Mr. Cave described it, was invariably of an extensive 
plain, and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable 
height, as if from a tower or a mast.  To the east and to the west 
the plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs, 
which reminded him of those he had seen in some picture; but what 
the picture was Mr. Wace was unable to ascertain.  These cliffs passed 
north and south&mdash;he could tell the points of the compass by the stars 
that were visible of a night&mdash;receding in an almost illimitable  
perspective and fading into the mists of the distance before they met.  He 
was nearer the eastern set of cliffs, on the occasion of his first vision 
the sun was rising over them, and black against the sunlight and pale 
against their shadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that Mr. 
Cave regarded as birds.  A vast range of buildings spread below him; 
he seemed to be looking down upon them; and, as they approached 
the blurred and refracted edge of the picture, they became indistinct.  
There were also trees curious in shape, and in colouring, a deep mossy 
green and an exquisite grey, beside a wide and shining canal.  And 
something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture.  But 
the first time Mr. Cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes, his 
hands shook, his head moved, the vision came and went, and grew 
foggy and indistinct.  And at first he had the greatest difficulty in  
finding the picture again once the direction of it was lost. 
</p><p>His next clear vision, which came about a week after the first, the 
interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some  
useful experience, showed him the view down the length of the valley. 
The view was different, but he had a curious persuasion, which his 
subsequent observations abundantly confirmed, that he was regarding 
this strange world from exactly the same spot, although he was  
looking 
 
<pb n="119"/>  
 
in a different direction.  The long facade of the great building, 
whose roof he had looked down upon before, was now receding in 
perspective.  He recognised the roof.  In the front of the facade was 
a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary length, and down 
the middle of the terrace, at certain intervals, stood huge but very 
graceful masts, bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting 
sun.  The import of these small objects did not occur to Mr. Cave 
until some time after, as he was describing the scene to Mr. Wace.  
The terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful 
vegetation, and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which certain 
broad creatures, in form like beetles but enormously larger, reposed.  
Beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone; 
and beyond that, and lined with dense red weeds, and passing up 
the valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs, was a broad and 
mirror-like expanse of water.  The air seemed full of squadrons of 
great birds, manoeuvring in stately curves; and across the river was a 
multitude of splendid buildings, richly coloured and glittering with 
metallic tracery and facets, among a forest of moss-like and lichenous 
trees.  And suddenly something flapped repeatedly across the vision, like 
the fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing, and a face, or 
rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes, came as it were 
close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal.  Mr. Cave 
was so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes, 
that he drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it.  He 
had become so absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to 
find himself in the cool darkness of his little shop, with its familiar 
odour of methyl, mustiness, and decay.  And, as he blinked about him, 
the glowing crystal faded, and went out. 
</p><p>Such were the first general impressions of Mr. Cave.  The story is 
curiously direct and circumstantial.  From the outset, when the valley 
first flashed momentarily on his senses, his imagination was strangely 
affected, and, as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he 
saw, his wonder rose to the point of a passion.  He went about his 
business listless and distraught, thinking only of the time when he 
should be able to return to his watching.  And then a few weeks 
after his first sight of the valley came the two customers, the stress and 
excitement of their offer, and the narrow escape of the crystal 
from sale, as I have already told. 
</p><p>Now, while the thing was Mr. Cave's secret, it remained a mere 
wonder, a thing to creep to covertly and peep at, as a child might 
peep upon a forbidden garden.  But Mr. Wace has, for a young scientific 
investigator, a particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind.  
Directly the crystal and its story came to him, and he had satisfied 
 
<pb n="120"/>  
 
himself, by seeing the phosphorescence with his own eyes, that there 
really was a certain evidence for Mr. Cave's statements, he proceeded 
to develop the matter systematically.  Mr. Cave was only too eager to 
come and feast his eyes on this wonderland he saw, and he came 
every night from half-past eight until half-past ten, and sometimes, 
in Mr. Wace's absence, during the day.  On Sunday afternoons, also, 
he came.  From the outset Mr. Wace made copious notes, and it was 
due to his scientific method that the relation between the direction 
from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the orientation 
of the picture were proved.  And, by covering the crystal in a box 
perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray, and 
by substituting black holland for his buff blinds, he greatly improved 
the conditions of the observations; so that in a little while they were 
able to survey the valley in any direction they desired. 
</p><p>So having cleared the way, we may give a brief account of this 
visionary world within the crystal.  The things were in all cases seen 
by Mr. Cave, and the method of working was invariably for him to 
watch the crystal and report what he saw, while Mr. Wace (who as 
a science student had learnt the trick of writing in the dark) wrote a 
brief note of his report.  When the crystal faded, it was put into 
its box in the proper position and the electric light turned on.  Mr. 
Wace asked questions, and suggested observations to clear up difficult 
points.  Nothing, indeed, could have been less visionary and more 
matter-of-fact. 
</p><p>The attention of Mr. Cave had been speedily directed to the bird-like creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier 
visions.  His first impression was soon corrected, and he considered 
for a time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat.  Then he 
thought, grotesquely enough, that they might be cherubs.  Their heads 
were round, and curiously human, and it was the eyes of one of them 
that had so startled him on his second observation.  They had broad, 
silvery wings, not feathered, but glistening almost as brilliantly as 
new-killed fish and with the same subtle play of colour, and these 
wings were not built on the plan of a bird-wing or bat, Mr. Wace 
learned, but supported by curved ribs radiating from the body. (A sort 
of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems best to express their  
appearance.) The body was small, but fitted with two bunches of prehensile 
organs, like long tentacles, immediately under the mouth.  Incredible as 
it appeared to Mr. Wace, the persuasion at last became irresistible, 
that it was these creatures which owned the great quasi-human buildings 
and the magnificent garden that made the broad valley so 
splendid.  And Mr. Cave perceived that the buildings, with other  
peculiarities, had no doors, but that the great circular windows, which 
 
<pb n="121"/>  
 
opened freely, gave the creatures egress and entrance.  They would 
alight upon their tentacles, fold their wings to a smallness almost rod-like, and hop into the interior.  But among them was a multitude of 
smaller-winged creatures, like great dragon-flies and moths and flying 
beetles, and across the greensward brilliantly-coloured gigantic ground-beetles crawled lazily to and fro.  Moreover, on the causeways and 
terraces, large-headed creatures similar to the greater winged flies, but 
wingless, were visible, hopping busily upon their hand-like tangle of 
tentacles. 
</p><p>Allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts 
that stood upon the terrace of the nearer building.  It dawned upon 
Mr. Cave, after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one 
particularly vivid day, that the glittering object there was a crystal 
exactly like that into which he peered.  And a still more careful 
scrutiny convinced him that each one in a vista of nearly twenty 
carried a similar object. 
</p><p>Occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to 
one, and, folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about 
the mast, would regard the crystal fixedly for a space,&mdash;sometimes for 
as long as fifteen minutes.  And a series of observations, made at the 
suggestion of Mr. Wace, convinced both watchers that, so far as this 
visionary world was concerned, the crystal into which they peered 
actually stood at the summit of the end-most mast on the terrace, and 
that on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other 
world had looked into Mr. Cave's face while he was making these 
observations. 
</p><p>So much for the essential facts of this very singular story.  Unless we 
dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of Mr. Wace, we have to 
believe one of two things: either that Mr. Cave's crystal was in two 
worlds at once, and that, while it was carried about in one, it  
remained stationary in the other, which seems altogether absurd; or 
else that it had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and 
exactly similar crystal in this other world, so that what was seen 
in the interior of the one in this world, was, under suitable conditions, 
visible to an observer in the corresponding crystal in the other 
world; and vice versa.  At present, indeed, we do not know of any 
way in which two crystals could so come en rapport, but nowadays 
we know enough to understand that the thing is not altogether  
impossible.  This view of the crystals as en rapport was the supposition 
that occurred to Mr. Wace, and to me at least it seems extremely  
plausible. . . . 
</p><p>And where was this other world? On this, also, the alert intelligence 
of Mr. Wace speedily threw light.  After sunset, the sky darkened 
 
<pb n="122"/>  
 
rapidly&mdash;there was a very brief twilight interval indeed&mdash;and the stars 
shone out.  They were recognisably the same as those we see, arranged 
in the same constellations.  Mr. Cave recognised the Bear, the Pleiades, 
Aldebaran, and Sirius: so that the other world must be somewhere in 
the solar system, and, at the utmost, only a few hundreds of millions 
of miles from our own.  Following up this clue, Mr. Wace learned that 
the midnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky, 
and that the sun seemed a little smaller.  And there were two small 
moons! "like our moon but smaller, and quite differently marked" one 
of which moved so rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one 
regarded it.  These moons were never high in the sky, but vanished 
as they rose: that is, every time they revolved they were eclipsed  
because they were so near their primary planet.  And all this answers 
quite completely, although.  Mr. Cave did not know it, to what must 
be the condition of things on Mars. 
</p><p>Indeed, it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering 
into this crystal Mr. Cave did actually see the planet Mars and its 
inhabitants.  And, if that be the case, then the evening star that shone 
so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision, was neither more nor 
less than our own familiar earth. 
</p><p>For a time the Martians&mdash;if they were Martians&mdash;do not seem to have 
known of Mr. Cave's inspection.  Once or twice one would come to 
peer, and go away very shortly to some other mast, as though the 
vision was unsatisfactory.  During this time Mr. Cave was able to 
watch the proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed 
by their attentions, and, although his report is necessarily vague and 
fragmentary, it is nevertheless very suggestive.  Imagine the impression 
of humanity a Martian observer would get who, after a difficult  
process of preparation and with considerable fatigue to the eyes, was 
able to peer at London from the steeple of St. Martin's Church for 
stretches, at longest, of four minutes at a time.  Mr. Cave was unable 
to ascertain if the winged Martians were the same as the Martians 
who hopped about the causeways and terraces, and if the latter could 
put on wings at will.  He several times saw certain clumsy bipeds, dimly 
suggestive of apes, white and partially translucent, feeding among 
certain of the lichenous trees, and once some of these fled before one 
of the hopping, round-headed Martians.  The latter caught one in its 
tentacles, and then the picture faded suddenly and left Mr. Cave most 
tantalisingly in the dark.  On another occasion a vast thing, that Mr. 
Cave thought at first was some gigantic insect, appeared advancing 
along the causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity.  As 
this drew nearer Mr. Cave perceived that it was a mechanism of  
shining 
<pb n="123"/>  
 
metals and of extraordinary complexity.  And then, when he looked 
again, it had passed out of sight. 
</p><p>After a time Mr. Wace aspired to attract the attention of the  
Martians, and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them  
appeared close to the crystal Mr. Cave cried out and sprang away, and 
they immediately turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a 
manner suggestive of signalling.  But when at last Mr. Cave examined 
the crystal again the Martian had departed. 
</p><p>Thus far these observations had progressed in early November, and 
then Mr. Cave, feeling that the suspicions of his family about the 
crystal were allayed, began to take it to and fro with him in order 
that, as occasion arose in the daytime or night, he might comfort 
himself with what was fast becoming the most real thing in his 
existence. 
</p><p>In December Mr. Wace's work in connection with a forthcoming  
examination became heavy, the sittings were reluctantly suspended for 
a week, and for ten or eleven days&mdash;he is not quite sure which&mdash;he saw 
nothing of Cave.  He then grew anxious to resume these investigations, 
and, the stress of his seasonal labours being abated, he went down to 
Seven Dials.  At the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fancier's 
window, and then another at a cobbler's.  Mr. Cave's shop was closed. 
</p><p>He rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black.  He 
at once called Mrs. Cave, who was, Mr. Wace could not but observe, 
in cheap but ample widow's weeds of the most imposing pattern.  
Without any very great surprise Mr. Wace learnt that Cave was dead 
and already buried.  She was in tears, and her voice was a little thick.  
She had just returned from Highgate.  Her mind seemed occupied with 
her own prospects and the honourable details of the obsequies, but 
Mr. Wace was at last able to learn the particulars of Cave's death.  
He had been found dead in his shop in the early morning, the day 
after his last visit to Mr. Wace, and the crystal had been clasped 
in his stone-cold hands.  His face was smiling, said Mrs. Cave, and 
the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at his feet.  He 
must have been dead five or six hours when he was found. 
</p><p>This came as a great shock to Wace, and he began to reproach  
ho,self bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old man's 
ill-health.  But his chief thought was of the crystal.  He approached 
that topic in a gingerly manner, because he knew Mrs. Cave's  
peculiarities.  He was dumbfoundered to learn that it was sold. 
</p><p>Mrs. Cave's first impulse, directly Cave's body had been taken  
upstairs, had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five 
pounds for the crystal, informing him of its recovery; but after a 
violent hunt in which her daughter joined her, they were convinced 
 
<pb n="124"/>  
 
of the loss of his address.  As they were without the means required 
to mourn and bury Cave in the elaborate style the dignity of an old 
Seven Dials inhabitant demands, they had appealed to a friendly  
fellow-tradesman in Great Portland Street.  He had very kindly taken 
over a portion of the stock at a valuation.  The valuation was his own 
and the crystal egg was included in one of the lots.  Mr. Wace, after 
a few suitable consolatory observations, a little offhandedly proffered 
perhaps, hurried at once to Great Portland Street.  But there he 
learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall, dark man 
in grey.  And there the material facts in this curious, and to me at 
least very suggestive, story come abruptly to an end.  The Great  
Portland Street dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was, 
nor had he observed him with sufficient attention to describe him 
minutely.  He did not even know which way this person had gone 
after leaving the shop.  For a time Mr. Wace remained in the shop, 
trying the dealer's patience with hopeless questions, venting his own 
exasperation.  And at last, realising abruptly that the whole thing had 
passed out of his hands, had vanished like a vision of the night, he 
returned to his own rooms, a little astonished to find the notes he 
had made still tangible and visible upon his untidy table. 
</p><p>His annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great.  He 
made a second call (equally ineffectual) upon the Great Portland 
Street dealer, and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals 
as were likely to come into the hands of a bric-a-brac collector.  He 
also wrote letters to The Daily Chronicle and Nature, but both those 
periodicals, suspecting a hoax, asked him to reconsider his action 
before they printed, and he was advised that such a strange story,  
unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence, might imperil his reputation 
as an investigator.  Moreover, the calls of his proper work were 
urgent.  So that after a month or so, save for an occasional reminder 
to certain dealers, he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the 
crystal egg, and from that day to this it remains undiscovered. 
Occasionally, however, he tells me, and I can quite believe him, he has 
bursts of zeal, in which he abandons his more urgent occupation and 
resumes the search. 
</p><p>Whether or not it will remain lost for ever, with the material and 
origin of it, are things equally speculative at the present time.  If the 
present purchaser is a collector, one would have expected the  
enquiries of Mr. Wace to have readied him through the dealers.  He has 
been able to discover Mr. Cave's clergyman and "Oriental"&mdash;no other 
than the Rev. James Parker and the young Prince of Bosso-Kuni in 
Java.  I am obliged to them for certain particulars.  The object of the 
Prince was simply curiosity&mdash;and extravagance.  He was so eager to buy, 
 
<pb n="125"/>  
 
because Cave was so oddly reluctant to sell.  It is just as possible that 
the buyer in the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and 
not a collector at all, and the crystal egg, for all I know, may at the 
present moment be within a mile of me, decorating a drawing-room 
or serving as a paper-weight&mdash;its remarkable functions all unknown.  
Indeed, it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that I have 
thrown this narrative into a form that will give it a chance of being 
read by the ordinary consumer of fiction. 
</p><p>My own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of 
Mr. Wace.  I believe the crystal on the mast in Mars and the crystal 
egg of Mr. Cave's to be in some physical, but at present quite  
inexplicable, way en rapport, and we both believe further that the  
terrestrial crystal must have been&mdash;possibly at some remote date&mdash;sent 
hither from that planet, in order to give the Martians a near view of 
our affairs.  Possibly the fellows to the crystals in the other masts are 
also on our globe.  No theory of hallucination suffices for the facts.

<head>THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES; A PANTOUM IN  
PROSE</head> 
 
<p>It is doubtful whether the gift was innate.  For my own part, I think it 
came to him suddenly.  Indeed, until he was thirty he was a sceptic, 
and did not believe in miraculous powers.  And here, since it is the 
most convenient place, I must mention that he was a little man, and 
had eyes of a hot brown, very erect red hair, a moustache with ends 
that he twisted up, and freckles.  His name was George McWhirter 
Fotheringay&mdash;not the sort of name by any means to lead to any  
expectation of miracles&mdash;and he was clerk at Gomshott's.  He was greatly 
addicted to assertive argument.  It was while he was asserting the  
impossibility of miracles that he had his first intimation of his extraordinary 
powers.  This particular argument was being held in the bar of the 
Long Dragon, and Toddy Beamish was conducting the opposition by 
a monotonous but effective "So you say," that drove Mr. Fotheringay 
to the very limit of his patience. 
</p><p>There were present, besides these two, a very dusty cyclist, landlord 
Cox, and Miss Maybridge, the perfectly respectable and rather portly 
barmaid of the Dragon.  Miss Maybridge was standing with her back 
to Mr. Fotheringay, washing glasses; the others were watching him, 
more or less amused by the present ineffectiveness of the assertive 
method.  Goaded by the Torres Vedras tactics of Mr. Beamish, Mr. 
Fotheringay determined to make an unusual rhetorical effort.  "Looky 
here, Mr. Beamish," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Let us clearly understand 
what a miracle is.  It's something contrariwise to the course of nature 
done by power of Will, something what couldn't happen without being 
specially willed." 
</p><p>"So you say," said Mr. Beamish, repulsing him. 
 
 
 
<pb n="127"/>  
 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay appealed to the cyclist, who had hitherto been a 
silent auditor, and received his assent&mdash;given with a hesitating cough 
and a glance at Mr. Beamish.  The landlord would express no opinion, 
and Mr. Fotheringay, returning to Mr. Beamish, received the unexpected 
concession of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle. 
</p><p>"For instance," said Mr. Fotheringay, greatly encouraged.  "Here 
would be a miracle.  That lamp, in the natural course of nature, 
couldn't burn like that upsy-down, could it, Beamish?" 
</p><p>"You say it couldn't," said Beamish. 
</p><p>"And you?" said Fotheringay.  "You don't mean to say&mdash;eh?" 
</p><p>"No," said Beamish reluctantly.  "No, it couldn't." 
</p><p>"Very well," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Then here comes someone, as 
it might be me, along here, and stands as it might be here, and says 
to that lamp, as I might do, collecting all my will&mdash;Turn upsy-down 
without breaking, and go on burning steady, and&mdash;Hullo!" 
</p><p>It was enough to make anyone say "Hullo!" The impossible, the 
incredible, was visible to them all.  The lamp hung inverted in the 
air, burning quietly with its flame pointing down.  It was as solid, as 
indisputable as ever a lamp was, the prosaic common lamp of the 
Long Dragon bar. 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted 
brows of one anticipating a catastrophic smash.  The cyclist, who was 
sitting next the lamp, ducked and jumped across the bar.  Everybody 
jumped, more or less.  Miss Maybridge turned and screamed.  For nearly 
three seconds the lamp remained still.  A faint cry of mental distress 
came from Mr. Fotheringay.  "I can't keep it up," he said, "any 
longer." He staggered back, and the inverted lamp suddenly flared, 
fell against the corner of the bar, bounced aside, smashed upon the 
floor, and went out. 
</p><p>It was lucky it had a metal receiver, or the whole place would have 
been in a blaze.  Mr. Cox was the first to speak, and his remark, shorn 
of needless excrescences, was to the effect that Fotheringay was a fool.  
Fotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition 
as that! He was astonished beyond measure at the thing that 
had occurred.  The subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light 
on the matter so far as Fotheringay was concerned; the general opinion 
not only followed Mr. Cox very closely but very vehemently.  Everyone 
accused Fotheringay of a silly trick, and presented him to himself 
as a foolish destroyer of comfort and security.  His mind was in a 
tornado of perplexity, he was himself inclined to agree with them, and 
he made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the proposal of his 
departure. 
</p><p>He went home flushed and heated, coat-collar crumpled, eyes  
smarting 
 
<pb n="128"/>  
 
and ears red.  He watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as 
he passed it. lt was only when he found himself alone in his little 
bed-room in Church Row that he was able to grapple seriously with 
his memories of the occurrence, and ask, "What on earth happened?" 
</p><p>He had removed his coat and boots, and was sitting on the bed with 
his hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for the 
seventeenth time, "I didn't want the confounded thing to upset," 
when it occurred to him that at the precise moment he had said 
the commanding words he had inadvertently willed the thing he said, 
and that when he had seen the lamp in the air he had felt it depended 
on him to maintain it there without being clear how this was to be 
done.  He had not a particularly complex mind, or he might have 
stuck for a time at that "inadvertently willed," embracing, as it does, 
the abstrusest problems of voluntary action; but as it was, the idea 
came to him with a quite acceptable haziness.  And from that, following, 
as I must admit, no clear logical path, he came to the test of 
experiment. 
</p><p>He pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind, though 
he felt he did a foolish thing.  "Be raised up," he said.  But in a 
second that feeling vanished.  The candle was raised, hung in the air 
one giddy moment, and as Mr. Fotheringay gasped, fell with a smash 
on his toilet-table, leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow 
of its wick. 
</p><p>For a time Mr. Fotheringay sat in the darkness, perfectly still.  "It 
did happen, after all," he said.  "And 'ow I'm to explain it I don't 
know." He sighed heavily, and began feeling in his pockets for a 
match.  He could find none, and he rose and groped about the toilet-table.  "I wish I had a match," he said.  He resorted to his coat, and 
there was none there, and then it dawned upon him that miracles 
were possible even with matches.  He extended a hand and scowled 
at it in the dark.  "Let there be a match in that hand," he said.  He felt 
some light object fall across his palm, and his fingers closed upon a 
match. 
</p><p>After several ineffectual attempts to light this, he discovered it was a 
safety-match.  He threw it down, and then it occurred to him that he 
might have willed it lit.  He did, and perceived it burning in the midst 
of his toilet-table mat.  He caught it up hastily, and it went out.  His 
perception of possibilities enlarged, and he felt for and replaced the 
candle in its candlestick.  "Here! you be lit," said Mr. Fotheringay, 
and forthwith the candle was flaring, and he saw a little black hole 
in the toilet-cover, with a wisp of smoke rising from it.  For a time he 
stared from this to the little flame and back, and then looked up and 
 
<pb n="129"/>  
 
met his own gaze in the looking glass.  By this help he communed with 
himself in silence for a time. 
</p><p>"How about miracles now?" said Mr. Fotheringay at last, addressing 
his reflection. 
</p><p>The subsequent meditations of Mr. Fotheringay were of a severe 
but confused description.  So far, he could see it was a case of pure 
willing with him.  The nature of his experiences so far disinclined 
him for any further experiments, at least until he had reconsidered 
them.  But he lifted a sheet of paper, and turned a glass of water pink 
and then green, and he created a snail, which he miraculously  
annihilated, and got himself a miraculous new tooth-brush.  Somewhen 
in the small hours he had reached the fact that his will-power must 
be of a particularly rare and pungent quality, a fact of which he had 
certainly had inklings before, but no certain assurance.  The scare and 
perplexity of his first discovery was now qualified by pride in this 
evidence of singularity and by vague intimations of advantage.  He  
became aware that the church clock was striking one, and as it did 
not occur to him that his daily duties at Gomshott's might be  
miraculously dispensed with, he resumed undressing, in order to get to bed 
without further delay.  As he struggled to get his shirt over his head, 
he was struck with a brilliant idea.  "Let me be in bed," he said, and 
found himself so.  "Undressed," he stipulated; and, finding the sheets 
cold, added hastily, "and in my nightshirt&mdash;no, in a nice soft woollen 
nightshirt.  Ah!" he said with immense enjoyment.  "And now let me 
be comfortably asleep. . . . ." 
</p><p>He awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfast-time, wondering whether his overnight experience might not be a 
particularly vivid dream.  At length his mind turned again to cautious 
experiments.  For instance, he had three eggs for breakfast; two his 
landlady had supplied, good, but shoppy, and one was a delicious fresh 
goose-egg, laid, cooked, and served by his extraordinary will.  He  
hurried off to Gomshott's in a state of profound but carefully concealed 
excitement, and only remembered the shell of the third egg when his 
landlady spoke of it that night.  All day he could do no work because 
of this astonishingly new self-knowledge, but this caused him no  
inconvenience, because he made up for it miraculously in his last ten 
minutes. 
</p><p>As the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation,  
albeit the circumstances of his dismissal from the Long Dragon 
were still disagreeable to recall, and a garbled account of the matter 
that had reached his colleagues led to some badinage.  It was evident 
he must be careful how he lifted frangible articles, but in other ways 
his gift promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind. 
 
<pb n="130"/>  
 
He intended among other things to increase his personal property 
by unostentatious acts of creation.  He called into existence a pair of 
very splendid diamond studs, and hastily annihilated them again as 
young Gomshott came across the counting-house to his desk.  He was 
afraid young Gomshott might wonder how he had come by them.  He 
saw quite clearly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its 
exercise, but so far as he could judge the difficulties attending its 
mastery would be no greater than those he had already faced in the 
study of cycling.  It was that analogy, perhaps, quite as much as the 
feeling that he would be unwelcome in the Long Dragon, that drove 
him out after supper into the lane beyond the gas-works, to  
rehearse a few miracles in private. 
</p><p>There was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts, 
for apart from his will-power Mr. Fotheringay was not a very  
exceptional man.  The miracle of Moses' rod came to his mind, but 
the night was dark and unfavourable to the proper control of large 
miraculous snakes.  Then he recollected the story of "Tannhauser" that 
he had read on the back of the Philharmonic programme.  That seemed 
to him singularly attractive and harmless.  He stuck his walking-stick&mdash;a very nice Poona-Penang lawyer&mdash;into the turf that edged the 
footpath, and commanded the dry wood to blossom.  The air was  
immediately full of the scent of roses, and by means of a match he saw 
for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed accomplished.  His 
satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps.  Afraid of a premature 
discovery of his powers, he addressed the blossoming stick hastily: "Go 
back." What he meant was "Change back;" but of course he was 
confused.  The stick receded at a considerable velocity, and  
incontinently came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching 
person.  "Who are you throwing brambles at, you fool?" cried a voice.  
"That got me on the shin." 
</p><p>"I'm sorry, old chap," said Mr. Fotheringay, and then realising 
the awkward nature of the explanation, caught nervously at his 
moustache.  He saw Winch, one of the three Immering constables,  
advancing. 
</p><p>"What d'yer mean by it?" asked the constable.  "Hullo! it's you, is it? 
The gent that broke the lamp at the Long Dragon!" 
</p><p>"I don't mean anything by it," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Nothing at 
all." 
</p><p>"What d'yer do it for then?" 
</p><p>"Oh, bother!" said Mr. Fotheringay. 
</p><p>"Bother indeed! D'yer know that stick hurt? What d'yer do it for, 
eh?" 
</p><p>For the moment Mr. Fotheringay could not think what he had 
 
<pb n="131"/>  
 
done it for.  His silence seemed to irritate Mr. Winch.  "You've been 
assaulting the police, young man, this time.  That's what you done." 
</p><p>"Look here, Mr. Winch," said Mr. Fotheringay, annoyed and  
confused, "I'm very sorry.  The fact is&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Well?" 
</p><p>He could think of no way but the truth.  "I was working a miracle." 
He tried to speak in an off-hand way, but try as he would he couldn't. 
</p><p>'&mdash;Working a&mdash;! 'Ere, don't you talk rot.  Working a miracle, indeed! 
Miracle! Well, that's downright funny! Why, you's the chap that don't 
believe in miracles. . . . .    Fact is, this is another of your silly  
conjuring tricks&mdash;that's what this is.  Now, I tell you&mdash;" 
</p><p>But Mr. Fotheringay never heard what Mr. Winch was going to 
tell him.  He realised he had given himself away, flung his valuable 
secret to all the winds of heaven.  A violent gust of irritation swept 
him to action.  He turned on the constable swiftly and fiercely.  "Here," 
he said, "I've had enough of this, I have! I'll show you a silly  
conjuring trick, I will! Go to Hades! Go, now!" 
</p><p>He was alone! 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay performed no more miracles that night nor did 
he trouble to see what had become of his flowering stick.  He returned 
to the town, scared and very quiet, and went to his bed-room.  "Lord!" 
he said, "it's a powerful gift&mdash;an extremely powerful gift.  I didn't 
hardly mean as much as that.  Not really. . . . I wonder what Hades 
is like!" 
</p><p>He sat on the bed taking off his boots.  Struck by a happy thought 
he transferred the constable to San Francisco, and without any more 
interference with normal causation went soberly to bed.  In the night 
he dreamt of the anger of Winch. 
</p><p>The next day Mr. Fotheringay heard two interesting items of news.  
Someone had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder 
Mr. Gomshott's private house in the Lullaborough Road, and the 
river as far as Rawling's Mill was to be dragged for Constable Winch. 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day, and 
performed no miracles except certain provisions for Winch, and the 
miracle of completing his day's work with punctual perfection in spite 
of all the bee-swarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind.  And 
the extraordinary abstraction and meekness of his manner was  
remarked by several people, and made a matter for jesting.  For the 
most part he was thinking of Winch. 
</p><p>On Sunday evening he went to chapel and oddly enough, Mr. 
Maydig, who took a certain interest in occult matters, preached about 
"things that are not lawful." Mr. Fotheringay was not a regular chapel 
goer, but the system of assertive scepticism, to which I have already 
 
<pb n="132"/>  
 
alluded, was now very much shaken.  The tenor of the sermon threw 
an entirely new light on these novel gifts, and he suddenly decided 
to consult Mr. Maydig immediately after the service.  So soon as that 
was determined, he found himself wondering why he had not done 
so before. 
</p><p>Mr. Maydig, a lean, excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists 
and neck, was gratified at a request for a private conversation from 
a young man whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for 
general remark in the town.  After a few necessary delays, he conducted 
him to the study of the Manse, which was contiguous to the dispel, 
seated him comfortably, and, standing in front of a cheerful fire&mdash; 
his legs threw a Rhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wall&mdash; 
requested Mr. Fotheringay to state his business. 
</p><p>At first Mr. Fotheringay was a little abashed, and found some 
difficulty in opening the matter.  "You will scarcely believe me, Mr. 
Maydig, I am afraid"&mdash;and so forth for some time.  He tried a question 
at last, and asked Mr. Maydig his opinion of miracles. 
</p><p>Mr. Maydig was still saying "Well" in an extremely judicial tone, 
when Mr. Fotheringay interrupted again: "You don't believe, I  
suppose, that some common sort of person&mdash;like myself, for instance&mdash;as 
it might be sitting here now, might have some sort of twist inside him 
that made him able to do things by his will." 
</p><p>"It's possible," said Mr. Maydig.  "Something of the sort, perhaps, 
is possible." 
</p><p>"If I might make free with something here, I think I might show 
you by a sort of experiment," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Now, take that 
tobacco-jar on the table, for instance.  What I want to know is 
whether what I am going to do with it is a miracle or not.  Just half 
a minute, Mr. Maydig, please." 
</p><p>He knitted his brows, pointed to the tobacco-jar and said: "Be 
a bowl of violets." 
</p><p>The tobacco-jar did as it was ordered. 
</p><p>Mr. Maydig started violently at the change, and stood looking 
from the thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers.  He said nothing.  
Presently he ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets; they 
were fresh-picked and very fine ones.  Then he stared at Mr. 
Fotheringay again. 
</p><p>"How did you do that?" he asked. 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay pulled his moustache.  "Just told it&mdash;and there you 
are.  Is that a miracle, or is it black art, or what is it? And what do 
you think's the matter with me? That's what I want to ask." 
</p><p>"It's a most extraordinary occurrence." 
</p><p>"And this day last week I knew no more that I could do things like 
 
<pb n="133"/>  
 
that than you did.  It came quite sudden.  It's something odd about my 
will, I suppose, and that's as far as I can see." 
</p><p>"Is that&mdash;the only thing? Could you do other things besides that?" 
</p><p>"Lord, yes! said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Just anything." He thought, and 
suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen.  "Here!" He 
pointed.  "Change into a bowl of fish&mdash;no, not that&mdash;change into a 
glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it.  That's better! 
You see that, Mr. Maydig?" 
</p><p>"It's astonishing.  It's incredible.  You are either a most extraordinary 
. . .  But no&mdash;" 
</p><p>"I could change it into anything," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Just 
anything.  Here! be a pigeon, will you?" 
</p><p>In another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room 
and making Mr. Maydig duck every time it came near him.  "Stop 
there, will you," said Mr. Fotheringay; and the pigeon hung motionless 
in the air.  "I could change it back to a bowl of flowers," he said, and 
after replacing the pigeon on the table worked that miracle.  "I  
expect you will want your pipe in a bit," he said, and restored the  
tobacco-jar. 
</p><p>Mr. Maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of  
ejaculatory silence.  He stared at Mr. Fotheringay and, in a very gingerly 
manner, picked up the tobacco-jar, examined it, replaced it on the 
table.  "Well!" was the only expression of his feelings. 
</p><p>"Now, after that it's easier to explain what I came about," said 
Mr. Fotheringay; and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of 
his strange experiences, beginning with the affair of the lamp in the 
Long Dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to Winch.  As 
he went on, the transient pride Mr. Maydig's consternation had 
caused passed away; he became the very ordinary Mr. Fotheringay of 
everyday intercourse again.  Mr. Maydig listened intently, the tobacco-jar in his hand, and his bearing changed also with the course of 
the narrative.  Presently, while Mr. Fotheringay was dealing with the 
miracle of the third egg, the minister interrupted with a fluttering 
extended hand&mdash; 
</p><p>"It is possible," he said.  "It is credible.  It is amazing, of course, but 
it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties.  The power to work 
miracles is a gift&mdash;a peculiar quality like genius or second sight&mdash; 
hitherto it has come very rarely and to exceptional people.  But in 
this case . . . I have always wondered at the miracles of Mahomet, 
and at Yogi's miracles, and the miracles of Madame Blavatsky.  But, of 
course! Yes, it is simply a gift! It carries out so beautifully the  
arguments of that great thinker"&mdash;Mr.  Maydig's voice sank&mdash;"his  
Grace the 
 
<pb n="134"/>  
 
Duke of Argyll.  Here we plumb some profounder law&mdash;deeper than 
the ordinary laws of nature.  Yes&mdash;yes.  Go on.  Go on!" 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with Winch, 
and Mr. Maydig, no longer overawed or scared, began to jerk his 
limbs about and interject astonishment.  "It's this what troubled me 
most," proceeded Mr. Fotheringay; "it's this I'm most mijitly in want 
of advice for; of course he's at San Francisco&mdash;wherever San Francisco 
may be&mdash;but of course it's awkward for both of us, as you'll see, Mr. 
Maydig.  I don't see how he can understand what has happened, and 
I daresay he's scared and exasperated something tremendous, and 
trying to get at me.  I daresay he keeps on starting off to come here.  
I send him back, by a miracle, every few hours, when I think of it.  
And of course, that's a thing he won't be able to understand, and it's 
bound to annoy him; and, of course, if he takes a ticket every time 
it will cost him a lot of money.  I done the best I could for him, but 
of course it's difficult for him to put himself in my place.  I thought 
afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched, you know&mdash;if 
Hades is all it's supposed to be&mdash;before I shifted him.  In that case I 
suppose they'd have locked him up in San Francisco.  Of course I 
willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly I thought of it.  
But, you see, I'm already in a deuce of a tangle&mdash;" 
</p><p>Mr. Maydig looked serious.  "I see you are in a tangle.  Yes, it's a 
difficult position.  How you are to end it . . ."  He became diffuse and 
inconclusive. 
</p><p>"However, we'll leave Winch for a little and discuss the larger 
question.  I don't think this is a case of the black art or anything of 
the sort.  I don't think there is any taint of criminality about it at 
all, Mr. Fotheringay&mdash;none whatever, unless you are suppressing  
material facts.  No, it's miracles&mdash;pure miracles&mdash;miracles, if I may say so, 
of the very highest class." 
</p><p>He began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate, while Mr. 
Fotheringay sat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm, looking 
worried.  "I don't see how I'm to manage about Winch," he said. 
</p><p>"A gift of working miracles&mdash;apparently a very powerful gift," said 
Mr. Maydig, "will find a way about Winch&mdash;never fear.  My dear 
Sir, you are a most important man&mdash;a man of the most astonishing 
possibilities.  As evidence, for example! And&mdash;in other ways, the things 
you may do . . . ." 
</p><p>"Yes, I've thought of a thing or two," said Mr. Fotheringay&mdash; "But 
&mdash;some of the things came a bit twisty.  You saw that fish at first? 
Wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish.  And I thought I'd ask 
someone." 
</p><p>"A proper course," said Mr. Maydig, "a very proper course&mdash; 
altogether 
<pb n="135"/>  
 
the proper course." He stopped and looked at Mr. Fotheringay.  
"It's practically an unlimited gift.  Let us test your powers, for  
instance.  If they really are . . . If they really are all they seem to be." 
</p><p>And so, incredible as it may seem, in the study of the little house 
behind the Congregational Chapel, on the evening of Sunday, Nov. 
10, 1896, Mr. Fotheringay, egged on and inspired by Mr. Maydig, 
began to work miracles.  The reader's attention is specially and  
definitely called to the date.  He will object, probably has already  
objected, that certain points in this story are improbable, that if any 
things of the sort already described had indeed occurred, they would 
have been in all the papers a year ago.  The details immediately  
following he will find particularly hard to accept, because among other 
things they involve the conclusion that he or she, the reader in 
question, must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented  
manner more than a year ago.  Now a miracle is nothing if not improbable, 
and as a matter of fact the reader was killed in a violent and 
unprecedented manner a year ago.  In the subsequent course of this 
story that will become perfectly clear and credible, as every right-minded and reasonable reader will admit.  But this is not the place 
for the end of the story, being but little beyond the hither side of 
the middle.  And at first the miracles worked by Mr. Fotheringay were 
timid little miracles&mdash;little things with the cups and parlour fitments&mdash; 
as feeble as the miracles of Theosophists, and, feeble as they were, 
they were received with awe by his collaborator.  He would have 
preferred to settle the Winch business out of hand, but Mr. Maydig 
would not let him.  But after they had worked a dozen of these 
domestic trivialities, their sense of power grew, their imagination 
began to show signs of stimulation, and their ambition enlarged.  Their 
first larger enterprise was due to hunger and the negligence of Mrs. 
Minchin, Mr. Maydig's housekeeper.  The meal to which the minister 
conducted Mr. Fotheringay was certainly ill-laid and uninviting as 
refreshment for two industrious miracle-workers; but they were seated, 
and Mr. Maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon 
his housekeeper's shortcomings, before it occurred to Mr. Fotheringay 
that an opportunity lay before him.  "Don't you think, Mr. Maydig," 
he said; "if it isn't a liberty, I&mdash;" 
</p><p>"My dear Mr. Fotheringay! Of course! No&mdash;I didn't think." 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay waved his hand.  "What shall we have?" he said, 
in a large, inclusive spirit, and, at Mr. Maydig's order, revised the 
supper very thoroughly.  "As for me," he said, eyeing Mr. Maydig's 
selection, "I am always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a 
nice Welsh rarebit, and I'll order that.  I ain't much given to  
Burgundy," and forthwith stout and Welsh rarebit promptly appeared 
 
<pb n="136"/>  
 
at his command.  They sat long at their supper, talking like equals, 
as Mr. Fotheringay presently perceived, with a glow of surprise and 
gratification, of all the miracles they would presently do.  "And, by 
the bye, Mr. Maydig," said Mr. Fotheringay, "I might perhaps be able 
to help you&mdash;in a domestic way." 
</p><p>"Don't quite follow," said Mr. Maydig pouring out a glass of  
miraculous old Burgundy. 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay helped himself to a second Welsh rarebit out of 
vacancy, and took a mouthful.  "I was thinking," he said, "I might 
be able (chum, chum) to work (chum, chum) a miracle with Mrs. 
Minchin (chum, chum)&mdash;make her a better woman." 
</p><p>Mr. Maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful.  "She's&mdash; 
She strongly objects to interference, you know, Mr. Fotheringay.  
And&mdash;as a matter of fact&mdash;it's well past eleven and she's probably in 
bed and asleep.  Do you think, on the whole&mdash;" 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay considered these objections.  "I don't see that it 
shouldn't be done in her sleep." 
</p><p>For a time Mr. Maydig opposed the idea, and then he yielded.  
Mr. Fotheringay issued his orders, and a little less at their ease,  
perhaps, the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast.  Mr. Maydig 
was enlarging on the changes he might expect in his housekeeper 
next day, with an optimism that seemed even to Mr. Fotheringay's 
supper senses a little forced and hectic, when a series of confused 
noises from upstairs began.  Their eyes exchanged interrogations, 
and Mr. Maydig left the room hastily.  Mr. Fotheringay heard him 
calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps going softly up 
to her. 
</p><p>In a minute or so the minister returned, his step light, his face 
radiant.  "Wonderful!" he said, "and touching! Most touching!" 
</p><p>He began pacing the hearthrug.  "A repentance&mdash;a most touching 
repentance&mdash;through the crack of the door.  Poor woman! A most 
wonderful change! She had got up.  She  must have got up at once.  She 
had got up out of her sleep to smash  a private bottle of brandy in 
her box.  And to confess it tool . . . But this gives us&mdash;it opens&mdash;a 
most amazing vista of possibilities.  If  we can work this miraculous 
change in her. . . ." 
</p><p>"The thing's unlimited seemingly,"  said Mr. Fotheringay.  "And 
about Mr. Winch&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Altogether unlimited." And from  the hearthrug Mr. Maydig, 
waving the Winch difficulty aside, unfolded a series of wonderful 
proposals&mdash;proposals he invented as he went along. 
</p><p>Now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials 
of this story.  Suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite 
 
<pb n="137"/>  
 
benevolence, the sort of benevolence that used to be called post-prandial.  Suffice it, too, that the problem of Winch remained  
unsolved.  Nor is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its 
fulfilment.  There were astonishing changes.  The small hours found 
Mr. Maydig and Mr. Fotheringay careering across the chilly market-square under the still moon, in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy, Mr. 
Maydig all flap and gesture, Mr. Fotheringay short and bristling, and 
no longer abashed at his greatness.  They had reformed every drunkard 
in the Parliamentary division, changed all the beer and alcohol 
to water (Mr.  Maydig had overruled Mr. Fotheringay on this point); 
they had, further, greatly improved the railway communication of 
the place, drained Flinder's swamp, improved the soil of One Tree 
Hill, and cured the Vicar's wart.  And they were going to see what 
could be done with the injured pier at South Bridge.  "The place," 
gasped Mr. Maydig, "won't be the same place to-morrow.  How  
surprised and thankful everyone will be!" And just at that moment the 
church clock struck three. 
</p><p>"I say," said Mr. Fotheringay, "that's three o'clock! I must be getting 
back.  I've got to be at business by eight.  And besides, Mrs. Wimms&mdash;" 
</p><p>"We're only beginning," said Mr. Maydig, full of the sweetness of 
unlimited power.  "We're only beginning.  Think of all the good we're 
doing.  When people wake&mdash;" 
</p><p>"But&mdash;," said Mr. Fotheringay. 
</p><p>Mr. Maydig gripped his arm suddenly.  His eyes were bright and 
wild.  "My dear chap," he said, "there's no hurry.  "Look"&mdash;he pointed 
to the moon at the zenith&mdash;"Joshua!" 
</p><p>"Joshua?" said Mr. Fotheringay. 
</p><p>"Joshua," said Mr. Maydig.  "Why not? Stop it." 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay looked at the moon. 
</p><p>"That's a bit tall," he said after a pause. 
</p><p>"Why not?" said Mr. Maydig.  "Of course it doesn't stop.  You stop 
the rotation of the earth, you know.  Time stops.  It isn't as if we were 
doing harm." 
</p><p>"H'm!" said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Well." He sighed.  "I'll try.  Here&mdash;" 
</p><p>He buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable 
globe, with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power.  
"Jest stop rotating, will you," said Mr. Fotheringay. 
</p><p>Incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at 
the rate of dozens of miles a minute.  In spite of the innumerable 
circles he was describing per second, he thought; for thought is  
wonderful&mdash;sometimes as sluggish as flowing pitch, sometimes as  
instantaneous as light.  He thought in a second, and willed.  "Let me come 
 
<pb n="138"/>  
 
down safe and sound.  Whatever else happens, let me down safe and 
sound." 
</p><p>He willed it only just in time, for his clothes, heated by his rapid 
flight through the air, were already beginning to singe.  He came 
down with a forcible, but by no means injurious bump in what 
appeared to be a mound of fresh-turned earth.  A large mass of metal 
and masonry, extraordinarily like the clock-tower in the middle of 
the market-square, hit the earth near him, ricochetted over him, and 
flew into stonework, bricks, and masonry, like a bursting bomb.  A 
hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like an egg.  
There was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of his past 
life seem like the sound of falling dust, and this was followed by a 
descending series of lesser crashes.  A vast wind roared throughout 
earth and heaven' so that he could scarcely lift his head to look.  
For a while he was too breathless and astonished even to see where 
he was or what had happened.  And his first movement was to feel his 
head and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own. 
</p><p>"Lord!" gasped Mr. Fotheringay, scarce able to speak for the gale, 
"I've had a squeak! What's gone wrong? Storms and thunder.  And 
only a minute ago a fine night.  It's Maydig set me on to this sort of 
thing.  What a wind! If I go on fooling in this way I'm bound to 
have a thundering accident! . . . 
</p><p>"Where's Maydig? 
</p><p>"What a confounded mess everything's in!" 
</p><p>He looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit.  
The appearance of things was really extremely strange.  "The sky's 
all right anyhow," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "And that's about all that 
is all right.  And even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up.  
But there's the moon overhead. just as it was just now.  Bright as 
midday.  But as for the rest&mdash;Where's the village? Where's&mdash;where's 
anything? And what on earth set this wind ablowing? I didn't order 
no wind." 
</p><p>Mr. Fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain, and after one 
failure, remained on all fours, holding on.  He surveyed the moonlit 
world to leeward, with the tails of his jacket streaming over his 
head.  "There's something seriously wrong," said Mr. Fotheringay.  
"And what it is&mdash;goodness knows." 
</p><p>Far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the 
haze of dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses 
of earth and heaps of inchoate ruins, no trees, no houses, no familiar 
shapes, only a wilderness of disorder vanishing at last into the  
darkness beneath the whirling columns and streamers, the lightnings and 
thunderings of a swiftly rising storm.  Near him in the livid glare 
 
<pb n="139"/>  
 
was something that might once have been an elm-tree, a smashed 
mass of splinters, shivered from boughs to base, and further a 
twisted mass of iron girders&mdash;only too evidently the viaduct&mdash;rose 
out of the piled confusion. 
</p><p>You see when Mr. Fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the 
solid globe, he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling 
movables upon its surface.  And the earth spins so fast that the  
surface at its equator is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles 
an hour, and in these latitudes at more than half that pace.  So that 
the village, and Mr. Maydig, and Mr. Fotheringay, and everybody 
and everything had been jerked violently forward at about nine miles 
per second&mdash;that is to say, much more violently than if they had been 
fired out of a cannon.  And every human being, every living creature, 
every house, and every tree&mdash;all the world as we know it&mdash;had been 
so jerked and smashed and utterly destroyed.  That was all. 
</p><p>These things Mr. Fotheringay did not, of course, fully appreciate.  
But he perceived that his miracle had miscarried, and with that a 
great disgust of miracles came upon him.  He was in darkness now, 
for the clouds had swept together and blotted out his momentary 
glimpse of the moon, and the air was full of fitful struggling tortured 
wraiths of hail.  A great roaring of wind and waters filled earth and 
sky, and, peering under his hand through the dust and sleet to  
windward, he saw by the play of the lightnings a vast wall of water  
pouring towards him. 
</p><p>"Maydig!" screamed Mr. Fotheringay's feeble voice amid the  
elemental uproar.  "Here!&mdash;Maydig!" 
</p><p>"Stop!" cried Mr. Fotheringay to the advancing water.  "Oh, for 
goodness' sake, stop!" 
</p><p>"Just a moment," said Mr. Fotheringay to the lightnings and  
thunder.  "Stop jest a moment while I collect my thoughts. . . . And now 
what shall I do?" he said.  "What shall I do? Lord! I wish Maydig 
was about." 
</p><p>"I know," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "And for goodness' sake let's have 
it right this time." 
</p><p>He remained on all fours, leaning against the wind, very intent 
to have everything right. 
</p><p>"Ah!" he said.  "Let nothing what I'm going to order happen until 
I say 'Off!' . . . Lord! I wish I'd thought of that before!" 
</p><p>He lifted his little voice against the whirlwind, shouting louder and 
louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak.  "Now then!&mdash;here 
goes! Mind about that what I said just now.  In the first place, when 
all I've got to say is done, let me lose my miraculous power, let my 
will become just like anybody else's will, and all these dangerous 
 
<pb n="140"/>  
 
miracles be stopped.  I don't like them.  I'd rather I didn't work 'em.  
Ever so much.  That's the first thing.  And the second is&mdash;let me be 
back just before the miracles begin; let everything be just as it was 
before that blessed lamp turned up.  It's a big job, but it's the last.  
Have you got it? No more miracles, everything as it was&mdash;me back in 
the Long Dragon just before I drank my half-pint.  That's it! Yes." 
</p><p>He dug his fingers into the mould, closed his eyes, and said "Off!" 
</p><p>Everything became perfectly still.  He perceived that he was standing 
erect. 
</p><p>"So you say," said a voice. 
</p><p>He opened his eyes.  He was in the bar of the Long Dragon,  
arguing about miracles with Toddy Beamish.  He had a vague sense of 
some great thing forgotten that instantaneously passed.  You see, 
except for the loss of his miraculous powers, everything was back as 
it had been; his mind and memory therefore were now just as they 
had been at the time when this story began.  So that he knew  
absolutely nothing of all that is told here, knows nothing of all that is 
told here to this day.  And among other things, of course, he still 
did not believe in miracles. 
</p><p>"I tell you that miracles, properly speaking, can't possibly happen," 
he said, "whatever you like to hold.  And I'm prepared to prove it up 
to the hilt." 
</p><p>"That's what you think," said Toddy Beamish, and "Prove it if 
you can." 
</p><p>"Looky here, Mr. Beamish," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Let us clearly 
understand what a miracle is.  It's something contrariwise to the 
course of nature done by power of Will . . ."

<head>THE PLATTNER STORY</head> 
 
<p>Whether the story of Gottfried Plattner is to be credited or not, is 
a pretty question in the value of evidence.  On the one hand, we have 
seven witnesses&mdash;to be perfectly exact, we have six and a half pairs of 
eyes, and one undeniable fact; and on the other we have&mdash;what is it? 
&mdash;prejudice, common sense, the inertia of opinion.  Never were there 
seven more honest-seeming witnesses; never was there a more undeniable, 
fact than the inversion of Gottfried Plattner's anatomical structure, 
and&mdash;never was there a more preposterous story than the one they 
have to tell! The most preposterous part of the story is the worthy 
Gottfried's contribution (for I count him as one of the seven).  Heaven 
forbid that I should be led into giving countenance to superstition 
by a passion for impartiality, and so come to share the fate of  
Eusapia's patrons! Frankly, I believe there is something crooked about 
this business of Gottfried Plattner; but what that crooked factor is, 
I will admit as frankly, I do not know.  I have been surprised at the 
credit accorded to the story in the most unexpected and authoritative 
quarters.  The fairest way to the reader, however, will be for me to 
tell it without further comment. 
</p><p>Gottfried Plattner is, in spite of his name, a freeborn Englishman.  
His father was an Alsatian who came to England in the Sixties,  
married a respectable English girl of unexceptionable antecedents, and 
died, after a wholesome and uneventful life (devoted, I understand, 
chiefly to the laying of parquet flooring), in 1887.  Gottfried's age is 
seven-and-twenty.  He is, by virtue of his heritage of three languages, 
Modern Languages Master in a small private school in the South of 
England.  To the casual observer he is singularly like any other  
Modern 
 
<pb n="142"/>  
 
Languages Master in any other small private school.  His costume 
is neither very costly nor very fashionable, but, on the other hand, 
it is not markedly cheap or shabby; his complexion, like his height 
and his bearing, is inconspicuous.  You would notice, perhaps, that, 
like the majority of people, his face was not absolutely symmetrical, 
his right eye a little larger than the left, and his jaw a trifle heavier 
on the right side.  If you, as an ordinary careless person, were to bare 
his chest and feel his heart beating, you would probably find it quite 
like the heart of any one else.  But here you and the trained observer 
would part company.  If you found his heart quite ordinary, the 
trained observer would find it quite otherwise.  And once the thing 
was pointed out to you, you too would perceive the peculiarity easily 
enough.  It is that Gottfried's heart beats on the right side of his 
body. 
</p><p>Now, that is not the only singularity of Gottfried's structure,  
although it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind.  
Careful sounding of Gottfried's internal arrangements, by a well-known surgeon, seems to point to the fact that all the other  
unsymmetrical parts of his body are similarly misplaced.  The right lobe of 
his liver is on the left side, the left on his right; while his lungs, 
too, are similarly contraposed.  What is still more singular, unless 
Gottfried is a consummate actor, we must believe that his right hand 
has recently become his left.  Since the occurrences we are about to 
consider (as impartially as possible), he has found the utmost difficulty 
in writing, except from right to left across the paper with his left 
hand.  He cannot throw with his right hand, he is perplexed at meal 
times between knife and fork, and his ideas of the rule of the road&mdash; 
he is a cyclist&mdash;are still a dangerous confusion.  And there is not a 
scrap of evidence to show that before these occurrences Gottfried 
was at all left-handed. 
</p><p>There is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business.  
Gottfried produces three photographs of himself.  You have him at 
the age of five or six, thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid 
frock, and scowling.  In that photograph his left eye is a little larger 
than his right, and his jaw is a. trifle heavier on the left side.  This is 
the reverse of his present living conditions.  The photograph of  
Gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict these facts, but that is because 
it is one of those cheap "Gem" photographs that were then in vogue, 
taken direct upon metal, and therefore reversing things just as a 
looking-glass would.  The third photograph represents him at one-and-twenty, and confirms the record of the others.  There seems here 
evidence of the strongest confirmatory character that Gottfried has 
exchanged his left side for his right.  Yet how a human being can be so 
 
<pb n="143"/>  
 
changed, short of a fantastic and pointless miracle, it is exceedingly 
hard to suggest. 
</p><p>In one way, of course, these facts might be explicable on the  
supposition that Plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification, on 
the strength of his heart's displacement.  Photographs may be fudged, 
and left-handedness imitated.  But the character of the man does 
not lend itself to any such theory.  He is quiet, practical, unobtrusive, 
and thoroughly sane, from the Nordau standpoint.  He likes beer, 
and smokes moderately, takes walking exercise daily, and has a healthily 
high estimate of the value of his teaching.  He has a good but 
untrained tenor voice, and takes a pleasure in singing airs of a  
popular and cheerful character.  He is fond, but not morbidly fond, of 
reading,&mdash;chiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely pious optimism,&mdash; 
sleeps well, and rarely dreams.  He is, in fact, the very last person 
to evolve a fantastic fable.  Indeed, so far from forcing this story 
upon the world, he has been singularly reticent on the matter.  He 
meets enquirers with a certain engaging&mdash;bashfulness is almost the 
word, that disarms the most suspicious.  He seems genuinely ashamed 
that anything so unusual has occurred to him. 
</p><p>It is to be regretted that Plattner's aversion to the idea of post-mortem dissection may postpone, perhaps for ever, the positive proof 
that his entire body has had its left and right sides transposed.  Upon 
that fact mainly the credibility of his story hangs.  There is no way of 
taking a man and moving him about in space, as ordinary people 
understand space, that will result in our changing his sides.  Whatever 
you do, his right is still his right, his left his left.  You can do that 
with a perfectly thin and flat thing, of course.  If you were to cut a 
figure out of paper, any figure with a right and left side, you could 
change its sides simply by lifting it up and turning it over.  But with 
a solid it is different.  Mathematical theorists tell us that the only way 
in which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is 
by taking that body clean out of space as we know it,&mdash;taking it out 
of ordinary existence, that is, and turning it somewhere outside space.  
This is a little abstruse, no doubt, but any one with any knowledge 
of mathematical theory will assure the reader of its truth.  To put 
the thing in technical language, the curious inversion of Plattner's 
right and left sides is proof that he has moved out of our space into 
what is called the Fourth Dimension, and that he has returned again 
to our world.  Unless we choose to consider ourselves the victims of 
an elaborate and motiveless fabrication, we are almost bound to  
believe that this has occurred. 
</p><p>So much for the tangible facts.  We come now to the account of the 
phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the 
 
<pb n="144"/>  
 
world.  It appears that in the Sussexville Proprietary School Plattner 
not only discharged the duties of Modern Languages Master, but also 
taught chemistry, commercial geography, book-keeping, shorthand, 
drawing, and any other additional subject to which the changing 
fancies of the boys' parents might direct attention.  He knew little 
or nothing of these various subjects, but in secondary as distinguished 
from Board or elementary schools, knowledge in the teacher is, very 
properly, by no means so necessary as high moral character and  
gentlemanly tone.  In chemistry he was particularly deficient, knowing, 
he says, nothing beyond the Three Gases (whatever the three gases 
may be).  As, however, his pupils began by knowing nothing, and 
derived all their information from him, this caused him (or any one) 
but little inconvenience for several terms.  Then a little boy named 
Whibble joined the school, who had been educated (it seems) by some 
mischievous relative into an enquiring habit of mind.  This little boy 
followed Plattner's lessons with marked and sustained interest, and 
in order to exhibit his zeal on the subject, brought, at various times, 
substances for Plattner to analyse.  Plattner, flattered by this evidence 
of his power of awakening interest, and trusting to the boy's ignorance, 
analysed these, and even made general statements as to their  
composition.  Indeed, he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain 
a work upon analytical chemistry and study it during his supervision 
of the evening's preparation.  He was surprised to find chemistry 
quite an interesting subject. 
</p><p>So far the story is absolutely commonplace.  But now the greenish 
powder comes upon the scene.  The source of that greenish powder 
seems, unfortunately, lost.  Master Whibble tells a tortuous story of 
finding it done up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the downs. 
It would have been an excellent thing for Plattner, and possibly for 
Master Whibble's family, if a match could have been applied to that 
powder there and then.  The young gentleman certainly did not bring 
it to school in a packet, but in a common eight-ounce graduated 
medicine bottle, plugged with masticated newspaper.  He gave it to 
Plattner at the end of the afternoon school.  Four boys had been  
detained after school prayers in order to complete some neglected tasks, 
and Plattner was supervising these in the small classroom in which 
the chemical teaching was conducted.  The appliances for the practical 
teaching of chemistry in the Sussexville Proprietary School, as 
in most small schools in this country, are characterised by a severe 
simplicity.  They are kept in a small cupboard standing in a recess, 
and having about the same capacity as a common travelling trunk.  
Plattner, being bored with his passive superintendence, seems to have 
welcomed the intervention of Whibble with his green powder as an 
 
<pb n="145"/>  
 
agreeable diversion, and, unlocking this cupboard, proceeded at once 
with his analytical experiments.  Whibble sat, luckily for himself, at 
a safe distance, regarding him.  The four malefactors, feigning a  
profound absorption in their work, watched him furtively with the keenest 
interest.  For even within the limits of the Three Gases, Plattner's  
practical chemistry was, I understand, temerarious. 
</p><p>They are practically unanimous in their account of Plattner's  
proceedings.  He poured a little of the green powder into a test-tube, and 
tried the substance with water, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and  
sulphuric acid in succession.  Getting no result, he emptied out a little 
heap&mdash;nearly half the bottleful, in fact&mdash;upon a slate and tried a 
match.  He held the medicine bottle in his left hand.  The stuff began 
to smoke and melt, and then&mdash;exploded with deafening violence and 
a blinding flash. 
</p><p>The five boys, seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes, 
ducked below their desks, and were none of them seriously hurt.  The 
window was blown out into the playground, and the blackboard on 
its easel was upset.  The slate was smashed to atoms.  Some plaster fell 
from the ceiling.  No other damage was done to the school edifice or 
appliances, and the boys at first, seeing nothing' of Plattner, fancied 
he was knocked down and lying out of their sight below the desks.  
They jumped out of their places to go to his assistance, and were 
amazed to find the space empty.  Being still confused by the sudden 
violence of the report, they hurried to the open door, under the 
impression that he must have been hurt, and have rushed out of the 
room.  But Carson, the foremost, nearly collided in the doorway with 
the principal, Mr. Lidgett. 
</p><p>Mr. Lidgett is a corpulent, excitable man with one eye.  The boys 
describe him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those 
tempered expletives irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use 
&mdash;lest worse befall.  "Wretched mumchancer!" he said.  "Where's Mr. 
Plattner?" The boys are agreed on the very words. ("Wobbler,"  
"snivelling puppy," and "mumchancer" are, it seems, among the ordinary 
small change of Mr. Lidgett's scholastic commerce.) 
</p><p>Where's Mr. Plattner? That was a question that was to be repeated 
many times in the next few days.  It really seemed as though that 
frantic hyperbole, "blown to atoms," had for once realised itself.  There 
was not a visible particle of Plattner to be seen; not a drop of blood 
nor a stitch of clothing to be found.  Apparently he had been blown 
clean out of existence and left not a wrack behind.  Not so much as 
would cover a sixpenny piece, to quote a proverbial expression! The 
evidence of his absolute disappearance, as a consequence of that  
explosion, is indubitable. 
 
<pb n="146"/>  
 
</p><p>It is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in 
the Sussexville Proprietary School, and in Sussexville and elsewhere, 
by this event.  It is quite possible, indeed, that some of the readers 
of these pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying  
version of that excitement during the last summer holidays.  Lidgett, it 
would seem, did everything in his power to suppress and minimise 
the story.  He instituted a penalty of twenty-five lines for any mention 
of Plattner's name among the boys, and stated in the schoolroom that 
he was clearly aware of his assistant's whereabouts.  He was afraid, 
he explains, that the possibility of an explosion happening, in spite of 
the elaborate precautions taken to minimise the practical teaching 
of chemistry, might injure the reputation of the school; and so might 
any mysterious quality in Plattner's departure.  Indeed, he did  
everything in his power to make the occurrence seem as ordinary as  
possible.  In particular, he cross-examined the five eye-witnesses of the 
occurrence so searchingly that they began to doubt the plain evidence 
of their senses.  But, in spite of these efforts, the tale, in a magnified 
and distorted state, made a nine days' wonder in the district, and 
several parents withdrew their sons on colourable pretexts.  Not the 
least remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a large number 
of people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dreams of 
Plattner during the period of excitement before his return, and that 
these dreams had a curious uniformity.  In almost all of them  
Plattner was seen, sometimes singly, sometimes in company, wandering 
about through a coruscating iridescence.  In all cases his face was 
pale and distressed, and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer.  
One or two of the boys, evidently under the influence of nightmare, 
fancied that Plattner approached them with remarkable swiftness, and 
seemed to look closely into their very eyes.  Others fled with Plattner 
from the pursuit of vague and extraordinary creatures of a globular 
shape.  But all these fancies were forgotten in enquiries and  
speculations when, on the Wednesday next but one after the Monday of 
the explosion, Plattner returned. 
</p><p>The circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his 
departure.  So far as Mr. Lidgett's somewhat choleric outline can be 
filled in from Plattner's hesitating statements, it would appear that 
on Wednesday evening, towards the hour of sunset, the former 
gentleman, having dismissed evening preparation, was engaged in his 
garden, picking and eating strawberries, a fruit of which he is  
inordinately fond.  It is a large old-fashioned garden, secured from  
observation, fortunately, by a high and ivy-covered red-brick wall. just 
as he was stooping over a particularly prolific plant, there was a 
flash in the air and a heavy thud, and before he could look round, 
 
<pb n="147"/>  
 
some heavy body struck him violently from behind.  He was pitched 
forward, crushing the strawberries he held in his hand, and that so 
roughly, that his silk hat&mdash;Mr. Lidgett adheres to the older ideas of 
scholastic costume&mdash;was driven violently down upon his forehead, and 
almost over one eye.  This heavy missile, which slid over him sideways 
and collapsed into a sitting posture among the strawberry plants, 
proved to be our long-lost Mr. Gottfried Plattner, in an extremely 
dishevelled condition.  He was collarless and hatless, his linen was 
dirty, and there was blood upon his hands.  Mr. Lidgett was so  
indignant and surprised that he remained on all-fours, and with his hat 
jammed down on his eye, while he expostulated vehemently with 
Plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct. 
</p><p>This scarcely idyllic scene completes what I may call the exterior 
version of the Plattner story&mdash;its exoteric aspect.  It is quite  
unnecessary to enter here into all the details of his dismissal by Mr. Lidgett.  
Such details, with the full names and dates and references, will be 
found in the larger report of these occurrences that was laid before 
the Society for the Investigation of Abnormal Phenomena.  The singular 
transposition of Plattner's right and left sides was scarcely observed 
for the first day or so, and then first in connection with his disposition 
to write from right to left across the blackboard.  He concealed 
rather than ostended this curious confirmatory circumstance, as he 
considered it would unfavourably affect his prospects in a new 
situation.  The displacement of his heart was discovered some months 
after, when he was having a tooth extracted under anaesthetics.  He 
then, very unwillingly, allowed a cursory surgical examination to be 
made of himself, with a view to a brief account in the  Journal of 
Anatomy.  That exhausts the statement of the material facts; and 
we may now go on to consider Plattner's account of the matter. 
</p><p>But first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion 
of this story and what is to follow.  All I have told thus far is  
established by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve.  
Every one of the witnesses is still alive; the reader, if he have the 
leisure, may hunt the lads out to-morrow, or even brave the terrors 
of the redoubtable Lidgett, and cross-examine and trap and test to 
his heart's content; Gottfried Plattner, himself, and his twisted 
heart and his three photographs are producible.  It may be taken as 
proved that he did disappear for nine days as the consequence of an 
explosion; that he returned almost as violently, under circumstances 
in their nature annoying to Mr. Lidgett, whatever the details of 
those circumstances may be; and that he returned inverted, just as 
a reflection returns from a mirror.  From the last fact, as I have 
already stated, it follows almost inevitably that Plattner, during those 
 
<pb n="148"/>  
 
nine days, must have been in some state of existence altogether out 
of space.  The evidence to these statements is, indeed, far stronger 
than that upon which most murderers are hanged.  But for his own 
particular account of where he had been, with its confused explanations 
and well-nigh self-contradictory details, we have only Mr. Gottfried 
Plattner's word.  I do not wish to discredit that, but I must point 
out&mdash;what so many writers upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to 
do&mdash;that we are passing here from the practically undeniable to that 
kind of matter which any reasonable man is entitled to believe or 
reject as he thinks proper.  The previous statements render it plausible; 
its discordance with common experience tilts it towards the incredible. 
I would prefer not to sway the beam of the reader's 
judgment either way, but simply to tell the story as Plattner told it me. 
</p><p>He gave me his narrative, I may state, at my house at Chislehurst, 
and so soon as he had left me that evening, I went into my study and 
wrote down everything as I remembered it.  Subsequently he was good 
enough to read over a type-written copy, so that its substantial  
correctness is undeniable. 
</p><p>He states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought 
he was killed.  He felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward.  
It is a curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his 
backward flight, and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry 
cupboard or the blackboard easel.  His heels struck ground, and he 
staggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on something soft 
and firm.  For a moment the concussion stunned him.  He became aware 
at once of a vivid scent of singed hair, and he seemed to hear the 
voice of Lidgett asking for him.  You will understand that for a time 
his mind was greatly confused. 
</p><p>At first he was distinctly under the impression that he was still 
in the classroom.  He perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the 
boys and the entry of Mr. Lidgett.  He is quite positive upon that 
score.  He did not hear their remarks; but that he ascribed to the 
deafening effect of the experiment.  Things about him seemed curiously 
dark and faint, but his mind explained that on the obvious but  
mistaken idea that the explosion had engendered a huge volume of dark 
smoke.  Through the dimness the figures of Lidgett and the boys 
moved, as faint and silent as ghosts.  Plattner's face still tingled with 
the stinging heat of the flash.  He was, he says, "all muddled." His 
first definite thoughts seem to have been of his personal safety.  He 
thought he was perhaps blinded and deafened.  He felt his limbs and 
face in a gingerly manner.  Then his perceptions grew clearer, and 
he was astonished to miss the old familiar desks and other schoolroom 
furniture about him.  Only dim, uncertain, grey shapes stood in the 
 
<pb n="149"/>  
 
place of these.  Then came a thing that made him shout aloud, and 
awoke his stunned faculties to instant activity.  Two of the boys,  
gesticulating, walked one after the other clean through him! Neither 
manifested the slightest consciousness of his presence.  It is difficult to 
imagine the sensation he felt.  They came against him, he says, with 
no more force than a wisp of mist. 
</p><p>Plattner's first thought after that was that he was dead.  Having 
been brought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters, however, 
he was a little surprised to find his body still about him.  His 
second conclusion was that he was not dead, but that the others were: 
that the explosion had destroyed the Sussexville Proprietary School 
and every soul in it except himself.  But that, too, was scarcely  
satisfactory.  He was thrown back upon astonished observation. 
</p><p>Everything about him was extraordinarily dark: at first it seemed 
to have an altogether ebony blackness.  Overhead was a black firmament. 
The only touch of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow 
at the edge of the sky in one direction, which threw into prominence 
a horizon of undulating black hills.  This, I say, was his impression at 
first.  As his eye grew accustomed to the darkness, he began to  
distinguish a faint quality of differentiating greenish colour in the 
circumambient night.  Against this background the furniture and 
occupants of the classroom, it seems, stood out like phosphorescent 
spectres, faint and impalpable.  He extended his hand, and thrust it 
without an effort through the wall of the room by the fireplace. 
</p><p>He describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract  
attention.  He shouted to Lidgett, and tried to seize the boys as they went 
to and fro.  He only desisted from these attempts when Mrs. Lidgett, 
whom he (as an Assistant Master) naturally disliked, entered the room.  
He says the sensation of being in the world, and yet not a part of it, 
was an extraordinarily disagreeable one.  He compared his feelings, 
not inaptly, to those of a cat watching a mouse through a window.  
Whenever he made a motion to communicate with the dim, familiar 
world about him, he found an invisible, incomprehensible barrier  
preventing intercourse. 
</p><p>He then turned his attention to his solid environment.  He found 
the medicine bottle still unbroken in his hand, with the remainder 
of the green powder therein.  He put this in his pocket, and began 
to feel about him.  Apparently, he was sitting on a boulder of rock 
covered with a velvety moss.  The dark country about him he was  
unable to see, the faint, misty picture of the schoolroom blotting it out, 
but he had a feeling (due perhaps to a cold wind) that he was 
near the crest of a hill, and that a steep valley fell away beneath his 
 
<pb n="150"/>  
 
feet.  The green glow along the edge of the sky seemed to be growing 
in extent and intensity.  He stood up, rubbing his eyes. 
</p><p>It would seem that he made a few steps, going steeply downhill, and 
then stumbled, nearly fell, and sat down again upon a jagged mass 
of rock to watch the dawn.  He became aware that the world about him 
was absolutely silent.  It was as still as it was dark, and though there 
was a cold wind blowing up the hill-face, the rustle of grass, the 
soughing of the boughs that should have accompanied it, were absent.  
He could hear, therefore, if he could not see, that the hillside upon 
which he stood was rocky and desolate.  The green grew brighter every 
moment, and as it did so, a faint, transparent blood-red mingled with, 
but did not mitigate, the blackness of the sky overhead and the 
rocky desolations about him.  Having regard to what follows, I am 
inclined to think that that redness may have been an optical effect due 
to contrast.  Something black fluttered momentarily against the livid 
yellow-green of the lower sky, and then the thin and penetrating voice 
of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him.  An oppressive  
expectation grew with the growing light. 
</p><p>It is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there, the 
strange green light growing brighter every moment, and spreading 
slowly, in flamboyant fingers, upward towards the zenith.  As it grew, 
the spectral vision of our world became relatively or absolutely fainter.  
Probably both, for the time must have been about that of our earthly 
sunset.  So far as his vision of our world went, Plattner, by his few 
steps downhill, had passed through the floor of the classroom, and 
was now, it seemed, sitting in mid-air in the larger schoolroom  
downstairs.  He saw the boarders distinctly, but much more faintly than 
he had seen Lidgett.  They were preparing their evening tasks, and 
he noticed with interest that several were cheating with their Euclid 
riders by means of a crib, a compilation whose existence he had 
hitherto never suspected.  As the time passed, they faded steadily, 
as steadily as the light of the green dawn increased. 
</p><p>Looking down into the valley, he saw that the light had crept far 
down its rocky sides, and that the profound blackness of the abyss 
was now broken by a minute green glow, like the light of a glowworm.  
And almost immediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing 
green rose over the basaltic undulations of the distant hills, and the 
monstrous hill-masses about him came out gaunt and desolate, in 
green light and deep, ruddy black shadows.  He became aware of a 
vast number of ball-shaped objects drifting as thistledown drifts over 
the high ground.  There were none of these nearer to him than the 
opposite side of the gorge.  The bell below twanged quicker and 
quicker, with something like impatient insistence, and several lights 
 
<pb n="151"/>  
 
moved hither and thither.  The boys at work at their desks were now 
almost imperceptibly faint. 
</p><p>This extinction of our world, when the green sun of this other 
universe rose, is a curious point upon which Plattner insists.  During 
the Other-World night, it is difficult to move about, on account of the 
vividness with which the things of this world are visible.  It becomes 
a riddle to explain why, if this is the case, we in this world catch no 
glimpse of the Other-World.' It is due, perhaps, to the comparatively 
vivid illumination of this world of ours.  Plattner describes the midday 
of the Other-World, at its brightest, as not being nearly so bright as 
this world at full moon, while its night is profoundly black.  
Consequently, the amount of light, even in an ordinary dark room, is  
sufficient to render the things of the Other-World invisible, on the same 
principle that faint phosphorescence is only visible in the profoundest 
darkness.  I have tried, since he told me his story, to see something 
of the Other-World by sitting for a long space in a photographer's 
dark room at night.  I have certainly seen indistinctly the form of 
greenish slopes and rocks, but only, I must admit, very indistinctly 
indeed.  The reader may possibly be more successful.  Plattner tells 
me that since his return he has dreamt and seen and recognised places 
in the Other-World, but this is probably due to his memory of these 
scenes.  It seems quite possible that people with unusually keen  
eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this strange Other-World 
about us. 
</p><p>However, this is a digression.  As the green sun rose, a long street 
of black buildings became perceptible, though only darkly and  
indistinctly, in the gorge, and, after some hesitation, Plattner began to 
clamber down the precipitous descent towards them.  The descent was 
long and exceedingly tedious, being so not only by the extraordinary 
steepness, but also by reason of the looseness of the boulders with 
which the whole face of the hill was strewn.  The noise of his  
descent&mdash;now and then his heels struck fire from the rocks&mdash;seemed now 
the only sound in the universe, for the beating of the bell had ceased.  
As he drew nearer, he perceived that the various edifices had a 
singular resemblance to tombs and mausoleums and monuments, 
saving only that they were all uniformly black instead of being white, 
as most sepulchres are.  And then he saw, crowding out of the largest 
building, very much as people disperse from church, a number of 
pallid, rounded, pale-green figures.  These dispersed in several  
directions about the broad street of the place, some going through side 
alleys and reappearing upon the steepness of the hill, others entering 
some of the small black buildings which lined the way. 
</p><p>At the sight of these things drifting up towards him, Plattner 
 
<pb n="152"/>  
 
stopped, staring.  They were not walking, they were indeed limbless, 
and they had the appearance of human heads, beneath which a tadpole-like body swung.  He was too astonished at their strangeness, too full, 
indeed, of strangeness, to be seriously alarmed by them.  They drove 
towards him, in front of the chill wind that was blowing uphill, 
much as soap-bubbles drive before a draught.  And as he looked at 
the nearest of those approaching, he saw it was indeed a human head, 
albeit with singularly large eyes, and wearing such an expression of 
distress and anguish as he had never seen before upon mortal countenance. 
He was surprised to find that it did not turn to regard him, 
but seemed to be watching and following some unseen moving thing.  
For a moment he was puzzled, and then it occurred to him that this 
creature was watching with its enormous eyes something that was 
happening in the world he had just left.  Nearer it came, and nearer, 
and he was too astonished to cry out.  It made a very faint fretting 
sound as it came close to him.  Then it struck his face with a gentle 
pat,&mdash;its touch was very cold,&mdash;and drove past him, and upward  
towards the crest of the hill. 
</p><p>An extraordinary conviction flashed across Plattner's mind that this 
head had a strong likeness to Lidgett.  Then he turned his attention 
to the other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hillside.  
None made the slightest sign of recognition.  One or two, indeed, came 
close to his head and almost followed the example of the first, but he 
dodged convulsively out of the way.  Upon most of them he saw the 
same expression of unavailing regret he had seen upon the first, 
and heard the same faint sounds of wretchedness from them.  One 
or two wept, and one rolling swiftly uphill wore an expression of 
diabolical rage.  But others were cold, and several had a look of 
gratified interest in their eyes.  One, at least, was almost in an ecstasy 
of happiness.  Plattner does not remember that he recognised any more 
likenesses in those he saw at this time. 
</p><p>For several hours, perhaps, Plattner watched these strange things 
dispersing themselves over the hills, and not till long after they had 
ceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge, did 
he resume his downward climb.  The darkness about him increased 
so much that he had a difficulty in stepping true.  Overhead the sky 
was now a bright, pale green.  He felt neither hunger nor thirst.  Later, 
when he did, he found a chilly stream running down the centre of 
the gorge, and the rare moss upon the boulders, when he tried it at 
last in desperation, was good to eat. 
</p><p>He groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge, seeking 
vaguely for some clue to these inexplicable things.  After a long time 
he came to the entrance of the big mausoleum-like building from 
 
<pb n="153"/>  
 
which the heads had issued.  In this he found a group of green lights 
burning upon a kind of basaltic altar, and a bell-rope from a belfry 
overhead hanging down into the centre of the place.  Round the wall 
ran a lettering of fire in a character unknown to him.  While he was 
still wondering at the purport of these things, he heard the receding 
tramp of heavy feet echoing far down the street.  He ran out into 
the darkness again, but he could see nothing.  He had a mind to pull 
the bell-rope, and finally decided to follow the footsteps.  But, although 
he ran far, he never overtook them; and his shouting was of no avail.  
The gorge seemed to extend an interminable distance.  It was as dark 
as earthly starlight throughout its length, while the ghastly green 
day lay along the upper edge of its precipices.  There were none of 
the heads, now, below.  They were all, it seemed, busily occupied along 
the upper slopes.  Looking up, he saw them drifting hither and 
thither, some hovering stationary, some flying swiftly through the air.  
It reminded him, he said, of "big snowflakes;" only these were black 
and pale green. 
</p><p>In pursuing the firm, undeviating footsteps that he never overtook, 
in groping into new regions of this endless devil's dyke, in clambering 
up and down the pitiless heights, in wandering about the summits, 
and in watching the drifting faces, Plattner states that he spent the 
better part of seven or eight days.  He did not keep count, he says.  
Though once or twice he found eyes watching him, he had word with 
no living soul.  He slept among the rocks on the hillside.  In the gorge 
things earthly were invisible, because, from the earthly standpoint, 
it was far underground.  On the altitudes, so soon as the earthly day 
began, the world became visible to him.  He found himself sometimes 
stumbling over the dark-green rocks, or arresting himself on a  
precipitous brink, while all about him the green branches of the  
Sussexville lanes were swaying; or, again, he seemed to be walking 
through the Sussexville streets, or watching unseen the private  
business of some household.  And then it was he discovered, that to almost 
every human being in our world there pertained some of these drifting 
heads: that every one in the world is watched intermittently by these 
helpless disembodiments. 
</p><p>What are they&mdash;these Watchers of the Living? Plattner never learned.  
But two, that presently found and followed him, were like his  
childhood's memory of his father and mother.  Now and then other faces 
turned their eyes upon him: eyes like those of dead people who had 
swayed him, or injured him, or helped him in his youth and manhood.   
Whenever they looked at him, Plattner was overcome with a 
strange sense of responsibility.  To his mother he ventured to speak; 
 
<pb n="154"/>  
 
but she made no answer.  She looked sadly, steadfastly, and tenderly&mdash; 
a little reproachfully, too, it seemed&mdash;into his eyes. 
</p><p>He simply tells this story: he does not endeavour to explain.  We 
are left to surmise who these Watchers of the Living may be, or 
if they are indeed the Dead, why they should so closely and passionately  
watch a world they have left for ever.  It may be&mdash;indeed to my 
mind it seems just&mdash;that, when our life has closed, when evil or good 
is no longer a choice for us, we may still have to witness the working 
out of the train of consequences we have laid.  If human souls continue  
after death, then surely human interests continue after death.  
But that is merely my own guess at the meaning of the things seen.  
Plattner offers no interpretation, for none was given him.  It is well 
the reader should understand this clearly.  Day after day, with his 
head reeling, he wandered about this strange-lit world outside the 
world, weary and, towards the end, weak and hungry.  By day&mdash;by our 
earthly day, that is&mdash;the ghostly vision of the old familiar scenery of 
Sussexville, all about him, irked and worried him.  He could not see 
where to put his feet, and ever and again with a chilly touch one 
of these Watching Souls would come against his face.  And after dark 
the multitude of these Watchers about him, and their intent distress, 
confused his mind beyond describing.  A great longing to return to 
the earthly life that was so near and yet so remote consumed him.  
The unearthliness of things about him produced a positively painful 
mental distress.  He was worried beyond describing by his own  
particular followers.  He would shout at them to desist from staring at 
him, scold at them, hurry away from them.  They were always mute 
and intent.  Run as he might over the uneven ground, they followed 
his destinies. 
</p><p>On the ninth day, towards evening, Plattner heard the invisible 
footsteps approaching, far away down the gorge.  He was then wandering  
over the broad crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen 
in his entry into this strange Other-World of his.  He turned to hurry 
down into the gorge, feeling his way hastily, and was arrested by the 
sight of the thing that was happening in a room in a back street 
near the school.  Both of the people in the room he knew by sight.  
The windows were open, the blinds up, and the setting sun shone 
clearly into it, so that it came out quite brightly at first, a vivid  
oblong of room, lying like a magic-lantern picture upon the black  
landscape and the livid green dawn.  In addition to the sunlight, a candle 
had just been lit in the room. 
</p><p>On the bed lay a lank man, his ghastly white face terrible upon 
the tumbled pillow.  His clenched hands were raised above his head.  
A little table beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles, some 
 
<pb n="155"/>  
 
toast and water, and an empty glass.  Every now and then the lank 
man's lips fell apart, to indicate a word he could not articulate.  But 
the woman did not notice that he wanted anything, because she was 
busy turning out papers from an old-fashioned bureau in the opposite 
corner of the room.  At first the picture was very vivid indeed, but 
as the green dawn behind it grew brighter and brighter, so it became 
fainter and more and more transparent. 
</p><p>As the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer, those footsteps 
that sound so loud in that Other-World and come so silently in this, 
Plattner perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering 
together out of the darkness and watching the two people in the 
room.  Never before had he seen so many of the Watchers of the 
Living.  A multitude had eyes only for the sufferer in the room, another 
multitude, in infinite anguish, watched the woman as she hunted with 
greedy eyes for something she could not find.  They crowded about 
Plattner, they came across his sight and buffeted his face, the noise of 
their unavailing regrets was all about him.  He saw clearly only now 
and then.  At other times the picture quivered dimly, through the veil 
of green reflections upon their movements.  In the room it must have 
been very still, and Plattner says the candle flame streamed up into 
a perfectly vertical line of smoke, but in his ears each footfall and its 
echoes beat like a clap of thunder.  And the faces! Two, more  
particularly near the woman's: one a woman's also, white and clear-featured, a face which might have once been cold and hard, but 
which was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth.  
The other might have been the woman's father.  Both were evidently 
absorbed in the contemplation of some act of hateful meanness, so 
it seemed, which they could no longer guard against and prevent.   
Behind were others, teachers, it may be, who had taught ill, friends 
whose influence had failed.  And over the man, too&mdash;a multitude, but 
none that seemed to be parents or teachers! Faces that might once 
have been coarse, now purged to strength by sorrow! And in the  
fore-front one face, a girlish one, neither angry nor remorseful, but merely 
patient and weary, and, as it seemed to Plattner, waiting for relief.  
His powers of description fail him at the memory of this multitude 
of ghastly countenances.  They gathered on the stroke of the bell.  He 
saw them all in the space of a second.  It would seem that he was so 
worked on by his excitement that, quite involuntarily, his restless 
fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it 
before him.  But he does not remember that. 
</p><p>Abruptly the footsteps ceased.  He waited for the next, and there 
was silence, and then suddenly, cutting through the unexpected  
stillness like a keen, thin blade, came the first stroke of the bell.  
At that 
 
<pb n="156"/>  
 
the multitudinous faces swayed to and fro and a louder crying began 
all about him.  The woman did not hear; she was burning something 
now in the candle flame.  At the second stroke everything grew dim, 
and a breath of wind, icy cold, blew through the host of watchers.  
They swirled about him like an eddy of dead leaves in the spring, 
and at the third stroke something was extended through them to the 
bed.  You have heard of a beam of light.  This was like a beam of 
darkness, and looking again at it, Plattner saw that it was a shadowy 
arm and hand. 
</p><p>The green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon, 
and the vision of the room was very faint.  Plattner could see that 
the white of the bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman 
looked round over her shoulder at it, startled. 
</p><p>The cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before 
the wind, and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the 
gorge.  Then suddenly Plattner understood the meaning of the  
shadowy black arm that stretched across his shoulder and clutched its 
prey.  He did not dare turn his head to see the Shadow behind the 
arm.  With a violent effort, and covering his eyes, he set himself 
to run, made, perhaps, twenty strides, then slipped on a boulder, and 
fell.  He fell forward on his hands; and the bottle smashed and  
exploded as he touched the ground. 
</p><p>In another moment he found himself, stunned and bleeding, sitting 
face to face with Lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school. 
 
</p><p>There the story of Plattner's experiences ends.  I have resisted, I 
believe successfully, the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to 
dress up incidents of this sort.  I have told the thing as far as possible 
in the order in which Plattner told it to me.  I have carefully avoided 
any attempt at style, effect, or construction.  It would have been easy, 
for instance, to have worked the scene of the death-bed into a kind 
of plot in which Plattner might have been involved.  But, quite apart 
from the objectionableness of falsifying a most extraordinary true 
story, any such trite devices would spoil, to my mind, the peculiar 
effect of this dark world, with its livid green illumination and its 
drifting Watchers of the Living, which, unseen and unapproachable 
to us, is yet lying all about us. 
</p><p>It remains to add, that a death did actually occur in Vincent  
Terrace, just beyond the school garden, and, so far as can be proved, 
at the moment of Plattner's return.  Deceased was a rate-collector and 
insurance agent.  His widow, who was much younger than himself, 
married last month a Mr. Whymper, a veterinary surgeon of Allbeeding.  
As the portion of this story given here has in various forms 
 
<pb n="157"/>  
 
circulated orally in Sussexville, she has consented to my use of her 
name, on condition that I make it distinctly known that she emphatically  
contradicts every detail of Plattner's account of her husband's 
last moments.  She burnt no will, she says, although Plattner never 
accused her of doing so; her husband made but one will, and that just 
after their marriage.  Certainly, from a man who had never seen it, 
Plattner's account of the furniture of the room was curiously accurate. 
</p><p>One other thing, even at the risk of an irksome repetition, I must 
insist upon, lest I seem to favour the credulous, superstitious view.  
Plattner's absence from the world for nine days is, I think, proved.  
But that does not prove his story.  It is quite conceivable that even 
outside space hallucinations may be possible.  That, at least, the 
reader must bear distinctly in mind.

<head>THE STRANGE ORCHID</head> 
 
<p>The buying of orchids always has in it a certain speculative flavour.  
You have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue, and for the 
rest you must trust your judgment, or the auctioneer, or your good-luck, as your taste may incline.  The plant may be moribund or dead, 
or it may be just a respectable purchase, fair value for your money, 
or perhaps&mdash;for the thing has happened again and again&mdash;there slowly 
unfolds before the delighted eyes of the happy purchaser, day after 
day, some new variety, some novel richness, a strange twist of the 
labellum, or some subtler colouration or unexpected mimicry.  Pride, 
beauty, and profit blossom together on one delicate green spike, and 
it may be, even immortality.  For the new miracle of Nature may 
stand in need of a new specific name, and what so convenient as that 
of its discoverer? "Johnsmithia"! There have been worse names. 
</p><p>It was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made 
Winter-Wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these sales&mdash;that 
hope, and also, maybe, the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest 
interest to do in the world.  He was a shy, lonely, rather ineffectual 
man, provided with just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity,  
and not enough nervous energy to make him seek any exacting 
employments.  He might have collected stamps or coins, or translated 
Horace, or bound books, or invented new species of diatoms.  But, 
as it happened, he grew orchids, and had one ambitious little  
hot-house. 
</p><p>"I have a fancy," he said over his coffee, "that something is going 
to happen to me to-day." He spoke&mdash;as he moved and thought&mdash; 
slowly. 
 
<pb n="159"/>  
 
</p><p>"Oh, don't say that!" said his housekeeper&mdash;who was also his remote 
cousin.  For "something happening" was a euphemism that meant only 
one thing to her. 
</p><p>"You misunderstand me.  I mean nothing unpleasant&mdash;though what 
I do mean I scarcely know. 
</p><p>"To-day," he continued after a pause, "Peters are going to sell a 
batch of plants from the Andamans and the Indies.  I shall go up 
and see what they have.  It may be I shall buy something good,  
unawares.  That may be it." 
</p><p>He passed his cup for his second cupful of coffee. 
</p><p>"Are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told 
me of the other day?" asked his cousin as she filled his cup. 
</p><p>"Yes," he said, and became meditative over a piece of toast. 
</p><p>"Nothing ever does happen to me," he remarked presently,  
beginning to think aloud.  "I wonder why? Things enough happen to 
other people.  There is Harvey.  Only the other week, on Monday he 
picked up sixpence, on Wednesday his chicks all had the staggers, on 
Friday his cousin came home from Australia, and on Saturday he 
broke his ankle.  What a whirl of excitement!&mdash;compared to me." 
</p><p>"I think I would rather be without so much excitement," said his 
housekeeper.  "It can't be good for you." 
</p><p>"I suppose it's troublesome.  Still&mdash;you see, nothing ever happens 
to me.  When I was a little boy I never had accidents.  I never fell in 
love as I grew up.  Never married&mdash;I wonder how it feels to have  
something happen to you, something really remarkable. 
</p><p>"That orchid-collector was only thirty-six&mdash;twenty years younger 
than myself&mdash;when he died.  And he had been married twice and divorced  
once; he had had malarial fever four times, and once he broke 
his thigh.  He killed a Malay once, and once he was wounded by a 
poisoned dart.  And in the end he was killed by jungle-leeches.  It 
must have all been very troublesome, but then it must have been 
very interesting, you know&mdash;except, perhaps, the leeches." 
</p><p>"I am sure it was not good for him," said the lady, with conviction. 
</p><p>"Perhaps not." And then Wedderburn looked at his watch.  
"Twentythree minutes past eight.  I am going up by the quarter to twelve train, 
so that there is plenty of time.  I think I shall wear my alpaca jacket 
&mdash;it is quite warm enough&mdash;and my grey felt hat and brown shoes.  I 
suppose&mdash;" 
</p><p>He glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden, 
and then nervously at his cousin's face. 
</p><p>"I think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to  
London," she said in a voice that admitted of no denial.  "There's all 
between here and the station coming back." 
 
<pb n="160"/>  
 
</p><p>When he returned he was in a state of mild excitement.  He had 
made a purchase.  It was rare that he could make up his mind 
quickly enough to buy, but this time he had done so. 
</p><p>"There are Vandas," he said, "and a Dendrobe and some Palaeonophis."  
He surveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup.  
They were laid out on the spotless tablecloth before him, and he was 
telling his cousin all about them as he slowly meandered through 
his dinner.  It was his custom to live all his visits to London over 
again in the evening for her and his own entertainment. 
</p><p>"I knew something would happen to-day.  And I have bought all 
these.  Some of them&mdash;some of them&mdash;I feel sure, do you know, that 
some of them will be remarkable.  I don't know how it is, but I feel 
just as sure as if some one had told me that some of these will turn 
out remarkable. 
</p><p>"That one"&mdash;he pointed to a shrivelled rhizome&mdash;"was not identified.  
It may be a Palaeonophis&mdash;or it may not.  It may be a new species, or 
even a new genus.  And it was the last that poor Batten ever collected." 
</p><p>"I don't like the look of it," said his housekeeper.  "It's such an ugly 
shape." 
</p><p>"To me it scarcely seems to have a shape." 
</p><p>"I don't like those things that stick out," said his housekeeper. 
</p><p>"It shall be put away in a pot to-morrow." 
</p><p>"It looks," said the housekeeper, "like a spider shamming dead." 
</p><p>Wedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one 
side.  "It is certainly not a pretty lump of stuff.  But you can never 
judge of these things from their dry appearance.  It may turn out 
to be a very beautiful orchid indeed.  How busy I shall be to-morrow! 
I must see tonight just exactly what to do with these things, and 
to-morrow I shall set to work. 
</p><p>"They found poor Batten lying dead, or dying, in a mangrove 
swamp&mdash;I forget which," he began again presently, "with one of these 
very orchids crushed up under his body.  He had been unwell for 
some days with some kind of native fever, and I suppose he fainted.  
These mangrove swamps are very unwholesome.  Every drop of blood, 
they say, was taken out of him by the jungle-leeches.  It may be that 
very plant that cost him his life to obtain." 
</p><p>"I think none the better of it for that." 
</p><p>"Men must work though women may weep," said Wedderburn, 
with profound gravity. 
</p><p>"Fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp! Fancy 
being ill of fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinine 
&mdash;if men were left to themselves they would live on chlorodyne and 
quinine&mdash;and no one round you but horrible natives! They say the 
 
<pb n="161"/>  
 
Andaman islanders are most disgusting wretches&mdash;and, anyhow, they 
can scarcely make good nurses, not having the necessary training.  And 
just for people in England to have orchids!" 
</p><p>"I don't suppose it was comfortable, but some men seem to enjoy 
that kind of thing," said Wedderburn.  "Anyhow, the natives of his 
party were sufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until 
his colleague, who was an ornithologist, came back again from the  
interior; though they could not tell the species of the orchid, and had 
let it wither.  And it makes these things more interesting." 
</p><p>"It makes them disgusting.  I should be afraid of some of the malaria 
clinging to them.  And just think, there has been a dead body lying 
across that ugly thing! I never thought of that before.  There! I  
declare I cannot eat another mouthful of dinner." 
</p><p>"I will take them off the table if you like, and put them in the 
window-seat.  I can see them just as well there." 
</p><p>The next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy 
little hothouse, fussing about with charcoal, lumps of teak, moss, and 
all the other mysteries of the orchid cultivator.  He considered he was 
having a wonderfully eventful time.  In the evening he would talk 
about these new orchids to his friends, and over and over again he 
reverted to his expectation of something strange. 
</p><p>Several of the Vandas and the Dendrobium died under his care, 
but presently the strange orchid began to show signs of life.  He was 
delighted, and took his housekeeper right away from jam-making to 
see it at once, directly he made the discovery. 
</p><p>"That is a bud," he said, "and presently there will be a lot of leaves 
there, and those little things coming out here are aerial rootlets." 
</p><p>"They look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown.  
I don't like them," said his housekeeper. 
</p><p>"Why not?" 
</p><p>"I don't know.  They look like fingers trying to get at you.  I can't 
help my likes and dislikes." 
</p><p>"I don't know for certain, but I don't think there are any orchids 
I know that have aerial rootlets quite like that.  It may be my fancy, 
of course.  You see they are a little flattened at the ends." 
</p><p>"I don't like 'em," said his housekeeper, suddenly shivering and 
turning away.  "I know it's very silly of me&mdash;and I'm very sorry,  
particularly as you like the thing so much.  But I can't help thinking of 
that corpse." 
</p><p>"But it may not be that particular plant.  That was merely a guess 
of mine." 
</p><p>His housekeeper shrugged her shoulders. 
</p><p>"Anyhow I don't like it," she said. 
 
<pb n="162"/>  
 
</p><p>Wedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant.  But that 
did not prevent his talking to her about orchids generally, and this 
orchid in particular, whenever he felt inclined. 
</p><p>"There are such queer things about orchids," he said one day; 
"such possibilities of surprises.  You know, Darwin studied their  
fertilisation, and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid-flower was contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen from 
plant to plant.  Well, it seems that there are lots of orchids known 
the flower of which cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that 
way.  Some of the Cypripediums, for instance; there are no insects 
known that can possibly fertilise them, and some of them have never 
been found with seed." 
</p><p>"But how do they form new plants?" 
</p><p>"By runners and tubers, and that kind of outgrowth.  That is easily 
explained.  The puzzle is, what are the flowers for? 
</p><p>"Very likely," he added, "my orchid may be something extraordinary  
in that way.  If so, I shall study it.  I have often thought of making 
researches as Darwin did.  But hitherto I have not found the time, 
or something else has happened to prevent it.  The leaves are  
beginning to unfold now.  I do wish you would come and see them!" 
</p><p>But she said that the orchid-house was so hot it gave her the  
headache.  She had seen the plant once again, and the aerial rootlets, 
which were now some of them more than a foot long, had unfortunately  
reminded her of tentacles reaching out after something; and 
they got into her dreams, growing after her with incredible rapidity.  
So that she had settled to her entire satisfaction that she would not 
see that plant again, and Wedderburn had to admire its leaves alone.  
They were of the ordinary broad form, and a deep glossy green, with 
splashes and dots of deep red towards the base.  He knew of no other 
leaves quite like them.  The plant was placed on a low bench near 
the thermometer, and close by was a simple arrangement by which a 
tap dripped on the hot-water pipes and kept the air steamy.  And he 
spent his afternoons now with some regularity meditating on the 
approaching flowering of this strange plant. 
</p><p>And at last the great thing happened.  Directly he entered the little 
glass house he knew that the spike had burst out, although his great 
Palaeonophis Lowii hid the corner where his new darling stood.  There 
was a new odour in the air, a rich, intensely sweet scent, that over-powered every other in that crowded, steaming little greenhouse. 
</p><p>Directly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid.  
And, behold! the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes 
of blossom, from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded.  He 
stopped before them in an ecstasy of admiration. 
 
<pb n="163"/>  
 
</p><p>The flowers were white, with streaks of golden orange upon the 
petals; the heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection, 
and a wonderful bluish purple mingled there with the gold.  He could 
see at once that the genus was altogether a new one.  And the  
insufferable scent! How hot the place was! The blossoms swam before his 
eyes. 
</p><p>He would see if the temperature was right.  He made a step towards 
the thermometer.  Suddenly everything appeared unsteady.  The bricks 
on the floor were dancing up and down.  Then the white blossoms, 
the green leaves behind them, the whole greenhouse, seemed to 
sweep sideways, and then in a curve upward. 
 
</p><p>At half-past four his cousin made the tea, according to their  
invariable custom.  But Wedderburn did not come in for his tea. 
</p><p>"He is worshipping that horrid orchid," she told herself, and 
waited ten minutes.  "His watch must have stopped.  I will go and 
call him." 
</p><p>She went straight to the hothouse, and, opening the door, called 
his name.  There was no reply.  She noticed that the air was very 
close, and loaded with an intense perfume.  Then she saw something 
lying on the bricks between the hot-water pipes. 
</p><p>For a minute, perhaps, she stood motionless. 
</p><p>He was lying, face upward, at the foot of the strange orchid.  The 
tentacle-like aerial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air, but were 
crowded together, a tangle of grey ropes, and stretched tight with 
their ends closely applied to his chin and neck and hands. 
</p><p>She did not understand.  Then she saw from under one of the  
exultant tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood. 
</p><p>With an inarticulate cry she ran towards him, and tried to pull 
him away from the leech-like suckers.  She snapped two of these 
tentacles, and their sap dripped red. 
</p><p>Then the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her 
head reel.  How they clung to him! She tore at the tough ropes, and 
he and the white inflorescence swam about her.  She felt she was  
fainting, knew she must not.  She left him and hastily opened the nearest 
door, and, after she had panted for a moment in the fresh air, she had 
a brilliant inspiration.  She caught up a flower-pot and smashed in the 
windows at the end of the greenhouse.  Then she re-entered.  She 
tugged now with renewed strength at Wedderburn's motionless body, 
and brought the strange orchid crashing to the floor.  It still clung 
with the grimmest tenacity to its victim.  In a frenzy, she lugged it 
and him into the open air. 
</p><p>Then she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by 
 
<pb n="164"/>  
 
one,  and in another minute she had released him and was dragging 
him away from the horror. 
</p><p>He was white and bleeding from a dozen circular patches. 
</p><p>The odd-job man was coming up the garden, amazed at the  
smashing of glass, and saw her emerge, hauling the inanimate body with 
red-stained hands.  For a moment he thought impossible things. 
</p><p>"Bring some water!" she cried, and her voice dispelled his fancies.  
When, with unnatural alacrity, he returned with the water, he found 
her weeping with excitement, and with Wedderburn's head upon her 
knee, wiping the blood from his face. 
</p><p>"What's the matter?" said Wedderburn, opening his eyes feebly, 
and closing them again at once. 
</p><p>"Go and tell Annie to come out here to me, and then go for Dr. 
Haddon at once," she said to the odd-job man so soon as he brought 
the water; and added, seeing he hesitated, "I will tell you all about 
it when you come back." 
</p><p>Presently Wedderburn opened his eyes again, and, seeing that he 
was troubled by the puzzle of his position, she explained to him, "You 
fainted in the hothouse." 
</p><p>"And the orchid?" 
</p><p>"I will see to that," she said. 
</p><p>Wedderburn had lost a good deal of blood, but beyond that he 
had suffered no very great injury.  They gave him brandy mixed with 
some pink extract of meat, and carried him upstairs to bed.  His  
housekeeper told her incredible  story in fragments to Dr. Haddon. 
"Come to the orchid-house and see," she said. 
</p><p>The cold outer air was blowing in through the open door, and 
the sickly perfume was almost dispelled.  Most of the torn aerial 
rootlets lay already withered amidst a number of dark stains upon 
the bricks.  The stem of the inflorescence was broken by the fall of 
the plant, and the flowers were growing limp and brown at the edges 
of the petals.  The doctor stooped towards it, then saw that one of the 
aerial rootlets still stirred feebly, and hesitated. 
</p><p>The next morning the strange orchid still lay there, black now and 
putrescent.  The door banged intermittingly in the morning breeze, 
and all the array of Wedderburn's orchids was shrivelled and  
prostrate.  But Wedderburn himself was bright and garrulous  
upstairs in the glory of his strange adventure.

<head>THE NEW ACCELERATOR</head> 
 
<p>Certainly, if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a 
pin it is my good friend Professor Gibberne.  I have heard before of 
investigators overshooting the mark, but never quite to the extent 
that he has done.  He has really, this time at any rate, without any 
touch of exaggeration in the phrase, found something to revolutionise 
human life.  And that when he was simply seeking an all-round 
nervous stimulant to bring languid people up to the stresses of these 
pushful days.  I have tasted the stuff now several times, and I cannot 
do better than describe the effect the thing had on me.  That there 
are astonishing experiences in store for all in search of new  
sensations will become apparent enough. 
</p><p>Professor Gibberne, as many people know, is my neighbour in 
Folkestone.  Unless my memory plays me a trick, his portrait at various 
ages has already appeared in The Strand Magazine&mdash;I think late in 
1899; but I am unable to look it up because I have lent that volume 
to some one who has never sent it back.  The reader may, perhaps, 
recall the high forehead and the singularly long black eyebrows 
that give such a Mephistophelian touch to his face.  He occupies one 
of those pleasant little detached houses in the mixed style that make 
the western end of the Upper Sandgate Road so interesting.  His is 
the one with the Flemish gables and the Moorish portico, and it is 
in the little room with the mullioned bay window that he works when 
he is down here, and in which of an evening we have so often smoked 
and talked together.  He is a mighty jester, but, besides, he likes to 
talk to me about his work; he is one of those men who find a help 
and stimulus in talking, and so I have been able to follow the  
conception 
<pb n="166"/>  
 
of the New Accelerator right up from a very early stage.  
Of course, the greater portion of his experimental work is not done 
in Folkestone, but in Gower Street, in the fine new laboratory next 
to the hospital that he has been the first to use. 
</p><p>As every one knows, or at least as all intelligent people know, the 
special department in which Gibberne has gained so great and deserved  
a reputation among physiologists is the action of drugs upon 
the nervous system.  Upon soporifics, sedatives, and anaesthetics he is, 
I am told, unequalled.  He is also a chemist of considerable eminence, 
and I suppose in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that 
centres about the ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little 
cleared places of his making, little glades of illumination, that, until 
he sees fit to publish his results, are still inaccessible to every other 
living man.  And in the last few years he has been particularly  
assiduous upon this question of nervous stimulants, and already, before 
the discovery of the New Accelerator, very successful with them.  
Medical science has to thank him for at least three distinct and absolutely  
safe invigorators of unrivalled value to practising men.  In 
cases of exhaustion the preparation known as Gibberne's B Syrup 
has, I suppose, saved more lives already than any lifeboat round the 
coast. 
</p><p>"But none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet," he told 
me nearly a year ago.  "Either they increase the central energy  
without affecting the nerves or they simply increase the available energy 
by lowering the nervous conductivity; and all of them are unequal 
and local in their operation.  One wakes up the heart and viscera 
and leaves the brain stupefied, one gets at the brain champagne  
fashion and does nothing good for the solar plexus, and what I want&mdash; 
and what, if it's an earthly possibility, I mean to have&mdash;is a stimulant 
that stimulates all round, that wakes you up for a time from the 
crown of your head to the tip of your great toe, and makes you 
go two&mdash;or even three to everybody else's one.  Eh? That's the thing 
I'm after." 
</p><p>"It would tire a man," I said. 
</p><p>"Not a doubt of it.  And you'd eat double or treble&mdash;and all that.  
But just think what the thing would mean.  Imagine yourself with 
a little phial like this"&mdash;he held up a little bottle of green glass and 
marked his points with it&mdash;"and in this precious phial is the power 
to think twice as fast, move twice as quickly, do twice as much work 
in a given time as you could otherwise do." 
</p><p>"But is such a thing possible?" 
</p><p>"I believe so.  If it isn't, I've wasted my time for a year.  These 
various preparations of the hypophosphites, for example, seem to 
 
<pb n="167"/>  
 
show that something of the sort . . . Even if it was only one and 
a half times as fast it would do." 
</p><p>"It would do," I said. 
</p><p>"If you were a statesman in a corner, for example, time rushing 
up against you, something urgent to be done, eh?" 
</p><p>"He could dose his private secretary," I said. 
</p><p>"And gain-double time.  And think if you, for example, wanted to 
finish a book." 
</p><p>"Usually," I said, "I wish I'd never begun 'em." 
</p><p>"Or a doctor, driven to death, wants to sit down and think out a 
case.  Or a barrister&mdash;or a man cramming for an examination." 
</p><p>"Worth a guinea a drop," said I, "and more&mdash;to men like that." 
</p><p>"And in a duel, again," said Gibberne, "where it all depends on 
your quickness in pulling the trigger." 
</p><p>"Or in fencing," I echoed. 
</p><p>"You see," said Gibberne, "if I get it as an all-round thing it will 
really do you no harm at all&mdash;except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree  
it brings you nearer old age.  You will just have lived twice to 
other people's once&mdash;" 
</p><p>"I suppose," I meditated, "in a duel&mdash;it would be fair?" 
</p><p>"That's a question for the seconds," said Gibberne. 
</p><p>I harked back further.  "And you really think such a thing is  
possible?" I said. 
</p><p>"As possible," said Gibberne, and glanced at something that went 
throbbing by the window, "as a motor-bus.  As a matter of fact&mdash;" 
</p><p>He paused and smiled at me deeply, and tapped slowly on the 
edge of his desk with the green phial.  "I think I know the stuff. . . . 
Already I've got something coming." The nervous smile upon his 
face betrayed the gravity of his revelation.  He rarely talked of his 
actual experimental work unless things were very near the end.  "And 
it may be, it may be&mdash;I shouldn't be surprised&mdash;it may even do the 
thing at a greater rate than twice." 
</p><p>"It will be rather a big thing," I hazarded. 
</p><p>"It will be, I think, rather a big thing." 
</p><p>But I don't think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be, for 
all that. 
</p><p>I remember we had several talks about the stuff after that.  "The 
New Accelerator" he called it, and his tone about it grew more 
confident on each occasion.  Sometimes he talked nervously of unexpected  
physiological results its use might have, and then he would 
get a little unhappy; at others he was frankly mercenary, and we  
debated long and anxiously how the preparation might be turned to 
commercial account.  "It's a good thing," said Gibberne, "a tremendous 
 
<pb n="168"/>  
 
thing.  I know I'm giving the world something, and I think it only 
reasonable we should expect the world to pay.  The dignity of science 
is all very well, but I think somehow I must have the monopoly of 
the stuff for, say, ten years. I don't see why all the fun in life should 
go to the dealers in ham." 
</p><p>My own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the 
time.  I have always had a queer little twist towards metaphysics in 
my mind.  I have always been given to paradoxes about space and 
time, and it seemed to me that Gibberne was really preparing no 
less than the absolute acceleration of life.  Suppose a man repeatedly 
dosed with such a preparation: he would live an active and record 
life indeed, but he would be an adult at eleven, middle-aged at 
twenty-five, and by thirty well on the road to senile decay.  It seemed 
to me that so far Gibberne was only going to do for any one who 
took his drug exactly what Nature has done for the Jews and Orientals,  
who are men in their teens and aged by fifty, and quicker in 
thought and act than we are all the time.  The marvel of drugs has 
always been great to my mind; you can madden a man, calm a man, 
make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log, quicken this 
passion and allay that, all by means of drugs, and here was a new 
miracle to be added to this strange armoury of phials the doctors 
use! But Gibberne was far too eager upon his technical points to 
enter very keenly into my aspect of the question. 
</p><p>It was the 7th or 8th of August when he told me the distillation 
that decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we 
talked, and it was on the 10th that he told me the thing was done 
and the New Accelerator a tangible reality in the world.  I met him 
as I was going up the Sandgate Hill towards Folkestone&mdash;I think 
I was going to get my hair cut, and he came hurrying down to meet 
me&mdash;I suppose he was coming to my house to tell me at once of his 
success.  I remember that his eyes were unusually bright and his face 
flushed, and I noted even the swift alacrity of his step. 
</p><p>"It's done," he cried, and gripped my hand, speaking very fast; 
"it's more than done.  Come up to my house and see." 
</p><p>"Really?" 
</p><p>"Really!" he shouted.  "Incredibly! Come up and see." 
</p><p>"And it does&mdash;twice?" 
</p><p>"It does more, much more.  It scares me.  Come up and see the 
stuff.  Taste it! Try it! It's the most amazing stuff on earth." He 
gripped my arm and, walking at such a pace that he forced me into 
a trot, went shouting with me up the hill.  A whole char-a-banc-ful of 
people turned and stared at us in unison after the manner of people 
in chars-a-banc.  It was one of those hot, clear days that Folkestone 
 
<pb n="169"/>  
 
sees so much of, every colour incredibly bright. and every outline hard.  
There was a breeze, of course, but not so much breeze as sufficed 
under these conditions to keep me cool and dry.  I panted for mercy. 
</p><p>"I'm not walking fast, am I?" cried Gibberne, and slackened his 
pace to a quick march. 
</p><p>"You've been taking some of this stuff," I puffed. 
</p><p>"No," he said.  "At the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker 
from which I had washed out the last traces of the stuff.  I took some 
last night, you know.  But that is ancient history, now." 
</p><p>"And it goes twice?" I said, nearing his doorway in a grateful  
perspiration. 
</p><p>"It goes a thousand times, many thousand times!" cried Gibberne, 
with a dramatic gesture, flinging open his Early English carved oak 
gate. 
</p><p>"Phew!" said I, and followed him to the door. 
</p><p>"I don't know how many times it goes," he said, with his latch-key 
in his hand. 
</p><p>"And you&mdash;" 
</p><p>"It throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology, it kicks the 
theory of vision into a perfectly new shape! . . . Heaven knows how 
many thousand times.  We'll try all that after&mdash; The thing is to try 
the stuff now." 
</p><p>"Try the stuff?" I said, as we went along the passage. 
</p><p>"Rather," said Gibberne, turning on me in his study.  "There it 
is in that little green phial there! Unless you happen to be afraid?" 
</p><p>I am a careful man by nature, and only theoretically adventurous. 
I was afraid.  But on the other hand there is pride. 
</p><p>"Well," I haggled.  "You say you've tried it?" 
</p><p>"I've tried it," he said, "and I don't look hurt by it, do I? I don't 
even look livery and I feel&mdash;" 
</p><p>I sat down.  "Give me the potion," I said.  "If the worst comes to 
the worst it will save having my hair cut, and that I think is one 
of the most hateful duties of a civilised man.  How do you take the 
mixture?" 
</p><p>"With water," said Gibberne, whacking down a carafe. 
</p><p>He stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy 
chair; his manner was suddenly affected by a touch of the Harley 
Street specialist.  "It's rum stuff, you know," he said. 
</p><p>I made a gesture with my hand. 
</p><p>"I must warn you in the first place as soon as you've got it down 
to shut your eyes, and open them very cautiously in a minute or so's 
time.  One still sees.  The sense of vision is a question of length of 
vibration, and not of multitude of impacts; but there's a kind of 
 
<pb n="170"/>  
 
shock to the retina, a nasty giddy confusion just at the time, if the 
eyes are open.  Keep 'em shut." 
</p><p>"Shut," I said.  "Good!" 
</p><p>"And the next thing is, keep still.  Don't begin to whack about.  You 
may fetch something a nasty rap if you do.  Remember you will be 
going several thousand times faster than you ever did before, heart, 
lungs, muscles, brain&mdash;everything&mdash;and you will hit hard without 
knowing it.  You won't know it, you know.  You'll feel just as you do 
now.  Only everything in the world will seem to be going ever so 
many thousand times slower that it ever went before.  That's what 
makes it so deuced queer." 
</p><p>"Lor'," I said.  "And you mean&mdash;" 
</p><p>"You'll see," said he, and took up a little measure.  He glanced 
at the material on his desk.  "Glasses," he said, "water.  All here.  
Mustn't take too much for the first attempt." 
</p><p>The little phial glucked out its precious contents.  "Don't forget 
what I told you," he said, turning the contents of the measure into 
a glass in the manner of an Italian waiter measuring whisky.  "Sit 
with the eyes tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes," 
he said.  "Then you will hear me speak." 
</p><p>He added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass.  
</p><p>"By-the-by," he said, "don't put your glass down.  Keep it in your 
hand and rest your hand on your knee.  Yes&mdash;so.  And now&mdash;" 
</p><p>He raised his glass. 
</p><p>"The New Accelerator," I said. 
</p><p>"The New Accelerator," he answered, and we touched glasses and 
drank, and instantly I closed my eyes. 
</p><p>You know that blank non-existence into which one drops when 
one has taken "gas." For an indefinite interval it was like that.  Then 
I heard Gibberne telling me to wake up, and I stirred and opened 
my eyes.  There he stood as he had been standing, glass still in hand.  
It was empty, that was all the difference. 
</p><p>"Well?" said I. 
</p><p>"Nothing out of the way?" 
</p><p>"Nothing.  A slight feeling of exhilaration, perhaps.  Nothing more." 
</p><p>"Sounds?" 
</p><p>"Things are still," I said.  "By Jove! yes! They are still.  Except 
the sort of faint pat, patter, like rain falling on different things.  
What is it?" 
</p><p>"Analysed sounds, I think he said, but I am not sure.  He glanced 
at the window.  "Have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed 
in that way before?" 
</p><p>I followed his eyes, and there was the end of the curtain, frozen, 
 
<pb n="171"/>  
 
as it were, corner high, in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze. 
</p><p>"No," said I; "that's odd." 
</p><p>"And here," he said, and opened the hand that held the glass.  
Naturally I winced, expecting the glass to smash.  But so far from 
smashing it did not even seem to stir; it hung in mid-air&mdash;motionless.  
"Roughly speaking," said Gibberne, "an object in these latitudes 
falls 16 feet in the first second.  This glass is falling 16 feet in a 
second now.  Only, you see, it hasn't been falling yet for the hundredth 
part of a second.  That gives you some idea of the pace of my Accelerator."  
And he waved his hand round and round, over and under 
the slowly sinking glass.  Finally he took it by the bottom, pulled it 
down, and placed it very carefully on the table.  "Eh?" he said to me, 
and laughed. 
</p><p>"That seems all right," I said, and began very gingerly to raise  
myself from my chair.  I felt perfectly well, very light and comfortable, 
and quite confident in my mind.  I was going fast all over.  My heart, 
for example, was beating a thousand times a second, but that caused 
me no discomfort at all.  I looked out of the window.  An immovable 
cyclist, head down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his driving-wheel, scorched to overtake a galloping char-a-banc that did not stir.  
I gaped in amazement at this incredible spectacle.  "Gibberne," I 
cried, "how long will this confounded stuff last?" 
</p><p>"Heaven knows!" he answered.  "Last time I took it I went to bed 
and slept it off.  I tell you, I was frightened.  It must have lasted some 
minutes, I think&mdash;it seemed like hours.  But after a bit it slows down 
rather suddenly, I believe." 
</p><p>I was proud to observe that I did not feel frightened&mdash;I suppose 
because there were two of us.  "Why shouldn't we go out?" I asked. 
</p><p>"Why not?" 
</p><p>"They'll see us." 
</p><p>"Not they.  Goodness, no! Why, we shall be going a thousand times 
faster than the quickest conjuring trick that was ever done.  Come 
along! Which way shall we go? Window, or door?" 
</p><p>And out by the window we went. 
</p><p>Assuredly of all the strange experiences that I have ever had, or 
imagined, or read of other people having or imagining, that little raid 
I made with Gibberne on the Folkestone Leas, under the influence 
of the New Accelerator, was the strangest and maddest of all.  We 
went out by his gate into the road, and there we made a minute 
examination of the statuesque passing traffic.  The tops of the wheels 
and some of the legs of the horses of this char-a-banc, the end of 
the whip-lash and the lower jaw of the conductor&mdash;who was just  
beginning to yawn&mdash;were perceptibly in motion, but all the rest of the 
 
<pb n="172"/>  
 
lumbering conveyance seemed still.  And quite noiseless except for 
a faint rattling that came from one man's throat! And as parts of 
this frozen edifice there were a driver, you know, and a conductor, and 
eleven people! The effect as we walked about the thing began by 
being madly queer, and ended by being&mdash;disagreeable.  There they 
were, people like ourselves and yet not like ourselves, frozen in careless 
attitudes, caught in mid-gesture.  A girl and a man smiled at one 
another, a leering smile that threatened to last for evermore; a woman 
in a floppy capelline rested her arm on the rail and stared at  
Gibberne's house with the unwinking stare of eternity; a man stroked 
his moustache like a figure of wax, and another stretched a tiresome 
stiff hand with extended fingers towards his loosened hat.  We stared 
at them, we laughed at them, we made faces at them, and then a sort 
of disgust of them came upon us, and we turned away and walked 
round in front of the cyclist towards the Leas. 
</p><p>"Goodness!" cried Gibberne, suddenly; "look there!" 
</p><p>He pointed, and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down 
the air with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an  
exceptionally languid snail&mdash;was a bee. 
</p><p>And so we came out upon the Leas.  There the thing seemed 
madder than ever.  The band was playing in the upper stand, though 
all the sound it made for us was a low-pitched, wheezy rattle, a sort 
of prolonged last sigh that passed at times into a sound like the slow, 
muffled ticking of some monstrous clock.  Frozen people stood erect, 
strange, silent, self-conscious-looking dummies hung unstably in  
midstride, promenading upon the grass.  I passed close to a little poodle 
dog suspended in the act of leaping, and watched the slow movement 
of his legs as he sank to the earth.  "Lord, look here!" cried Gibberne, 
and we halted for a moment before a magnificent person in white 
faint-striped flannels, white shoes, and a Panama hat, who turned back 
to wink at two gaily dressed ladies he had passed.  A wink, studied 
with such leisurely deliberation as we could afford, is an unattractive 
thing.  It loses any quality of alert gaiety, and one remarks that the 
winking eye does not completely close, that under its drooping lid 
appears the lower edge of an eyeball and a little line of white.  
"Heaven give me memory," said I, "and I will never wink again." 
</p><p>"Or smile," said Gibberne, with his eye on the lady's answering 
teeth. 
</p><p>"It's infernally hot, somehow," said I. "Let's go slower." 
</p><p>"Oh, come along!" said Gibberne. 
</p><p>We picked our way among the bath-chairs in the path.  Many of 
the people sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive 
poses, but the contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful 
 
<pb n="173"/>  
 
thing to see.  A purple-faced little gentleman was frozen in the midst of 
a violent struggle to refold his newspaper against the wind; there 
were many evidences that all these people in their sluggish way 
were exposed to a considerable breeze, a breeze that had no existence 
so far as our sensations went.  We came out and walked a little way 
from the crowd, and turned and regarded it.  To see all that  
multitude changed to a picture, smitten rigid, as it were, into the 
semblance of realistic wax, was impossibly wonderful.  It was absurd, 
of course; but it filled me with an irrational, an exultant sense of 
superior advantage.  Consider the wonder of it! All that I had said, 
and thought, and done since the stuff had begun to work in my 
veins had happened, so far as those people, so far as the world in 
general went, in the twinkling of an eye.  "The New Accelerator&mdash;" 
I began, but Gibberne interrupted me. 
</p><p>"There's that infernal old woman!" he said.  
</p><p>"What old woman?" 
</p><p>"Lives next door to me," said Gibberne.  "Has a lapdog that yaps.  
Gods! The temptation is strong!" 
</p><p>There is something very boyish and impulsive about Gibberne at 
times.  Before I could expostulate with him he had dashed forward, 
snatched the unfortunate animal out of visible existence, and was 
running violently with it towards the cliff of the Leas.  It was most 
extraordinary.  The little brute, you know, didn't bark or wriggle or 
make the slightest sign of vitality.  It kept quite stiffly in an attitude 
of somnolent repose, and Gibberne held it by the neck.  It was like 
running about with a dog of wood.  "Gibberne," I cried, "put it 
down!" Then I said something else.  "If you run like that, Gibberne," 
I cried, "you'll set your clothes on fire.  Your linen trousers are 
going brown as it is!" 
</p><p>He clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge.  
"Gibberne," I cried, coming up, "put it down.  This heat is too much! 
It's our running so! Two or three miles a second! Friction of the air!" 
</p><p>"What?" he said, glancing at the dog. 
</p><p>"Friction of the air," I shouted.  "Friction of the air.  Going too fast.  
Like meteorites and things.  Too hot.  And, Gibberne! Gibberne! 
I'm all over pricking and a sort of perspiration.  You can see people 
stirring slightly.  I believe the stuff's working off! Put that dog down." 
</p><p>"Eh?" he said. 
</p><p>"It's working off," I repeated.  "We're too hot and the stuff's working 
off! I'm wet through." 
</p><p>He stared at me.  Then at the band, the wheezy rattle of whose 
performance was certainly going faster.  Then with a tremendous 
sweep of the arm he hurled the dog away from him and it went 
 
<pb n="174"/>  
 
spinning upward, still inanimate, and hung at last over the grouped 
parasols of a knot of chattering people.  Gibberne was gripping my 
elbow.  "By Jove!" he cried.  "I believe it is! A sort of hot pricking 
and&mdash;yes.  That man's moving his pocket-handkerchief! Perceptibly.  
We must get out of this sharp." 
</p><p>But we could not get out of it sharply enough.  Luckily, perhaps! 
For we might have run, and if we had run we should, I believe, have 
burst into flames.  Almost certainly we should have burst into flames! 
You know we had neither of us thought of that. . . . But before 
we could even begin to run the action of the drug had ceased.  It was 
the business of a minute fraction of a second.  The effect of the 
New Accelerator passed like the drawing of a curtain, vanished in the 
movement of a hand.  I heard Gibberne's voice in infinite alarm.  
"Sit down," he said, and flop, down upon the turf at the edge of the 
Leas I sat&mdash;scorching as I sat.  There is a patch of burnt grass there 
still where I sat down.  The whole stagnation seemed to wake up as 
I did so, the disarticulated vibration of the band rushed together 
into a blast of music, the promenaders put their feet down and 
walked their ways, the papers and flags began flapping, smiles passed 
into words, the winker finished his wink and went on his way  
complacently, and all the seated people moved and spoke. 
</p><p>The whole world had come alive again, was going as fast as we 
were, or rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world.  
It was like slowing down as one comes into a railway station. 
Everything seemed to spin round for a second or two, I had the most 
transient feeling of nausea, and that was all.  And the little dog which 
had seemed to hang for a moment when the force of Gibberne's arm 
was expended fell with a swift acceleration clean through a lady's 
parasol! 
</p><p>That was the saving of us.  Unless it was for one corpulent old 
gentleman in a bath-chair, who certainly did start at the sight of us 
and afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye, 
and, finally, I believe, said something to his nurse about us, I doubt 
if a solitary person remarked our sudden appearance among them.  
Plop! We must have appeared abruptly.  We ceased to smoulder 
almost at once, though the turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot.  
The attention of every one&mdash;including even the Amusements' Association  
band, which on this occasion, for the only time in its history, 
got out of tune&mdash;was arrested by the amazing fact, and the still more 
amazing yapping and uproar caused by the fact that a respectable, 
over-fed lap-dog sleeping quietly to the east of the bandstand should 
suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the west&mdash;in a slightly 
singed condition due to the extreme velocity of its movements through 
 
<pb n="175"/>  
 
the air.  In these absurd days, too, when we are all trying to be as 
psychic, and silly, and superstitious as possible! People got up and 
trod on other people, chairs were overturned, the Leas policeman 
ran.  How the matter settled itself I do not know&mdash;we were much 
too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of 
range of the eye of the old gentleman in the bath-chair to make 
minute inquiries.  As soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently 
recovered from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do 
so we stood up and, skirting the crowd, directed our steps back along 
the road below the Metropole towards Gibberne's house.  But amidst 
the din I heard very distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting 
beside the lady of the ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable 
threats and language to one of those chair-attendants who have  
"Inspector" written on their caps.  "If you didn't throw the dog," he said, 
"who did?" 
</p><p>The sudden return of movement and familiar noises, and our 
natural anxiety about ourselves (our clothes were still dreadfully hot, 
and the fronts of the thighs of Gibberne's white trousers were 
scorched a drabbish brown), prevented the minute observations I 
should have liked to make on all these things.  Indeed, I really made 
no observations of any scientific value on that return.  The bee, of 
course, had gone.  I looked for that cyclist, but he was already out of 
sight as we came into the Upper Sandgate Road or hidden from us 
by traffic; the char-a-banc, however, with its people now all alive 
and stirring, was clattering along at a spanking pace almost abreast 
of the nearer church. 
</p><p>We noted, however, that the window-sill on which we had stepped 
in getting out of the house was slightly singed, and that the  
impressions of our feet on the gravel of the path were unusually deep. 
 
</p><p>So it was I had my first experience of the New Accelerator.   
Practically we had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of 
things in the space of a second or so of time.  We had lived half an 
hour while the band had played, perhaps, two bars.  But the effect it 
had upon us was that the whole world had stopped for our convenient  
inspection.  Considering all things, and particularly considering 
our rashness in venturing out of the house, the experience might 
certainly have been much more disagreeable than it was.  It showed, 
no doubt, that Gibberne has still much to learn before his preparation  
is a manageable convenience, but its practicability it certainly 
demonstrated beyond all cavil. 
</p><p>Since that adventure he has been steadily bringing its use under 
control, and I have several times, and without the slightest bad result, 
 
<pb n="176"/>  
 
taken measured doses under his direction; though I must confess I 
have not yet ventured abroad again while under its influence.  I may 
mention, for example, that this story has been written at one sitting 
and without interruption, except for the nibbling of some chocolate, 
by its means.  I began at 6:25, and my watch is now very nearly at 
the minute past the half-hour.  The convenience of securing a long, 
uninterrupted spell of work in the midst of a day full of engagements 
cannot be exaggerated.  Gibberne is now working at the quantitative 
handling of his preparation, with especial reference to its distinctive 
effects upon different types of constitution.  He then hopes to find a 
Retarder with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency.  
The Retarder will, of course, have the reverse effect to the Accelerator; 
used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over 
many hours of ordinary time, and so to maintain an apathetic 
inaction, a glacier-like absence of alacrity, amidst the most animated 
or irritating surroundings.  The two things together must necessarily 
work an entire revolution in civilised existence.  It is the beginning 
of our escape from that Time Garment of which Carlyle speaks.  
While this Accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with 
tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our 
utmost sense and vigour, the Retarder will enable us to pass in passive 
tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium.  Perhaps I am a 
little optimistic about the Retarder, which has indeed still to be 
discovered, but about the Accelerator there is no possible sort of 
doubt whatever.  Its appearance upon the market in a convenient, 
controllable, and assimilable form is a matter of the next few 
months.  It will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists, in small 
green bottles, at a high but, considering its extraordinary qualities, 
by no means excessive price.  Gibberne's Nervous Accelerator it will 
be called, and he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths: one 
in 200, one in 900, and one in 2000, distinguished by yellow, pink, 
and white labels respectively. 
</p><p>No doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary 
things possible; for, of course, the most remarkable and, possibly, 
even criminal proceedings may be effected with impunity by thus 
dodging, as it were, into the interstices of time.  Like all potent  
preparations it will be liable to abuse.  We have, however, discussed this 
aspect of the question very thoroughly, and we have decided that 
this is purely a matter of medical jurisprudence and altogether outside 
our province.  We shall manufacture and sell the Accelerator, and, 
as for the consequences&mdash;we shall see.

<head>THE DIAMOND MAKER</head> 
 
<p>Some business had detained me in Chancery Lane until nine in 
the evening, and thereafter, having some inkling of a headache, I was 
disinclined either for entertainment or further work.  So much of the 
sky as the high cliffs of that narrow canyon of traffic left visible spoke 
of a serene night, and I determined to make my way down to the  
Embankment, and rest my eyes and cool my head by watching the  
variegated lights upon the river.  Beyond comparison the night is the 
best time for this place; a merciful darkness hides the dirt of the 
waters, and the lights of this transition age, red, glaring orange, 
gas-yellow, and electric white, are set in shadowy outlines of every 
possible shade between grey and deep purple.  Through the arches of 
Waterloo Bridge a hundred points of light mark the sweep of the 
Embankment and above its parapet rise the towers of Westminster, 
warm grey against the starlight.  The black river goes by with only a 
rare ripple breaking its silence, and disturbing the reflections of the 
lights that swim upon its surface. 
</p><p>"A warm night," said a voice at my side. 
</p><p>I turned my head, and saw the profile of a man who was leaning 
over the parapet beside me.  It was a refined face, not unhandsome, 
though pinched and pale enough, and the coat collar turned up and 
pinned round the throat marked his status in life as sharply as a 
uniform.  I felt I was committed to the price of a bed and breakfast 
if I answered him. 
</p><p>I looked at him curiously.  Would he have anything to tell me 
worth the money, or was he the common incapable&mdash;incapable even 
of telling his own story? There was a quality of intelligence in his 
 
<pb n="178"/>  
 
forehead and eyes, and a certain tremulousness in his nether lip that 
decided me. 
</p><p>"Very warm," said I; "but not too warm for us here." 
</p><p>"No," he said, still looking across the water, "it is pleasant enough 
here . . . just now. 
</p><p>"It is good," he continued after a pause, "to find anything so 
restful as this in London.   After one has been fretting about business 
all day, about getting on, meeting obligations, and parrying dangers, 
I do not know what one would do if it were not for such pacific 
corners." He spoke with long pauses between the sentences.  "You 
must know a little of the irksome labour of the world, or you would 
not be here.  But I doubt if you can be so brain-weary and footsore 
as I am . . . Bah! Sometimes I doubt if the game is worth the candle.  
I feel inclined to throw the whole thing over&mdash;name, wealth, and 
position&mdash;and take to some modest trade.  But I know if I abandoned 
my ambition&mdash;hardly as she uses me&mdash;I should have nothing but  
remorse left for the rest of my days." 
</p><p>He became silent.  I looked at him in astonishment.  If ever I saw 
a man hopelessly hard-up it was the man in front of me.  He was 
ragged and he was dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as though 
he had been left in a dust-bin for a week.  And he was talking to me 
of the irksome worries of a large business.  I almost laughed outright.  
Either he was mad or playing a sorry jest on his own poverty. 
</p><p>"If high aims and high positions,", said I, "have their drawbacks of 
hard work and anxiety, they have their compensations. influence, the 
power of doing good, of assisting those weaker and poorer than our-selves;  
and there is even a certain gratification in display . . . ." 
</p><p>My banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste.  I spoke 
on the spur of the contrast of his appearance and speech.  I was sorry 
even while I was speaking. 
</p><p>He turned a haggard but very composed face upon me.  Said he: 
"I forget myself.  Of course you would not understand." 
</p><p>He measured me for a moment.  "No doubt it is very absurd.  You 
will not believe me even when I tell you, so that it is fairly safe to 
tell you.  And it will be a comfort to tell someone.  I really have a big 
business in hand, a very big business.  But there are troubles just now.  
The fact is . . . I make diamonds." 
</p><p>"I suppose," said I, "you are out of work just at present?" 
</p><p>"I am sick of being disbelieved," he said impatiently, and suddenly 
unbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little canvas bag that 
was hanging by a cord round his neck.  From this he produced a 
brown pebble.  "I wonder if you know enough to know what that 
is?" He handed it to me. 
 
<pb n="179"/>  
 
</p><p>Now, a year or so ago, I had occupied my leisure in taking a  
London science degree, so that I have a smattering of physics and  
mineralogy.  The thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the darker sort, 
though far too large, being almost as big as the top of my thumb.  
I took it, and saw it had the form of a regular octahedron, with the 
curved faces peculiar to the most precious of minerals.  I took out 
my penknife and tried to scratch it&mdash;vainly.  Leaning forward towards 
the gas-lamp, I tried the thing on my watch-glass, and scored a white 
line across that with the greatest ease. 
</p><p>I looked at my interlocutor with rising curiosity.  "It certainly is 
rather like a diamond.  But, if so, it is a Behemoth of diamonds.  
Where did you get it?" 
</p><p>"I tell you I made it," he  said.  "Give it back to me." 
</p><p>He replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket.  "I will sell it you for 
one hundred pounds," he suddenly whispered eagerly.  With that 
my suspicions returned.  The thing might, after all, be merely a lump 
of that almost equally hard substance, corundum, with an accidental 
resemblance in shape to the diamond.  Or if it was a diamond, how 
came he by it, and why should he offer it at a hundred pounds? 
</p><p>We looked into one another's eye.  He seemed eager, but honestly 
eager.  At that moment I believed it was a diamond he was trying to 
sell.  Yet I am a poor man, a hundred pounds would leave a visible 
gap in my fortunes and no sane man would buy a diamond by gas-light  
from a ragged tramp on his personal warranty only.  Still, 
a diamond that size conjured up a vision of many thousands of 
pounds.  Then, thought I, such a stone could scarcely exist without 
being mentioned in every book on gems, and again I called to mind 
the stories of contraband and lightfingered Kaffirs at the Cape.  I put 
the question of purchase on one side. 
</p><p>"How did you get it?" said I. 
</p><p>"I made it." 
</p><p>I had heard something of Moissan, but I knew his artificial  
diamonds were very small.  I shook my head. 
</p><p>"You seem to know something of this kind of thing.  I will tell you 
a little about myself.  Perhaps then you may think better of the 
purchase." He turned round with his back to the river, and put his 
hands in his pockets.  He sighed.  "I know you will not believe me. 
</p><p>"Diamonds," he began&mdash;and as he spoke his voice lost its faint 
flavour of the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an 
educated man&mdash;"are to be made by throwing carbon out of combination  
in a suitable flux and under a suitable pressure; the carbon 
crystallises out, not as black-lead or charcoal-powder, but as small  
diamonds.  So much has been known to chemists for years, but no one 
 
<pb n="180"/>  
 
yet has hit upon exactly the right flux in which to melt up the carbon, 
or exactly the right pressure for the best results.  Consequently the 
diamonds made by chemists are small and dark, and worthless as 
jewels.  Now I, you know, have given up my life to this problem&mdash; 
given my life to it. 
</p><p>"I began to work at the conditions of diamond making when I was 
seventeen, and now I am thirty-two.  It seemed to me that it might 
take all the thought and energies of a man for ten years, or twenty 
years, but even if it did, the game was still worth the candle.  Suppose 
one to have at last just hit the right trick, before the secret got out 
and diamonds became as common as coal, one might realise millions.  
Millions!" 
</p><p>He paused and looked for my sympathy.  His eyes shone hungrily.  
"To think," said he, "that I am on the verge of it all, and here! 
</p><p>"I had," he proceeded, "about a thousand pounds when I was 
twenty-one, and this, I thought, eked out by a little teaching, would 
keep my researches going.  A year or two was spent in study, at Berlin 
chiefly, and then I continued on my own account.  The trouble was 
the secrecy.  You see, if once I had let out what I was doing, other 
men might have been spurred on by my belief in the practicability 
of the idea; and I do not pretend to be such a genius as to have been 
sure of coming in first, in the case of a race for the discovery.  And 
you see it was important that if I really meant to make a pile, people 
should not know it was an artificial process and capable of turning 
out diamonds by the ton.  So I had to work all alone.  At first I had 
a little laboratory, but as my resources began to run out I had to 
conduct my experiments in a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish 
Town, where I slept at last on a straw mattress on the floor among all 
my apparatus.  The money simply flowed away.  I grudged myself 
everything except scientific appliances.  I tried to keep things going by 
a little teaching, but I am not a very good teacher, and I have no  
university degree, nor very much education except in chemistry, and I 
found I had to give a lot of time and labour for precious little money.  
But I got nearer and nearer the thing.  Three years ago I settled 
the problem of the composition of the flux, and got near the pressure 
by putting this flux of mine and a certain carbon composition into 
a closed-up gun-barrel, filling up with water, sealing tightly, and  
heating." 
</p><p>He paused. 
</p><p>"Rather risky," said I. 
</p><p>"Yes.  It burst, and smashed all my windows and a lot of my  
apparatus; but I got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless.  Following 
out the problem of getting a big pressure upon the molten mixture 
 
<pb n="181"/>  
 
from which the things were to crystallise, I hit upon some researches 
of Daubree's at the Paris Laboratorie des Poudres et Salpetres.  He 
exploded dynamite in a tightly screwed steel cylinder, too strong 
to burst, and I found he could crush rocks into a muck not unlike 
the South African bed in which diamonds are found.  It was a tremendous  
strain on my resources, but I got a steel cylinder made for 
my purpose after his pattern.  I put in all my stuff and my explosives, 
built up a fire in my furnace, put the whole concern in, and&mdash;went 
out for a walk." 
</p><p>I could not help laughing at his matter-of-fact manner.  "Did you not 
think it would blow up the house? Were there other people in the 
place?" 
</p><p>"It was in the interest of science," he said, ultimately.  "There was 
a coster-monger family on the floor below, a begging-letter writer in 
the room behind mine, and two flower-women were upstairs.  Perhaps 
it was a bit thoughtless.  But possibly some of them were out. 
</p><p>"When I came back the thing was just where I left it, among the 
white-hot coals.  The explosive hadn't burst the case.  And then I had 
a problem to face.  You know time is an important element in  
crystallisation.  If you hurry the process the crystals  
are small&mdash;it is only by prolonged standing that they grow to any size.   
I resolved to let this apparatus cool for two years, letting  
the temperature go down slowly during that time.  And I was now  
quite out of money; and with a big fire and the rent of my room,  
as well as my hunger to satisfy, I had scarcely a penny in the world. 
</p><p>"I can hardly tell you all the shifts I was put to while I was making 
the diamonds.  I have sold newspapers, held horses, opened cab-doors.  
For many weeks I addressed envelopes.  I had a place as assistant to 
a man who owned a barrow, and used to call down one side of the 
road while he called down the other.  Once for a week I had absolutely 
nothing to do, and I begged.  What a week that was! One day the fire 
was going out and I had eaten nothing all day, and a little chap 
taking his girl out gave me sixpence&mdash;to show-off.  Thank heaven for 
vanity! How the fish-shops smelt! But I went and spent it all on coals, 
and had the furnace bright red again, and then&mdash;Well, hunger 
makes a fool of a man. 
</p><p>"At last, three weeks ago, I let the fire out.  I took my cylinder 
and unscrewed it while it was still so hot that it punished my hands, 
and I scraped out the crumbling lava-like mass with a chisel, and 
hammered it into a powder upon an iron plate.  And I found three 
big diamonds and five small ones.  As I sat on the floor hammering, my 
door opened, and my neighbour, the begging-letter writer, came in.  
He was drunk&mdash;as he usually is.  "Nerchist,' said he.  'You're drunk,' 
 
<pb n="182"/>  
 
said I. "Structive scoundrel,' said he.  'Go to your father,' said I, 
meaning the Father of Lies.  'Never you mind,' said he, and gave me 
a cunning wink, and hiccuped, and leaning up against the door, with 
his other eye against the door-post, began to babble of how he had 
been prying in my room, and how he had gone to the police that 
morning, and how they had taken down everything he had to say&mdash; 
"siffiwas a ge'm,' said he.  Then I suddenly realised I was in a hole.  
Either I should have to tell these police my little secret, and get 
the whole thing blown upon, or be lagged as an Anarchist.  So I went 
up to my neighbour and took him by the collar, and rolled him 
about a bit, and then I gathered up my diamonds and cleared out.  
The evening newspapers called my den the Kentish-Town Bomb 
Factory.  And now I cannot part with the things for love or money. 
</p><p>"If I go in to respectable jewellers they ask me to wait, and go 
and whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I cannot 
wait.  And I found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he simply 
stuck to the one I gave him and told me to prosecute if I wanted it 
back.  I am going about now with several hundred thousand pounds' 
worth of diamonds round my neck, and without either food or shelter.  
You are the first person I have taken into my confidence.  But I like 
your face and I am hard-driven." 
</p><p>He looked into my eyes. 
</p><p>"It would be madness," said I, "for me to buy a diamond under 
the circumstances.  Besides, I do not carry hundreds of pounds about 
in my pocket.  Yet I more than half believe your story.  I will,   if you 
like, do this: come to my office to-morrow. . . ." 
</p><p>"You think I am a thief!" said he keenly.  "You will tell the police.  
I am not coming into a trap." 
</p><p>"Somehow I am assured you are no thief.  Here is my card.  Take 
that, anyhow.  You need not come to any appointment.  Come when 
you will." 
</p><p>He took the card, and an earnest of my good will. 
</p><p>"Think better of it and come," said I. 
</p><p>He shook his head doubtfully.  "I will pay back your half-crown 
with interest some day&mdash;such interest as will amaze you," said he.  
"Anyhow, you will keep the secret? . . .  Don't follow me." 
</p><p>He crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the little 
steps under the archway leading into Essex Street, and I let him go.  
And that was the last I ever saw of him. 
</p><p>Afterwards I had two letters from him asking me to send banknotes&mdash; 
not cheques&mdash;to certain addresses.  I weighed the matter over, 
and took what I conceived to be the wisest course.  Once he called 
upon me when I was out.  My urchin described him as a very thin, 
 
<pb n="183"/>  
 
dirty, and ragged man, with a dreadful cough.  He left no message.  
That was the finish of him so far as my story goes.  I wonder  
sometimes what has become of him.  Was he an ingenious monomaniac, or 
a fraudulent dealer in pebbles, or has he really made diamonds as he 
asserted? The latter is just sufficiently credible to make me think at 
times that I have missed the most brilliant opportunity of my life.  He 
may of course be dead, and his diamonds carelessly thrown aside&mdash; 
one, I repeat, was almost as big as my thumb.  Or he may be still 
wandering about trying to sell the things.  It is just possible he may 
yet emerge upon society, and, passing athwart my heavens in the 
serene altitude sacred to the wealthy and the well-advertised, reproach 
me silently for my want of enterprise.  I sometimes think I might at 
least have risked five pounds.

<p>"I must get rid of it," said the man in the corner of the carriage, 
abruptly breaking the silence. 
</p><p>Mr. Hinchcliff looked up, hearing imperfectly.  He had been 
lost in the rapt contemplation of the college cap tied by a string to 
his portmanteau handles&mdash;the outward and visible sign of his newly-gained pedagogic position&mdash;in the rapt appreciation of the college cap 
and the pleasant anticipations it excited.  For Mr. Hinchcliff had 
just matriculated at London University, and was going to be junior 
assistant at the Holmwood Grammar School&mdash;a very enviable position.  
He stared across the carriage at his fellow-traveller. 
</p><p>"Why not give it away?" said this person.  "Give it away! Why not?" 
</p><p>He was a tall, dark, sunburnt man with a pale face.  His arms 
were folded tightly, and his feet were on the scat in front of him.  
He was pulling at a lank, black moustache.  He stared hard at his 
toes. 
</p><p>"Why not?" he said. 
</p><p>Mr. Hinchcliff coughed. 
</p><p>The stranger lifted his eyes&mdash;they were curious, dark-grey eyes&mdash; 
and stared blankly at Mr. Hinchcliff for the best part of a minute, 
perhaps.  His expression grew to interest. 
</p><p>"Yes," he said slowly.  "Why not? And end it." 
</p><p>"I don't quite follow you, I'm afraid," said Mr. Hinchcliff, with 
another cough. 
</p><p>"You don't quite follow me?" said the stranger, quite mechanically, 
his singular eyes wandering from Mr. Hinchcliff to the bag with its 
ostentatiously displayed cap, and back to Mr. Hinchcliff's downy face. 
 
<pb n="185"/>  
 
</p><p>"You're so abrupt, you know," apologised Mr. Hinchcliff. 
</p><p>"Why shouldn't I?" said the stranger, following his thoughts.  "You 
are a student?" he said, addressing Mr. Hinchcliff. 
</p><p>"I am&mdash;by Correspondence&mdash;of the London University," said Mr. 
Hinchcliff, with irrepressible pride, and feeling nervously at his tie. 
</p><p>"In pursuit of knowledge," said the stranger, and suddenly took 
his feet off the seat, put his fist on his knees, and stared at Mr. 
Hinchcliff as though he had never seen a student before.  "Yes," he 
said, and flung out an index finger.  Then he rose, took a bag from 
the hat-rack, and unlocked it.  Quite silently, he drew out something 
round and wrapped in a quantity of silver-paper, and unfolded this 
carefully.  He held it out towards Mr. Hinchcliff,&mdash;a small, very smooth, 
golden-yellow fruit. 
</p><p>Mr. Hinchcliff's eyes and mouth were open.  He did not offer to take 
this object&mdash;if he was intended to take it. 
</p><p>"That," said this fantastic stranger, speaking very slowly, "is the 
Apple of the Tree of Knowledge.  Look at it&mdash;small, and bright, and 
wonderful&mdash;Knowledge&mdash;and I am going to give it to you." 
</p><p>Mr. Hinchcliff's mind worked painfully for a minute, and then the 
sufficient explanation, "Mad!" flashed across his brain, and illuminated 
the whole situation.  One humoured madmen.  He put his head a little 
on one side. 
</p><p>"The Apple of the Tree of Knowledge, eigh!" said Mr. Hinchcliff, 
regarding it with a finely assumed air of interest, and then looking 
at the interlocutor.  "But don't you want to eat it yourself? And 
besides&mdash;how did you come by it?" 
</p><p>"It never fades.  I have had it now three months.  And it is ever 
bright and smooth and ripe and desirable, as you see it." He laid 
his hand on his knee and regarded the fruit musingly.  Then he began 
to wrap it again in the papers, as though he had abandoned his  
intention of giving it away. 
</p><p>"But how did you come by it?" said Mr. Hinchcliff, who had his 
argumentative side.  "And how do you know that it is the Fruit of 
the Tree?" 
</p><p>"I bought this fruit," said the stranger, "three months ago&mdash;for a 
drink of water and a crust of bread.  The man who gave it to me&mdash; 
because I kept the life in him&mdash;was an Armenian.  Armenia! that 
wonderful country, the first of all countries, where the ark of the 
Flood remains to this day, buried in the glaciers of Mount Ararat.  
This man, I say, fleeing with others from the Kurds who had come 
upon them, went up into desolate places among the mountains&mdash;places 
beyond the common knowledge of men.  And fleeing from imminent 
pursuit, they came to a slope high among the mountain-peaks, 
 
<pb n="186"/>  
 
green with a grass like knife-blades, that cut and slashed most 
pitilessly at any one who went into it.  The Kurds were close behind, 
and there was nothing for it but to plunge in, and the worst of it 
was that the paths they made through it at the price of their blood 
served for the Kurds to follow.  Every one of the fugitives was killed 
save this Armenian and another.  He heard the screams and cries of 
his friends, and the swish of the grass about those who were pursuing 
them&mdash;it was tall grass rising overhead.  And then a shouting and  
answers, and when presently he paused, everything was still.  He 
pushed out again, not understanding, cut and bleeding, until he 
came out on a steep slope of rocks below a precipice, and then 
he saw the grass was all on fire, and the smoke of it rose like a veil  
between him and his enemies." 
</p><p>The stranger paused.  "Yes?" said Mr. Hinchcliff.  "Yes?" 
</p><p>"There he was, all torn and bloody from the knife-blades of the 
grass, the rocks blazing under the afternoon sun,&mdash;the sky molten brass, 
&mdash;and the smoke of the fire driving towards him.  He dared not stay 
there.  Death he did not mind, but torture! Far away beyond the 
smoke he heard shouts and cries.  Women screaming.  So he went 
clambering up a gorge in the rocks&mdash;everywhere were bushes with dry 
branches that stuck out like thorns among the leaves&mdash;until he 
clambered over the brow of a ridge that hid him.  And then he met 
his companion, a shepherd, who had also escaped.  And, counting cold 
and famine and thirst as nothing against the Kurds, they went on 
into the heights, and among the snow and ice.  They wandered three 
whole days. 
</p><p>"The third day came the vision.  I suppose hungry men often do 
see visions, but then there is this fruit." He lifted the wrapped globe 
in his hand.  "And I have heard it, too, from other mountaineers who 
have known something of the legend. it was in the evening time, when 
the stars were increasing, that they came down a slope of polished 
rock into a huge, dark valley all set about with strange, contorted 
trees, and in these trees hung little globes like glow-worm spheres, 
strange, round, yellow lights. 
</p><p>"Suddenly this valley was lit far away, many miles away, far down 
it, with a golden flame marching slowly athwart it, that made the 
stunted trees against it black as night, and turned the slopes all about 
them and their figures to the likeness of fiery gold.  And at the vision 
they, knowing the legends of the mountains, instantly knew that it 
was Eden they saw, or the sentinel of Eden, and they fell upon their 
faces like men struck dead. 
</p><p>"When they dared to look again, the valley was dark for a space, 
and then the light came again&mdash;returning, a burning amber. 
 
<pb n="187"/>  
 
</p><p>"At that the shepherd sprang to his feet, and with a shout began 
to run down towards the light; but the other man was too fearful 
to follow him.  He stood stunned, amazed, and terrified, watching his 
companion recede towards the marching glare.  And hardly had the 
shepherd set out when there came a noise like thunder, the beating 
of invisible wings hurrying up the valley, and a great and terrible fear; 
and at that the man who gave me the fruit turned&mdash;if he might still 
escape.  And hurrying headlong up the slope again, with that tumult 
sweeping after him, he stumbled against one of these stunted bushes, 
and a ripe fruit came off it into his hand.  This fruit.  Forthwith, the 
wings and the thunder rolled all about him.  He fell and fainted, 
and when he came to his senses, he was back among the blackened 
ruins of his own village, and I and the others were attending to the 
wounded.  A vision? But the golden fruit of the tree was still clutched 
in his hand.  There were others there who knew the legend, knew 
what that strange fruit might be." He paused.  "And this is it," he 
said. 
</p><p>It was a most extraordinary story to be told in a third-class carriage 
on a Sussex railway. lt was as if the real was a mere veil to the 
fantastic, and here was the fantastic poking through.  "Is it?" was all 
Mr. Hinchcliff could say. 
</p><p>"The legend," said the stranger, "tells that those thickets of dwarfed 
trees growing about the garden sprang from the apple that Adam 
carried in his hand when he 'and Eve were driven forth.  He felt 
something in his hand, saw the half-eaten apple, and flung it  
petulantly aside.  And there they grow, in that desolate valley, girdled 
round with the everlasting snows; and there the fiery swords keep 
ward against the Judgment Day." 
</p><p>"But I thought these things were&mdash;" Mr. Hinchcliff paused&mdash;"fables 
&mdash;parables rather.  Do you mean to tell me that there in Armenia&mdash;" 
</p><p>The stranger answered the unfinished question with the fruit in his 
open hand. 
</p><p>"But you don't know," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "that that is the fruit of 
the Tree of Knowledge.  The man may have had&mdash;a sort of mirage, say.  
Suppose&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Look at it," said the stranger. 
</p><p>It was certainly a strange-looking globe, not really an apple, Mr. 
Hinchcliff saw, and a curious glowing golden colour, almost as though 
light itself was wrought into its substance.  As he looked at it, he began 
to see more vividly the desolate valley among the mountains, the 
guarding swords of fire, the strange antiquities of the story he had 
just heard.  He rubbed a knuckle into his eye.  "But&mdash;" said he. 
 
<pb n="188"/>  
 
</p><p>"It has kept like that, smooth and full, three months.  Longer than 
that it is now by some days.  No drying, no withering, no decay." 
</p><p>"And you yourself," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "really believe that&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Is the Forbidden Fruit." 
</p><p>There was no mistaking the earnestness of the man's manner and 
his perfect sanity.  "The Fruit of Knowledge," he said. 
</p><p>"Suppose it was?" said Mr. Hinchcliff, after a pause, still staring at 
it. "But after all," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "it's not my kind of knowledge 
&mdash;not the sort of knowledge.  I mean, Adam and Eve have eaten it  
already." 
</p><p>"We inherit their sins&mdash;not their knowledge," said the stranger.  
"That would make it all clear and bright again.  We should see 
into everything, through everything, into the deepest meaning of 
everything&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Why don't you eat it, then?" said Mr. Hinchcliff, with an  
inspiration. 
</p><p>"I took it intending to eat it," said the stranger.  "Man has fallen.  
Merely to eat again could scarcely&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Knowledge is power," said Mr. Hinchcliff. 
</p><p>"But is it happiness? I am older than you&mdash;more than twice as old.  
Time after time I have held this in my hand, and my heart has failed 
me at the thought of all that one might know, that terrible lucidity&mdash; 
Suppose suddenly all the world became pitilessly clear?" 
</p><p>"That, I think, would be a great advantage," said Mr. Hinchcliff, 
"on the whole." 
</p><p>Suppose you saw into the hearts and minds of every one about you, 
into their most secret recesses&mdash;people you loved, whose love you 
valued?" 
</p><p>"You'd soon find out the humbugs," said Mr. Hinchcliff, greatly 
struck by the idea. 
</p><p>"And worse&mdash;to know yourself, bare of your most intimate illusions.  
To see yourself in your place.  All that your lusts and weaknesses  
prevented your doing.  No merciful perspective." 
</p><p>"That might be an excellent thing too. 'Know thyself,' you know." 
</p><p>"You are young," said the stranger. 
</p><p>"If you don't care to eat it, and it bothers you, why don't you throw 
it away?" 
</p><p>"There again, perhaps, you will not understand me.  To me, how 
could one throw away a thing like that, glowing, wonderful? Once one 
has it, one is bound.  But, on the other hand, to give it away! To give 
it away to some one who thirsted after knowledge, who found no 
terror in the thought of that clear perception&mdash;" 
 
<pb n="189"/>  
 
</p><p>"Of course," said Mr. Hinchcliff, thoughtfully, "it might be some 
sort of poisonous fruit." 
</p><p>And then his eye caught something motionless, the end of a white 
board black-lettered outside the carriage-window.  "-MWOOD," he 
saw.  He started convulsively.  "Gracious!" said Mr. Hinchcliff. 
"Holmwood!"&mdash;and the practical present blotted out the mystic realisations 
that had been stealing upon him. 
</p><p>In another moment he was opening the carriage-door, portmanteau 
in hand.  The guard was already fluttering his green flag.  Mr.  
Hinchcliff jumped out.  "Here!" said a voice behind him, and he saw the 
dark eyes of the stranger shining and the golden fruit, bright and 
bare, held out of the open carriage-door.  He took it instinctively, 
the train was already moving. 
</p><p>"No!" shouted the stranger, and made a snatch at it as if to take it 
back. 
</p><p>"Stand away," cried a country porter, thrusting forward to close 
the door.  The stranger shouted something Mr. Hinchcliff did not 
catch, head and arm thrust excitedly out of the window, and then 
the shadow of the bridge fell on him, and in a trice he was hidden.  
Mr. Hinchcliff stood astonished, staring at the end of the last waggon 
receding round the bend, and with the wonderful fruit in his hand.  
For the fraction of a minute his mind was confused, and then he 
became aware that two or three people on the platform were  
regarding him with interest.  Was he not the new Grammar School 
master making his debut? It occurred to him that, so far as they could 
tell, the fruit might very well be the naive refreshment of an orange.  
He flushed at the thought, and thrust the fruit into his side pocket, 
where it bulged undesirably.  But there was no help for it, so he went 
towards them, awkwardly concealing his sense of awkwardness, to 
ask the way to the Grammar School, and the means of getting his 
portmanteau and the two tin boxes which lay up the platform thither.  
Of all the odd and fantastic yarns to tell a fellow! 
</p><p>His luggage could be taken on a truck for sixpence, he found, and 
he could precede it on foot.  He fancied an ironical note in the 
voices.  He was painfully aware of his contour. 
</p><p>The curious earnestness of the man in the train, and the glamour 
of the story he told, had, for a time, diverted the current of Mr. 
Hinchcliff's thoughts.  It drove like a mist before his immediate  
concerns.  Fires that went to and fro! But the preoccupation of his new 
position, and the impression he was to produce upon Holmwood 
generally, and the school people in particular, returned upon him 
with reinvigorating power before he left the station and cleared his 
mental atmosphere.  But it is extraordinary what an inconvenient 
 
<pb n="190"/>  
 
thing the addition of a soft and rather brightly-golden fruit, not 
three inches in diameter, may prove to a sensitive youth on his 
best appearance.  In the pocket of his black jacket it bulged dreadfully,  
spoilt the lines altogether.  He passed a little old lady in black, 
and he felt her eye drop upon the excrescence at once.  He was wearing 
one glove and carrying the other, together with his stick, so that to 
bear the fruit openly was impossible.  In one place, where the road 
into the town seemed suitably secluded, he took his encumbrance 
out of his pocket and tried it in his hat.  It was just too large, the 
hat wobbled ludicrously, and just as he was taking it out again, a 
butcher's boy came driving round the corner. 
</p><p>"Confound it!" said Mr. Hinchcliff. 
</p><p>He would have eaten the thing, and attained omniscience there 
and then, but it would seem so silly to go into the town sucking a 
juicy fruit&mdash;and it certainly felt juicy. if one of the boys should 
come by, it might do him a serious injury with his discipline so to 
be seen.  And the juice might make his face sticky and get upon his 
cuffs&mdash;or it might be an acid juice as potent as lemon, and take all 
the colour out of his clothes. 
</p><p>Then round a bend in the lane came two pleasant, sunlit, girlish 
figures.  They were walking slowly towards the town and chattering 
&mdash;at any moment they might look round and see a hot-faced young 
man behind them carrying a kind of phosphorescent yellow tomato! 
They would be sure to laugh. 
</p><p>"Hang!" said Mr. Hinchcliff, and with a swift jerk sent the  
encumbrance flying over the stone wall of an orchard that there abutted 
on the road.  As it vanished, he felt a faint twinge of loss that lasted 
scarcely a moment.  He adjusted the stick and glove in his hand, and 
walked on, erect and self-conscious, to pass the girls. 
 
</p><p>But in the darkness of the night Mr. Hinchcliff had a dream, and 
saw the valley, and the flaming swords, and the contorted trees, and 
knew that it really was the Apple of the Tree of Knowledge that 
he had thrown regardlessly away.  And he awoke very unhappy. 
</p><p>In the morning his regret had passed, but afterwards it returned 
and troubled him; never, however, when he was happy or busily 
occupied.  At last, one moonlight night about eleven, when all  
Holmwood was quiet, his regrets returned with redoubled force, and  
therewith an impulse to adventure.  He slipped out of the house and 
over the playground wall, went through the silent town to Station 
Lane, and climbed into the orchard where he had thrown the fruit.  
But nothing was to be found of it there among the dewy grass and 
the faint intangible globes of dandelion down.

<head>THE PURPLE PILEUS</head> 
 
<p>Mr. Coombes was sick of life.  He walked away from his unhappy 
home, and, sick not only of his own existence, but of everybody 
else's, turned aside down Gaswork Lane to avoid the town, and, crossing  
the wooden bridge that goes over the canal to Starling's Cottages, 
was presently alone in the damp pinewoods and out of sight and 
sound of human habitation.  He would stand it no longer.  He repeated 
aloud with blasphemies unusual to him that he would stand it no 
longer. 
</p><p>He was a pale-faced little man, with dark eyes and a fine and very 
black moustache.  He had a very stiff, upright collar slightly frayed, 
that gave him an illusory double chin, and his overcoat (albeit shabby) 
was trimmed with astrachan.  His gloves were a bright brown with 
black stripes over the knuckles, and split at the finger-ends.  His  
appearance, his wife had said once in the dear, dead days beyond recall, 
&mdash;before he married her, that is,&mdash;was military.  But now she called 
him&mdash; It seems a dreadful thing to tell of between husband and wife, 
but she called him "a little grub." It wasn't the only thing she had 
called him, either. 
</p><p>The row had arisen about that beastly Jennie again.  Jennie was 
his wife's friend, and, by no invitation of Mr. Coombes, she came 
in every blessed Sunday to dinner, and made a shindy all the afternoon.  
She was a big, noisy girl, with a taste for loud colours and a strident 
laugh; and this Sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions 
by bringing in a fellow with her, a chap as showy as herself.  And 
Mr. Coombes, in a starchy, clean collar and his Sunday frock-coat, had 
sat dumb and wrathful at his own table, while his wife and her guests 
 
<pb n="192"/>  
 
talked foolishly and undesirably, and laughed aloud.  Well, he stood 
that, and after dinner (which, "as usual," was late), what must Miss 
Jennie do but go to the piano and play banjo tunes, for all the world 
as if it were a week-day! Flesh and blood could not endure such 
goings-on.  They would hear next door; they would hear in the road; 
it was a public announcement of their disrepute.  He had to speak. 
</p><p>He had felt himself go pale, and a kind of rigour had affected 
his respiration as he delivered himself.  He had been sitting on one 
of the chairs by the window&mdash;the new guest had taken possession 
of the arm-chair.  He turned his head.  "Sun Day!" he said over the 
collar, in the voice of one who warns.  "Sun Day!" What people call 
a "nasty" tone it was. 
</p><p>Jennie had kept on playing; but his wife, who was looking through 
some music that was piled on the top of the piano, had stared at him.  
"What's wrong now?" she said; "can't people enjoy themselves?" 
</p><p>"I don't mind rational 'njoyment, at all," said little Coombes; 
"but I ain't a-going to have week-day tunes playing on a Sunday in 
this house." 
</p><p>"What's wrong with my playing now?" said Jennie, stopping and 
twirling round on the music-stool with a monstrous rustle of flounces. 
</p><p>Coombes saw it was going to be a row, and opened too vigorously, 
as is common with your timid, nervous men all the world over.  "Steady 
on with that music-stool!" said he; "it ain't made for 'eavy weights." 
</p><p>"Never you mind about weights," said Jennie, incensed.  "What 
was you saying behind my back about my playing?" 
</p><p>"Surely you don't 'old with not having a bit of music on a Sunday, 
Mr. Coombes?" said the new guest, leaning back in the arm-chair, 
blowing a cloud of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying 
way.  And simultaneously his wife said something to Jennie about 
"Never mind 'im.  You go on, Jinny." 
</p><p>"I do," said Mr. Coombes, addressing the new guest. 
</p><p>"May I arst why?" said the new guest, evidently enjoying both his 
cigarette and the prospect of an argument.  He was, by-the-by, a 
lank young man, very stylishly dressed in bright drab, and a white 
cravat and a pearl and silver pin.  It had been better taste to come 
in a black coat, Mr. Coombes thought. 
</p><p>"Because," began Mr. Coombes, "it don't suit me.  I'm a business 
man.  I 'ave to study my connection.  Rational 'njoyment 
</p><p>"His connection!" said Mrs. Coombes, scornfully.  "That's what 
he's always a-saying.  We got to do this, and we got to do that&mdash;" 
</p><p>"If you don't mean to study my connection," said Mr. Coombes, 
"what did you marry me for?" 
</p><p>"I wonder," said Jennie, and turned back to the piano. 
 
<pb n="193"/>  
 
</p><p>"I never saw such a man as you," said Mrs. Coombes.  "You've  
altered all round since we were married.  Before&mdash;" 
</p><p>Then Jennie began at the tum, tum, tum again. 
</p><p>"Look here!" said Mr. Coombes, driven at last to revolt, standing up 
and raising his voice.  "I tell you I won't have that." The frock-coat 
heaved with his indignation. 
</p><p>"No vi'lence, now," said the long young man in drab, sitting up. 
</p><p>"Who the juice are you?" said Mr. Coombes, fiercely. 
</p><p>Whereupon they all began talking at once.  The new guest said 
he was Jennie's "intended," and meant to protect her, and Mr. 
Coombes said he was welcome to do so anywhere but in his (Mr.  
Coombes') house; and Mrs. Coombes said he ought to be ashamed of 
insulting his guests, and (as I have already mentioned) that he was 
getting a regular little grub; and the end was, that Mr. Coombes  
ordered his visitors out of the house, and they wouldn't go, and so he 
said he would go himself.  With his face burning and tears of excitement  
in his eyes, he went into the passage, and as he struggled with 
his overcoat&mdash;his frock-coat sleeves got concertinaed up his arm&mdash;and 
gave a brush at his silk hat, Jennie began again at the piano, and 
strummed him insultingly out of the house.  Tum, tum, tum.  He slammed  
the shop-door so that the house quivered.  That, briefly, was 
the immediate making of his mood.  You will perhaps begin to  
understand his disgust with existence. 
</p><p>As he walked along the muddy path under the firs,&mdash;it was late 
October, and the ditches and heaps of fir-needles were gorgeous with 
clumps of fungi,&mdash;he recapitulated the melancholy history of his  
marriage.  It was brief and commonplace enough.  He now perceived with 
sufficient clearness that his wife had married him out of a natural 
curiosity and in order to escape from her worrying, laborious, and 
uncertain life in the workroom; and, like the majority of her class, 
she was far too stupid to realise that it was her duty to co-operate 
with him in his business.  She was greedy of enjoyment, loquacious, and 
socially-minded, and evidently disappointed to find the restraints of 
poverty still hanging about her.  His worries exasperated her, and 
the slightest attempt to control her proceedings resulted in a charge 
of "grumbling." Why couldn't he be nice&mdash;as he used to be? And 
Coombes was such a harmless little man, too, nourished mentally on 
"Self-Help," and with a meagre ambition of self-denial and  
competition, that was to end in a "sufficiency." Then Jennie came in as a 
female Mephistopheles, a gabbling chronicle of "fellers," and was al-ways wanting his wife to go to theatres, and "all that." And in  
addition were aunts of his wife, and cousins (male and female), to eat 
up capital, insult him personally, upset business arrangements, annoy 
 
<pb n="194"/>  
 
good customers, and generally blight his life.  It was not the first  
occasion by many that Mr. Coombes had fled his home in wrath and  
indignation, and something like fear, vowing furiously and even aloud 
that he wouldn't stand it, and so frothing away his energy along the 
line of least resistance.  But never before had he been quite so sick 
of life as on this particular Sunday afternoon.  The Sunday dinner may 
have had its share in his despair&mdash;and the greyness of the sky.   
Perhaps, too, he was beginning to realise his unendurable frustration as 
a business man as the consequence of his marriage.  Presently bankruptcy, 
and after that&mdash; Perhaps she might have reason to repent when 
it was too late.  And destiny, as I have already intimated, had planted 
the path through the wood with evil-smelling fungi, thickly and 
variously planted it, not only on the right side, but on the left. 
</p><p>A small shopman is in such a melancholy position, if his wife turns 
out a disloyal partner.  His capital is all tied up in his business, and 
to leave her, means to join the unemployed in some strange part of 
the earth.  The luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether.  So that 
the good old tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably 
for him, and things work up to tragic culminations.  Bricklayers kick 
their wives to death, and dukes betray theirs; but it is among the 
small clerks and shopkeepers nowadays that it comes most often to a 
cutting of throats.  Under the circumstances it is not so very remarkable 
&mdash;and you must take it as charitably as you can&mdash;that the mind of Mr. 
Coombes ran for awhile on some such glorious close to his disappointed  
hopes, and that he thought of razors, pistols, bread-knives, 
and touching letters to the coroner denouncing his enemies by name, 
and praying piously for forgiveness.  After a time his fierceness gave 
way to melancholia.  He had been married in this very overcoat, in 
his first and only frockcoat that was buttoned up beneath it.  He began  
to recall their courting along this very walk, his years of penurious 
saving to get capital, and the bright hopefulness of his marrying days.  
For it all to work out like this! Was there no sympathetic ruler  
anywhere in the world? He reverted to death as a topic. 
</p><p>He thought of the canal he had just crossed, and doubted whether 
he shouldn't stand with his head out, even in the middle, and it was 
while drowning was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his 
eye.  He looked at it mechanically for a moment, and stopped and 
stooped towards it to pick it up, under the impression that it was 
some such small leather object as a purse.  Then he saw that it was 
the purple top of a fungus, a peculiarly poisonous-looking purple: 
slimy, shiny, and emitting a sour odour.  He hesitated with his hand 
an inch or so from it, and the thought of poison crossed his mind. 
 
<pb n="195"/>  
 
With that he picked the thing, and stood up again with it in his 
hand. 
</p><p>The odour was certainly strong&mdash;acrid, but by no means disgusting.  
He broke off a piece, and the fresh surface was a creamy white, that 
changed like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowish-green 
colour.  It was even an inviting-looking change.  He broke off two 
other pieces to see it repeated.  They were wonderful things, these 
fungi, thought Mr. Coombes, and all of them the deadliest poisons, 
as his father had often told him.  Deadly poisons! 
</p><p>There is no time like the present for a rash resolve.  Why not here 
and now? thought Mr. Coombes.  He tasted a little piece, a very 
little piece indeed&mdash;a mere crumb.  It was so pungent that he almost 
spat it out again, then merely hot and full-flavoured,&mdash;a kind of 
German mustard with a touch of horse-radish and&mdash;well, mushroom.  
He swallowed it in the excitement of the moment.  Did he like it 
or did he not? His mind was curiously careless.  He would try another 
bit.  It really wasn't bad&mdash;it was good.  He forgot his troubles in the 
interest of the immediate moment.  Playing with death it was.  He took 
another bite, and then deliberately finished a mouthful.  A curious 
tingling sensation began in his finger-tips and toes.  His pulse began 
to move faster.  The blood in his ears sounded like a millrace.  "Try 
bi' more," said Mr. Coombes.  He turned and looked about him, and 
found his feet unsteady.  He saw and struggled towards a little patch 
of purple a dozen yards away.  "Jol' goo' stuff," said Mr. Coombes. 
"E&mdash;lomore ye'" He pitched forward and fell on his face, his hands  
outstretched towards the cluster of pilei.  But he did not eat any more 
of them.  He forgot forthwith. 
</p><p>He rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his 
face.  His carefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch.  
He pressed his hand to his brow.  Something had happened, but he 
could not rightly determine what it was.  Anyhow, he was no longer 
dull&mdash;he felt bright, cheerful.  And his throat was afire.  He laughed 
in the sudden gaiety of his heart.  Had he been dull? He did not 
know; but at any rate he would be dull no longer.  He got up and 
stood unsteadily, regarding the universe with an agreeable smile.  He 
began to remember.  He could not remember very well, because of a 
steam roundabout that was beginning in his head.  And he knew he 
had been disagreeable at home, just because they wanted to be happy.  
They were quite right; life should be as gay as possible.  He would 
go home and make it up, and reassure them.  And why not take some 
of this delightful toadstool with him, for them to eat? A hatful, no 
less.  Some of those red ones with white spots as well, and a few 
yellow.  He had been a dull dog, an enemy to merriment; he would 
 
<pb n="196"/>  
 
make up for it.  It would be gay to turn his coat-sleeves inside out, 
and stick some yellow gorse into his waist-coat pockets.  Then home&mdash; 
singing&mdash;for a jolly evening. 
</p><p>After the departure of Mr. Coombes, Jennie discontinued playing, 
and turned round on the music-stool again.  "What a fuss about 
nothing," said Jennie. 
</p><p>"You see, Mr. Clarence, what I've got to put up with," said Mrs. 
Coombes. 
</p><p>"He is a bit hasty," said Mr. Clarence, judicially. 
</p><p>"He ain't got the slightest sense of our position," said Mrs. Coombes; 
"that's what I complain of.  He cares for nothing but his old shop; 
and if I have a bit of company, or buy anything to keep myself decent, 
or get any little thing I want out of the housekeeping money, there's 
disagreeables.  'Economy,' he says; 'struggle for life,' and all that.  He 
lies awake of nights about it, worrying how he can screw me out of 
a shilling.  He wanted us to eat Dorset butter once.  If once I was 
to give in to him&mdash;there!" 
</p><p>"Of course," said Jennie. 
</p><p>"If a man values a woman," said Mr. Clarence, lounging back in 
the arm-chair, "he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her.  For 
my own part," said Mr. Clarence, with his eye on Jennie, "I shouldn't 
think of marrying till I was in a position to do the thing in style.  
It's downright selfishness.  A man ought to go through the rough-and-tumble by himself, and not drag her&mdash;" 
</p><p>"I don't agree altogether with that," said Jennie.  "I don't see why 
a man shouldn't have a woman's help, provided he doesn't treat her 
meanly, you know.  It's meanness&mdash;" 
</p><p>"You wouldn't believe," said Mrs. Coombes.  "But I was a fool to 
'ave 'im.  I might 'ave known.  If it 'adn't been for my father, we 
shouldn't have had not a carriage to our wedding." 
</p><p>"Lord! he didn't stick out at that?" said Mr. Clarence, quite shocked. 
</p><p>"Said he wanted the money for his stock; or some such rubbish.  
Why, he wouldn't have a woman in to help me once a week if it 
wasn't for my standing out plucky.  And the fusses he makes about 
money&mdash;comes to me, well pretty near crying, with sheets of paper 
and figgers.  'If only we can tide over this year,' he says, 'the business 
is bound to go.' 'If only we can tide over this year,' I says; 'then 
it'll be, if only we can tide over next year.  I know you,' I says.  'And 
you don't catch me screwing myself lean and ugly.  Why didn't you 
marry a slavey,' I says, 'if you wanted one&mdash;instead of a respectable 
girl?' I says." 
</p><p>So Mrs. Coombes.  But we will not follow this unedifying  
conversation 
<pb n="197"/>  
 
further.  Suffice it that Mr. Coombes was very satisfactorily disposed  
of, and they had a snug little time round the fire.  Then Mrs. 
Coombes went to get the tea, and Jennie sat coquettishly on the 
arm of Mr. Clarence's chair until the tea-things clattered outside.  
"What was that I heard?" asked Mrs. Coombes, playfully, as she 
entered, and there was badinage about kissing.  They were just sitting 
down to the little circular table when the first intimation of Mr. 
Coombes' return was heard. 
</p><p>This was a fumbling at the latch of the front door. 
</p><p>"'Ere's my lord," said Mrs. Coombes.  "Went out like a lion and 
comes back like a lamb, I'll lay." 
</p><p>Something fell over in the shop: a chair, it sounded like.  Then 
there was a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the  
passage.  Then the door opened and Coombes appeared.  But it was 
Coombes transfigured.  The immaculate collar had been torn carelessly 
from his throat.  His carefully-brushed silk hat, half-full of a crush 
of fungi, was under one arm; his coat was inside out, and his  
waist-coat adorned with bunches of yellow-blossomed furze.  These little 
eccentricities of Sunday costume, however, were quite overshadowed 
by the change in his face; it was livid white, his eyes were unnaturally 
large and bright, and his pale blue lips were drawn back in a cheerless 
grin.  "Merry!" he said.  He had stopped dancing to open the door.  
"Rational 'njoyment.  Dance." He made three fantastic steps into 
the room, and stood bowing. 
</p><p>"Jim!" shrieked Mrs. Coombes, and Mr. Clarence sat petrified, 
with a dropping lower jaw. 
</p><p>"Tea," said Mr. Coombes.  "Jol' thing, tea.  Tose-stools, too.  Brosher." 
</p><p>"He's drunk," said Jennie, in a weak voice.  Never before had she 
seen this intense pallor in a drunken man, or such shining, dilated 
eyes. 
</p><p>Mr. Coombes held out a handful of scarlet agario to Mr. Clarence.  
"Jo' stuff," said he; "ta' some." 
</p><p>At that moment he was genial.  Then at the sight of their startled 
faces he charged, with the swift transition of insanity, into  
overbearing fury.  And it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel 
of his departure.  In such a huge voice as Mrs. Coombes had never 
heard before, he shouted, "My house.  I'm master 'ere.  Eat what I give 
yer!" He bawled this, as it seemed, without an effort, without a violent 
gesture, standing there as motionless as one who whispers, holding 
out a handful of fungus. 
</p><p>Clarence approved himself a coward.  He could not meet the mad 
fury in Coombes' eyes; he rose to his feet, pushing back his chair, 
and turned, stooping.  At that Coombes rushed at him.  Jennie saw 
 
<pb n="198"/>  
 
her opportunity, and, with the ghost of a shriek, made for the door.  
Mrs. Coombes followed her.  Clarence tried to dodge.  Over went the 
tea-table with a smash as Coombes clutched him by the collar and 
tried to thrust the fungus into his mouth.  Clarence was content to 
leave his collar behind him, and shot out into the passage with red 
patches of fly agaric still adherent to his face.  "Shut 'im in!" cried 
Mrs. Coombes, and would have closed the door, but her supports 
deserted her; Jennie saw the shop-door open and vanished thereby, 
locking it behind her, while Clarence went on hastily into the 
kitchen.  Mr. Coombes came heavily against the door, and Mrs. 
Coombes, finding the key was inside, fled upstairs and locked herself 
in the spare bedroom. 
</p><p>So the new convert to joie de vivre emerged upon the passage, 
his decorations a little scattered, but that respectable hatful of fungi 
still under his arm.  He hesitated at the three ways, and decided on 
the kitchen.  Whereupon Clarence, who was fumbling with the key, 
gave up the attempt to imprison his host, and fled into the scullery, 
only to be captured before he could open the door into the yard.  
Mr. Clarence is singularly reticent of the details of what occurred.  
It seems that Mr. Coombes' transitory irritation had vanished again, 
and he was once more a genial playfellow.  And as there were knives 
and meat-choppers about, Clarence very generously resolved to humour 
him and so avoid anything tragic.  It is beyond dispute that Mr. 
Coombes played with Mr. Clarence to his heart's content; they could 
not have been more playful and familiar if they had known each 
other for years.  He insisted gaily on Clarence trying the fungi, and 
after a friendly tussle, was smitten with remorse at the mess he was 
making of his guest's face.  It also appears that Clarence was dragged 
under the sink and his face scrubbed with the blacking-brush,&mdash;he 
being still resolved to humour the lunatic at any cost,&mdash;and that 
finally, in a somewhat dishevelled, chipped, and discoloured condition, 
he was assisted to his coat and shown out by the back door, the 
shopway being barred by Jennie.  Mr. Coombes' wandering thoughts 
then turned to Jennie.  Jennie had been unable to unfasten the shop-door, but she shot the bolts against Mr. Coombes' latch-key, and  
remained in possession of the shop for the rest of the evening. 
It would appear that Mr. Coombes then returned to the kitchen, 
still in pursuit of gaiety, and, albeit a strict Good Templar, drank 
(or spilt down the front of the first and only frock-coat) no less than 
five bottles of the stout Mrs. Coombes insisted upon having for her 
health's sake.  He made cheerful noises by breaking off the necks 
of the bottle with several of his wife's wedding-present dinner-plates, 
and during the earlier part of this great drunk he sang divers merry 
 
<pb n="199"/>  
 
ballads. He cut his finger rather badly with one of the bottles,&mdash;the 
only bloodshed in this story,&mdash;and what with that, and the systematic 
convulsion of his inexperienced physiology by the liquorish brand of 
Mrs. Coombes' stout, it may be the evil of the fungus poison was 
somehow allayed.  But we prefer to draw a veil over the concluding 
incidents of this Sunday afternoon.  They ended in the coal cellar, 
in a deep and healing sleep. 
 
</p><p>An interval of five years elapsed.  Again it was a Sunday afternoon 
in October, and again Mr. Coombes walked through the pinewood 
beyond the canal.  He was still the same dark-eyed, black-moustached 
little man that he was at the outset of the story, but his double chin 
was now scarcely so illusory as it had been.  His overcoat was new, 
with a velvet lapel, and a stylish collar with turndown corners, free 
of any coarse starchiness, had replaced the original all-round article.  
His hat was glossy, his gloves newish&mdash;though one finger had split and 
been carefully mended.  And a casual observer would have noticed 
about him a certain rectitude of bearing, a certain erectness of head 
that marks the man who thinks well of himself.  He was a master 
now, with three assistants.  Beside him walked a larger sunburnt  
parody of himself, his brother Tom, just back from Australia.  They were 
recapitulating their early struggles, and Mr. Coombes had just been 
making a financial statement. 
</p><p>"It's a very nice little business, Jim," said brother Tom.  "In these 
days of competition you're jolly lucky to have worked it up so.  And 
you're jolly lucky, too, to have a wife who's willing to help like yours 
does." 
</p><p>"Between ourselves, said Mr. Coombes, "it wasn't always so.  It 
wasn't always like this.  To begin with, the missus was a bit giddy.  
Girls are funny creatures." 
</p><p>"Dear me!" 
</p><p>"Yes.  You'd hardly think it, but she was downright extravagant, 
and always having slaps at me.  I was a bit too easy and loving, and 
all that, and she thought the whole blessed show was run for her.  
Turned the 'ouse into a regular caravansary, always having her  
relations and girls from business in, and their chaps.  Comic songs a' 
Sunday, it was getting to, and driving trade away.  And she was 
making eyes at the chaps, too! I tell you, Tom, the place wasn't my 
own." 
</p><p>"Shouldn't 'a' thought it." 
</p><p>"It was so.  Well&mdash;I reasoned with her.  I said, 'I ain't a duke, to keep 
a wife like a pet animal.  I married you for 'elp and company.' I 
said, 'You got to 'elp and pull the business through.' She wouldn't 'ear 
 
<pb n="200"/>  
 
of it.  'Very well,' I says; 'I'm a mild man till I'm roused,' I says, 'and 
it's getting to that.' But she wouldn't 'ear of no warnings." 
</p><p>"Well?" 
</p><p>"It's the way with women.  She didn't think I 'ad it in me to be 
roused.  Women of her sort (between ourselves, Tom) don't respect a 
man until they're a bit afraid of him.  So I just broke out to show her.  
In comes a girl named Jennie, that used to work with her, and her 
chap.  We 'ad a bit of a row, and I came out 'ere&mdash;it was just such 
another day as this&mdash;and I thought it all out.  Then I went back and 
pitched into them." 
</p><p>"You did?" 
</p><p>"I did.  I was mad, I can tell you.  I wasn't going to 'it 'er, if I 
could 'elp it, so I went back and licked into this chap, just to show 
'er what I could do.  'E was a big chap, too.  Well, I chucked him, and 
smashed things about, and gave 'er a scaring, and she ran up and 
locked 'erself into the spare room." 
</p><p>"Well?" 
</p><p>"That's all.  I says to 'er the next morning, "Now you know,' I 
says, "what I'm like when I'm roused.' And I didn't 'ave to say anything 
more." 
</p><p>"And you've been happy ever after, eh?" 
</p><p>"So to speak.  There's nothing like putting your foot down with 
them.  If it 'adn't been for that afternoon I should 'a' been tramping 
the roads now, and she'd 'a' been grumbling at me, and all her 
family grumbling for bringing her to poverty&mdash;I know their little 
ways.  But we're all right now.  And it's a very decent little business, 
as you say." 
</p><p>They proceed on their way meditatively.  "Women are funny  
creatures," said brother Tom. 
</p><p>"They want a firm hand," says Coombes. 
</p><p>'What a lot of these funguses there are about here!" remarked 
brother Tom, presently.  "I can't see what use they are in the world." 
</p><p>Mr. Coombes looked.  "I dessay they're sent for some wise purpose, 
said Mr. Coombes. 
</p><p>And that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for 
maddening this absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action, and 
so altering the whole course of his life.</p>
