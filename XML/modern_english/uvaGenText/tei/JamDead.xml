The Altar of the Dead<lb/>

By Henry James, 1895</head>
<div2 type="chapter" n="1" id="d4"><head>I</head>
<p>
He had a mortal dislike, poor Stransom, to lean anniversaries, and he disliked
them still more when they made a pretense of a figure. Celebrations and
suppressions were equally painful to him, and there was only one of the former
that found a place in his life. Again and again he had kept in his own fashion
the day of the year on which Mary Antrim died. It would be more to the point
perhaps to say that the day kept <hi rend="italic">him:</hi> it kept him at least, effectually,
from doing anything else. It took hold of him year after year with a hand
of which time had softened but had never loosened the touch. He waked up
to this feast of memory as consciously as he would have waked up to his marriage
morn. Marriage had had, of old, but too little to say to the matter: for
the girl who was to have been his bride there had been no bridal embrace.
She had died of a malignant fever after the wedding day had been fixed, and
he had lost, before fairly tasting it, an affection that promised to fill
his life to the brim.
</p><p>
Of that benediction, however, it would have been false to say this life could
really be emptied: it was still ruled by a pale ghost, it was still ordered
by a sovereign presence. He had not been a man of numerous passions, and
even in all these years no sense had grown stronger with him than the sense
of being bereft. He had needed no priest and no altar to make him forever
widowed. He had done many things in the world&mdash;he had done almost all things
but one; he had never forgotten. He had tried to put into his existence whatever
else might take up room in it, but he had never made it anything but a house
of which the mistress was eternally absent. She was most absent of all on
the recurrent December day that his tenacity set apart. He had no designed
observance of it, but his nerves made it all their own. They always drove
him forth on a long walk, for the goal of his pilgrimage was far. She had
been buried in a London suburb, in a place then almost natural, but which
he had seen lose, one after another, every feature of freshness. It was in
truth during the moments he stood there that his eyes beheld the place least.
They looked at another image, they opened to another light. Was it a credible
future? Was it an incredible past? Whatever it was, it was an immense escape
from the actual.
</p><p>
It is true that, if there were no other dates than this, there were other
memories; and by the time George Stransom was fifty-five such memories had
greatly multiplied. There were other ghosts in his life than the ghost of
Mary Antrim. He had perhaps not had more losses than most men, but he had
counted his losses more; he had not seen death more closely, but he had,
in a manner, felt it more deeply. He had formed little by little the habit
of numbering his Dead; it had come to him tolerably early in life that there
was something one had to do for them. They were there in their simplified,
intensified essence, their conscious absence and expressive patience, as
personally there as if they had only been stricken dumb. When all sense of
them failed, all sound of then ceased, it was as if their purgatory were
really still on earth: they asked so little that they got, poor things, even
less, and died again, died every day, of the hard usage of life. They had
no organized service, no reserved place, no honor, no shelter, no safety.
Even ungenerous people provided for the living, but even those who were called
most generous did nothing for the others. So, on George Stransom's part,
there grew up with the years a determination that he at least would do something
to it, that is, for his own&mdash;and perform the great charity without reproach.
Every man had his own, and every man had, to meet this charity, the ample
resources of the soul.
</p><p>
It was doubtless the voice of Mary Antrim that spoke for them best; at any
rate, as the years went on, he found himself in regular communion with these
alternative associates, with those whom indeed he always called in his thoughts
the Others. He spared them the moments, he organized the charity. How it
grew up he probably never could have told you, but what came to pass was
that an altar, such as was, after all, within everybody's compass, lighted
with perpetual candles and dedicated to these secret rites, reared itself
in his spiritual spaces. He had wondered of old, in some embarrassment, whether
he had a religion; being very sure, and not a little content, that he had
not at all events the religion some of the people he had known wanted him
to have. Gradually this question was straightened out for him; it became
clear to him that the religion instilled by his earliest consciousness had
been simply the religion of the Dead. It suited his inclination, it satisfied
his spirit, it gave employment to his piety. It answered his love of great
offices, of a solemn and splendid ritual; for no shrine could be more bedecked
and no ceremonial more stately than those to which his worship was attached.
He had no imagination about these things save that they were accessible to
everyone who should ever feel the need of them. The poorest could build such
temples of the spirit&mdash;could make them blaze with candles and smoke with
incense, make them flush with pictures and flowers. The cost, in common phrase,
of keeping them up fell entirely on the liberal heart.
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="2" id="d5"><head>II</head>
<p>
He had this year, on the eve of his anniversary, as it happened, an emotion
not unconnected with that range of feeling. Walking home at the close of
a busy day, he was arrested in the London street by the particular effect
of a shopfront which lighted the dull brown air with its mercenary grin,
and before which several persons were gathered. It was the window of a jeweler
whose diamonds and sapphires seemed to laugh, in flashes like high notes
of sound, with the mere joy of knowing how much more they were "worth" than
most of the dingy pedestrians staring at them from the other side of the
pane. Stransom lingered long enough to suspend, in a vision, a string of
pearls about the white neck of Mary Antrim, and then was kept an instant
longer by the sound of a voice he knew. Next to him was a mumbling old woman,
and beyond the old woman a gentleman with a lady on his arm. It was from
him, from Paul Creston, the voice had proceeded; he was talking with the
lady of some precious object in the window. Stransom had no sooner recognized
him than the old woman turned away; but simultaneously with this increase
of opportunity he became aware of a strangeness which stayed him in the very
act of laying his hand on his friend's arm. It lasted only a few seconds,
but a few seconds were long enough for the flash of a wild question. Was
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> Mrs. Creston dead?&mdash;the ambiguity met him there in the short drop
of her husband's voice, the drop conjugal, if it ever was, and in the way
the two figures leaned to each other. Creston, making a step to look at something
else, came nearer, glanced at him, started, and exclaimed&mdash;a circumstance
the effect of which was at first only to leave Stransom staring&mdash;staring
back across the months at the different face, the wholly other face the poor
man had shown him last, the blurred, ravaged mask bent over the open grave
by which they had stood together. Creston was not in mourning now; he detached
his arm from his companion's to grasp the hand of the older friend. He colored
as well as smiled in the strong light of the shop when Stransom raised a
tentative hat to the lady. Stransom had just time to see that she was pretty
before he found himself gaping at a fact more portentous. "My dear fellow,
let me make you acquainted with my wife."
</p><p>
Creston had blushed and stammered over it, but in half a minute, at the rate
we live in polite society, it had practically become, for Stransom, the mere
memory of a shock. They stood there and laughed and talked; Stransom had
instantly whisked the shock out of the way, to keep it for private consumption.
He felt himself grimacing, he heard himself exaggerating the usual, but he
was conscious that he had turned slightly faint. That new woman, that hired
performer, Mrs. Creston? Mrs. Creston had been more living for him than any
woman but one. This lady had a face that shone as publicly as the jeweler's
window, and in the happy candor with which she wore her monstrous character
there was an effect of gross immodesty. The character of Paul Creston's wife,
thus attributed to her, was monstrous for reasons which Stransom could see
that his friend perfectly knew that he knew. The happy pair had just arrived
from America, and Stransom had not needed to be told this to divine the
nationality of the lady. Somehow it deepened the foolish air that her husband's
confused cordiality was unable to conceal. Stransom recalled that he had
heard of poor Creston's having, while his bereavement was still fresh, gone
to the United States for what people in such predicaments call a little change.
He had found the little change; indeed, he had brought the little change
back: it was the little change that stood there and that, do what he would,
he couldn't, while he showed those high front teeth of his, look like anything
but a conscious ass about. They were going into the shop, Mrs. Creston said,
and she begged Mr. Stransom to come with them and help to decide. He thanked
her, opening his watch and pleading an engagement for which he was already
late, and they parted while she shrieked into the fog, "Mind now you come
to see me right away!" Creston had had the delicacy not to suggest that,
and Stransom hoped it hurt him somewhere to hear her scream it to all the
echoes.
</p><p>
He felt quite determined, as he walked away, never in his life to go near
her. She was perhaps a human being, but Creston oughtn't to have shown her
without precautions, oughtn't indeed to have shown her at all. His precautions
should have been those of a forger or a murderer, and the people at home
would never have mentioned extradition. This was a wife for foreign service
or purely external use; a decent consideration would have spared her the
injury of comparisons. Such were the first reflections of George Stransom's
amazement; but as he sat alone that night&mdash;these were particular hours that
he always passed alone&mdash;the harshness dropped from them and left only the
pity. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> could spend an evening with Kate Creston, if the man to whom
she had given everything couldn't. He had not known her twenty years, and
she was the only woman for whom he might perhaps have been unfaithful. She
was all cleverness and sympathy and charm; her house had been the very easiest
in all the world, and her friendship the very firmest. Without accidents
he had loved her, without accidents everyone had loved her; she had made
the passions about her as regular as the moon makes the tides. She had been
also, of course, far too good for her husband, but he never suspected it,
and in nothing had she been more admirable than in the exquisite art with
which she tried to keep everyone else (keeping Creston was no trouble) from
finding it out. Here was a man to whom she had devoted her life and for whom
she had given it up&mdash;dying to bring into the world a child of his bed; and
she had had only to submit to her fate to have, ere the grass was green on
her grave, no more existence for him than a domestic servant he had replaced.
The frivolity, the indecency of it made Stransom's eyes fill; and he had
that evening a rich, almost happy sense that he alone, in a world without
delicacy, had a right to hold up his head. While he smoked, after dinner,
he had a book in his lap, but he had no eyes for his page; his eyes, in the
swarming void of things, seemed to have caught Kate Creston's, and it was
into their sad silences he looked. It was to him her sentient spirit had
turned, knowing that it was of her he would think. He thought, for a long
time, of how the closed eyes of dead women could still live&mdash;how they could
open again, in a quiet lamplit room, long after they had looked their last.
They had looks that remained, as great poets had quoted lines.
</p><p>
The newspaper lay by his chair&mdash;the thing that came in the afternoon, and
the servants thought one wanted; without sense for what was in it, he had
mechanically unfolded and then dropped it. Before he went to bed he took
it up, and this time, at the top of a paragraph, he was caught by five words
that made him start. He stood staring, before the fire, at the "Death of
Sir Acton Hague, K.C.B.," the man who, ten years earlier, had been the nearest
of his friends, and whose deposition from this eminence had practically left
it without an occupant. He had seen him after that catastrophe, but he had
not seen him for years. Standing there before the fire, he turned cold as
he read what had befallen him. Promoted a short time previous to the governorship
of the Westward Islands, Acton Hague had died, in the bleak honor of this
exile, of an illness consequent on the bite of a poisonous snake. His career
was compressed by the newspaper into a dozen lines, the perusal of which
excited on George Stransom's part no warmer feeling than one of relief at
the absence of any mention of their quarrel, an incident accidentally tainted
at the time, thanks to their joint immersion in large affairs, with a horrible
publicity. Public, indeed, was the wrong Stransom had, to his own sense,
suffered, the insult he had blankly taken from the only man with whom he
had ever been intimate; the friend, almost adored, of his university years,
the subject, later, of his passionate loyalty; so public that he had never
spoken of it to a human creature, so public that he had completely overlooked
it. It had made the difference for him that friendship too was all over,
but it had only made just that one. The shock of interests had been private,
intensely so; but the action taken by Hague had been in the face of men.
Today it all seemed to have occurred merely to the end that George Stransom
should think of him as "Hague," and measure exactly how much he himself could
feel like a stone. He went cold, suddenly, and horribly cold, to bed.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="3" id="d6"><head>III</head>
<p>
The next day, in the afternoon, in the great gray suburb, he felt that his
long walk had tired him. In the dreadful cemetery alone he had been on his
feet an hour. Instinctively, coming back, they had taken him a devious course,
and it was a desert in which no circling cabman hovered over possible prey.
He paused on a corner and measured the dreariness; then he became aware in
the gathered dusk that he was in one of those tracts of London which are
less gloomy by night than by day, because, in the former case, of the civil
gift of light. By day there was nothing, but by night there were lamps, and
George Stransom was in a mood which made lamps good in themselves. It wasn't
that they could show him anything; it was only that they could burn clear.
To his surprise, however, after a while, they did show him something: the
arch of a high doorway approached by a low terrace of steps, in the depth
of which&mdash;it formed a dim vestibule&mdash;the raising of a curtain, at the moment
he passed, gave him a glimpse of an avenue of gloom with a glow of tapers
at the end. He stopped and looked up, making out that the place was a church.
The thought quickly came to him that, since he was tired, he might rest there;
so that, after a moment, he had in turn pushed up the leathern curtain and
gone in. It was a temple of the old persuasion, and there had evidently been
a function&mdash;perhaps a service for the dead; the high altar was still a blaze
of candles. This was an exhibition he always liked, and he dropped into a
seat with relief. More than it had ever yet come home to him it struck him
as good that there should be churches.
</p><p>
This one was almost empty, and the other altars were dim; a verger shuffled
about, an old woman coughed, but it seemed to Stransom there was hospitality
in the thick, street air. Was it only the savor of the incense, or was it
something larger and more guaranteed? He had at any rate quitted the great
gray suburb and come nearer to the warm center. He presently ceased to feel
an intruder&mdash;he gained at last even a sense of community with the only worshipper
in his neighborhood, the somber presence of a woman, in mourning unrelieved,
whose back was all he could see of her, and who had sunk deep into prayer
at no great distance from him. He wished he could sink, like her, to the
very bottom, be as motionless, as rapt in prostration. After a few moments
be shifted his seat; it was almost indelicate to be so aware of her. But
Stransom subsequently lost himself altogether, he floated away on the sea
of light. If occasions like this had been more frequent in his life, he would
have been more frequently conscious of the great original type, set up in
a myriad temples, of the unapproachable shrine he had erected in his mind.
That shrine had begun as a reflection of ecclesiastical pomps, but the echo
had ended by growing more distinct than the sound. The sound now rang out,
the type blazed at him with all its fires and with a mystery of radiance
in which endless meanings could glow. The thing became, as he sat there,
his appropriate altar, and each starry candle an appropriate vow. He numbered
them, he named them, he grouped them&mdash;it was the silent roll call of his
Dead. They made together a brightness vast and intense&mdash;a brightness in which
the mere chapel of his thoughts grew so dim that, as it faded away, he asked
himself if he shouldn't find his real comfort in some material act, some
outward worship.
</p><p>
This idea took possession of him while, at a distance, the black-robed lady
continued prostrate; he was quietly thrilled with his conception, which at
last brought him to his feet in his sudden excitement of a plan. He wandered
softly about the church, pausing in the different chapels, which were all,
save one, applied to a special devotion. It was in this one, dark and
ungarnished, he stood longest&mdash;the length of time it took him fully to grasp
the conception of gilding it with his bounty. He should snatch it from no
other rites and associate it with nothing profane; he would simply take it
as it should be given up to him and make it a masterpiece of splendor and
a mountain of fire. Tended sacredly all the year, with the sanctifying church
around it, it would always be ready for his offices. There would be difficulties,
but from the first they presented themselves only as difficulties surmounted.
Even for a person so little affiliated, the thing would be a matter of
arrangement. He saw it all in advance, and how bright in especial the place
would become to him in the intermission of toil and the dusk of afternoons;
how rich in assurance at all times, but especially in the indifferent world.
Before withdrawing he drew nearer again to the spot where he had first sat
down, and in the movement he met the lady whom he had seen praying and who
was now on her way to the door. She passed him quickly, and he had only a
glimpse of her pale face and her unconscious, almost sightless eyes. For
that instant she looked faded and handsome.
</p><p>
This was the origin of the rites more public, yet certainly esoteric, that
he at last found himself able to establish. It took a long time, it took
a year; and both the process and the result would have been&mdash;for any who
knew&mdash;a vivid picture of his good faith. No one did know, in fact&mdash;no one
but the bland ecclesiastic whose acquaintance he had promptly sought, whose
objections he had softly overridden, whose curiosity and sympathy he had
artfully charmed, whose assent to his eccentric munificence he had eventually
won, and who had asked for concessions in exchange for indulgences. Stransom
had of course at an early stage of his inquiry been referred to the bishop,
and the bishop had been delightfully human; the bishop had been almost amused.
Success was within sight, at any rate, from the moment the attitude of those
whom it concerned became liberal in response to liberality. The altar and
the small chapel that enclosed it, consecrated to an ostensible and customary
worship, were to be splendidly maintained; all that Stransom reserved to
himself was the number of his lights and the free enjoyment of his intention.
When the intention had taken complete effect, the enjoyment became even greater
than he had ventured to hope. He liked to think of this effect when he was
far from it&mdash;he liked to convince himself of it yet again when he was near.
He was not often, indeed, so near as that a visit to it had not perforce
something of the patience of a pilgrimage; but the time he gave to his devotion
came to seem to him more a contribution to his other interests than a betrayal
of them. Even a loaded life might be easier when one had added a new necessity
to it.
</p><p>
How much easier was probably never guessed by those who simply knew that
there were hours when he disappeared, and for many of whom there was a vulgar
reading of what they used to call his plunges. These plunges were into depths
quieter than the deep sea caves; and the habit, at the end of a year or two,
had become the one it would have cost him most to relinquish. Now they had
really, his Dead, something that was indefeasibly theirs; and he liked to
think that they might, in cases, be the Dead of others, as well as that the
Dead of others might be invoked there under the protection of what he had
done. Whoever bent a knee on the carpet he had laid down appeared to him
to act in the spirit of his intention. Each of his lights had a name for
him, and from time to time a new light was kindled. This was what he had
fundamentally agreed for, that there should always be room for them all.
What those who passed or lingered saw was simply the most resplendent of
the altars, called suddenly into vivid usefulness, with a quiet elderly man,
for whom it evidently had a fascination, often seated there in a maze or
a doze; but half the satisfaction of the spot, for this mysterious and fitful
worshipper, was that he found the years of his life there, and the ties,
the affections, the struggles, the submissions, the conquests, if there had
been such a record of that adventurous journey in which the beginnings and
the endings of human relations are the lettered milestones. He had in general
little taste for the past as a past of his own history; at other times and
in other places, it mostly seemed to him pitiful to consider and impossible
to repair; but on these occasions he accepted it with something of that positive
gladness with which one adjusts one's self to an ache that is beginning to
succumb to treatment. To the treatment of time the malady of life begins
at a given moment to succumb; and these were doubtless the hours at which
that truth most came home to him. The day was written for him there on which
he had first become acquainted with death, and the successive phases of the
acquaintance were each marked with a flame.
</p><p>
The flames were gathering thick at present, for Stransom had entered that
dark defile of our earthly descent in which someone dies every day. It was
only yesterday that Kate Creston had flashed out her white fire; yet already
there were younger stars ablaze on the tips of the tapers. Various persons
in whom his interest had not been intense drew closer to him by entering
this company. He went over it, head by head, till he felt like the shepherd
of a huddled flock, with all a shepherd's vision of differences imperceptible.
He knew his candles apart, up to the color of the flame, and would still
have known them had their positions all been changed. To other imaginations
they might stand for other things&mdash;that they should stand for something to
be hushed before was all he desired; but he was intensely conscious of the
personal note of each and of the distinguishable way it contributed to the
concert. There were hours at which he almost caught himself wishing that
certain of his friends would now die, that he might establish with them in
this manner a connection more charming than, as it happened, it was possible
to enjoy with them in life. In regard to those from whom one was separated
by the long curves of the globe such a connection could only be an improvement;
it brought them instantly within reach. Of course there were gaps in the
constellation, for Stransom knew he could only pretend to act for his own,
and it was not every figure passing before his eyes into the great obscure
that was entitled to a memorial. There was a strange sanctification in death,
but some characters were more sanctified by being forgotten than by being
remembered. The greatest blank in the shining page was the memory of Acton
Hague, of which he inveterately tried to rid himself. For Acton Hague no
flame could ever rise on any altar of his.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="4" id="d7"><head>IV</head>
<p>
Every year, the day he walked back from the great graveyard, he went to church
as he had done the day his idea was born. It was on this occasion, as it
happened, after a year had passed, that he began to observe his altar to
be haunted by a worshipper at least as frequent as himself. Others of the
faithful, and in the rest of the church, came and went, appealing sometimes,
when they disappeared, to a vague or to a particular recognition; but this
unfailing presence was always to be observed when he arrived and still in
possession when he departed. He was surprised, the first time, at the promptitude
with which it assumed an identity for him &mdash;
 the identity of the lady whom,
two years before, on his anniversary, he had seen so intensely bowed, and
of whose tragic face he had had so flitting a vision. Given the time that
had elapsed, his recollection of her was fresh enough to make him wonder.
Of himself she had, of course, no impression, or, rather, she had none at
first. The time came when her manner of transacting her business suggested
to him that she had gradually guessed his call to be of the same order. She
used his altar for her own purpose; he could only hope that, sad and solitary
as she always struck him, she used it for her own Dead. There were interruptions,
infidelities, all on his part, calls to other associations and duties; but
as the months went on he found her whenever he returned, and he ended by
taking pleasure in the thought that he had given her almost the contentment
he had given himself. They worshipped side by side so often that there were
moments when he wished he might be sure, so straight did their prospect stretch
away of growing old together in their rites. She was younger than he, but
she looked as if her Dead were at least as numerous as his candles. She had
no color, no sound, no fault, and another of the things about which he had
made up his mind was that she had no fortune. She was always black-robed,
as if she had had a succession of sorrows. People were not poor, after all,
whom so many losses could overtake; they were positively rich when they had
so much to give up. But the air of this devoted and indifferent woman, who
always made, in any attitude, a beautiful, accidental line, conveyed somehow
to Stransom that she had known more kinds of trouble than one.
</p><p>
He had a great love of music and little time for the joy of it; but occasionally,
when workaday noises were muffled by Saturday afternoons, it used to come
back to him that there were glories. There were, moreover, friends who reminded
him of this, and side by side with whom he found himself sitting out concerts.
On one of these winter evenings, in St. James' Hall, he became aware, after
he had seated himself, that the lady he had so often seen at church was in
the place next him and was evidently alone, as he also this time happened
to be. She was at first too absorbed in the consideration of the program
to heed him, but when she at last glanced at him he took advantage of the
movement to speak to her, greeting her with the remark that he felt as if
he already knew her. She smiled as she said: "Oh, yes! I recognize you."
Yet in spite of this admission of their long acquaintance, it was the first
time he had ever seen her smile. The effect of it was suddenly to contribute
more to that acquaintance than all the previous meetings had done. He hadn't
"taken in," he said to himself, that she was so pretty. Later that evening
(it was while he rolled along in a hansom on his way to dine out) he added
that he hadn't taken in that she was so interesting. The next morning, in
the midst of his work, he quite suddenly and irrelevantly reflected that
his impression of her, beginning so far back, was like a winding river that
had at last reached the sea.
</p><p>
His work was indeed blurred a little, all that day, by the sense of what
had now passed between them. It wasn't much, but it had just made the difference.
They had listened together to Beethoven and Schumann; they had talked in
the pauses and at the end, when at the door, to which they moved together,
he had asked her if he could help her in the matter of getting away. She
had thanked him and put up her umbrella, slipping into the crowd without
an allusion to their meeting yet again, and leaving him to remember at leisure
that not a word had been exchanged about the place in which they frequently
met. This circumstance seemed to him at one moment natural enough and at
another perverse. She mightn't in the least have recognized his warrant for
speaking to her; and yet; if she hadn't, he would have judged her an underbred
woman. It was odd that, when nothing had really ever brought them together,
he should have been able successfully to assume that they were in a manner
old friends&mdash;that this negative quantity was somehow more than they could
express. His success, it was true, had been qualified by her quick escape,
so that there grew up in him an absurd desire to put it to some better test.
Save insofar as some other improbable accident might assist him, such a test
could be only to meet her afresh at church. Left to himself he would have
gone to church the very next afternoon, just for the curiosity of seeing
if he should find her there. But he was not left to himself, a fact he discovered
quite at the last, after he had virtually made up his mind to go. The influence
that kept him away really revealed to him how little to himself his Dead
ever left him. They reminded him that he went only for them&mdash;for nothing
else in the world.
</p><p>
The force of this reminder kept him away ten days; he hated to connect the
place with anything but his offices, or to give a glimpse of the curiosity
that had been on the point of moving him. It was absurd to weave a tangle
about a matter so simple as a custom of devotion that might so easily have
been daily or hourly; yet the tangle got itself woven. He was sorry, he was
disappointed; it was as if a long, happy spell had been broken and he had
lost a familiar security. At the last, however, he asked himself if he was
to stay away forever from the fear of this muddle about motives. After an
interval, neither longer nor shorter than usual, he re-entered the church
with a clear conviction that he should scarcely heed the presence or the
absence of the lady of the concert. This indifference didn't prevent his
instantly perceiving that for the only time since he had first seen her she
was not on the spot. He had now no scruple about giving her time to arrive,
but she didn't arrive, and when he went away still missing her he was quite
profanely and consentingly sorry. If her absence made the tangle more intricate,
that was only her fault. By the end of another year it was very intricate
indeed; but by that time he didn't in the least care, and it was only his
cultivated consciousness that had given him scruples. Three times in three
months he had gone to church without finding her, and he felt that he had
not needed these occasions to show him that his suspense had quite dropped.
Yet it was, incongruously, not indifference, but a refinement of delicacy
that had kept him from asking the sacristan, who would of course immediately
have recognized his description of her, whether she had been seen at other
hours. His delicacy had kept him from asking any question about her at any
time, and it was exactly the same virtue that had left him so free to be
decently civil to her at the concert.
</p><p>
This happy advantage now served him anew, enabling him when she finally met
his eyes&mdash;it was after a fourth trial&mdash;to determine without hesitation to
wait till she should retire. He joined her in the street as soon as she had
done so, and asked her if he might accompany her a certain distance. With
her placid permission he went as far as a house in the neighborhood at which
she had business; she let him know it was not where she lived. She lived,
as she said, in a mere slum, with an old aunt, a person in connection with
whom she spoke of the engrossment of humdrum duties and regular occupations.
She was not, the mourning niece, in her first youth, and her vanished freshness
had left something behind which, for Stransom, represented the proof that
it had been tragically sacrificed. Whatever she gave him the assurance of
she gave it without references. She might in fact have been a divorced duchess,
and she might have been an old maid who taught the harp.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="5" id="d8"><head>V</head>
<p>
They fell at last into the way of walking together almost every time they
met, though, for a long time, they never met anywhere save at church. He
couldn't ask her to come and see him, and, as if she had not a proper place
to receive him, she never invited him. As much as himself she knew the world
of London, but from an undiscussed instinct of privacy they haunted the region
not mapped on the social chart. On the return she always made him leave her
at the same corner. She looked with him, as a pretext for a pause, at the
depressed things in suburban shopfronts; and there was never a word he had
said to her that she had not beautifully understood. For long ages he never
knew her name, any more than she had ever pronounced his own; but it was
not their names that mattered, it was only their perfect practice and their
common need.
</p><p>
These things made their whole relation so impersonal that they had not the
rules or reasons people found in ordinary friendships. They didn't care for
the things it was supposed necessary to care for in the intercourse of the
world. They ended one day (they never knew which of them expressed it first)
by throwing out the idea that they didn't care for each other. Over this
idea they grew quite intimate; they rallied to it in a way that marked a
fresh start in their confidence. If to feel deeply together about certain
things wholly distinct from themselves didn't constitute a safety, where
was safety to be looked for? Not lightly nor often, not without occasion
nor without emotion, any more than in any other reference by serious people
to a mystery of their faith; but when something had happened to warm, as
it were, the air for it, they came as near as they could come to calling
their Dead by name. They felt it was coming very near to utter their thought
at all. The word "they" expressed enough; it limited the mention, it had
a dignity of its own, and if, in their talk, you had heard our friends use
it, you might have taken them for a pair of pagans of old alluding decently
to the domesticated gods. They never knew&mdash;at least Stransom never knew&mdash;how
they had learned to be sure about each other. If it had been with each a
question of what the other was there for, the certitude had come in some
fine way of its own. Any faith, after all, has the instinct of propagation,
and it was as natural as it was beautiful that they should have taken pleasure
on the spot in the imagination of a following. If the following was for each
but a following of one, it had proved in the event to be sufficient. Her
debt, however, of course, was much greater than his, because while she had
only given him a worshipper he had given her a magnificent temple. Once she
said she pitied him for the length of his list (she had counted his candles
almost as often as himself) and this made him wonder what could have been
the length of hers. He had wondered before at the coincidence of their losses,
especially as from time to time a new candle was set up. On some occasion
some accident led him to express this curiosity, and she answered as if she
was surprised that he hadn't already understood. "Oh, for me, you know, the
more there are the better&mdash;there could never be too many. I should like hundreds
and hundreds&mdash;I should like thousands; I should like a perfect mountain of
light."
</p><p>
Then, of course, in a flash, he understood. "Your Dead are only One?"
</p><p>
She hesitated as she had never hesitated. "Only One," she answered, coloring
as if now he knew her innermost secret. It really made him feel that he knew
less than before, so difficult was it for him to reconstitute a life in which
a single experience had reduced all others to nought. His own life, round
its central hollow, had been packed close enough. After this she appeared
to have regretted her confession, though at the moment she spoke there had
been pride in her very embarrassment. She declared to him that his own was
the larger, the dearer possession&mdash;the portion one would have chosen if one
had been able to choose; she assured him she could perfectly imagine some
of the echoes with which his silences were peopled. He knew she couldn't;
one's relation to what one had loved and hated had been a relation too distinct
from the relations of others. But this didn't affect the fact that they were
growing old together in their piety. She was a feature of that piety, but
even at the ripe stage of acquaintance in which they occasionally arranged
to meet at a concert, or to go together to an exhibition, she was not a feature
of anything else. The most that happened was that his worship became paramount.
Friend by friend dropped away till at last there were more emblems on his
altar than houses left him to enter. She was more than any other the friend
who remained, but she was unknown to all the rest. Once when she had discovered,
as they called it, a new star, she used the expression that the chapel at
last was full.
</p><p>
"Oh, no!" Stransom replied, "there is a great thing wanting for that! The
chapel will never be full till a candle is set up before which all the others
will pale. It will be the tallest candle of all."
</p><p>
Her mild wonder rested on him. "What candle do you mean?"
</p><p>
"I mean, dear lady, my own."
</p><p>
He had learned after a long time that she earned money by her pen, writing
under a designation that she never told him in magazines that he never saw.
She knew too well what he couldn't read and what she couldn't write, and
she taught him to cultivate indifference with a success that did much for
their good relations. Her invisible industry was a convenience to him; it
helped his contented thought of her, the thought that rested in the dignity
of her proud, obscure life, her little remunerated art and her little
impenetrable home. Lost, with her obscure relative, in her dim suburban world,
she came to the surface for him in distant places. She was really the priestess
of his altar, and whenever he quitted England he committed it to her keeping.
She proved to him afresh that women have more of the spirit of religion than
men; he felt his fidelity pale and faint in comparison with hers. He often
said to her that since he had so little time to live he rejoiced in her having
so much; so glad was he to think she would guard the temple when he should
have ceased. He had a great plan for that, which, of course, he told her,
too, a bequest of money to keep it up in undiminished state. Of the
administration of this fund he would appoint her superintendent, and, if
the spirit should move her, she might kindle a taper even for him.
</p><p>
"And who will kindle one even for me?" she gravely inquired.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="6" id="d9"><head>VI</head>
<p>
She was always in mourning, yet the day he came back from the longest absence
he had yet made her appearance immediately told him she had lately had a
bereavement. They met on this occasion as she was leaving the church, so
that, postponing his own entrance, he instantly offered to turn round and
walk away with her. She considered, then she said: "Go in now, but come and
see me in an hour." He knew the small vista of her street, closed at the
end and as dreary as an empty pocket, where the pairs of shabby little houses,
semidetached but indissolubly united, were like married couples on bad terms.
Often, however, as he had gone to the beginning, he had never gone beyond.
Her aunt was dead&mdash;that he immediately guessed, as well as that it made a
difference; but when she had for the first time mentioned her number he found
himself, on her leaving him, not a little agitated by this sudden liberality.
She was not a person with whom, after all, one got on so very fast; it had
taken him months and months to learn her name, years and years to learn her
address. If she had looked, on this reunion, so much older to him, how in
the world did he look to her? She had reached the period of life that he
had long since reached, when, after separations, the dreadful clock-face
of the friend we meet announces the hour we have tried to forget. He couldn't
have said what he expected, as, at the end of his waiting, he turned the
corner at which, for years, he had always paused; simply not to pause was
a sufficient cause for emotion. It was an event, somehow; and in all their
long acquaintance there had never been such a thing. The event grew larger
when, five minutes later, in the faint elegance of her little drawing room,
she quavered out some greeting which showed the measure she took of it. He
had a strange sense of having come for something in particular; strange because,
literally, there was nothing particular between them, nothing save that they
were at one on their great point, which had long ago become a magnificent
matter of course. It was true that, after she had said, "You can always come
now, you know," the thing he was there for seemed already to have happened.
He asked her if it was the death of her aunt that made the difference; to
which she replied: "She never knew I knew you. I wished her not to." The
beautiful clearness of her candor&mdash;her faded beauty was like a summer
twilight&mdash;disconnected the words from any image of deceit. They might have
struck him as the record of a deep dissimulation; but she had always given
him a sense of noble reasons. The vanished aunt was present, as he looked
about him, in the small complacencies of the room, the beaded velvet and
the fluted moreen; and though, as we know, he had the worship of the dead,
he found himself not definitely regretting this lady. If she was not in his
long list, however, she was in her niece's short one, and Stransom presently
observed to his friend that now, at least, in the place they haunted together,
she would have another object of devotion.
</p><p>
"Yes, I shall have another. She was very kind to me. It's that that makes
the difference."
</p><p>
He judged, wondering a good deal before he made any motion to leave her,
that the difference would somehow be very great and would consist of still
other things than her having let him come in. It rather chilled him, for
they had been happy together as they were. He extracted from her at any rate
an intimation that she should now have larger means, that her aunt's tiny
fortune had come to her, so that there was henceforth only one to consume
what had formerly been made to suffice for two. This was a joy to Stransom,
because it had hitherto been equally impossible for him either to offer her
presents or to find contentment in not doing so. It was too ugly to be at
her side that way, abounding himself and yet not able to overflow&mdash;a
demonstration that would have been a signally false note. Even her better
situation too seemed only to draw out in a sense the loneliness of her future.
It would merely help her to live more and more for their small ceremonial,
at a time when he himself had begun wearily to feel that, having set it in
motion, he might depart. When they had sat a while in the pale parlor she
got up and said: "This isn't <hi rend="italic">my</hi> room: let us go into mine." They had
only to cross the narrow hall, as he found, to pass into quite another air.
When she had closed the door of the second room, as she called it, he felt
that he had at last real possession of her. The place had the flush of life&mdash;it
was expressive; its dark red walls were articulate with memories and relics.
These were simple things&mdash;photographs and watercolors, scraps of writing
framed and ghosts of flowers embalmed; but only a moment was needed to show
him they had a common meaning. It was here that she had lived and worked;
and she had already told him she would make no change of scene. He saw that
the objects about her mainly had reference to certain places and times; but
after a minute he distinguished among them a small portrait of a gentleman.
At a distance and without their glasses, his eyes were only caught by it
enough to feel a vague curiosity. Presently this impulse carried him nearer,
and in another moment he was staring at the picture in stupefaction and with
the sense that some sound had broken from him. He was further conscious that
he showed his companion a white face when he turned round on her with the
exclamation: "Acton Hague!"
</p><p>
She gave him back his astonishment. "Did you know him?"
</p><p>
"He was the friend of all my youth&mdash;my early manhood. And <hi rend="italic">you</hi> knew
him?"
</p><p>
She colored at this, and for a moment her answer failed; her eyes took in
everything in the place, and a strange irony reached her lips as she echoed:
"Knew him?"
</p><p>
Then Stransom understood, while the room heaved like the cabin of a ship,
that its whole contents cried out with him, that it was a museum in his honor,
that all her later years had been addressed to him, and that the shrine he
himself had reared had been passionately converted to this use. It was all
for Acton Hague that she had kneeled every day at his altar. What need had
there been for a consecrated candle when he was present in the whole array?
The revelation seemed to smite our friend in the face, and he dropped into
a seat and sat silent. He had quickly become aware that she was shocked at
the vision of his own shock, but as she sank on the sofa beside him and laid
her hand on his arm he perceived almost as soon that she was unable to resent
it as much as she would have liked.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="7" id="d10"><head>VII</head>
<p>
He learned in that instant two things: one of them was that even in so long
a time she had gathered no knowledge of his great intimacy and his great
quarrel; the other was that, in spite of this ignorance, strangely enough,
she supplied on the spot a reason for his confusion. "How extraordinary,"
he presently exclaimed, "that we should never have known!"
</p><p>
She gave a wan smile, which seemed to Stransom stranger even than the fact
itself. "I never, never spoke of him."
</p><p>
Stransom looked about the room again, "Why then, if your life had been so
full of him?"
</p><p>
"Mayn't I put you that question as well. Hadn't your life also been full
of him?"
</p><p>
"Anyone's, everyone's life was who had the wonderful experience of knowing
him. I never spoke of him," Stransom added in a moment, "because he did me&mdash;years
ago&mdash;an unforgettable wrong." She was silent, and with the full effect of
his presence all about them it almost startled her visitor to hear no protest
escape from her. She accepted his words; he turned his eyes to her again
to see in what manner she accepted them. It was with rising tears, and an
extraordinary sweetness in the movement of putting out her hand to take his
own. Nothing more wonderful had ever appeared to Stransom than, in that little
chamber of remembrance and homage, to see her convey with such exquisite
mildness that, as from Acton Hague, any injury was credible. The clock ticked
in the stillness&mdash;Hague had probably given it to her&mdash;and while he let her
hold his hand with a tenderness that was almost an assumption of responsibility
for his old pain as well as his new, Stransom after a minute broke out: "Good
God, how he must have used <hi rend="italic">you!"</hi>
</p><p>
She dropped his hand at this, got up, and, moving across the room, made straight
a small picture to which, on examining it, he had given a slight push. Then,
turning round on him, with her pale gaiety recovered: "I've forgiven him!"
she declared.
</p><p>
"I know what you've done," said Stransom; "I know what you've done for years."
For a moment they looked at each other across the room, with their long community
of service in their eyes. This short passage made, to Stransom's sense, for
the woman before him, an immense, an absolutely naked confession; which was
presently, suddenly blushing red and changing her place again, what she appeared
to become aware that he perceived in it. He got up, "How you must have loved
him!"
</p><p>
"Women are not like men. They can love even where they've suffered."
</p><p>
"Women are wonderful," said Stransom. "But I assure you I've forgiven him,
too."
</p><p>
"If I had known of anything so strange, I wouldn't have brought you here."
</p><p>
"So that we might have gone on in our ignorance to the last?"
</p><p>
"What do you call the last?" she asked, smiling still.
</p><p>
At this he could smile back at her. "You'll see&mdash;when it comes."
</p><p>
She reflected a moment. "This is better perhaps; but as we were&mdash;it was good."
</p><p>
"Did it never happen that he spoke of me?" Stransom inquired.
</p><p>
Considering more intently, she made no answer, and he quickly recognized
that he would have been adequately answered by her asking how often he himself
had spoken of their terrible friend. Suddenly a brighter light broke in her
face and an excited idea sprang to her lips in the question: "You <hi rend="italic">have</hi>
forgiven him?"
</p><p>
"How, if I hadn't, could I linger here?"
</p><p>
She winced, for an instant, at the deep but unintended irony of this; but
even while she did so, she panted quickly: "Then in the lights on your altar?"
</p><p>
"There's never a light for Acton Hague!"
</p><p>
She stared, with a great visible fall. "But if he's one of your Dead?"
</p><p>
"He's one of the world's, if you like&mdash;he's one of yours. But he's not one
of mine. Mine are only the Dead who died possessed of me. They're mine in
death because they were mine in life."
</p><p>
<hi rend="italic">"He</hi> was yours in life, then, even if for a while he ceased to be.
If you forgave him, you went back to him. Those whom we've once loved&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Are those who can hurt us most," Stransom broke in.
</p><p>
"Ah, it's not true&mdash;you've <hi rend="italic">not</hi> forgiven him!" she wailed with a passion
that startled him,
</p><p>
He looked at her a moment. "What was it he did to you?"
</p><p>
"Everything!" Then abruptly she put out her hand in farewell. "Goodbye."
</p><p>
He turned as cold as he had turned that night he read of the death of Acton
Hague. "You mean that we meet no more?"
</p><p>
"Not as we have met&mdash;not <hi rend="italic">there!"</hi>
</p><p>
He stood aghast at this snap of their great bond, at the renouncement that
rang out in the word she so passionately emphasized. "But what's changed
&mdash;
 for you?"
</p><p>
She hesitated, in all the vividness of a trouble that, for the first time
since he had known her, made her splendidly stern. "How can you understand
now when you didn't understand before?"
</p><p>
"I didn't understand before only because I didn't know. Now that I know,
I see what I've been living with for years," Stransom went on very gently.
</p><p>
She looked at him with a larger allowance, as if she appreciated his good
nature. "How can I, then, with this new knowledge of my own, ask you to continue
to live with it?"
</p><p>
"I set up my altar, with its multiplied meanings Stransom began; but she
quickly interrupted him:
</p><p>
"You set up your altar, and when I wanted one most I found it magnificently
ready. I used it, with the gratitude I've always shown you, for I knew from
of old that it was dedicated to Death. I told you, long ago, that my Dead
were not many. Yours were, but all you had done for them was none too much
for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> worship! You had placed a great light for Each&mdash;I gathered
them together for One!"
</p><p>
"We had simply different intentions," Stransom replied. "That, as you say,
I perfectly knew, and I don't see why your intention shouldn't still sustain
you."
</p><p>
"That's because you're generous&mdash;you can imagine and think. But the spell
is broken."
</p><p>
It seemed to poor Stransom, in spite of his resistance, that it really was,
and the prospect stretched gray and void before him. All, however, that he
could say was: "I hope you'll try before you give up."
</p><p>
"If I had known you had ever known him, I should have taken for granted he
had his candle," she presently rejoined. "What's changed, as you say, is
that on making the discovery I find he never has had it. That makes <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
attitude"&mdash;she paused a moment, as if thinking how to express it, then said
simply&mdash;"all wrong."
</p><p>
"Come once again," Stransom pleaded.
</p><p>
"Will you give him his candle?" she asked.
</p><p>
He hesitated, but only because it would sound ungracious; not because he
had a doubt of his feeling. "I can't do that!" he declared at last.
</p><p>
"Then goodbye." And she gave him her hand again.
</p><p>
He had got his dismissal; besides which, in the agitation of everything that
had opened out to him, he felt the need to recover himself as he could only
do in solitude. Yet he lingered&mdash;lingered to see if she had no compromise
to express, no attenuation to propose. But he only met her great lamenting
eyes, in which indeed he read that she was as sorry for him as for anyone
else. This made him say: "At least, at any rate, I may see you here."
</p><p>
"Oh, yes! come if you like. But I don't think it will do."
</p><p>
Stransom looked round the room once more; he felt in truth by no means sure
it would do. He felt also stricken and more and more cold, and his chill
was like an ague in which he had to make an effort not to shake. "I must
try on my side, if you can't try on yours," he dolefully rejoined. She came
out with him to the hall and into the doorway, and here he put to her the
question that seemed to him the one he could least answer from his own wit.
"Why have you never let me come before?"
</p><p>
"Because my aunt would have seen you, and I should have had to tell her how
I came to know you."
</p><p>
"And what would have been the objection to that?"
</p><p>
"It would have entailed other explanations; there would at any rate have
been that danger."
</p><p>
"Surely she knew you went every day to church," Stransom objected.
</p><p>
"She didn't know what I went for."
</p><p>
"Of me then she never even heard?"
</p><p>
"You'll think I was deceitful. But I didn't need to be!"
</p><p>
Stransom was now on the lower doorstep, and his hostess held the door half-closed
behind him. Through what remained of the opening he saw her framed face.
He made a supreme appeal. "What <hi rend="italic">did</hi> he do to you?"
</p><p>
"It would have come out&mdash;<hi rend="italic">she</hi> would have told you. That fear, at my
heart&mdash;that was my reason!" And she closed the door, shutting him out.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="8" id="d11"><head>VIII</head>
<p>
He had ruthlessly abandoned her&mdash;that, of course, was what he had done. Stransom
made it all out in solitude, at leisure, fitting the unmatched pieces gradually
together and dealing one by one with a hundred obscure points. She had known
Hague only after her present friend's relations with him had wholly terminated;
obviously indeed a good while after; and it was natural enough that of his
previous life she should have ascertained only what he had judged good to
communicate. There were passages it was quite conceivable that even in moments
of the tenderest expansion, he should have withheld. Of many facts in the
career of a man so in the eye of the world there was of course a common
knowledge; but this lady lived apart from public affairs, and the only period
perfectly clear to her would have been the period following the dawn of her
own drama. A man, in her place, would have "looked up" the past&mdash;would even
have consulted old newspapers. It remained similar indeed that in her long
contact with the partner of her retrospect no accident had lighted a train;
but there was no arguing about that; the accident had in fact come; it had
simply been that security had prevailed. She had taken what Hague had given
her, and her blankness in respect of his other connections was only a touch
in the picture of that plasticity Stransom had supreme reason to know so
great a master could have been trusted to produce.
</p><p>
This picture, for a while, was all that our friend saw; he caught his breath
again and again as it came over him that the woman with whom he had had for
years so fine a point of contact was a woman whom Acton Hague, of all men
in the world, had more or less fashioned. Such as she sat there today, she
was ineffaceably stamped with him. Beneficent, blameless as Stransom held
her, he couldn't rid himself of the sense that he had been the victim of
a fraud. She had imposed upon him hugely, though she had known it as little
as he. All this later past came back to him as a time grotesquely misspent.
Such at least were his first rejections; after a while he found himself more
divided and only, at the end of it, more troubled. He imagined, recalled,
reconstituted, figured out for himself the truth she had refused to give
him; the effect of which was to make her seem to him only more saturated
with her fate. He felt her spirit, in the strange business, to be finer than
his own in the very degree in which she might have been, in which she certainly
had been, more wronged. A woman, when she was wronged, was always more wronged
than a man, and there were conditions when the least she could have got off
with was more than the most he could have to endure. He was sure this rare
creature wouldn't have got off with the least. He was awestruck at the thought
of such a surrender&mdash;such a prostration. Molded indeed she had been by powerful
hands, to have converted her injury into an exaltation so sublime. The fellow
had only had to die for everything that was ugly in him to be washed out
in a torrent. It was vain to try to guess what had taken place, but nothing
could be clearer than that she had ended by accusing herself. She absolved
him at every point, she adored her very wounds. The passion by which he had
profited had rushed back after its ebb, and now the tide of tenderness, arrested
forever at flood, was too deep even to fathom. Stransom sincerely considered
that he had forgiven him; but how little he had achieved the miracle that
she had achieved! His forgiveness was silence, but hers was mere unuttered
sound. The light she had demanded for his altar would have broken his silence
with a blare; whereas all the lights in the church were for her too great
a hush.
</p><p>
She had been right about the difference&mdash;she had spoken the truth about the
change; Stransom felt before long that he was perversely but definitely jealous.
<hi rend="italic">His</hi> tide had ebbed, not flowed; if he had "forgiven" Acton Hague,
that forgiveness was a motive with a broken spring. The very fact of her
appeal for a material sign, a sign that should make her dead lover equal
there with the others, presented the concession to Stransom as too handsome
for the case. He had never thought of himself as hard, but an exorbitant
article might easily render him so. He moved round and round this one, but
only in widening circles&mdash;the more he looked at it the less acceptable it
appeared. At the same time he had no illusion about the effect of his refusal;
he perfectly saw that it was the beginning of a separation. He left her alone
for many days; but when at last he called upon her again this conviction
acquired a depressing force. In the interval he had kept away from the church,
and he needed no fresh assurance from her to know she had not entered it.
The change was complete enough; it had broken up her life. Indeed it had
broken up his, for all the fires of his shrine seemed to him suddenly to
have been quenched. A great indifference fell upon him, the weight of which
was in itself a pain; and he never knew what his devotion had been for him
till, in that shock, it stopped like a dropped watch. Neither did he know
with how large a confidence he had counted on the final service that had
now failed; the mortal deception was that in this abandonment the whole future
gave way.
</p><p>
These days of her absence proved to him of what she was capable; all the
more that he never dreamed she was vindictive or even resentful. It was not
in anger she had forsaken him; it was in absolute submission to hard reality,
to crude destiny. This came home to him when he sat with her again in the
room in which her late aunt's conversation lingered like the tone of a cracked
piano. She tried to make him forget how much they were estranged; but in
the very presence of what they had given up it was impossible not to be sorry
for her. He had taken from her so much more than she had taken from him.
He argued with her again, told her she could now have the altar to herself;
but she only shook her head with pleading sadness, begging him not to waste
his breath on the impossible, the extinct. Couldn't he see that, in relation
to her private need, the rites he had established were practically an elaborate
exclusion? She regretted nothing that had happened; it had all been right
so long as she didn't know, and it was only that now she knew too much, and
that from the moment their eyes were open they would simply have to conform.
It had doubtless been happiness enough for them to go on together so long.
She was gentle, grateful, resigned; but this was only the form of a deep
immutability. He saw that he should never more cross the threshold of the
second room, and he felt how much this alone would make a stranger of him
and give a conscious stiffness to his visits. He would have hated to plunge
again into that well of reminders, but he enjoyed quite as little the vacant
alternative.
</p><p>
After he had been with her three or four times it seemed to him that to have
come at last into her house had had the horrid effect of diminishing their
intimacy. He had known her better, had liked her in greater freedom, when
they merely walked together or kneeled together. Now they only pretended;
before they had been nobly sincere. They began to try their walks again,
but it proved a lame imitation, for these things, from the first, beginning
or ending, had been connected with their visits to the church. They had either
strolled away as they came out or had gone in to rest on the return. Besides,
Stransom now grew weary; he couldn't walk as of old. The omission made everything
false; it was a horrible mutilation of their lives. Our friend was frank
and monotonous; he made no mystery of his remonstrance and no secret of his
predicament. Her response, whatever it was, always came to the same thing&mdash;an
implied invitation to him to judge, if he spoke of predicaments, of how much
comfort she had in hers. For him indeed there was no comfort even in complaint,
for every allusion to what had befallen them only made the author of their
trouble more present. Acton Hague was between them, that was the essence
of the matter; and he was never so much between them as when they were face
to face. Stransom, even while he wanted to banish him, had the strangest
sense of desiring a satisfaction that could come only from having accepted
him. Deeply disconcerted by what he knew, he was still worse tormented by
really not knowing. Perfectly aware that it would have been horribly vulgar
to abuse his old friend or to tell his companion the story of their quarrel,
it yet vexed him that her depth of reserve should give him no opening and
should have the effect of a magnanimity greater even than his own.
</p><p>
He challenged himself, denounced himself, asked himself if he were in love
with her that he should care so much what adventures she had had. He had
never for a moment admitted that he was in love with her; therefore nothing
could have surprised him more than to discover that he was jealous. What
but jealousy could give a man that sore, contentious wish to have the detail
of what would make him suffer? Well enough he knew indeed that he should
never have it from the only person who, today, could give it to him. She
let him press her with his somber eyes, only smiling at him with an exquisite
mercy and breathing equally little the word that would expose her secret
and the word that would appear to deny his literal right to bitterness. She
told nothing, she judged nothing; she accepted everything but the possibility
of her return to the old symbol. Stransom divined that for her, too, they
had been vividly individual, had stood for particular hours or particular
attributes&mdash;particular links in her chain. He made it clear to himself, as
he believed, that his difficulty lay in the fact that the very nature of
the plea for his faithless friend constituted a prohibition; that it happened
to have come from <hi rend="italic">her</hi> was precisely the vice that attached to it.
To the voice of impersonal generosity he felt sure he would have listened;
he would have deferred to an advocate who, speaking from abstract justice,
knowing of his omission, without having known Hague, should have had the
imagination to say: "Oh, remember only the best of him; pity him; provide
for him!" To provide for him on the very ground of having discovered another
of his turpitudes was not to pity him, but to glorify him. The more Stransom
thought, the more he made it out that this relation of Hague's, whatever
it was, could only have been a deception finely practiced. Where had it come
into the life that all men saw? Why had he never heard of it, if it had had
the frankness of an attitude honorable? Stransom knew enough of his other
ties, of his obligations and appearances, not to say enough of his general
character, to be sure there had been some infamy. In one way or another the
poor woman had been coldly sacrificed. That was why, at the last as well
as the first, he must still leave him out.
</p></div2>
<div2 type="chapter" n="9" id="d12"><head>IX</head>
<p>
And yet this was no solution, especially after he had talked again to his
friend of all it had been his plan that she should finally do for him. He
had talked in the other days, and she had responded with a frankness qualified
only by a courteous reluctance&mdash;a reluctance that touched him&mdash;to linger
on the question of his death. She had then practically accepted the charge,
suffered him to feel that he could depend upon her to be the eventual guardian
of his shrine; and it was in the name of what had so passed between them
that he appealed to her not to forsake him in his old age. She listened to
him now with a sort of shining coldness and all her habitual forbearance
to insist on her terms; her deprecation was even still tenderer, for it expressed
the compassion of her own sense that he was abandoned. Her terms, however,
remained the same, and scarcely the less audible for not being uttered; although
he was sure that, secretly, even more than he, she felt bereft of the
satisfaction his solemn trust was to have provided for her. They both missed
the rich future, but she missed it most, because, after all, it was to have
been entirely hers; and it was her acceptance of the loss that gave him the
full measure of her preference for the thought of Acton Hague over any other
thought whatever. He had humor enough to laugh rather grimly when he said
to himself: "Why the deuce does she like him so much more than she likes
me?"&mdash;the reasons being really so conceivable. But even his faculty of analysis
left the irritation standing, and this irritation proved perhaps the greatest
misfortune that had ever overtaken him. There had been nothing yet that made
him so much want to give up. He had of course by this time well reached the
age of renouncement; but it had not hitherto been vivid to him that it was
time to give up everything.
</p><p>
Practically, at the end of six months, he had renounced the friendship that
was once so charming and comforting. His privation had two faces, and the
face it had turned to him on the occasion of his last attempts to cultivate
that friendship was the one he could look at least. This was the privation
he inflicted; the other was the privation he bore. The conditions she never
phrased he used to murmur to himself in solitude: "One more, one more&mdash;only
just one." Certainly he was going down; he often felt it when he caught himself,
over his work, staring at vacancy and giving voice to that inanity. There
was proof enough besides in his being so weak and so ill. His irritation
took the form of melancholy, and his melancholy that of the conviction that
his health had quite failed. His altar, moreover, had ceased to exist; his
chapel, in his dreams, was a great dark cavern. All the lights had gone out&mdash;all
his Dead had died again. He couldn't exactly see at first how it had been
in the power of his late companion to extinguish them, since it was neither
for her nor by her that they had been called into being. Then he understood
that it was essentially in his own soul the revival had taken place, and
that in the air of this soul they were now unable to breathe. The candles
might mechanically burn, but each of them had lost its luster. The church
had become a void; it was his presence, her presence, their common presence,
that had made the indispensable medium. If anything was wrong everything
was&mdash;her silence spoiled the tune.
</p><p>
Then, when three months were gone, he felt so lonely that he went back;
reflecting that as they had been his best society for years his Dead perhaps
wouldn't let him forsake them without doing something more for him. They
stood there, as he had left them, in their tall radiance, the bright cluster
that had already made him, on occasions when he was willing to compare small
things with great, liken them to a group of sea lights on the edge of the
ocean of life. It was a relief to him, after a while, as he sat there, to
feel that they had still a virtue. He was more and more easily tired, and
he always drove now; the action of his heart was weak, and gave him none
of the reassurance conferred by the action of his fancy. Nonetheless he returned
yet again, returned several times, and finally, during six months, haunted
the place with a renewal of frequency and a strain of impatience. In winter
the church was unwarmed, and exposure to cold was forbidden him, but the
glow of his shrine was an influence in which he could almost bask. He sat
and wondered to what he had reduced his absent associate, and what she now
did with the hours of her absence. There were other churches, there were
other altars, there were other candles; in one way or another her piety would
still operate; he couldn't absolutely have deprived her of her rites. So
he argued, but without contentment; for he well enough knew there was no
other such rare semblance of the mountain of light she had once mentioned
to him as the satisfaction of her need. As this semblance again gradually
grew great to him and his pious practice more regular, there was a sharper
and sharper pang for him in the imagination of her darkness; for never so
much as in these weeks had his rites been real, never had his gathered company
seemed so to respond and even to invite. He lost himself in the large luster,
which was more and more what he had from the first wished it to be&mdash;as dazzling
as the vision of heaven in the mind of a child. He wandered in the fields
of light; he passed, among the tall tapers, from tier to tier, from fire
to fire, from name to name, from the white intensity of one clear emblem,
of one saved soul, to another. It was in the quiet sense of having saved
his souls that his deep, strange instinct rejoiced. This was no dim theological
rescue, no boon of a contingent world; they were saved better than faith
or works could save them, saved for the warm world they had shrunk from dying
to, for actuality, for continuity, for the certainty of human remembrance.
</p><p>
By this time he had survived all his friends; the last straight flame was
three years old; there was no one to add to the list. Over and over he called
his roll, and it appeared to him compact and complete. Where should he put
in another; where, if there were no other objection, would it stand in its
place in the rank? He reflected, with a want of sincerity of which he was
quite conscious, that it would be difficult to determine that place. More
and more, besides, face to face with his little legion, reading over endless
histories, handling the empty shells and playing with the silence&mdash;more and
more he could see that he had never introduced an alien. He had had his great
compassions, his indulgences&mdash;there were cases in which they had been immense:
but what had his devotion after all been, if it hadn't been fundamentally
a respect? He was, however, himself surprised at his stiffness; by the end
of the winter the responsibility of it was what was uppermost in his thoughts.
The refrain had grown old to them, the plea for just one more. There came
a day when, for simple exhaustion, if symmetry should really demand just
one more, he was ready to take symmetry into account. Symmetry was harmony,
and the idea of harmony began to haunt him; he said to himself that harmony
was of course everything. He took, in fancy, his composition to pieces,
redistributing it into other lines, making other juxtapositions and contrasts.
He shifted this and that candle; he made the spaces different; he effaced
the disfigurement of a possible gap. There were subtle and complex relations,
a scheme of cross reference, and moments in which he seemed to catch a glimpse
of the void so sensible to the woman who wandered in exile or sat where he
had seen her with the portrait of Acton Hague. Finally, in this way, he arrived
at a conception of the total, the ideal, which left a clear opportunity for
just another figure. "Just one more, to round it off; just one more, just
one," continued to hum itself in his head. There was a strange confusion
in the thought, for he felt the day to be near when he too should be one
of the Others. What, in this case, would the Others matter to him, since
they only mattered to the living? Even as one of the Dead, what would his
altar matter to him, since his particular dream of keeping it up had melted
away? What had harmony to do with the case, if his lights were all to be
quenched? What he had hoped for was an instituted thing. He might perpetuate
it on some other pretext, but his special meaning would have dropped. This
meaning was to have lasted with the life of the one other person who understood
it.
</p><p>
In March he had an illness during which he spent a fortnight in bed, and
when he revived a little he was told of two things that had happened. One
was that a lady, whose name was not known to the servants (she left none),
had been three times to ask about him; the other was that in his sleep, and
on an occasion when his mind evidently wandered, he was heard to murmur again
and again: "Just one more&mdash;just one." As soon as he found himself able to
go out, and before the doctor in attendance had pronounced him so, he drove
to see the lady who had come to ask about him. She was not at home; but this
gave him the opportunity, before his strength should fail again, to take
his way to the church. He entered the church alone; he had declined, in a
happy manner he possessed of being able to decline effectively, the company
of his servant or of a nurse. He knew now perfectly what these good people
thought; they had discovered his clandestine connection, the magnet that
had drawn him for so many years, and doubtless attached a significance of
their own to the odd words they had repeated to him. The nameless lady was
the clandestine connection&mdash;a fact nothing could have made clearer than his
indecent haste to rejoin her. He sank on his knees before his altar, and
his head fell over on his hands. His weakness, his life's weariness, overtook
him. It seemed to him he had come for the great surrender. At first he asked
himself how he should get away; then, with the failing belief in the power,
the very desire to move gradually left him. He had come, as he always came,
to lose himself; the fields of light were still there to stray in; only this
time, in straying, he would never come back. He had given himself to his
Dead, and it was good; this time his Dead would keep him. He couldn't rise
from his knees; he believed he should never rise again; all he could do was
to lift his face and fix his eyes upon his lights. They looked unusually,
strangely splendid, but the one that always drew him most had an unprecedented
luster. It was the central voice of the choir, the glowing heart of the
brightness, and on this occasion it seemed to expand, to spread great wings
of flame. The whole altar flared&mdash;it dazzled and blinded; but the source
of the vast radiance burned clearer than the rest; it gathered itself into
form, and the form was human beauty and human charity; it was the far-off
face of Mary Antrim. She smiled at him from the glory of heaven&mdash;she brought
the glory down with her to take him. He bowed his head in submission, and
at the same moment another wave rolled over him. Was it the quickening of
joy to pain? In the midst of his joy, at any rate, he felt his buried face
grow hot as with some communicated knowledge that had the force of a reproach.
It suddenly made him contrast that very rapture with the bliss he had refused
to another. This breath of the passion immortal was all that other had asked;
the descent of Mary Antrim opened his spirit with a great compunctious throb
for the descent of Acton Hague. It was as if Stransom had read what her eyes
said to him.
</p><p>
After a moment he looked round him in a despair which made him feel as if
the source of life were ebbing. The church had been empty&mdash;he was alone;
but he wanted to have something done, to make a last appeal. This idea gave
him strength for an effort; he rose to his feet with a movement that made
him turn, supporting himself by the back of a bench. Behind him was a prostrate
figure, a figure he had seen before; a woman in deep mourning, bowed in grief
or in prayer. He had seen her in other days&mdash;the first time he came into
the church and he slightly wavered there, looking at her again till she seemed
to become aware he had noticed her. She raised her head and met his eyes:
the partner of his long worship was there. She looked across at him an instant
with a face wondering and scared; he saw that he had given her an alarm.
Then quickly rising, she came straight to him with both hands out.
</p><p>
"Then you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> come? God sent you!" he murmured, with a happy smile.
</p><p>
"You're very ill&mdash;you shouldn't be here," she urged in anxious reply.
</p><p>
"God sent me, too, I think. I was ill when I came, but the sight of you does
wonders." He held her hands, and they steadied and quickened him. "I've something
to tell you."
</p><p>
"Don't tell me!" she tenderly pleaded; "let me tell you. This afternoon,
by a miracle, the sweetest of miracles, the sense of our difference left
me. I was out&mdash;I was near, thinking, wandering alone, when, on the spot,
something changed in my heart. It's my confession&mdash;there it is. To come back,
to come back on the instant&mdash;the idea gave me wings. It was as if I suddenly
saw something&mdash;as if it all became possible. I could come for what you yourself
come for: that was enough. So here I am. It's not for my own&mdash;that's over.
But I'm here for <hi rend="italic">them."</hi> And breathless, infinitely relieved by her
low, precipitate explanation, she looked with eyes that rejected all its
splendor at the magnificence of their altar.
</p><p>
"They're here for you," Stransom said, "they're present tonight as they've
never been. They speak for you&mdash;don't you see?&mdash;in a passion of light&mdash;they
sing out like a choir of angels. Don't you hear what they say?&mdash;they offer
the very thing you asked of me."
</p><p>
"Don't talk of it&mdash;don't think of it; forget it!" She spoke in hushed
supplication, and while the apprehension deepened in her eyes she disengaged
one of her hands and passed an arm round him, to support him better, to help
him to sink into a seat.
</p><p>
He let himself go, resting on her; he dropped upon the bench, and she fell
on her knees beside him with his arm on her shoulder. So he remained an instant,
staring up at his shrine. "They say there's a gap in the array&mdash;they saw
it's not full, complete. Just one more," he went on, softly&mdash;"isn't that
what you wanted? Yes, one more, one more."
</p><p>
"Ah, no more&mdash;no more!" she wailed as if with a quick, new horror of it,
under her breath.
</p><p>
"Yes, one more," he repeated simply; "just one!" And with this his head dropped
on her shoulder; she felt that in his weakness he had fainted. But alone
with him in the dusty church a great dread was on her of what might still
happen, for his face had the whiteness of death.
