<head>PREFACE</head> 
<p> 
THIS volume is divided into seven parts.</p><p> 
First we have <hi rend="italic">Tales for Children</hi>, published about the year 1872, and 
reminding us of the time when Tolstoy was absorbed in efforts to educate the 
peasant children. This section of the book contains the two stories which of 
all that he has written Tolstoy likes best. In <hi rend="italic">What is Art?</hi> he claims no 
place among examples of good art for any of his own productions 'except for the 
story <hi rend="italic">God sees the Truth, but Waits</hi>, which seeks a place in the first 
class (religious art), and <hi rend="italic">A Prisoner in the Caucasus</hi>, which belongs to 
the second (universal art).' In the first of these the subject (a favourite one 
with Tolstoy) is the forgiveness of injuries. The second deals with the 
simplest feelings common to all men: fear and courage, pity, endurance, 
&amp;c.' expressed with that individuality, clearness, and sincerity, which 
Tolstoy says are the signs of true art.</p> 
<p>Part II contains a series of stories written for the people; and among them 
<hi rend="italic">What Men Live By</hi>, probably the most widely circulated of all Tolstoy's 
tales. It is founded on the oft-repeated legend of an angel sent by God to live 
for a while among men.</p><p> 
Part III consists of a Fairy Tale, <hi rend="italic">Iv&aacute;n the Fool</hi>, which contains 
in popular form Tolstoy's indictment of militarism and commercialism.</p><p> 
Part IV contains three short stories written to help   <pb n="vi"/>   the sale of cheap 
reproductions of some good drawings; Tolstoy having for many years been anxious 
by all means in his power to further the circulation, at a cheap price, of good 
works of pictorial as well as literary art.</p><p> 
In Part V we have a series of Russian Folk-Tales. The gems of this collection 
are the temperance story, <hi rend="italic">The Imp and the Crust</hi>, the anti-war story, 
<hi rend="italic">The Empty Drum</hi>, and another story, <hi rend="italic">How Much Land does a Man Need?</hi> 
which deals with a peasant's greed for land. <hi rend="italic">A Grain as big as a Hen's 
Egg</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Godson</hi> are highly characteristic of the spirit of the 
Russian peasantry, and supply a glimpse of the sources from whence Tolstoy 
imbibed many of his own spiritual sympathies and antipathies.</p><p> 
Part VI gives two adaptations from the French which have appeared in no 
previous English edition of Tolstoy's works. They are not merely translations, 
for to some extent Tolstoy when translating them, modified them and made them 
his own.</p><p> 
Part VII consists of stories Tolstoy contributed in aid of the Jews left 
destitute after the massacres and outrages in Kishin&eacute;f and elsewhere in 
Russia in 1903, &mdash;  outrages which were forerunners of the yet more terrible 
Jewish massacres of 1905.</p><p> 
The importance Tolstoy attributes to literature of the kind contained in this 
volume, is shown by the following passage in What is Art? &mdash; </p> 
<q>'The artist of the future will understand that to compose a 
fairy tale, a little song which will touch,   <pb n="vii"/>   a lullaby or a riddle which will 
entertain, a jest which will amuse, or to draw a sketch such as will delight 
dozens of generations or millions of children and adults, is incomparably more 
important and more fruitful than to compose a novel, or a symphony, or paint a 
picture, of the kind which diverts some members of the wealthy classes for a 
short time and is then for ever forgotten. The region of this art of the 
simplest feelings accessible to all is enormous, and it is as yet almost 
untouched.'</q> 
<p>The sections of the book have been arranged in 
chronological order. The date when each story was published is given. The 
translations are new ones, and for the footnotes I am responsible.</p>

<head>GOD SEES THE TRUTH, BUT WAITS</head> 
<p>IN the town of Vlad&iacute;mir lived a young merchant named Iv&aacute;n 
Dm&iacute;tritch Aksy&oacute;nof. He had two shops and a house of his own.</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof was a handsome, fair-haired, curly-headed fellow, full of fun, 
and very fond of singing. When quite a young man he had been given to drink, 
and was riotous when he had had too much, but after he married he gave up 
drinking, except now and then.</p><p> 
One summer Aksy&oacute;nof was going to the N&iacute;zhny Fair, and as he bade 
good-bye to his family his wife said to him, 'Iv&aacute;n Dm&iacute;tritch, do 
not start to-day; I have had a bad dream about you.'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof laughed, and said, 'You are afraid that when I get to the fair 
I shall go on the spree.'</p><p> 
His wife replied: 'I do not know what I am afraid of; all I know is that I had 
a bad dream. I dreamt you returned from the town, and when you took off your 
cap I saw that your hair was quite grey.'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof laughed. 'That's a lucky sign,' said he. 'See if I don't sell 
out all my goods, and bring you some presents from the fair.'</p><p> 
So he said good-bye to his family, and drove away.</p><p> 
When he had travelled half-way, he met a merchant whom he knew, and they put up 
at the same inn for the night. They had some tea together, and then went to bed 
in adjoining rooms.</p><p> 
It was not Aksy&oacute;nof's habit to sleep late, and, wishing to travel while 
it was still cool, he aroused his driver before dawn, and told him to put in 
the horses.</p>   <pb n="2"/>  <p> 
Then he made his way across to the landlord of the inn (who lived in a cottage 
at the back), paid his bill, and continued his journey.</p><p> 
When he had gone about twenty-five miles, he stopped for the horses to be fed. 
Aksy&oacute;nof rested awhile in the passage of the inn, then he stepped out 
into the porch and, ordering a <hi rend="italic">samov&aacute;r</hi> to be heated got out his guitar and began 
to play.</p><p> 
Suddenly a <hi rend="italic">tr&oacute;yka</hi> drove up 
with tinkling bells, and an official alighted, followed by two soldiers. He 
came to Aksy&oacute;nof and began to question him, asking him who he was and 
whence he came. Aksy&oacute;nof answered him fully, and said, 'Won't you have 
some tea with me?' But the official went on cross-questioning him and asking 
him, 'Where did you spend last night? Were you alone, or with a 
fellow-merchant? Did you see the other merchant this morning? Why did you leave 
the inn before dawn?'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof wondered why he was asked all these questions, but he described 
all that had happened, and then added, 'Why do you cross-question me as if I 
were a thief or a robber? I am travelling on business of my own, and there is 
no need to question me.'</p><p> 
Then the official, calling the soldiers, said, 'I am the police-officer of this 
district, and I question you because the merchant with whom you spent last 
night has been found with his throat cut. We must search your things.'</p><p> 
They entered the house. The soldiers and the police-officer unstrapped 
Aksy&oacute;nof's luggage and searched it. Suddenly the officer drew a knife 
out of a bag, crying, 'Whose knife is this?'</p>   <pb n="3"/>  <p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof looked, and seeing a blood-stained knife taken from his bag, he 
was frightened.</p><p> 
'How is it there is blood on this knife?'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof tried to answer, but could hardly utter a word, and only 
stammered: 'I &mdash; I don't know &mdash; not mine.'</p><p> 
Then the police-officer said, 'This morning the merchant was found in bed with 
his throat cut. You are the only person who could have done it. The house was 
locked from inside, and no one else was there. Here is this bloodstained knife 
in your bag, and your face and manner betray you! Tell me how you killed him, 
and how much money you stole?'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof swore he had not done it; that he had not seen the merchant 
after they had had tea together; that he had no money except eight thousand 
roubles of his own, and that the knife 
was not his. But his voice was broken, his face pale, and he trembled with fear 
as though he were guilty.</p><p> 
The police-officer ordered the soldiers to bind Aksy&oacute;nof and to put him 
in the cart. As they tied his feet together and flung him into the cart, 
Aksy&oacute;nof crossed himself and wept. His money and goods were taken from 
him, and he was sent to the nearest town and imprisoned there. Enquiries as to 
his character were made in Vlad&iacute;mir. The merchants and other inhabitants 
of that town said that in former days he used to drink and waste his time, but 
that he was a good man. Then the trial came on: he was charged with murdering a 
merchant   <pb n="4"/>  from Ryaz&aacute;n, and robbing him of twenty thousand r&uacute;bles.</p><p> 
His wife was in despair, and did not know what to believe. Her children were 
all quite small; one was a baby at her breast. Taking them all with her, she 
went to the town where her husband was in gaol. At first she was not allowed to 
see him; but, after much begging, she obtained permission from the officials, 
and was taken to him. When she saw her husband in prison-dress and in chains, 
shut up with thieves and criminals, she fell down, and did not come to her 
senses for a long time. Then she drew her children to her, and sat down near 
him. She told him of things at home, and asked about what had happened to him. 
He told her all, and she asked, 'What can we do now?'</p><p> 
'We must petition the Tsar not to let an innocent man perish.'</p><p> 
His wife told him that she had sent a petition to the Tsar, but that it had not 
been accepted.</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof did not reply, but only looked downcast.</p><p> 
Then his wife said, 'It was not for nothing I dreamt your hair had turned grey. 
You remember? You should not have started that day.' And passing her fingers 
through his hair, she said: 'V&aacute;nya dearest, tell your wife the truth; 
was it not you who did it?'</p><p> 
'So you, too, suspect me!' said Aksy&oacute;nof, and hiding his face in his 
hands, he began to weep. Then a soldier came to say that the wife and children 
must go away; and Aksy&oacute;nof said good-bye to his family for the last 
time.</p><p> 
When they were gone, Aksy&oacute;nof recalled what had been said, and when he 
remembered that his wife also had suspected him, he said to himself, 'It seems 
that only God can know the truth, it is   <pb n="5"/>   to Him alone we must appeal, and from 
Him alone expect mercy.'</p><p> 
And Aksy&oacute;nof wrote no more petitions; gave up all hope, and only prayed 
to God.</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof was condemned to be flogged and sent to the mines. So he was 
flogged with a knout, and when the wounds made by the knout were healed, he was 
driven to Siberia with other convicts.</p><p> 
For twenty-six years Aksy&oacute;nof lived as a convict in Siberia. His hair 
turned white as snow and his beard grew long, thin, and grey. All his mirth 
went; he stooped; he walked slowly, spoke little, and never laughed, but he 
often prayed.</p><p> 
In prison Aksy&oacute;nof learnt to make boots, and earned a little money, with 
which he bought <hi rend="italic">The Lives of the Saints</hi>. He read this book when there 
was light enough in the prison; and on Sundays in the prison-church he read the 
lessons and sang in the choir; for his voice was still good.</p><p> 
The prison authorities liked Aksy&oacute;nof for his meekness, and his 
fellow-prisoners respected him: they called him 'Grandfather,' and 'The Saint.' 
When they wanted to petition the prison authorities about anything, they always 
made Aksy&oacute;nof their spokesman, and when there were quarrels among the 
prisoners they came to him to put things right, and to judge the matter.</p><p> 
No news reached Aksy&oacute;nof from his home, and he did not even know if his 
wife and children were still alive.</p><p> 
One day a fresh gang of convicts came to the prison. In the evening the old 
prisoners collected round the new ones and asked them what towns or villages 
they came from, and what they were sentenced for. Among the rest 
Aksy&oacute;nof sat down near the new-comers, and listened with downcast air to 
what was said.</p>   <pb n="6"/>  <p> 
One of the new convicts, a tall, strong man of sixty, with a closely-cropped 
grey beard, was telling the others what he had been arrested for.</p><p> 
'Well, friends,' he said, 'I only took a horse that was tied to a sledge, and I 
was arrested and accused of stealing. I said I had only taken it to get home 
quicker, and had then let it go; besides, the driver was a personal friend of 
mine. So I said, "It's all right." "No," said they, "you stole it." But how or 
where I stole it they could not say. I once really did something wrong, and 
ought by rights to have come here long ago, but that time I was not found out. 
Now I have been sent here for nothing at all. . . . Eh, but it's lies I'm 
telling you; I've been to Siberia before, but I did not stay long.'</p><p> 
'Where are you from?' asked some one.</p><p> 
'From Vlad&iacute;mir. My family are of that town. My name is Mak&aacute;r, and 
they also call me Semy&oacute;nitch.'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof raised his head and said: 'Tell me, Semy&oacute;nitch, do you 
know anything of the merchants Aksy&oacute;nof, of Vlad&iacute;mir? Are they 
still alive?'</p><p> 
'Know them? Of course I do. The Aksy&oacute;nofs are rich, though their father 
is in Siberia: a sinner like ourselves, it seems! As for you, Gran'dad, how did 
you come here?'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof did not like to speak of his misfortune. He only sighed, and 
said, 'For my sins I have been in prison these twenty-six years.'</p><p> 
'What sins?' asked Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch.</p><p> 
But Aksy&oacute;nof only said, 'Well, well &mdash; I must have deserved it!' He 
would have said no more, but his companions told the new-comer how 
Aksy&oacute;nof came to be in Siberia: how some one had killed a merchant and 
had put a knife among Aksy&oacute;nof's things, and Aksy&oacute;nof had been 
unjustly condemned.</p><p> 
When Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch heard this, he looked at Aksy&oacute;nof, 
slapped his own knee, and exclaimed,   <pb n="7"/>   'Well this is wonderful! Really wonderful! 
But how old you've grown, Gran'dad!'</p><p> 
The others asked him why he was so surprised, and where he had seen 
Aksy&oacute;nof before; but Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch did not reply. He 
only said: 'It's wonderful that we should meet here, lads!'</p><p> 
These words made Aksy&oacute;nof wonder whether this man knew who had killed 
the merchant; so he said 'Perhaps, Semy&oacute;nitch, you have heard of that 
affair or maybe you've seen me before?'</p><p> 
'How could I help hearing? The world's full of rumours. But it's long ago, and 
I've forgotten what I heard.'</p><p> 
'Perhaps you heard who killed the merchant?' asked Aksy&oacute;nof.</p><p> 
Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch laughed, and replied, 'It must have been him in 
whose bag the knife was found! If some one else hid the knife there, "He's not 
a thief till he's caught," as the saying is. How could any one put a knife into 
your bag while it was under your head? It would surely have woke you up?'</p><p> 
When Aksy&oacute;nof heard these words, he felt sure this was the man who had 
killed the merchant. He rose and went away. All that night Aksy&oacute;nof lay 
awake.</p><p> 
He felt terribly unhappy, and all sorts of images rose in his mind. There was 
the image of his wife as she was when he parted from her to go to the fair. He 
saw her as if she were present; her face and her eyes rose before him; he heard 
her speak and laugh. Then he saw his children, quite little, as they were at 
that time: one with a little cloak on, another at his mother's breast. And then 
he remembered himself as he used to be &mdash; young and merry. He remembered how he 
sat playing the guitar in the porch of the inn where he was arrested, and how 
free from care he had been. He saw, in his mind, the place where he was 
flogged, the   <pb n="8"/>   executioner, and the people standing around; the chains, the 
convicts, all the twenty-six years of his prison life, and his premature old 
age. The thought of it all made him so wretched that he was ready to kill 
himself.</p><p> 
'And it's all that villain's doing!' thought Aksy&oacute;nof. And his anger was 
so great against Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch that he longed for vengeance, 
even if he himself should perish for it. He kept repeating prayers all night, 
but could get no peace. During the day he did not go near Mak&aacute;r 
Semy&oacute;nitch, nor even look at him.</p><p> 
A fortnight passed in this way. Aksy&oacute;nof could not sleep at nights, and 
was so miserable that he did not know what to do.</p><p> 
One night as he was walking about the prison he noticed some earth that came 
rolling out from under one of the shelves on which the prisoners slept. He 
stopped to see what it was. Suddenly Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch crept out 
from under the shelf, and looked up at Aksy&oacute;nof with frightened face. 
Aksy&oacute;nof tried to pass without looking at him, but Mak&aacute;r seized 
his hand and told him that he had dug a hole under the wall, getting rid of the 
earth by putting it into his high-boots, and emptying it out every day on the 
road when the prisoners were driven to their work.</p><p> 
'Just you keep quiet, old man, and you shall get out too. If you blab they'll 
flog the life out of me, but I will kill you first.'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof trembled with anger as he looked at his enemy. He drew his hand 
away, saying, 'I have no wish to escape, and you have no need to kill me; you 
killed me long ago! As to telling of you &mdash; I may do so or not, as God shall 
direct.'</p><p> 
Next day, when the convicts were led out to work, the convoy soldiers noticed 
that one or other of the   <pb n="9"/>  prisoners emptied some earth out of his boots. The 
prison was searched, and the tunnel found. The Governor came and questioned all 
the prisoners to find out who had dug the hole. They all denied any knowledge 
of it. Those who knew, would not betray Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch, knowing 
he would be flogged almost to death. At last the Governor turned to 
Aksy&oacute;nof, whom he knew to be a just man, and said:</p><p> 
'You are a truthful old man; tell me, before God, who dug the hole?'</p><p> 
Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch stood as if he were quite unconcerned, looking 
at the Governor and not so much as glancing at Aksy&oacute;nof. 
Aksy&oacute;nof's lips and hands trembled, and for a long time he could not 
utter a word. He thought, 'Why should I screen him who ruined my life? Let him 
pay for what I have suffered. But if I tell, they will probably flog the life 
out of him and maybe I suspect him wrongly. And, after all, what good would it 
be to me?'</p><p> 
'Well, old man,' repeated the Governor, 'tell us the truth: who has been 
digging under the wall?'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof glanced at Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch, and said 'I cannot 
say, your honour. It is not God's will that I should tell! Do what you like 
with me; I am in your hands.'</p><p> 
However much the Governor tried, Aksy&oacute;nof would say no more, and so the 
matter had to be left.</p><p> 
That night, when Aksy&oacute;nof was lying on his bed and just beginning to 
doze, some one came quietly and sat down on his bed. He peered through the 
darkness and recognized Mak&aacute;r.</p><p> 
'What more do you want of me?' asked Aksy&oacute;nof. 'Why have you come 
here?'</p><p> 
Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch was silent. So Aksy&oacute;nof sat up and said, 
'What do you want? Go away, or I will call the guard!'</p>   <pb n="10"/>  <p> 
Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch bent close over Aksy&oacute;nof, and whispered, 
'Iv&aacute;n Dm&iacute;tritch, forgive me!'</p><p> 
'What for?' asked Aksy&oacute;nof.</p><p> 
'It was I who killed the merchant and hid the knife among your things. I meant 
to kill you too, but I heard a noise outside; so I hid the knife in your bag 
and escaped out of the window.'</p><p> 
Aksy&oacute;nof was silent, and did not know what to say. Mak&aacute;r 
Semy&oacute;nitch slid off the bed-shelf and knelt upon the ground. 
'Iv&aacute;n Dm&iacute;tritch,' said he, 'forgive me! For the love of God, 
forgive me! I will confess that it was I who killed the merchant, and you will 
be released and can go to your home.'</p><p> 
'It is easy for you to talk,' said Aksy&oacute;nof, 'but I have suffered for 
you these twenty-six years. Where could I go to now? . . . My wife is dead, and 
my children have forgotten me. I have nowhere to go. . . .'</p><p> 
Mak&aacute;r Semy&oacute;nitch did not rise, but beat his head on the floor. 
'Iv&aacute;n Dm&iacute;tritch, forgive me!' he cried. 'When they flogged me 
with the knout it was not so hard to bear as it is to see you now . . . yet you 
had pity on me, and did not tell. For Christ's sake forgive me, wretch that I 
am!' And he began to sob.</p><p> 
When Aksy&oacute;nof heard him sobbing he, too, began to weep.</p><p> 
'God will forgive you!' said he. 'Maybe I am a hundred times worse than you.' 
And at these words his heart grew light, and the longing for home left him. He 
no longer had any desire to leave the prison, but only hoped for his last hour 
to come.</p><p> 
In spite of what Aksy&oacute;nof had said, Maker Semy&oacute;nitch confessed 
his guilt. But when the order for his release came, Aksy&oacute;nof was already 
dead.</p><p>

<head>A PRISONER IN THE CAUCASUS</head> 
<div3 type="section" n="1" id="d10"> 
<head>I</head> 
<p>AN officer named Zh&iacute;lin was serving in the army in the Caucasus.</p><p> 
One day he received a letter from home. It was from his mother, who wrote: 'I 
am getting old, and should like to see my dear son once more before I die. Come 
and say good-bye to me and bury me, and then, if God pleases, return to service 
again with my blessing. But I have found a girl for you, who is sensible and 
good and has some property. If you can love her, you might marry her and remain 
at home.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin thought it over. It was quite true, the old lady was failing fast 
and he might not have another chance to see her alive. He had better go, and, 
if the girl was nice, why not marry her?</p><p> 
So he went to his Colonel, obtained leave of absence, said good-bye to his 
comrades, stood the soldiers four pailfuls of v&oacute;dka as a farewell treat, and got ready to go.</p><p> 
It was a time of war in the Caucasus. The roads were not safe by night or day. 
If ever a Russian ventured to ride or walk any distance away from his fort, the 
Tartars killed him or carried him off to the hills. So it had been arranged 
that twice every week a body of soldiers should march from one fortress to the 
next to convoy travellers from point to point.</p><p> 
It was summer. At daybreak the baggage-train got ready under shelter of the 
fortress; the soldiers   <pb n="12"/>  marched out; and all started along the road. 
Zh&iacute;lin was on horseback, and a cart with his things went with the 
baggage-train. They had sixteen miles to go. The baggage-train moved slowly; 
sometimes the soldiers stopped, or perhaps a wheel would come off one of the 
carts, or a horse refuse to go on, and then everybody had to wait.</p><p> 
When by the sun it was already past noon, they had not gone half the way. It 
was dusty and hot, the sun was scorching and there was no shelter anywhere: a 
bare plain all round &mdash; not a tree, not a bush, by the road.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin rode on in front, and stopped, waiting for the baggage to 
overtake him. Then he heard the signal-horn sounded behind him: the company had 
again stopped. So he began to think: 'Hadn't I better ride on by myself? My 
horse is a good one: if the Tartars do attack me, I can gallop away. Perhaps, 
however, it would be wiser to wait.'</p><p> 
As he sat considering, Kost&iacute;lin, an officer carrying a gun, rode up to 
him and said:</p><p> 
'Come along, Zh&iacute;lin, let's go on by ourselves. It's dreadful; I am 
famished, and the heat is terrible. My shirt is wringing wet.'</p><p> 
Kost&iacute;lin was a stout, heavy man, and the perspiration was running down 
his red face. Zh&iacute;lin thought awhile, and then asked: 'Is your gun 
loaded?'</p><p> 
'Yes it is.'</p><p> 
'Well, then, let's go, but on condition that we keep together.'</p><p> 
So they rode forward along the road across the plain, talking, but keeping a 
look-out on both sides. They could see afar all round. But after crossing the 
plain the road ran through a valley between two hills, and Zh&iacute;lin said: 
'We had better climb that hill and have a look round, or the Tartars may be on 
us before we know it.'</p>   <pb n="13"/>  <p> 
But Kost&iacute;lin answered: 'What's the use? Let us go on.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin, however, would not agree.</p><p> 
'No,' he said; 'you can wait here if you like, but I'll go and look round.' And 
he turned his horse to the left, up the hill. Zh&iacute;lin's horse was a 
hunter, and carried him up the hillside as if it had wings. (He had bought it 
for a hundred r&uacute;bles as a colt out of a herd, and had broken it in himself.) 
Hardly had he reached the top of the hill, when he saw some thirty Tartars not 
much more than a hundred yards ahead of him. As soon as he caught sight of them 
he turned round but the Tartars had also seen him, and rushed after him at full 
gallop, getting their guns out as they went. Down galloped Zh&iacute;lin as 
fast as the horse's legs could go, shouting to Kost&iacute;lin: 'Get your gun 
ready!'</p><p> 
And, in thought, he said to his horse: 'Get me well out of this, my pet; don't 
stumble, for if you do it's all up. Once I reach the gun, they shan't take me 
prisoner.'</p><p> 
But, instead of waiting, Kost&iacute;lin, as soon as he caught sight of the 
Tartars, turned back towards the fortress at full speed, whipping his horse now 
on one side now on the other, and its switching tail was all that could be seen 
of him in the dust.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin saw it was a bad look-out; the gun was gone, and what could he do 
with nothing but his sword? He turned his horse towards the escort, thinking to 
escape, but there were six Tartars rushing to cut him off. His horse was a good 
one, but theirs were still better; and besides, they were across his path. He 
tried to rein in his horse and to turn another way, but it was going so fast it 
could not stop, and dashed on straight towards the Tartars. He saw a 
red-bearded Tartar on a grey horse, with his gun raised, come at him, yelling 
and showing his teeth.</p>   <pb n="14"/>  <p> 
'Ah,' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'I know you, devils that you are. If you take me 
alive, you'll put me in a pit and flog me. I will not be taken alive!'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin, though not a big fellow, was brave. He drew his sword and dashed 
at the red-bearded Tartar thinking: 'Either I'll ride him down, or disable him 
with my sword.'</p><p> 
He was still a horse's length away from him, when he was fired at from behind, 
and his horse was hit. It fell to the ground with all its weight, pinning 
Zh&iacute;lin to the earth.</p><p> 
He tried to rise, but two ill-savoured Tartars were already sitting on him and 
binding his hands behind his back. He made an effort and flung them off, but 
three others jumped from their horses and began beating his head with the butts 
of their guns. His eyes grew dim, and he fell back. The Tartars seized him, 
and, taking spare girths from their saddles, twisted his hands behind him and 
tied them with a Tartar knot. They knocked his cap off, pulled off his boots, 
searched him all over, tore his clothes, and took his money and his watch.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin looked round at his horse. There it lay on its side, poor thing, 
just as it had fallen; struggling, its legs in the air, unable to touch the 
ground. There was a hole in its head, and black blood was pouring out, turning 
the dust to mud for a couple of feet around.</p><p> 
One of the Tartars went up to the horse and began taking the saddle off, it 
still kicked, so he drew a dagger and cut its windpipe. A whistling sound came 
from its throat, the horse gave one plunge, and all was over.</p><p> 
The Tartars took the saddle and trappings. The red-bearded Tartar mounted his 
horse, and the others lifted Zh&iacute;lin into the saddle behind him. To 
prevent his falling off, they strapped him to the   <pb n="15"/>  Tartar's girdle; and then 
they all rode away to the hills.</p><p> 
So there sat Zh&iacute;lin, swaying from side to side, his head striking 
against the Tartar's stinking back. He could see nothing but that muscular back 
and sinewy neck, with its closely shaven, bluish nape. Zh&iacute;lin's head was 
wounded: the blood had dried over his eyes, and he could neither shift his 
position on the saddle nor wipe the blood off. His arms were bound so tightly 
that his collar-bones ached.</p><p> 
They rode up and down hills for a long way. Then they reached a river which 
they forded, and came to a hard road leading across a valley.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin tried to see where they were going, but his eyelids were stuck 
together with blood, and he could not turn.</p><p> 
Twilight began to fall; they crossed another river and rode up a stony 
hillside. There was a smell of smoke here, and dogs were barking. They had 
reached an Aoul (a Tartar village). The Tartars got off their horses; Tartar 
children came and stood round Zh&iacute;lin, shrieking with pleasure and 
throwing stones at him.</p><p> 
The Tartar drove the children away, took Zh&iacute;lin off the horse, and 
called his man. A Nog&aacute;y with high 
cheek-bones, and nothing on but a shirt (and that so torn that his breast was 
all bare), answered the call. The Tartar gave him an order. He went and fetched 
shackles: two blocks of oak with iron rings attached, and a clasp and lock 
fixed to one of the rings.</p><p> 
They untied Zh&iacute;lin's arms, fastened the shackles on his leg, and dragged 
him to a barn, where they pushed him in and locked the door.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin fell on a heap of manure. He lay still awhile then groped about 
to find a soft place, and settled down.</p> 
  </div3> 
<pb n="16"/>   
<div3 type="section" n="2" id="d11"> 
<head>II</head> 
<p> 
That night Zh&iacute;lin hardly slept at all. It was the time of year when the 
nights are short, and daylight soon showed itself through a chink in the wall. 
He rose, scratched to make the chink bigger, and peeped out.</p><p> 
Through the hole he saw a road leading down-hill; to the right was a Tartar hut 
with two trees near it, a black dog lay on the threshold, and a goat and kids 
were moving about wagging their tails. Then he saw a young Tartar woman in a 
long, loose, bright-coloured gown, with trousers and high boots showing from 
under it. She had a coat thrown over her head, on which she carried a large 
metal jug filled with water. She was leading by the hand a small, 
closely-shaven Tartar boy, who wore nothing but a shirt; and as she went along 
balancing herself, the muscles of her back quivered. This woman carried the 
water into the hut, and, soon after, the red-bearded Tartar of yesterday came 
out dressed in a silk tunic, with a silver-hilted dagger hanging by his side, 
shoes on his bare feet, and a tall black sheepskin cap set far back on his 
head. He came out, stretched himself, and stroked his red beard. He stood 
awhile, gave an order to his servant, and went away.</p><p> 
Then two lads rode past from watering their horses. The horses' noses were wet. 
Some other closely-shaven boys ran out, without any trousers, and wearing 
nothing but their shirts. They crowded together, came to the barn, picked up a 
twig, and began pushing it in at the chink. Zh&iacute;lin gave a shout, and the 
boys shrieked and scampered off, their little bare knees gleaming as they 
ran.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin was very thirsty: his throat was parched,   <pb n="17"/>   and he thought: 'If 
only they would come and so much as look at me!'</p><p> 
Then he heard some one unlocking the barn. The red-bearded Tartar entered, and 
with him was another a smaller man, dark, with bright black eyes, red cheeks 
and a short beard. He had a merry face, and was always laughing. This man was 
even more richly dressed than the other. He wore a blue silk tunic trimmed with 
gold, a large silver dagger in his belt, red morocco slippers worked with 
silver, and over these a pair of thick shoes, and he had a white sheepskin cap 
on his head.</p><p> 
The red-bearded Tartar entered, muttered something as if he were annoyed, and 
stood leaning against the doorpost, playing with his dagger, and glaring 
askance at Zh&iacute;lin, like a wolf. The dark one, quick and lively and 
moving as if on springs, came straight up to Zh&iacute;lin, squatted down in 
front of him, slapped him on the shoulder, and began to talk very fast in his 
own language. His teeth showed, and he kept winking, clicking his tongue, and 
repeating, 'Good Russ, good Russ.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin could not understand a word, but said, 'Drink! give me water to 
drink!'</p><p> 
The dark man only laughed. 'Good Russ,' he said, and went on talking in his own 
tongue.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin made signs with lips and hands that he wanted something to 
drink.</p><p> 
The dark man understood, and laughed. Then he looked out of the door, and 
called to some one: 'Dina!'</p><p> 
A little girl came running in: she was about thirteen, slight, thin, and like 
the dark Tartar in face. Evidently she was his daughter. She, too, had clear 
black eyes, and her face was good-looking. She had on a long blue gown with 
wide sleeves, and no girdle. The hem of her gown, the front, and the   <pb n="18"/>  sleeves, 
were trimmed with red. She wore trousers and slippers, and over the slippers 
stouter shoes with high heels. Round her neck she had a necklace made of 
Russian silver coins. She was bareheaded, and her black hair was plaited with a 
ribbon and ornamented with gilt braid and silver coins.</p><p> 
Her father gave an order, and she ran away and returned with a metal jug. She 
handed the water to Zh&iacute;lin and sat down, crouching so that her knees 
were as high as her head, and there she sat with wide open eyes watching 
Zh&iacute;lin drink, as though he were a wild animal.</p><p> 
When Zh&iacute;lin handed the empty jug back to her, she gave such a sudden 
jump back, like a wild goat, that it made her father laugh. He sent her away 
for something else. She took the jug, ran out, and brought back some unleavened 
bread on a round board, and once more sat down, crouching, and looking on with 
staring eves.</p><p> 
Then the Tartars went away and again locked the door.</p><p> 
After a while the Nog&aacute;y came and said: <hi rend="italic">'Ayda</hi>, the master, 
<hi rend="italic">Ayda!</hi>'</p><p> 
He, too, knew no Russian. All Zh&iacute;lin could make out was that he was told 
to go somewhere.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin followed the N&oacute;gay, but limped, for the shackles dragged 
his feet so that he could hardly step at all. On getting out of the barn he saw 
a Tartar village of about ten houses, and a Tartar church with a small tower. 
Three horses stood saddled before one of the houses; little boys were holding 
them by the reins. The dark Tartar came out of this house, beckoning with his 
hand for Zh&iacute;lin to follow him. Then he laughed, said something in his 
own language, and returned into the house.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin entered. The room was a good one: the walls smoothly plastered 
with clay. Near the front   <pb n="19"/>  wall lay a pile of bright-coloured feather beds; the 
side walls were covered with rich carpets used as hangings, and on these were 
fastened guns, pistols and swords, all inlaid with silver. Close to one of the 
walls was a small stove on a level with the earthen floor. The floor itself was 
as clean as a thrashing-ground. A large space in one corner was spread over 
with felt, on which were rugs, and on these rugs were cushions stuffed with 
down. And on these cushions sat five Tartars, the dark one, the red-haired one, 
and three guests. They were wearing their indoor slippers, and each had a 
cushion behind his back. Before them were standing millet cakes on a round 
board, melted butter in a bowl and a jug of <hi rend="italic">buza</hi>, or Tartar beer. They 
ate both cakes and butter with their hands.</p><p> 
The dark man jumped up and ordered Zh&iacute;lin to be placed on one side, not 
on the carpet but on the bare ground, then he sat down on the carpet again, and 
offered millet cakes and <hi rend="italic">buza</hi> to his guests. The servant made 
Zh&iacute;lin sit down, after which he took off his own overshoes, put them by 
the door where the other shoes were standing, and sat down nearer to his 
masters on the felt, watching them as they ate, and licking his lips.</p><p> 
The Tartars ate as much as they wanted, and a woman dressed in the same way as 
the girl &mdash; in a long gown and trousers, with a kerchief on her head &mdash;  came 
and took away what was left, and brought a handsome basin, and an ewer with a 
narrow spout. The Tartars washed their hands, folded them, went down on their 
knees, blew to the four quarters, and said their prayers. After they had talked 
for a while, one of the guests turned to Zh&iacute;lin and began to speak in 
Russian.</p><p> 
'You were captured by Kazi-Mohammed,' he said, and pointed at the red-bearded 
Tartar. 'And   <pb n="20"/>  Kazi-Mohammed has given you to Abdul Murat,' pointing at the dark 
one. 'Abdul Murat is now your master.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin was silent. Then Abdul Murat began to talk, laughing, pointing to 
Zh&iacute;lin, and repeating, 'Soldier Russ, good Russ.'</p><p> 
The interpreter said, 'He orders you to write home and tell them to send a 
ransom, and as soon as the money comes he will set you free.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin thought for a moment, and said, 'How much ransom does he want?'</p><p> 
The Tartars talked awhile, and then the interpreter said, 'Three thousand 
r&uacute;bles.'</p><p> 
'No,' said Zh&iacute;lin,' I can't pay so much.'</p><p> 
Abdul jumped up and, waving his arms, talked to Zh&iacute;lin' thinking, as 
before, that he would understand. The interpreter translated: 'How much will 
you give?'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin considered, and said, 'Five hundred r&uacute;bles.' At this the Tartars 
began speaking very quickly, all together. Abdul began to shout at the 
red-bearded one, and jabbered so fast that the spittle spurted out of his 
mouth. The red-bearded one only screwed up his eyes and clicked his tongue.</p><p> 
They quietened down after a while, and the interpreter said, 'Five hundred 
r&uacute;bles is not enough for the master. He paid two hundred for you himself. 
Kazi-Mohammed was in debt to him, and he took you in payment. Three thousand 
r&uacute;bles! Less than that won't do. If you refuse to write, you will be put into 
a pit and flogged with a whip!'</p><p> 
'Eh!' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'the more one fears them the worse it will be.'</p><p> 
So he sprang to his feet, and said, 'You tell that dog that if he tries to 
frighten me I will not write at all, and he will get nothing. I never was 
afraid of you dogs, and never will be!'</p>   <pb n="21"/>  <p> 
The interpreter translated, and again they all began to talk at once.</p><p> 
They jabbered for a long time, and then the dark man jumped up, came to 
Zh&iacute;lin, and said: <hi rend="italic">'Dzhigit Russ, dzhigit Russ!</hi>' (<hi rend="italic">Dzhigit</hi> 
in their language means 'brave.') And he laughed, and said something to the 
interpreter, who translated: 'One thousand r&uacute;bles will satisfy him.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin stuck to it: 'I will not give more than five hundred. And if you 
kill me you'll get nothing at all.'</p><p> 
The Tartars talked awhile, then sent the servant out to fetch something, and 
kept looking, now at Zh&iacute;lin, now at the door. The servant returned, 
followed by a stout, bare-footed, tattered man, who also had his leg 
shackled.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin gasped with surprise: it was Kost&iacute;lin. He, too, had been 
taken. They were put side by side, and began to tell each other what had 
occurred. While they talked, the Tartars looked on in silence. Zh&iacute;lin 
related what had happened to him; and Kost&iacute;lin told how his horse had 
stopped, his gun missed fire, and this same Abdul had overtaken and captured 
him.</p><p> 
Abdul jumped up, pointed to Kost&iacute;lin, and said something. The 
interpreter translated that they both now belonged to one master, and the one 
who first paid the ransom would be set free first.</p><p> 
'There now,' he said to Zh&iacute;lin, 'you get angry, but your comrade here is 
gentle; he has written home, and they will send five thousand r&uacute;bles. So he 
will be well fed and well treated.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin replied: 'My comrade can do as he likes; maybe he is rich, I am 
not. It must be as I said. Kill me, if you like &mdash; you will gain nothing by it; 
but I will not write for more than five hundred r&uacute;bles.'</p><p> 
They were silent. Suddenly up sprang Abdul,   <pb n="22"/>  brought a little box, took out a 
pen, ink, and a bit of paper, gave them to Zh&iacute;lin, slapped him on the 
shoulder, and made a sign that he should write. He had agreed to take five 
hundred r&uacute;bles.</p><p> 
'Wait a bit!' said Zh&iacute;lin to the interpreter; 'tell him that he must 
feed us properly, give us proper clothes and boots, and let us be together. It 
will be more cheerful for us. And he must have these shackles taken off our 
feet,' and Zh&iacute;lin looked at his master and laughed.</p><p> 
The master also laughed, heard the interpreter, and said: 'I will give them the 
best of clothes: a cloak and boots fit to be married in. I will feed them like 
princes; and if they like they can live together in the barn. But I can't take 
off the shackles, or they will run away. They shall be taken off, however, at 
night.' And he jumped up and slapped Zh&iacute;lin on the shoulder, exclaiming: 
'You good, I good!'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin wrote the letter, but addressed it wrongly, so that it should not 
reach its destination, thinking to himself: 'I'll run away!'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin and Kost&iacute;lin were taken back to the barn and given some 
maize straw, a jug of water, some bread, two old cloaks, and some worn-out 
military boots &mdash;  evidently taken from the corpses of Russian soldiers, At 
night their shackles were taken off their feet, and they were locked up in the 
barn.</p> 
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="3" id="d12"> 
<head> 
III</head> 
<p> 
Zh&iacute;lin and his friend lived in this way for a whole month. The master 
always laughed and said: 'You, Iv&aacute;n, good! I, Abdul, good!' But he fed 
them badly giving them nothing but unleavened bread of millet-flour baked into 
flat cakes, or sometimes only unbaked dough.</p><p> 
Kost&iacute;lin wrote home a second time, and did   <pb n="23"/>  nothing but mope and wait for 
the money to arrive. He would sit for days together in the barn sleeping, or 
counting the days till a letter could come.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin knew his letter would reach no one, and he did not write another. 
He thought: 'Where could my mother get enough money to ransom me? As it is she 
lived chiefly on what I sent her. If she had to raise five hundred r&uacute;bles, she 
would be quite ruined. With God's help I'll manage to escape!'</p><p> 
So he kept on the look-out, planning how to run away.</p><p> 
He would walk about the Aoul whistling; or would sit working, modelling dolls 
of clay, or weaving baskets out of twigs: for Zh&iacute;lin was clever with his 
hands.</p><p> 
Once he modelled a doll with a nose and hands and feet and with a Tartar gown 
on, and put it up on the roof. When the Tartar women came out to fetch water, 
the master's daughter, Dina, saw the doll and called the women, who put down 
their jugs and stood looking and laughing. Zh&iacute;lin took down the doll and 
held it out to them. They laughed, but dared not take it. He put down the doll 
and went into the barn, waiting to see what would happen.</p><p> 
Dina ran up to the doll, looked round, seized it, and ran away.</p><p> 
In the morning, at daybreak, he looked out. Dina came out of the house and sat 
down on the threshold with the doll, which she had dressed up in bits of red 
stuff, and she rocked it like a baby, singing a Tartar lullaby. An old woman 
came out and scolded her, and snatching the doll away she broke it to bits, and 
sent Dina about her business.</p><p> 
But Zh&iacute;lin made another doll, better than the first, and gave it to 
Dina. Once Dina brought a little jug, put it on the ground, sat down gazing at 
him, and laughed, pointing to the jug.</p>   <pb n="24"/>  <p> 
'What pleases her so?' wondered Zh&iacute;lin. He took the jug thinking it was 
water, but it turned out to be milk. He drank the milk and said: 'That's 
good!'</p><p> 
How pleased Dina was! 'Good, Iv&aacute;n, good!' said she, and she jumped up 
and clapped her hands. Then, seizing the jug, she ran away. After that, she 
stealthily brought him some milk every day.</p><p> 
The Tartars make a kind of cheese out of goat's milk, which they dry on the 
roofs of their houses; and sometimes, on the sly, she brought him some of this 
cheese. And once, when Abdul had killed a sheep she brought Zh&iacute;lin a bit 
of mutton in her sleeve. She would just throw the things down and run away.</p><p> 
One day there was a heavy storm, and the rain fell in torrents for a whole 
hour. All the streams became turbid. At the ford, the water rose till it was 
seven feet high, and the current was so strong that it rolled the stones about. 
Rivulets flowed everywhere, and the rumbling in the hills never ceased. When 
the storm was over, the water ran in streams down the village street. 
Zh&iacute;lin got his master to lend him a knife, and with it he shaped a small 
cylinder, and cutting some little boards, he made a wheel to which he fixed two 
dolls, one on each side. The little girls brought him some bits of stuff, and 
he dressed the dolls, one as a peasant, the other as a peasant woman. Then he 
fastened them in their places, and set the wheel so that the stream should work 
it. The wheel began to turn and the dolls danced.</p><p> 
The whole village collected round. Little boys and girls, Tartar men and women, 
all came and clicked their tongues.</p><p> 
'Ah, Russ! Ah, Iv&aacute;n!'</p><p> 
Abdul had a Russian clock, which was broken.   <pb n="25"/>   He called Zh&iacute;lin and showed 
it to him, clicking his tongue.</p><p> 
'Give it me, I'll mend it for you,' said Zh&iacute;lin.</p><p> 
He took it to pieces with the knife, sorted the pieces, and put them together 
again, so that the clock went all right.</p><p> 
The master was delighted, and made him a present of one of his old tunics which 
was all in holes. Zh&iacute;lin had to accept it. He could, at any rate, use it 
as a coverlet at night.</p><p> 
After that Zh&iacute;lin's fame spread; and Tartars came from distant villages, 
bringing him now the lock of a gun or of a pistol, now a watch, to mend. His 
master gave him some tools &mdash; pincers, gimlets, and a file.</p><p> 
One day a Tartar fell ill, and they came to Zh&iacute;lin saying, 'Come and 
heal him!' Zh&iacute;lin knew nothing about doctoring, but he went to look, and 
thought to himself, 'Perhaps he will get well anyway.'</p><p> 
He returned to the barn, mixed some water with sand, and then in the presence 
of the Tartars whispered some words over it and gave it to the sick man to 
drink. Luckily for him, the Tartar recovered.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin began to pick up their language a little, and some of the Tartars 
grew familiar with him. When they wanted him, they would call: 'Iv&aacute;n! 
Iv&aacute;n!' Others, however, still looked at him askance, as at a wild 
beast.</p><p> 
The red-bearded Tartar disliked Zh&iacute;lin. Whenever he saw him he frowned 
and turned away, or swore at him. There was also an old man there who did not 
live in the Aoul, but used to come up from the foot of the hill. Zh&iacute;lin 
only saw him when he passed on his way to the Mosque. He was short, and had a 
white cloth wound round his hat. His beard and moustaches were clipped, and 
white as   <pb n="26"/>  snow; and his face was wrinkled and brick-red. His nose was hooked 
like a hawk's, his grey eyes looked cruel, and he had no teeth except two 
tusks. He would pass, with his turban on his head, leaning on his staff, and 
glaring round him like a wolf. If he saw Zh&iacute;lin he would snort with 
anger and turn away.</p><p> 
Once Zh&iacute;lin descended the hill to see where the old man lived. He went 
down along the pathway and came to a little garden surrounded by a stone wall; 
and behind the wall he saw cherry and apricot trees, and a hut with a flat 
roof. He came closer, and saw hives made of plaited straw, and bees flying 
about and humming. The old man was kneeling, busy doing something with a hive. 
Zh&iacute;lin stretched to look, and his shackles rattled. The old man turned 
round, and, giving a yell, snatched a pistol from his belt and shot at 
Zh&iacute;lin, who just managed to shelter himself behind the stone wall.</p><p> 
The old man went to Zh&iacute;lin's master to complain. The master called 
Zh&iacute;lin, and said with a laugh, 'Why did you go to the old man's 
house?'</p><p> 
'I did him no harm,' replied Zh&iacute;lin. 'I only wanted to see how he 
lived.'</p><p> 
The master repeated what Zh&iacute;lin said.</p><p> 
But the old man was in a rage; he hissed and jabbered, showing his tusks, and 
shaking his fists at Zh&iacute;lin.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin could not understand all, but he gathered that the old man was 
telling Abdul he ought not to keep Russians in the Aoul, but ought to kill 
them. At last the old man went away.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin asked the master who the old man was.</p><p> 
'He is a great man!' said the master. 'He was the bravest of our fellows; he 
killed many Russians and was at one time very rich. He had three wives and 
eight sons, and they all lived in one village. Then the Russians came and 
destroyed the village,   <pb n="27"/>  and killed seven of his sons. Only one son was left, and 
he gave himself up to the Russians. The old man also went and gave himself up, 
and lived among the Russians for three months. At the end of that time he found 
his son, killed him with his own hands, and then escaped. After that he left 
off fighting, and went to Mecca to pray to God; that is why he wears a turban. 
One who has been to Mecca is called "Hadji," and wears a turban. He does not 
like you fellows. He tells me to kill you. But I can't kill you. I have paid 
money for you and, besides, I have grown fond of you, Iv&aacute;n. Far from 
killing you, I would not even let you go if I had not promised.' And he 
laughed, saying in Russian, 'You, Iv&aacute;n, good; I, Abdul, good!'</p><p> 
</p> 
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="4" id="d13">

IV</head><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin lived in this way for a month. During the day he sauntered about 
the Aoul or busied himself with some handicraft, but at night, when all was 
silent in the Aoul, he dug at the floor of the barn. It was no easy task 
digging, because of the stones; but he worked away at them with his file, and 
at last had made a hole under the wall large enough to get through.</p><p> 
'If only I could get to know the lay of the land,' thought he, 'and which way 
to go! But none of the Tartars will tell me.'</p><p> 
So he chose a day when the master was away from home, and set off after dinner 
to climb the hill beyond the village, and to look around. But before leaving 
home the master always gave orders to his son to watch Zh&iacute;lin, and not 
to lose sight of him. So the lad ran after Zh&iacute;lin, shouting: 'Don't go! 
Father does not allow it. I'll call the neighbours if you won't come back.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin tried to persuade him, and said: 'I'm not   <pb n="28"/>  going far; I only want 
to climb that hill. I want to find a herb &mdash; to cure sick people with. You come 
with me if you like. How can I run away with these shackles on? To-morrow I'll 
make a bow and arrows for you.'</p><p> 
So he persuaded the lad, and they went. To look at the hill, it did not seem 
far to the top; but it was hard walking with shackles on his leg. Zh&iacute;lin 
went on and on, but it was all he could do to reach the top. There he sat down 
and noted how the land lay. To the south, beyond the barn, was a valley in 
which a herd of horses was pasturing and at the bottom of the valley one could 
see another Aoul. Beyond that was a still steeper hill, and another hill beyond 
that. Between the hills, in the blue distance, were forests, and still further 
off were mountains, rising higher and higher. The highest of them were covered 
with snow, white as sugar; and one snowy peak towered above all the rest. To 
the east and to the west were other such hills, and here and there smoke rose 
from Aouls in the ravines. 'Ah,' thought he, 'all that is Tartar country.' And 
he turned towards the Russian side. At his feet he saw a river, and the Aoul he 
lived in, surrounded by little gardens. He could see women, like tiny dolls, 
sitting by the river rinsing clothes. Beyond the Aoul was a hill, lower than 
the one to the south, and beyond it two other hills well wooded; and between 
these, a smooth bluish plain, and far, far across the plain something that 
looked like a cloud of smoke. Zh&iacute;lin tried to remember where the sun 
used to rise and set when he was living in the fort, and he saw that there was 
no mistake: the Russian fort must be in that plain. Between those two hills he 
would have to make his way when he escaped.</p><p> 
The sun was beginning to set. The white, snowy mountains turned red, and the 
dark hills turned   <pb n="29"/>  darker; mists rose from the ravine, and the valley, where he 
supposed the Russian fort to be, seemed on fire with the sunset glow. 
Zh&iacute;lin looked carefully. Something seemed to be quivering in the valley 
like smoke from a chimney, and he felt sure the Russian fortress was there.</p><p> 
It had grown late. The Mullah's cry was heard. The herds were being driven 
home, the cows were lowing, and the lad kept saying, 'Come home!' But 
Zh&iacute;lin did not feel inclined to go away.</p><p> 
At last, however, they went back. 'Well,' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'now that I 
know the way, it is time to escape.' He thought of running away that night. The 
nights were dark &mdash; the moon had waned. But as ill-luck would have it, the 
Tartars returned home that evening. They generally came back driving cattle 
before them and in good spirits. But this time they had no cattle. All they 
brought home was the dead body of a Tartar  &mdash; the red one's brother &mdash; who had 
been killed. They came back looking sullen, and they all gathered together for 
the burial. Zh&iacute;lin also came out to see it.</p><p> 
They wrapped the body in a piece of linen, without any coffin, and carried it 
out of the village, and laid it on the grass under some plane-trees. The Mullah 
and the old men came. They wound clothes round their caps, took off their 
shoes, and squatted on their heels, side by side, near the corpse.</p><p> 
The Mullah was in front: behind him in a row were three old men in turbans, and 
behind them again the other Tartars. All cast down their eyes and sat in 
silence. This continued a long time, until the Mullah raised his head and said: 
'Allah!' (which means God). He said that one word, and they all cast down their 
eyes again, and were again silent for a long time. They sat quite still, not 
moving or making any sound.</p>   <pb n="30"/>  <p> 
Again the Mullah lifted his head and said, 'Allah!' and they all repeated: 
'Allah! Allah!' and were again silent.</p><p> 
The dead body lay immovable on the grass, and they sat as still as if they too 
were dead. Not one of them moved. There was no sound but that of the leaves of 
the plane-trees stirring in the breeze. Then the Mullah repeated a prayer, and 
they all rose. They lifted the body and carried it in their arms to a hole in 
the ground. It was not an ordinary hole, but was hollowed out under the ground 
like a vault. They took the body under the arms and by the legs, bent it, and 
let it gently down, pushing it under the earth in a sitting posture, with the 
hands folded in front.</p><p> 
The Nog&aacute;y brought some green rushes, which they stuffed into the hole, 
and, quickly covering it with earth, they smoothed the ground, and set an 
upright stone at the head of the grave. Then they trod the earth down, and 
again sat in a row before the grave, keeping silence for a long time.</p><p> 
At last they rose, said 'Allah! Allah! Allah!' and sighed.</p><p> 
The red-bearded Tartar gave money to the old men; then he too rose, took a 
whip, struck himself with it three times on the forehead, and went home.</p><p> 
The next morning Zh&iacute;lin saw the red Tartar, followed by three others, 
leading a mare out of the village. When they were beyond the village, the 
red-bearded Tartar took off his tunic and turned up his sleeves, showing his 
stout arms. Then he drew a dagger and sharpened it on a whetstone. The other 
Tartars raised the mare's head, and he cut her throat, threw her down and began 
skinning her, loosening the hide with his big hands. Women and girls came and 
began to wash the entrails and the inwards. The mare was cut up, the pieces 
taken   <pb n="31"/>  into the hut, and the whole village collected at the red Tartar's hut for 
a funeral feast.</p><p> 
For three days they went on eating the flesh of the mare, drinking <hi rend="italic">buza</hi>, 
and praying for the dead man. All the Tartars were at home. On the fourth day 
at dinner-time Zh&iacute;lin saw them preparing to go away. Horses were brought 
out, they got ready, and some ten of them (the red one among them) rode away; 
but Abdul stayed at home. It was new moon, and the nights were still dark.</p><p> 
'Ah!' thought Zh&iacute;lin, 'to-night is the time to escape.' And he told 
Kost&iacute;lin; but Kost&iacute;lin's heart failed him.</p><p> 
'How can we escape?' he said. 'We don't even know the way.'</p><p> 
'I know the way,' said Zh&iacute;lin.</p><p> 
'Even if you do'' said Kost&iacute;lin, 'we can't reach the fort in one 
night.'</p><p> 
'If we can't,' said Zh&iacute;lin, 'we'll sleep in the forest. See here, I have 
saved some cheeses. What's the good of sitting and moping here? If they send 
your ransom  &mdash; well and good; but suppose they don't manage to collect it? The 
Tartars are angry now, because the Russians have killed one of their men. They 
are talking of killing us.'</p><p> 
Kost&iacute;lin thought it over.</p><p> 
'Well, let's go,' said he.</p><p> 
</p> 
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="5" id="d14"> 
<head> 
V</head><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin crept into the hole, widened it so that Kost&iacute;lin might 
also get through, and then they both sat waiting till all should be quiet in 
the Aoul.</p><p> 
As soon as all was quiet, Zh&iacute;lin crept under the wall, got out, and 
whispered to Kost&iacute;lin, 'Come!' Kost&iacute;lin crept out, but in so 
doing he caught a stone with his foot and made a noise. The master had a very 
vicious watch-dog, a spotted one called   <pb n="32"/>  Oulyashin. Zh&iacute;lin had been 
careful to feed him for some time before. Oulyashin heard the noise and began 
to bark and jump, and the other dogs did the same. Zh&iacute;lin gave a slight 
whistle, and threw him a bit of cheese. Oulyashin knew Zh&iacute;lin, wagged 
his tail, and stopped barking.</p><p> 
But the master had heard the dog, and shouted to him from his hut, 'Hayt, hayt, 
Oulyashin!'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin, however, scratched Oulyashin behind the ears, and the dog was 
quiet, and rubbed against his legs, wagging his tail</p><p> 
They sat hidden behind a corner for awhile. All became silent again, only a 
sheep coughed inside a shed, and the water rippled over the stones in the 
hollow. It was dark, the stars were high overhead, and the new moon showed red 
as it set, horns upward, behind the hill. In the valleys the fog was white as 
milk.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin rose and said to his companion, 'Well, friend, come along!'</p><p> 
They started; but they had only gone a few steps when they heard the Mullah 
crying from the roof, 'Allah, Beshmillah! Ilrahman!' That meant that the people 
would be going to the Mosque. So they sat down again, hiding behind a wall, and 
waited a long time till the people had passed. At last all was quiet again.</p><p> 
'Now then! May God be with us!' They crossed themselves, and started once more. 
They passed through a yard and went down the hillside to the river, crossed the 
river, and went along the valley.</p><p> 
The mist was thick, but only near the ground; overhead the stars shone quite 
brightly. Zh&iacute;lin directed their course by the stars. It was cool in the 
mist, and easy walking, only their boots were uncomfortable, being worn out and 
trodden down. Zh&iacute;lin took his off, threw them away, and went   <pb n="33"/>  barefoot, 
jumping from stone to stone, and guiding his course by the stars. 
Kost&iacute;lin began to lag behind.</p><p> 
'Walk slower,' he said, 'these confounded boots have quite blistered my 
feet.'</p><p> 
'Take them off!' said Zh&iacute;lin. 'It will be easier walking without 
them.'</p><p> 
Kost&iacute;lin went barefoot, but got on still worse. The stones cut his feet 
and he kept lagging behind. Zh&iacute;lin said: 'If your feet get cut, they'll 
heal again; but if the Tartars catch us and kill us, it will be worse!'</p><p> 
Kost&iacute;lin did not reply, but went on, groaning all the time.</p><p> 
Their way lay through the valley for a long time. Then, to the right, they 
heard dogs barking. Zh&iacute;lin stopped, looked about, and began climbing the 
hill feeling with his hands.</p><p> 
'Ah!' said he, 'we have gone wrong, and have come too far to the right. Here is 
another Aoul, one I saw from the hill. We must turn back and go up that hill to 
the left. There must be a wood there.'</p><p> 
But Kost&iacute;lin said: 'Wait a minute! Let me get breath. My feet are all 
cut and bleeding.'</p><p> 
'Never mind, friend! They'll heal again. You should spring more lightly. Like 
this!'</p><p> 
And Zh&iacute;lin ran back and turned to the left up the hill towards the 
wood.</p><p> 
Kost&iacute;lin still lagged behind, and groaned. Zh&iacute;lin only said 
'Hush!' and went on and on.</p><p> 
They went up the hill and found a wood as Zh&iacute;lin had said. They entered 
the wood and forced their way through the brambles, which tore their clothes. 
At last they came to a path and followed it.</p><p> 
'Stop!' They heard the tramp of hoofs on the path, and waited, listening. It 
sounded like the tramping of a horse's feet, but then ceased. They moved on, 
and again they heard the tramping.   <pb n="34"/>   When they paused, it also stopped. 
Zh&iacute;lin crept nearer to it, and saw something standing on the path where 
it was not quite so dark. It looked like a horse, and yet not quite like one, 
and on it was something queer, not like a man. He heard it snorting. 'What can 
it be?' Zh&iacute;lin gave a low whistle, and off it dashed from the path into 
the thicket, and the woods were filled with the noise of crackling, as if a 
hurricane were sweeping through, breaking the branches.</p><p> 
Kost&iacute;lin was so frightened that he sank to the ground. But Zh&iacute;lin 
laughed and said: 'It's a stag. Don't you hear him breaking the branches with 
his antlers? We were afraid of him, and he is afraid of us.'</p><p> 
They went on. The Great Bear was already setting. It was near morning, and they 
did not know whether they were going the right way or not. Zh&iacute;lin 
thought it was the way he had been brought by the Tartars, and that they were 
still some seven miles from the Russian fort; but he had nothing certain to go 
by, and at night one easily mistakes the way. After a time they came to a 
clearing. Kost&iacute;lin sat down and said: 'Do as you like, I can go no 
farther! My feet won't carry me.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin tried to persuade him.</p><p> 
'No I shall never get there, I can't!'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin grew angry, and spoke roughly to him.</p><p> 
'Well, then, I shall go on alone. Good-bye!'</p><p> 
Kost&iacute;lin jumped up and followed. They went another three miles. The mist 
in the wood had settled down still more densely; they could not see a yard 
before them, and the stars had grown dim.</p><p> 
Suddenly they heard the sound of a horse's hoofs in front of them. They heard 
its shoes strike the stones. Zh&iacute;lin lay down flat, and listened with his 
ear to the ground.</p><p> 
'Yes, so it is! A horseman is coming towards us.'</p>   <pb n="35"/>  <p> 
They ran off the path, crouched among the bushes and waited. Zh&iacute;lin 
crept to the road, looked, and saw a Tartar on horseback driving a cow and 
humming to himself. The Tartar rode past. Zh&iacute;lin returned to 
Kost&iacute;lin.</p><p> 
'God has led him past us; get up and let's go on!'</p><p> 
Kost&iacute;lin tried to rise, but fell back again.</p><p> 
'I can't; on my word I can't! I have no strength left.'</p><p> 
He was heavy and stout, and had been perspiring freely. Chilled by the mist, 
and with his feet all bleeding, he had grown quite limp.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin tried to lift him, when suddenly Kost&iacute;lin screamed out: 
'Oh, how it hurts!'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin's heart sank.</p><p> 
'What are you shouting for? The Tartar is still near; he'll have heard you!' 
And he thought to himself, 'He is really quite done up. What am I to do with 
him? It won't do to desert a comrade.'</p><p> 
'Well, then, get up, and climb up on my back. I'll carry you if you really 
can't walk.'</p><p> 
He helped Kost&iacute;lin up, and put his arms under his thighs. Then he went 
out on to the path, carrying him.</p><p> 
'Only, for the love of heaven,' said Zh&iacute;lin, 'don't throttle me with 
your hands! Hold on to my shoulders.'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin found his load heavy; his feet, too, were bleeding, and he was 
tired out. Now and then he stooped to balance Kost&iacute;lin better, jerking 
him up so that he should sit higher, and then went on again.</p><p> 
The Tartar must, however, really have heard Kost&iacute;lin scream. 
Zh&iacute;lin suddenly heard some one galloping behind and shouting in the 
Tartar tongue. He darted in among the bushes. The Tartar seized his gun and 
fired, but did not hit them, shouted in his own language, and galloped off 
along the road.</p>   <pb n="36"/>  <p> 
'Well, now we are lost, friend!' said Zh&iacute;lin. 'That dog will gather the 
Tartars together to hunt us down. Unless we can get a couple of miles away from 
here we are lost!' And he thought to himself, 'Why the devil did I saddle 
myself with this block? I should have got away long ago had I been alone.'</p><p> 
'Go on alone,' said Kost&iacute;lin. 'Why should you perish because of me?'</p><p> 
'No I won't go. It won't do to desert a comrade.'</p><p> 
Again he took Kost&iacute;lin on his shoulders and staggered on. They went on 
in that way for another half-mile or more. They were still in the forest, and 
could not see the end of it. But the mist was already dispersing, and clouds 
seemed to be gathering, the stars were no longer to be seen. Zh&iacute;lin was 
quite done up. They came to a spring walled in with stones by the side of the 
path. Zh&iacute;lin stopped and set Kost&iacute;lin down.</p><p> 
'Let me have a rest and a drink,' said he, 'and let us eat some of the cheese. 
It can't be much farther now.'</p><p> 
But hardly had he lain down to get a drink, when he heard the sound of horses' 
feet behind him. Again they darted to the right among the bushes, and lay down 
under a steep slope.</p><p> 
They heard Tartar voices. The Tartars stopped at the very spot where they had 
turned off the path. The Tartars talked a bit, and then seemed to be setting a 
dog on the scent. There was a sound of crackling twigs, and a strange dog 
appeared from behind the bushes. It stopped, and began to bark.</p><p> 
Then the Tartars, also strangers, came climbing down, seized Zh&iacute;lin and 
Kost&iacute;lin, bound them, put them on horses, and rode away with them.</p><p> 
When they had ridden about two miles, they met Abdul, their owner, with two 
other Tartars following him. After talking with the strangers,   <pb n="37"/>  he put 
Zh&iacute;lin and Kost&iacute;lin on two of his own horses and took them back 
to the Aoul.</p><p> 
Abdul did not laugh now, and did not say a word to them.</p><p> 
They were back at the Aoul by daybreak, and were set down in the street. The 
children came crowding round, throwing stones, shrieking, and beating them with 
whips.</p><p> 
The Tartars gathered together in a circle, and the old man from the foot of the 
hill was also there. They began discussing, and Zh&iacute;lin heard them 
considering what should be done with him and Kost&iacute;lin. Some said they 
ought to be sent farther into the mountains; but the old man said: 'They must 
be killed!'</p><p> 
Abdul disputed with him, saying: 'I gave money for them, and I must get ransom 
for them.' But the old man said: 'They will pay you nothing, but will only 
bring misfortune. It is a sin to feed Russians. Kill them, and have done with 
it!'</p><p> 
They dispersed. When they had gone, the master came up to Zh&iacute;lin and 
said: 'If the money for your ransom is not sent within a fortnight, I will flog 
you; and if you try to run away again, I'll kill you like a dog! Write a 
letter, and write properly!'</p><p> 
Paper was brought to them, and they wrote the letters. Shackles were put on 
their feet, and they were taken behind the Mosque to a deep pit about twelve 
feet square, into which they were let down.</p><p> 
</p> 
</div3> 
<div3 type="section" n="6" id="d15"> 
<head> 
VI</head><p> 
Life was now very hard for them. Their shackles were never taken off, and they 
were not let out into the fresh air. Unbaked dough was thrown to them as if 
they were dogs, and water was let down in a can.</p><p> 
It was wet and close in the pit, and there was a   <pb n="38"/>  horrible stench. 
Kost&iacute;lin grew quite ill, his body became swollen and he ached all over, 
and moaned or slept all the time. Zh&iacute;lin, too, grew downcast; he saw it 
was a bad look-out, and could think of no way of escape.</p><p> 
He tried to make a tunnel, but there was nowhere to put the earth. His master 
noticed it, and threatened to kill him.</p><p> 
He was sitting on the floor of the pit one day, thinking of freedom and feeling 
very downhearted, when suddenly a cake fell into his lap, then another, and 
then a shower of cherries. He looked up, and there was Dina. She looked at him, 
laughed, and ran away. And Zh&iacute;lin thought: 'Might not Dina help me?'</p><p> 
He cleared out a little place in the pit, scraped up some clay, and began 
modelling toys. He made men, horses, and dogs, thinking, 'When Dina comes I'll 
throw them up to her.'</p><p> 
But Dina did not come next day. Zh&iacute;lin heard the tramp of horses; some 
men rode past, and the Tartars gathered in council near the Mosque. They 
shouted and argued; the word 'Russians' was repeated several times. He could 
hear the voice of the old man. Though he could not distinguish what was said, 
he guessed that Russian troops were somewhere near, and that the Tartars, 
afraid they might come into the Aoul, did not know what to do with their 
prisoners.</p><p> 
After talking awhile, they went away. Suddenly he heard a rustling overhead, 
and saw Dina crouching at the edge of the pit, her knees higher than her head, 
and bending over so that the coins of her plait dangled above the pit. Her eyes 
gleamed like stars. She drew two cheeses out of her sleeve and threw them to 
him. Zh&iacute;lin took them and said, 'Why did you not come before? I have 
made some   <pb n="39"/>  toys for you. Here, catch!' And he began throwing the toys up, one by 
one.</p><p> 
But she shook her head and would not look at them.</p><p> 
'I don't want any,' she said. She sat silent for awhile, and then went on, 
'Iv&aacute;n, they want to kill you!' And she pointed to her own throat.</p><p> 
'Who wants to kill me?'</p><p> 
'Father; the old men say he must. But I am sorry for you!'</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin answered: 'Well, if you are sorry for me, bring me a long 
pole.'</p><p> 
She shook her head, as much as to say, 'I can't!'</p><p> 
He clasped his hands and prayed her: 'Dina, please do! Dear Dina, I beg of 
you!'</p><p> 
'I can't!' she said, 'they would see me bringing it. They're all at home.' And 
she went away.</p><p> 
So when evening came Zh&iacute;lin still sat looking up now and then, and 
wondering what would happen. The stars were there, but the moon had not yet 
risen. The Mullah's voice was heard; then all was silent. Zh&iacute;lin was 
beginning to doze, thinking: 'The girl will be afraid to do it!'</p><p> 
Suddenly he felt clay falling on his head. He looked up, and saw a long pole 
poking into the opposite wall of the pit. It kept poking about for a time, and 
then it came down, sliding into the pit. Zh&iacute;lin was glad indeed. He took 
hold of it and lowered it. It was a strong pole, one that he had seen before on 
the roof of his master's hut.</p><p> 
He looked up. The stars were shining high in the sky, and just above the pit 
Dina's eyes gleamed in the dark like a cat's. She stooped with her face close 
to the edge of the pit, and whispered, 'Iv&aacute;n! Iv&aacute;n!' waving her 
hand in front of her face to show that he should speak low.</p><p> 
'What?' said Zh&iacute;lin.</p><p> 
'All but two have gone away.'</p>   <pb n="40"/>  <p> 
Then Zh&iacute;lin said, 'Well, Kost&iacute;lin, come; let us have one last 
try; I'll help you up.'</p><p> 
But Kost&iacute;lin would not hear of it.</p><p> 
'No,' said he, 'It's clear I can't get away from here. How can I go, when I 
have hardly strength to turn round?'</p><p> 
'Well, good-bye, then! Don't think ill of me!' and they kissed each other. 
Zh&iacute;lin seized the pole, told Dina to hold on, and began to climb. He 
slipped once or twice; the shackles hindered him. Kost&iacute;lin helped him, 
and he managed to get to the top. Dina with her little hands, pulled with all 
her might at his shirt, laughing.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin drew out the pole and said, 'Put it back in its place, Dina, or 
they'll notice, and you will be beaten.'</p><p> 
She dragged the pole away, and Zh&iacute;lin went down the hill. When he had 
gone down the steep incline, he took a sharp stone and tried to wrench the lock 
off the shackles. But it was a strong lock and he could not manage to break it, 
and besides, it was difficult to get at. Then he heard some one running down 
the hill, springing lightly. He thought: 'Surely, that's Dina again.'</p><p> 
Dina came, took a stone and said, 'Let me try.'</p><p> 
She knelt down and tried to wrench the lock off, but her little hands were as 
slender as little twigs, and she had not the strength. She threw the stone away 
and began to cry. Then Zh&iacute;lin set to work again at the lock, and Dina 
squatted beside him with her hand on his shoulder.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin looked round and saw a red light to the left behind the hill. The 
moon was just rising. 'Ah!' he thought, 'before the moon has risen I must have 
passed the valley and be in the forest.' So he rose and threw away the stone. 
Shackles or no, he must go on.</p>   <pb n="41"/>  <p> 
'Good-bye, Dina dear!' he said. 'I shall never forget you!'</p><p> 
Dina seized hold of him and felt about with her hands for a place to put some 
cheeses she had brought. He took them from her.</p><p> 
'Thank you, my little one. Who will make dolls for you when I am gone?' And he 
stroked her head.</p><p> 
Dina burst into tears hiding her face in her hands. Then she ran up the hill 
like a young goat, the coins in her plait clinking against her back.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin crossed himself took the lock of his shackles in his hand to 
prevent its clattering, and went along the road, dragging his shackled leg, and 
looking towards the place where the moon was about to rise. He now knew the 
way. If he went straight he would have to walk nearly six miles. If only he 
could reach the wood before the moon had quite risen! He crossed the river; the 
light behind the hill was growing whiter. Still looking at it, he went along 
the valley. The moon was not yet visible. The light became brighter, and one 
side of the valley was growing lighter and lighter, and shadows were drawing in 
towards the foot of the hill, creeping nearer and nearer to him.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin went on, keeping in the shade. He was hurrying, but the moon was 
moving still faster; the tops of the hills on the right were already lit up. As 
he got near the wood the white moon appeared from behind the hills, and it 
became light as day. One could see all the leaves on the trees. It was light on 
the hill, but silent, as if nothing were alive; no sound could be heard but the 
gurgling of the river below.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin reached the wood without meeting any one, chose a dark spot, and 
sat down to rest.</p><p> 
He rested and ate one of the cheeses. Then he   <pb n="42"/>  found a stone and set to work 
again to knock off the shackles. He knocked his hands sore, but could not break 
the lock. He rose and went along the road. After walking the greater part of a 
mile he was quite done up, and his feet were aching. He had to stop every ten 
steps. 'There is nothing else for it,' thought he. 'I must drag on as long as I 
have any strength left. If I sit down, I shan't be able to rise again. I can't 
reach the fortress; but when day breaks I'll lie down in the forest, remain 
there all day, and go on again at night.'</p><p> 
He went on all night. Two Tartars on horseback passed him; but he heard them a 
long way off, and hid behind a tree.</p><p> 
The moon began to grow paler, the dew to fall. It was getting near dawn, and 
Zh&iacute;lin had not reached the end of the forest. 'Well,' thought he, 'I'll 
walk another thirty steps, and then turn in among the trees and sit down.'</p><p> 
He walked another thirty steps, and saw that he was at the end of the forest. 
He went to the edge; it was now quite light, and straight before him was the 
plain and the fortress. To the left, quite close at the foot of the slope, a 
fire was dying out, and the smoke from it spread round. There were men gathered 
about the fire.</p><p> 
He looked intently, and saw guns glistening. They were soldiers &mdash; Cossacks!</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin was filled with joy. He collected his remaining strength and set 
off down the hill, saying to himself: 'God forbid that any mounted Tartar 
should see me now, in the open field! Near as I am, I could not get there in 
time.'</p><p> 
Hardly had he said this when, a couple of hundred yards off, on a hillock to 
the left, he saw three Tartars.</p><p> 
They saw him also and made a rush. His heart   <pb n="43"/>  sank. He waved his hands, and 
shouted with all his might, 'Brothers, brothers! Help!'</p><p> 
The Cossacks heard him, and a party of them on horseback darted to cut across 
the Tartars' path. The Cossacks were far and the Tartars were near; but 
Zh&iacute;lin, too, made a last effort. Lifting the shackles with his hand, he 
ran towards the Cossacks, hardly knowing what he was doing, crossing himself 
and shouting, 'Brothers! Brothers! Brothers!'</p><p> 
There were some fifteen Cossacks. The Tartars were frightened, and stopped 
before reaching him. Zhilin staggered up to the Cossacks.</p><p> 
They surrounded him and began questioning him. 'Who are you? What are you? 
Where from?</p><p> 
But Zh&iacute;lin was quite beside himself, and could only weep and repeat, 
'Brothers! Brothers!'</p><p> 
Then the soldiers came running up and crowded round Zh&iacute;lin &mdash; one giving 
him bread, another buckwheat, a third v&oacute;dka: one wrapping a cloak round 
him, another breaking his shackles.</p><p> 
The officers recognized him, and rode with him to the fortress. The soldiers 
were glad to see him back, and his comrades all gathered round him.</p><p> 
Zh&iacute;lin told them all that had happened to him.</p><p> 
'That's the way I went home and got married!' said he. 'No. It seems plain that 
fate was against it!'</p><p> 
So he went on serving in the Caucasus. A month passed before Kost&iacute;lin 
was released, after paying five thousand r&uacute;bles ransom. He was almost dead 
when they brought him back.</p><p>

<head>THE BEAR-HUNT</head> 

<p>[The adventure here narrated is one that happened to Tolstoy himself in 1858. 
More than twenty years later he gave up hunting, on humanitarian grounds.]</p> 
<p>WE were out on a bear-hunting expedition. My comrade had shot at a bear, but 
only gave him a flesh-wound. There were traces of blood on the snow, but the 
bear had got away.</p><p> 
We all collected in a group in the forest, to decide whether we ought to go 
after the bear at once, or wait two or three days till he should settle down 
again. We asked the peasant bear-drivers whether it would be possible to get 
round the bear that day.</p><p> 
'No. It's impossible,' said an old bear-driver. 'You must let the bear quiet 
down. In five days' time it will be possible to surround him; but if you 
followed him now, you would only frighten him away, and he would not settle 
down.'</p><p> 
But a young bear-driver began disputing with the old man, saying that it was 
quite possible to get round the bear now.</p><p> 
'On such snow as this,' said he, 'he won't go far, for he is a fat bear. He 
will settle down before evening; or, if not, I can overtake him on 
snowshoes.'</p><p> 
The comrade I was with was against following up the bear, and advised waiting. 
But I said:</p><p> 
'We need not argue. You do as you like, but I will follow up the track with 
Damian. If we get round the bear, all right. If not, we lose nothing. It is 
still early, and there is nothing else for us to do to-day.'</p>   <pb n="45"/>  <p> 
So it was arranged.</p><p> 
The others went back to the sledges, and returned to the village. Damian and I 
took some bread, and remained behind in the forest.</p><p> 
When they had all left us, Damian and I examined our guns, and after tucking 
the skirts of our warm coats into our belts, we started off, following the 
bear's tracks.</p><p> 
The weather was fine, frosty and calm; but it was hard work snow-shoeing. The 
snow was deep and soft: it had not caked together at all in the forest, and 
fresh snow had fallen the day before, so that our snow-shoes sank six inches 
deep in the snow, and sometimes more.</p><p> 
The bear's tracks were visible from a distance, and we could see how he had 
been going; sometimes sinking in up to his belly and ploughing up the snow as 
he went. At first, while under large trees, we kept in sight of his track; but 
when it turned into a thicket of small firs, Damian stopped.</p><p> 
'We must leave the trail now,' said he. 'He has probably settled somewhere 
here. You can see by the snow that he has been squatting down. Let us leave the 
track and go round; but we must go quietly. Don't shout or cough, or we shall 
frighten him away.'</p><p> 
Leaving the track, therefore, we turned off to the left. But when we had gone 
about five hundred yards, there were the bear's traces again right before us. 
We followed them, and they brought us out on to the road. There we stopped, 
examining the road to see which way the bear had gone. Here and there in the 
snow were prints of the bear's paw, claws and all, and here and there the marks 
of a peasant's bark shoes. The bear had evidently gone towards the village.</p><p> 
As we followed the road, Damian said:</p>   <pb n="46"/>  <p> 
'It's no use watching the road now. We shall see where he has turned off, to 
right or left, by the marks in the soft snow at the side. He must have turned 
off somewhere; for he won't have gone on to the village.'</p><p> 
We went along the road for nearly a mile, and then saw, ahead of us, the bear's 
track turning off the road. We examined it. How strange! It was a bear's track 
right enough, only not going from the road into the forest, but from the forest 
on to the road! The toes were pointing towards the road.</p><p> 
'This must be another bear,' I said.</p><p> 
Damian looked at it, and considered a while.</p><p> 
'No,' said he. 'It's the same one. He's been playing tricks, and walked 
backwards when he left the road.'</p><p> 
We followed the track, and found it really was so! The bear had gone some ten 
steps backwards, and then, behind a fir tree, had turned round and gone 
straight ahead. Damian stopped and said:</p><p> 
'Now, we are sure to get round him. There is a marsh ahead of us, and he must 
have settled down there. Let us go round it.'</p><p> 
We began to make our way round, through a fir thicket. I was tired out by this 
time, and it had become still more difficult to get along. Now I glided on to 
juniper bushes and caught my snow-shoes in them, now a tiny fir tree appeared 
between my feet, or, from want of practise, my snow-shoes slipped off; and now 
I came upon a stump or a log hidden by the snow. I was getting very tired, and 
was drenched with perspiration; and I took off my fur cloak. And there was 
Damian all the time, gliding along as if in a boat, his snowshoes moving as if 
of their own accord, never catching against anything, nor slipping off. He even 
took my fur and slung it over his shoulder, and still kept urging me on.</p>   <pb n="47"/>  <p> 
We went on for two more miles, and came out on the other side of the marsh. I 
was lagging behind. My snow-shoes kept slipping off, and my feet stumbled. 
Suddenly Damian, who was ahead of me, stopped and waved his arm. When I came up 
to him, he bent down, pointing with his hand, and whispered:</p><p> 
'Do you see the magpie chattering above that undergrowth? It scents the bear 
from afar. That is where he must be.'</p><p> 
We turned off and went on for more than another half-mile, and presently we 
came on to the old track again. We had, therefore, been right round the bear 
who was now within the track we had left. We stopped, and I took off my cap and 
loosened all my clothes. I was as hot as in a steam bath, and as wet as a 
drowned rat. Damian too was flushed, and wiped his face with his sleeve.</p><p> 
'Well, sir,' he said, 'we have done our job, and now we must have a rest.'</p><p> 
The evening glow already showed red through the forest. We took off our 
snow-shoes and sat down on them, and got some bread and salt out of our bags. 
First I ate some snow, and then some bread; and the bread tasted so good, that 
I thought I had never in my life had any like it before. We sat there resting 
until it began to grow dusk, and then I asked Damian if it was far to the 
village.</p><p> 
'Yes,' he said. 'It must be about eight miles. We will go on there to-night, 
but now we must rest. Put on your fur coat, sir, or you'll be catching cold.'</p><p> 
Damian flattened down the snow, and breaking off some fir branches made a bed 
of them. We lay down side by side, resting our heads on our arms. I do not 
remember how I fell asleep. Two hours later I woke up, hearing something 
crack.</p><p> 
I had slept so soundly that I did not know where   <pb n="48"/>  I was. I looked around me. How 
wonderful! I was in some sort of a hall, all glittering and white with gleaming 
pillars, and when I looked up I saw, through delicate white tracery, a vault, 
raven black and studded with coloured lights. After a good look, I remembered 
that we were in the forest, and that what I took for a hall and pillars, were 
trees covered with snow and hoar-frost, and the coloured lights were stars 
twinkling between the branches.</p><p> 
Hoar-frost had settled in the night; all the twigs were thick with it, Damian 
was covered with it, it was on my fur coat, and it dropped down from the trees. 
I woke Damian, and we put on our snowshoes and started. It was very quiet in 
the forest. No sound was heard but that of our snow-shoes pushing through the 
soft snow; except when now and then a tree, cracked by the frost, made the 
forest resound. Only once we heard the sound of a living creature. Something 
rustled close to us, and then rushed away. I felt sure it was the bear, but 
when we went to the spot whence the sound had come, we found the footmarks of 
hares, and saw several young aspen trees with their bark gnawed. We had 
startled some hares while they were feeding.</p><p> 
We came out on the road, and followed it, dragging our snow-shoes behind us. It 
was easy walking now. Our snow-shoes clattered as they slid behind us from side 
to side of the hard-trodden road. The snow creaked under our boots, and the 
cold hoar-frost settled on our faces like down. Seen through the branches, the 
stars seemed to be running to meet us, now twinkling, now vanishing, as if the 
whole sky were on the move.</p><p> 
I found my comrade sleeping, but woke him up, and related how we had got round 
the bear. After   <pb n="49"/>  telling our peasant host to collect beaters for the morning, we 
had supper and lay down to sleep.</p><p> 
I was so tired that I could have slept on till midday, if my comrade had not 
roused me. I jumped up, and saw that he was already dressed, and busy doing 
something to his gun.</p><p> 
'Where is Damian?' said I.</p><p> 
'In the forest, long ago. He has already been over the tracks you made, and 
been back here, and now he has gone to look after the beaters.'</p><p> 
I washed and dressed, and loaded my guns; and then we got into a sledge, and 
started.</p><p> 
The sharp frost still continued. It was quiet, and the sun could not be seen. 
There was a thick mist above us, and hoar-frost still covered everything.</p><p> 
After driving about two miles along the road, as we came near the forest, we 
saw a cloud of smoke rising from a hollow, and presently reached a group of 
peasants, both men and women, armed with cudgels.</p><p> 
We got out and went up to them. The men sat roasting potatoes, and laughing and 
talking with the women.</p><p> 
Damian was there too; and when we arrived the people got up, and Damian led 
them away to place them in the circle we had made the day before. They went 
along in single file, men and women, thirty in all. The snow was so deep that 
we could only see them from their waists upwards. They turned into the forest, 
and my friend and I followed in their track.</p><p> 
Though they had trodden a path, walking was difficult, but, on the other hand, 
it was impossible to fall: it was like walking between two walls of snow.</p><p> 
We went on in this way for nearly half a mile,   <pb n="50"/>  when all at once we saw Damian 
coming from another direction &mdash; running towards us on his snowshoes, and 
beckoning us to join him. We went towards him, and he showed us where to stand. 
I took my place, and looked round me.</p><p> 
To my left were tall fir trees, between the trunks of which I could see a good 
way, and, like a black patch just visible behind the trees, I could see a 
beater. In front of me was a thicket of young firs, about as high as a man, 
their branches weighed down and stuck together with snow. Through this copse 
ran a path thickly covered with snow, and leading straight up to where I stood. 
The thicket stretched away to the right of me, and ended in a small glade, 
where I could see Damian placing my comrade.</p><p> 
I examined both my guns, and considered where I had better stand. Three steps 
behind me was a tall fir.</p><p> 
'That's where I'll stand,' thought I, 'and then I can lean my second gun 
against the tree'; and I moved towards the tree, sinking up to my knees in the 
snow at each step. I trod the snow down, and made a clearance about a yard 
square, to stand on. One gun I kept in my hand; the other, ready cocked, I 
placed leaning up against the tree. Then I unsheathed and replaced my dagger, 
to make sure that I could draw it easily in case of need.</p><p> 
Just as I had finished these preparations, I heard Damian shouting in the 
forest:</p><p> 
'He's up! He's up!'</p><p> 
And as soon as Damian shouted, the peasants round the circle all replied in 
their different voices.</p><p> 
'Up, up, up! Ou! Ou! Ou!' shouted the men.</p><p> 
'Ay! Ay! Ay!' screamed the women in high. pitched tones.</p><p> 
The bear was inside the circle, and as Damian   <pb n="51"/>  drove him on, the people all 
round kept shouting. Only my friend and I stood silent and motionless, waiting 
for the bear to come towards us. As I stood gazing and listening, my heart beat 
violently. I trembled, holding my gun fast.</p><p> 
'Now now,' I thought. 'He will come suddenly. I shall aim, fire, and he will 
drop &mdash; '</p><p> 
Suddenly, to my left, but at a distance, I heard something falling on the snow. 
I looked between the tall fir trees, and, some fifty paces off, behind the 
trunks, saw something big and black. I took aim and waited, thinking:</p><p> 
'Won't he come any nearer?'</p><p> 
As I waited I saw him move his ears, turn, and go back; and then I caught a 
glimpse of the whole of him in profile. He was an immense brute. In my 
excitement, I fired, and heard my bullet go 'flop' against a tree. Peering 
through the smoke, I saw my bear scampering back into the circle, and 
disappearing among the trees.</p><p> 
'Well,' thought I. 'My chance is lost. He won't come back to me. Either my 
comrade will shoot him, or he will escape through the line of beaters. In any 
case he won't give me another chance.'</p><p> 
I reloaded my gun, however, and again stood listening. The peasants were 
shouting all round, but to the right, not far from where my comrade stood, I 
heard a woman screaming in a frenzied voice: 'Here he is! Here he is! Come 
here, come here! Oh! Oh! Ay! Ay!'</p><p> 
Evidently she could see the bear. I had given up expecting him, and was looking 
to the right at my comrade. All at once I saw Damian with a stick in his hand, 
and without his snow-shoes, running along a footpath towards my friend. He 
crouched down beside him, pointing his stick as if aiming at   <pb n="52"/>   something, and 
then I saw my friend raise his gun and aim in the same direction. Crack! He 
fired.</p><p> 
'There,' thought I. 'He has killed him.'</p><p> 
But I saw that my comrade did not run towards the bear. Evidently he had missed 
him, or the shot had not taken full effect.</p><p> 
'The bear will get away,' I thought. 'He will go back, but he won't come a 
second time towards me. &mdash;  But what is that?'</p><p> 
Something was coming towards me like a whirlwind, snorting as it came; and I 
saw the snow flying up quite near me. I glanced straight before me, and there 
was the bear, rushing along the path through the thicket right at me, evidently 
beside himself with fear. He was hardly half a dozen paces off, and I could see 
the whole of him &mdash; his black chest and enormous head with a reddish patch. 
There he was, blundering straight at me, and scattering the snow about as he 
came. I could see by his eyes that he did not see me, but, mad with fear, was 
rushing blindly along; and his path led him straight at the tree under which I 
was standing. I raised my gun and fired. He was almost upon me now, and I saw 
that I had missed. My bullet had gone past him, and he did not even hear me 
fire, but still came headlong towards me. I lowered my gun, and fired again, 
almost touching his head. Crack! I had hit, but not killed him!</p><p> 
He raised his head, and laying his ears back, came at me, showing his teeth.</p><p> 
I snatched at my other gun, but almost before I had touched it, he had down at 
me and, knocking me over into the snow, had passed right over me.</p><p> 
'Thank goodness, he has left me,' thought I.</p><p> 
I tried to rise, but something pressed me down, and prevented my getting up. 
The bear's rush had carried him past me, but he had turned back, and   <pb n="53"/>  had fallen 
on me with the whole weight of his body. I felt something heavy weighing me 
down, and something warm above my face, and I realized that he was drawing my 
whole face into his mouth. My nose was already in it, and I felt the heat of 
it, and smelt his blood. He was pressing my shoulders down with his paws so 
that I could not move: all I could do was to draw my head down towards my chest 
away from his mouth, trying to free my nose and eyes, while he tried to get his 
teeth into them. Then I felt that he had seized my forehead just under the hair 
with the teeth of his lower jaw, and the flesh below my eyes with his upper 
jaw, and was closing his teeth. It was as if my face were being cut with 
knives. I struggled to get away, while he made haste to close his jaws like a 
dog gnawing. I managed to twist my face away, but he began drawing it again 
into his mouth.</p><p> 
'Now,' thought I, 'my end has come!'</p><p> 
Then I felt the weight lifted, and looking up, I saw that he was no longer 
there. He had jumped off me and run away.</p><p> 
When my comrade and Damian had seen the bear knock me down and begin worrying 
me, they rushed to the rescue. My comrade, in his haste, blundered, and instead 
of following the trodden path, ran into the deep snow and fell down. While he 
was struggling out of the snow, the bear was gnawing at me. But Damian just as 
he was, without a gun, and with only a stick in his hand, rushed along the path 
shouting:</p><p> 
'He's eating the master! He's eating the master!'</p><p> 
And as he ran, he called to the bear:</p><p> 
'Oh you idiot! What are you doing? Leave off! Leave off!'</p><p> 
The bear obeyed him, and leaving me ran away.   <pb n="54"/>  When I rose, there was as much 
blood on the snow as if a sheep had been killed, and the flesh hung in rags 
above my eyes, though in my excitement I felt no pain.</p><p> 
My comrade had come up by this time, and the other people collected round: they 
looked at my wound, and put snow on it. But I, forgetting about my wounds, only 
asked:</p><p> 
'Where's the bear? Which way has he gone?'</p><p> 
Suddenly I heard:</p><p> 
'Here he is! Here he is!'</p><p> 
And we saw the bear again running at us. We seized our guns, but before any one 
had time to fire he had run past. He had grown ferocious, and wanted to gnaw me 
again, but seeing so many people he took fright. We saw by his track that his 
head was bleeding and we wanted to follow him up; but, as my wounds had become 
very painful, we went, instead, to the town to find a doctor.</p><p> 
The doctor stitched up my wounds with silk, and they soon began to heal.</p><p> 
A month later we went to hunt that bear again, but I did not get a chance of 
finishing him. He would not come out of the circle, but went round and round 
growling in a terrible voice.</p><p> 
Damian killed him. The bear's lower jaw had been broken, and one of his teeth 
knocked out by my bullet.</p><p> 
He was a huge creature, and had splendid black fur.</p><p> 
I had him stuffed, and he now lies in my room. The wounds on my forehead healed 
up so that the scars can scarcely be seen.</p><p>

I</head><p> 
A SHOEMAKER named Simon, who had neither house nor land of his own, lived with 
his wife and children in a peasant's hut, and earned his living by his work. 
Work was cheap but bread was dear, and what he earned he spent for food. The 
man and his wife had but one sheepskin coat between them for winter wear, and 
even that was worn to tatters, and this was the second year he had been wanting 
to buy sheep-skins for a new coat. Before winter Simon saved up a little money: 
a three-r&uacute;ble note lay hidden in his wife's box, and five r&uacute;bles   <pb n="56"/>  and twenty 
kopeks were owed him by customers in the 
village.</p><p> 
So one morning he prepared to go to the village to buy the sheep-skins. He put 
on over his shirt his wife's wadded nankeen jacket, and over that he put his 
own cloth coat. He took the three-r&uacute;ble note in his pocket, cut himself a 
stick to serve as a staff, and started off after breakfast. 'I'll collect the 
five r&uacute;bles that are due to me,' thought he, 'add the three I have got, and 
that will be enough to buy sheep-skins for the winter coat.'</p><p> 
He came to the village and called at a peasant's hut, but the man was not at 
home. The peasant's wife promised that the money should be paid next week, but 
she would not pay it herself. Then Simon called on another peasant, but this 
one swore he had no money, and would only pay twenty kopeks which he owed for a 
pair of boots Simon had mended. Simon then tried to buy the sheep-skins on 
credit, but the deader would not trust him.</p><p> 
'Bring your money,' said he, 'then you may have your pick of the skins. We know 
what debt-collecting is like.'</p><p> 
So all the business the shoemaker did was to get the twenty kopeks for boots he 
had mended, and to take a pair of felt boots a peasant gave him to sole with 
leather.</p><p> 
Simon felt downhearted. He spent the twenty kopeks on v&oacute;dka, and started 
homewards without having bought any skins. In the morning he had felt the 
frost; but now, after drinking the v&oacute;dka, he felt warm even without a 
sheep-skin coat. He trudged along, striking his stick on the frozen earth with 
one hand, swinging the felt boots with the other, and talking to himself.</p>   <pb n="57"/>  <p> 
'I'm quite warm,' said he, 'though I have no sheepskin coat. I've had a drop, 
and it runs through all my veins. I need no sheepskins. I go along and don't 
worry about anything. That's the sort of man I am! What do I care? I can live 
without sheep skins. I don't need them. My wife will fret, to be sure. And, 
true enough, it's a shame; one works all day long, and then does not get paid. 
Stop a bit! If you don't bring that money along, sure enough I'll skin you, 
blessed if I don't. How's that? He pays twenty kopeks at a time! What can I do 
with twenty kopeks: Drink it &mdash; that's all one can do! Hard up, he says he is! 
So he may be &mdash; but what about me? You have house, and cattle, and everything; 
I've only what I stand up in! You have corn of your own growing; I have to buy 
every grain. Do what I will, I must spend three r&uacute;bles every week for bread 
alone. I come home and find the bread all used up, and I have to fork out 
another r&uacute;ble and a half. So just you pay up what you owe, and no nonsense 
about it!'</p><p> 
By this time he had nearly reached the shrine at the bend of the road. Looking 
up, he saw something whitish behind the shrine. The daylight was fading, and 
the shoemaker peered at the thing without being able to make out what it was. 
'There was no white stone here before. Can it be an ox? It's not like an ox. It 
has a head like a man, but it's too white; and what could a man be doing 
there?'</p><p> 
He came closer, so that it was clearly visible. To his surprise it really was a 
man, alive or dead, sitting naked, leaning motionless against the shrine. 
Terror seized the shoemaker, and he thought, 'Some one has killed him, stripped 
him, and left him here. If I meddle I shall surely get into trouble.'</p><p> 
So the shoemaker went on. He passed in front of the shrine so that he could not 
see the man.   <pb n="58"/>   When he had gone some way, he looked back, and saw that the man 
was no longer leaning against the shrine, but was moving as if looking towards 
him. The shoemaker felt more frightened than before, and thought, 'Shall I go 
back to him, or shall I go on? If I go near him something dreadful may happen. 
Who knows who the fellow is? He has not come here for any good. If I go near 
him he may jump up and throttle me, and there will be no getting away. Or if 
not, he'd still be a burden on one's hands. What could I do with a naked man? I 
couldn't give him my last clothes. Heaven only help me to get away!'</p><p> 
So the shoemaker hurried on, leaving the shrine behind him &mdash; when suddenly his 
conscience smote him and he stopped in the road.</p><p> 
'What are you doing, Simon?' said he to himself. 'The man may be dying of want, 
and you slip past afraid. Have you grown so rich as to be afraid of robbers? 
Ah, Simon, shame on you!'</p><p> 
So he turned back and went up to the man.</p> 
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="2" id="d20"> 
<head> 
II</head><p> 
Simon approached the stranger, looked at him, and saw that he was a young man, 
fit, with no bruises on his body, only evidently freezing and frightened, and 
he sat there leaning back without looking up at Simon, as if too faint to lift 
his eyes. Simon went close to him, and then the man seemed to wake up. Turning 
his head, he opened his eyes and looked into Simon's face. That one look was 
enough to make Simon fond of the man. He threw the felt boots on the ground 
undid his sash, laid it on the boots, and took off his cloth coat.</p><p> 
'It's not a time for talking,' said he. 'Come, put this coat on at once!' And 
Simon took the man by the elbows and helped him to rise. As he stood   <pb n="59"/>   there, 
Simon saw that his body was clean and in good condition, his hands and feet 
shapely, and his face good and kind. He threw his coat over the man's shoulders 
but the latter could not find the sleeves. Simon guided his arms into them, and 
drawing the coat well on trapped it closely about him, tying the sash round the 
man's waist.</p><p> 
Simon even took off his torn cap to put it on the man's head, but then his own 
head felt cold, and he thought: 'I'm quite bald, while he has long curly hair.' 
So he put his cap on his own head again. 'It will be better to give him 
something for his feet,' thought he; and he made the man sit down, and helped 
him to put on the felt boots, saying, 'There, friend, now move about and warm 
yourself. Other matters can be settled later on. Can you walk?'</p><p> 
The man stood up and looked kindly at Simon, but could not say a word.</p><p> 
'Why don't you speak?'  said Simon. 'It's too cold to stay here; we must be 
getting home. There now, take my stick, and if you're feeling weak, lean on 
that. Now step out!'</p><p> 
The man started walking, and moved easily, not lagging behind.</p><p> 
As they went along, Simon asked him, 'And where do you belong to?'</p><p> 
'I'm not from these parts.'</p><p> 
'I thought as much. I know the folks hereabouts. But how did you come to be 
there by the shrine?'</p><p> 
'I cannot tell.'</p><p> 
'Has some one been ill-treating you?'</p><p> 
'No one has ill-treated me. God has punished me.</p><p> 
'Of course God rules all. Still, you'll have to find food and shelter 
somewhere. Where do you want to go to?'</p><p> 
'It is all the same to me.'</p>   <pb n="60"/>  <p> 
Simon was amazed. The man did not look like a rogue, and he spoke gently, but 
yet he gave no account of himself. Still Simon thought, 'Who knows what may 
have happened?' And he said to the stranger: 'Well then, come home with me, and 
at least warm yourself awhile.'</p><p> 
So Simon walked towards his home, and the stranger kept up with him, walking at 
his side. The wind had risen and Simon felt it cold under his shirt. He was 
getting over his tipsiness by now, and began to feel the frost. He went along 
sniffling and wrapping his wife's coat round him, and he thought to himself: 
'There now &mdash; talk about sheepskins! I went out for sheepskins and come home 
without even a coat to my back and what is more, I'm bringing a naked man along 
with me. Matry&oacute;na won't be pleased!' And when he thought of his wife he 
felt sad; but when he looked at the stranger and remembered how he had looked 
up at him at the shrine, his heart was glad.</p> 
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="3" id="d21"> 
<head> 
III</head><p> 
Simon's wife had everything ready early that day. She had cut wood, brought 
water, fed the children eaten her own meal, and now she sat thinking. She 
wondered when she ought to make bread: now or to-morrow? There was still a 
large piece left.</p><p> 
'If Simon has had some dinner in town,' thought she, and does not eat much for 
supper, the bread will last out another day.'</p><p> 
She weighed the piece of bread in her hand again and again, and thought: 'I 
won't make any more to-day. We have only enough flour left to bake one batch. 
We can manage to make this last out till Friday.'</p><p> 
So Matry&oacute;na put away the bread, and sat down   <pb n="61"/>   at the table to patch her 
husband's shirt. While she worked she thought how her husband was buying skins 
for a winter coat.</p><p> 
'If only the dealer does not cheat him. My good man is much too simple; he 
cheats nobody, but any child can take him in. Eight r&uacute;bles is a lot of money 
&mdash; he should get a good coat at that price. Not tanned skins, but still a 
proper winter coat. How difficult it was last winter to get on without a warm 
coat. I could neither get down to the river, nor go out anywhere. When he went 
out he put on all we had, and there was nothing left for me. He did not start 
very early to-day, but still it's time he was back. I only hope he has not gone 
on the spree!'</p><p> 
Hardly had Matry&oacute;na thought this, when steps were heard on the 
threshold, and some one entered. Matry&oacute;na stuck her needle into her work 
and went out into the passage. There she saw two men: Simon, and with him a man 
without a hat, and wearing felt boots.</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na noticed at once that her husband smelt of spirits. 'There now, 
he has been drinking,' thought she. And when she saw that he was coatless, had 
only her jacket on, brought no parcel, stood there silent, and seemed ashamed, 
her heart was ready to break with disappointment. 'He has drunk the money,' 
thought she, 'and has been on the spree with some good-for-nothing fellow whom 
he has brought home with him.'</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na let them pass into the hut, followed them in, and saw that the 
stranger was a young, slight man, wearing her husband's coat. There was no 
shirt to be seen under it, and he had no hat. Having entered, he stood neither 
moving, nor raising his eyes, and Matry&oacute;na thought: 'He must be a bad 
man &mdash; he's afraid.'</p>   <pb n="62"/>  <p> 
Matry&oacute;na frowned, and stood beside the oven looking to see what they 
would do.</p><p> 
Simon took off his cap and sat down on the bench as if things were all right.</p><p> 
'Come, Matry&oacute;na; if supper is ready, let us have some.'</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na muttered something to herself and did not move, but stayed 
where she was, by the oven. She looked first at the one and then at the other 
of them, and only shook her head. Simon saw that his wife was annoyed, but 
tried to pass it off. Pretending not to notice anything, he took the stranger 
by the arm.</p><p> 
'Sit down, friend,' said he, 'and let us have some supper.'</p><p> 
The stranger sat down on the bench.</p><p> 
'Haven't you cooked anything for us?' said Simon.</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na's anger boiled over. 'I've cooked, but not for you. It seems to 
me you have drunk your wits away. You went to buy a sheep-skin coat, but come 
home without so much as the coat you had on, and bring a naked vagabond home 
with you. I have no supper for drunkards like you.'</p><p> 
'That's enough, Matry&oacute;na. Don't wag your tongue without reason! You had 
better ask what sort of man &mdash;'</p><p> 
'And you tell me what you've done with the money?'</p><p> 
Simon found the pocket of the jacket, drew out the three-r&uacute;ble note, and 
unfolded it.</p><p> 
'Here is the money. Tr&iacute;fonof did not pay, but promises to pay soon.'</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na got still more angry; he had bought no sheep-skins, but had put 
his only coat on some naked fellow and had even brought him to their house.</p>   <pb n="63"/>  <p> 
She snatched up the note from the table, took it to put away in safety, and 
said: 'I have no supper for you. We can't feed all the naked drunkards in the 
world.'</p><p> 
'There now, Matry&oacute;na, hold your tongue a bit. First hear what a man has 
to say!'</p><p> 
'Much wisdom I shall hear from a drunken fool. I was right in not wanting to 
marry you &mdash; a drunkard. The linen my mother gave me you drank; and now you've 
been to buy a coat &mdash; and have drunk it too!'</p><p> 
Simon tried to explain to his wife that he had only spent twenty kopeks; tried 
to tell how he had found the man &mdash; but Matry&oacute;na would not let him get a 
word in. She talked nineteen to the dozen, and dragged in things that had 
happened ten years before.</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na talked and talked, and at last she flew at Simon and seized him 
by the sleeve.</p><p> 
'Give me my jacket. It is the only one I have and you must needs take it from 
me and wear it yourself. Give it here, you mangy dog, and may the devil take 
you.'</p><p> 
Simon began to pull off the jacket, and turned a sleeve of it inside out; 
Matry&oacute;na seized the jacket and it burst its seams. She snatched it up, 
threw it over her head and went to the door. She meant to go out, but stopped 
undecided &mdash; she wanted to work off her anger, but she also wanted to learn 
what sort of a man the stranger was.</p> 
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="4" id="d22"> 
<head> 
IV</head><p> 
Matry&oacute;na stopped and said: 'If he were a good man he would not be naked. 
Why, he hasn't even a shirt on him. If he were all right, you would say where 
you came across the fellow.'</p><p> 
'That's just what I am trying to tell you,' said   <pb n="64"/>  Simon. 'As I came to the 
shrine I saw him sitting all naked and frozen. It isn't quite the weather to 
sit about naked! God sent me to him, or he would have perished. What was I to 
do? How do we know what may have happened to him? So I took him, clothed him, 
and brought him along. Don't be so angry, Matry&oacute;na. It is a sin. 
Remember, we all must die one day.'</p><p> 
Angry words rose to Matry&oacute;na's lips, but she looked at the stranger and 
was silent. He sat on the edge of the bench, motionless, his hands folded on 
his knees, his head drooping on his breast, his eyes closed, and his brows knit 
as if in pain. Matry&oacute;na was silent, and Simon said: 'Matry&oacute;na, 
have you no love of God?'</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na heard these words, and as she looked at the stranger, suddenly 
her heart softened towards him. She came back from the door, and going to the 
oven she got out the supper. Setting a cup on the table, she poured out some 
<hi rend="italic">kvas</hi>. Then she brought out the 
last piece of bread, and set out a knife and spoons.</p><p> 
'Eat, if you want to,' said she.</p><p> 
Simon drew the stranger to the table.</p><p> 
'Take your place, young man,' said he.</p><p> 
Simon cut the bread, crumbled it into the broth, and they began to eat. 
Matry&oacute;na sat at the corner of the table, resting her head on her hand 
and looking at the stranger.</p><p> 
And Matry&oacute;na was touched with pity for the stranger, and began to feel 
fond of him. And at once the stranger's face lit up; his brows were no longer 
bent, he raised his eyes and smiled at Matry&oacute;na.</p><p> 
When they had finished supper, the woman   <pb n="65"/>   cleared away the things and began 
questioning the stranger. 'Where are you from?' said she.</p><p> 
'I am not from these parts.'</p><p> 
'But how did you come to be on the road?'</p><p> 
'I may not tell.'</p><p> 
'Did some one rob you?'</p><p> 
'God punished me.'</p><p> 
'And you were lying there naked?'</p><p> 
'Yes, naked and freezing. Simon saw me and had pity on me. He took off his 
coat, put it on me and brought me here. And you have fed me, given me drink, 
and shown pity on me. God will reward you!'</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na rose, took from the window Simon's old shirt she had been 
patching, and gave it to the stranger. She also brought out a pair of trousers 
for him.</p><p> 
'There,' said she, 'I see you have no shirt. Put this on, and lie down where 
you please, in the loft or on the oven.'</p><p> 
The stranger took off the coat, put on the shirt, and lay down in the loft. 
Matry&oacute;na put out the candle, took the coat, and climbed to where her 
husband lay.</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na drew the skirts of the coat over her and lay down, but could 
not sleep; she could not get the stranger out of her mind.</p><p> 
When she remembered that he had eaten their last piece of bread and that there 
was none for to-morrow and thought of the shirt and trousers she had given 
away, she felt grieved; but when she remembered how he had smiled, her heart 
was glad.</p><p> 
Long did Matry&oacute;na lie awake, and she noticed   <pb n="66"/>  that Simon also was awake 
&mdash;  he drew the coat towards him.</p><p> 
'Simon!'</p><p> 
'Well?' </p><p> 
'You have had the last of the bread, and I have not put any to rise. I don't 
know what we shall do tomorrow. Perhaps I can borrow some of neighbour Martha.' 
</p><p> 
'If we're alive we shall find something to eat.' </p><p> 
The woman lay still awhile, and then said, 'He seems a good man, but why does 
he not tell us who he is?' </p><p> 
'I suppose he has his reasons.' </p><p> 
'Simon!' </p><p> 
'Well?' </p><p> 
'We give; but why does nobody give us anything?'</p><p> 
 Simon did not know what to say; so he only said, 'Let us stop talking,' and 
turned over and went to sleep.</p> 
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="5" id="d23"> 
<head> 
V</head><p> 
In the morning Simon awoke. The children were still asleep; his wife had gone 
to the neighbour's to borrow some bread. The stranger alone was sitting on the 
bench, dressed in the old shirt and trousers, and looking upwards. His face was 
brighter than it had been the day before.</p><p> 
Simon said to him, 'Well, friend; the belly wants bread and the naked body 
clothes. One has to work for a living. What work do you know?'</p><p> 
'I do not know any.'</p><p> 
This surprised Simon, but he said, 'Men who want to learn can learn 
anything.'</p><p> 
'Men work, and I will work also.'</p><p> 
'What is your name?'</p><p> 
'Michael.'</p>   <pb n="67"/>  <p> 
'Well Michael, if you don't wish to talk about yourself that is your own 
affair; but you'll have to earn a living for yourself. If you will work as I 
tell you, I will give you food and shelter.'</p><p> 
'May God reward you! I will learn. Show me what to do.'</p><p> 
Simon took yarn, put it round his thumb and began to twist it.</p><p> 
'It is easy enough &mdash; see!'</p><p> 
Michael watched him, put some yarn round his own thumb in the same way, caught 
the knack, and twisted the yarn also.</p><p> 
Then Simon showed him how to wax the thread. This also Michael mastered. Next 
Simon showed him how to twist the bristle in, and how to sew, and this, too, 
Michael learned at once.</p><p> 
Whatever Simon showed him he understood at once, and after three days he worked 
as if he had sewn boots all his life. He worked without stopping, and ate 
little. When work was over he sat silently, looking upwards. He hardly went 
into the street, spoke only when necessary, and neither joked nor laughed. They 
never saw him smile, except that first evening when Matry&oacute;na gave them 
supper.</p> 
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="6" id="d24"> 
<head> 
VI</head> 
<p>Day by day and week by week the year went round. Michael lived and worked with 
Simon. His fame spread till people said that no one sewed boots so neatly and 
strongly as Simon's workman, Michael; and from all the district round people 
came to Simon for their boots, and he began to be well off.</p><p> 
One winter day, as Simon and Michael sat working a carriage on sledge-runners, 
with three horses and with bells, drove up to the hut. They looked   <pb n="68"/>  out of the 
window; the carriage stopped at their door, a fine servant jumped down from the 
box and opened the door. A gentleman in a fur coat got out and walked up to 
Simon's hut. Up jumped Matry&oacute;na and opened the door wide. The gentleman 
stooped to enter the hut, and when he drew himself up again his head nearly 
reached the ceiling, and he seemed quite to fill his end of the room.</p><p> 
Simon rose, bowed, and looked at the gentleman with astonishment. He had never 
seen any one like him. Simon himself was lean, Michael was thin, and 
Matry&oacute;na was dry as a bone, but this man was like some one from another 
world: red-faced, burly, with a neck like a bull's, and looking altogether as 
if he were cast in iron.</p><p> 
The gentleman puffed, threw off his fur coat, sat down on the bench, and said, 
'Which of you is the master bootmaker?'</p><p> 
'I am, your Excellency,' said Simon, coming forward.</p><p> 
Then the gentleman shouted to his lad, 'Hey, F&eacute;dka, bring the 
leather!'</p><p> 
The servant ran in, bringing a parcel. The gentleman took the parcel and put it 
on the table.</p><p> 
'Untie it' said he. The lad untied it.</p><p> 
The gentleman pointed to the leather.</p><p> 
'Look here, shoemaker,' said he, 'do you see this leather?'</p><p> 
'Yes, your honour.'</p><p> 
'But do you know what sort of leather it is?'</p><p> 
Simon felt the leather and said, 'It is good leather.'</p><p> 
'Good, indeed! Why, you fool, you never saw such leather before in your life. 
It's German, and cost twenty r&uacute;bles.'</p><p> 
Simon was frightened, and said, 'Where should I ever see leather like that?'</p>   <pb n="69"/>  <p> 
'Just so! Now, can you make it into boots for me?'</p><p> 
'Yes, your Excellency, I can.'</p><p> 
Then the gentleman shouted at him: 'You can, can you? Well, remember whom you 
are to make them for, and what the leather is. You must make me boots that will 
wear for a year, neither losing shape nor coming unsewn. If you can do it, take 
the leather and cut it up; but if you can't, say so. I warn you now, if your 
boots come unsewn or lose shape within a year, I will have you put in prison. 
If they don't burst or lose shape for a year, I will pay you ten r&uacute;bles for 
your work.'</p><p> 
Simon was frightened, and did not know what to say. He glanced at Michael and 
nudging him with his elbow, whispered: 'Shall I take the work?'</p><p> 
Michael nodded his head as if to say, 'Yes, take it.'</p><p> 
Simon did as Michael advised, and undertook to make boots that would not lose 
shape or split for a whole year.</p><p> 
Calling his servant, the gentleman told him to pull the boot off his left leg, 
which he stretched out.</p><p> 
'Take my measure!' said he.</p><p> 
Simon stitched a paper measure seventeen inches long, smoothed it out, knelt 
down, wiped his hands well on his apron so as not to soil the gentleman's sock, 
and began to measure. He measured the sole, and round the instep, and began to 
measure the calf of the leg, but the paper was too short. The calf of the leg 
was as thick as a beam.</p><p> 
'Mind you don't make it too tight in the leg.'</p><p> 
Simon stitched on another strip of paper. The gentleman twitched his toes about 
in his sock, looking round at those in the hut, and as he did so he noticed 
Michael.</p><p> 
'Whom have you there?' asked he</p>   <pb n="70"/>  <p> 
'That is my workman. He will sew the boots.'</p><p> 
'Mind,' said the gentleman to Michael, 'remember to make them so that they will 
last me a year.'</p><p> 
Simon also looked at Michael, and saw that Michael was not looking at the 
gentleman, but was gazing into the corner behind the gentleman, as if he saw 
some one there. Michael looked and looked, and suddenly he smiled, and his face 
became brighter.</p><p> 
'What are you grinning at, you fool?' thundered the gentleman. 'You had better 
look to it that the boots are ready in time.'</p><p> 
'They shall be ready in good time,' said Michael.</p><p> 
'Mind it is so,' said the gentleman, and he put on his boots and his fur coat, 
wrapped the latter round him, and went to the door. But he forgot to stoop and 
struck his head against the lintel.</p><p> 
He swore and rubbed his head. Then he took his seat in the carriage and drove 
away.</p><p> 
When he had gone, Simon said: 'There's a figure of a man for you! You could not 
kill him with a mallet. He almost knocked out the lintel, but little harm it 
did him.'</p><p> 
And Matry&oacute;na said: 'Living as he does, how should he not grow strong? 
Death itself can't touch such a rock as that.'</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="7" id="d25"> 
<p> 
VII</p> 
<p>Then Simon said to Michael: 'Well, we have taken the work, but we must see we 
don't get into trouble over it. The leather is dear, and the gentleman 
hot-tempered. We must make no mistakes. Come, your eye is truer and your hands 
have become nimbler than mine, so you take this measure and cut out the boots. 
I will finish off the sewing of the vamps.'</p><p> 
Michael did as he was told. He took the leather,   <pb n="71"/>  spread it out on the table, 
folded it in two, took a knife and began to cut out.</p><p> 
Matry&oacute;na came and watched him cutting, and was surprised to see how he 
was doing it. Matry&oacute;na was accustomed to seeing boots made, and she 
looked and saw that Michael was not cutting the leather for boots, but was 
cutting it round.</p><p> 
She wished to say something, but she thought to herself: 'Perhaps I do not 
understand how gentlemen's boots should be made. I suppose Michael knows more 
about it &mdash; and I won't interfere.'</p><p> 
When Michael had cut up the leather, he took a thread and began to sew not with 
two ends, as boots are sewn, but with a single end, as for soft slippers.</p><p> 
Again Matry&oacute;na wondered, but again she did not interfere. Michael sewed 
on steadily till noon. Then Simon rose for dinner, looked around, and saw that 
Michael had made slippers out of the gentleman's leather.</p><p> 
'Ah!' groaned Simon, and he thought, 'How is it that Michael, who has been with 
me a whole year and never made a mistake before, should do such a dreadful 
thing? The gentleman ordered high boots, welted, with whole fronts, and Michael 
has made soft slippers with single soles, and has wasted the leather. What am I 
to say to the gentleman? I can never replace leather such as this.'</p><p> 
And he said to Michael, 'What are you doing friend? You have ruined me! You 
know the gentleman ordered high booth but see what you have made!'</p><p> 
Hardly had he begun to rebuke Michael, when 'rat-tat , went the iron ring that 
hung at the door. Some one was knocking. They looked out of the window; a man 
had come on horseback, and was fastening his horse. They opened the door, and 
   <pb n="72"/>  the servant who had been with the gentleman came in.</p><p> 
'Good day,' said he.</p><p> 
'Good day,' replied Simon. 'What can we do for you?'</p><p> 
'My mistress has sent me about the boots.'</p><p> 
'What about the boots?'</p><p> 
'Why, my master no longer needs them. He is dead.'</p><p> 
'Is it possible?'</p><p> 
'He did not live to get home after leaving you, but died in the carriage. When 
we reached home and the servants came to help him alight he rolled over like a 
sack. He was dead already, and so stiff that he could hardly be got out of the 
carriage. My mistress sent me here, saying: "Tell the bootmaker that the 
gentleman who ordered boots of him and left the leather for them no longer 
needs the boots, but that he must quickly make soft slippers for the corpse. 
Wait till they are ready, and bring them back with you." That is why I have 
come.'</p><p> 
Michael gathered up the remnants of the leather; rolled them up, took the soft 
slippers he had made, slapped them together, wiped them down with his apron, 
and handed them and the roll of leather to the servant, who took them and said: 
'Good-bye, masters and good day to you!'</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="8" id="d26"> 
<head> 
VIII</head> 
<p>Another year passed, and another, and Michael was now living his sixth year 
with Simon. He lived as before. He went nowhere, only spoke when necessary, and 
had only smiled twice in all those years &mdash; once when Matry&oacute;na gave him 
food, and a second time when the gentleman was in their hut. Simon was more 
than pleased with his workman.   <pb n="73"/>  He never now asked him where he came from, and 
only feared lest Michael should go away.</p><p> 
They were all at home one day. Matry&oacute;na was putting iron pots in the 
oven, the children were running along the benches and looking out of the 
window; Simon was sewing at one window, and Michael was fastening on a heel at 
the other.</p><p> 
One of the boys ran along the bench to Michael, leant on his shoulder, and 
looked out of the window.</p><p> 
'Look, Uncle Michael! There is a lady with little girls! She seems to be coming 
here. And one of the girls is lame.'</p><p> 
When the boy said that, Michael dropped his work, turned to the window, and 
looked out into the street.</p><p> 
Simon was surprised. Michael never used to look out into the street, but now he 
pressed against the window, staring at something. Simon also looked out, and 
saw that a well-dressed woman was really coming to his hut, leading by the hand 
two little girls in fur coats and woollen shawls. The girls could hardly be 
told one from the other, except that one of them was crippled in her left leg 
and walked with a limp.</p><p> 
The woman stepped into the porch and entered the passage. Feeling about for the 
entrance she found the latch, which she lifted, and opened the door. She let 
the two girls go in first, and followed them into the hut.</p><p> 
'Good day, good folk!'</p><p> 
'Pray come in,' said Simon. 'What can we do for you?'</p><p> 
The woman sat down by the table. The two little girls pressed close to her 
knees, afraid of the people in the hut.</p><p> 
'I want leather shoes made for these two little girls, for spring.'</p>   <pb n="74"/>   
<p>'We can do that. We never have made such small shoes, but we can make them; 
either welted or turnover shoes, linen lined. My man, Michael, is a master at 
the work.'</p><p> 
Simon glanced at Michael and saw that he had left his work and was sitting with 
his eyes fixed on the little girls. Simon was surprised. It was true the girls 
were pretty, with black eyes, plump, and rosy-cheeked, and they wore nice 
kerchiefs and fur coats, but still Simon could not understand why Michael 
should look at them like that &mdash; just as if he had known them before. He was 
puzzled, but went on talking with the woman, and arranging the price. Having 
fixed it, he prepared the measure. The woman lifted the lame girl on to her lap 
and said: 'Take two measures from this little girl. Make one shoe for the lame 
foot and three for the sound one. They both have the same sized feet. They are 
twins.'</p><p> 
Simon took the measure and, speaking of the lame girl, said: 'How did it happen 
to her? She is such a pretty girl. Was she born so?'</p><p> 
'No, her mother crushed her leg.'</p><p> 
Then Matry&oacute;na joined in. She wondered who this woman was, and whose the 
children were, so she said: 'Are not you their mother, then?'</p><p> 
'No, my good woman, I am neither their mother nor any relation to them. They 
were quite strangers to me, but I adopted them.'</p><p> 
'They are not your children and yet you are so fond of them?'</p><p> 
'How can I help being fond of them? I fed them both at my own breasts. I had a 
child of my own, but God took him. I was not so fond of him as I now am of 
them.'</p><p> 
'Then whose children are they?'</p> 
  <pb n="75"/>   
</div3><div3 type="section" n="9" id="d27"> 
<head> 
IX</head><p> 
The woman, having begun talking, told them the whole story.</p><p> 
'It is about six years since their parents died, both in one week: their father 
was buried on the Tuesday, and their mother died on the Friday. These orphans 
were born three days after their father's death, and their mother did not live 
another day. My husband and I were then living as peasants in the village. We 
were neighbours of theirs, our yard being next to theirs. Their father was a 
lonely man; a wood-cutter in the forest. When felling trees one day, they let 
one fall on him. It fell across his body and crushed his bowels out. They 
hardly got him home before his soul went to God; and that same week his wife 
gave birth to twins &mdash; these little girls. She was poor and alone; she had no 
one, young or old, with her. Alone she gave them birth, and alone she met her 
death.</p><p> 
'The next morning I went to see her, but when I entered the hut, she, poor 
thing, was already stark and cold. In dying she had rolled on to this child and 
crushed her leg. The village folk came to the hut washed the body, laid her 
out, made a coffin, and buried her. They were good folk. The babies were left 
alone. What was to be done with them? I was the only woman there who had a baby 
at the time. I was nursing my first-born &mdash; eight weeks old. So I took them for 
a time. The peasants came together, and thought and thought what to do with 
them, and at last they said to me: "For the present, Mary, you had better keep 
the girls, and later on we will arrange what to do for them." So I nursed the 
sound one at my breast, but at first I did not feed this crippled one. I did 
not suppose she would live. But then I thought to myself, why   <pb n="76"/>  should the poor 
innocent suffer? I pitied her, and began to feed her. And so I fed my own boy 
and these two &mdash; the three of them &mdash; at my own breast. I was young and strong, 
and had good food, and God gave me so much milk that at times it even 
overflowed. I used sometimes to feed two at a time, while the third was 
waiting. When one had had enough I nursed the third. And God so ordered it that 
these grew up, while my own was buried before he was two years old. And I had 
no more children, though we prospered. Now my husband is working for the corn 
merchant at the mill. The pay is good and we are well off. But I have no 
children of my own, and how lonely I should be without these little girls! How 
can I help loving them! They are the joy of my life!'</p><p> 
She pressed the lame little girl to her with one hand while with the other she 
wiped the tears from her cheeks.</p><p> 
And Matry&oacute;na sighed, and said: 'The proverb is true that says, "One may 
live without father or mother, but one cannot live without God."'</p><p> 
So they talked together, when suddenly the whole hut was lighted up as though 
by summer lightning from the corner where Michael sat. They all looked towards 
him and saw him sitting, his hands folded on his knees, gazing upwards and 
smiling.</p> 
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="10" id="d28">

<p> 
The woman went away with the girls. Michael rose from the bench, put down his 
work, and took off his apron. Then, bowing low to Simon and his wife, he said: 
'Farewell, masters. God has forgiven me. I ask your forgiveness, too, for 
anything done amiss.'</p><p> 
And they saw that a light shone from Michael.    <pb n="77"/>  And Simon rose, bowed down to 
Michael, and said: 'I see, Michael, that you are no common man, and I can 
neither keep you nor question you. Only tell me this: how is it that when I 
found you and brought you home, you were gloomy, and when my wife gave you food 
you smiled at her and became brighter? Then when the gentleman came to order 
the boots, you smiled again and became brighter still? And now, when this woman 
brought the little girls, you smiled a third time, and have become as bright as 
day? Tell me, Michael, why does your face shine so, and why did you smile those 
three times?'</p><p> 
And Michael answered: 'Light shines from me because I have been punished, but 
now God has pardoned me. And I smiled three times, because God sent me to learn 
three truths, and I have learnt them. One I learnt when your wife pitied me and 
that is why I smiled the first time. The second I learnt when the rich man 
ordered the boots and then I smiled again. And now, when I saw those little 
girls, I learnt the third and last truth, and I smiled the third time.'</p><p> 
And Simon said, 'Tell me, Michael, what did God punish you for? and what were 
the three truths? that I, too, may know them.'</p><p> 
And Michael answered: 'God punished me for disobeying Him. I was an angel in 
heaven and disobeyed God. God sent me to fetch a woman's soul. I flew to earth, 
and saw a sick woman lying alone, who had just given birth to twin girls. They 
moved feebly at their mother's side, but she could not lift them to her breast. 
When she saw me, she understood that God had sent me for her soul, and she wept 
and said: "Angel of God! My husband has just been buried, killed by a falling 
tree. I have neither sister, nor aunt, nor mother: no one to care    <pb n="78"/>  for my 
orphans. Do not take my soul! Let me nurse my babes, feed them, and set them on 
their feet before I die. Children cannot live without father or mother." And I 
hearkened to her. I placed one child at her breast and gave the other into her 
arms, and returned to the Lord in heaven. I flew to the Lord, and said: "I 
could not take the soul of the mother. Her husband was killed by a tree; the 
woman has twins, and prays that her soul may not be taken. She says: 'Let me 
nurse and feed my children, and set them on their feet. Children cannot live 
without father or mother.' I have not taken her soul." And God said: "Go &mdash; 
take the mother's soul, and learn three truths: Learn <hi rend="italic">What dwells in 
man</hi>, <hi rend="italic">What is not given to man</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">What men live by</hi>. When 
thou hast learnt these things, thou shalt return to heaven." So I flew again to 
earth and took the mother's soul. The babes dropped from her breasts. Her body 
rolled over on the bed and crushed one babe, twisting its leg. I rose above the 
village, wishing to take her soul to God; but a wind seized me, and my wings 
drooped and dropped off. Her soul rose alone to God, while I fell to earth by 
the roadside.'</p>

XI</head> 
<p> 
And Simon and Matry&oacute;na understood who it was that had lived with them, 
and whom they had clothed and fed. And they wept with awe and with joy. And the 
angel said: 'I was alone in the field, naked. I had never known human needs, 
cold and hunger, till I became a man. I was famished, frozen, and did not know 
what to do. I saw, near the field I was in, a shrine built for God, and I went 
to it hoping to find shelter. But the shrine was locked, and I could not enter. 
So I sat down behind    <pb n="79"/>  the shrine to shelter myself at least from the wind. 
Evening drew on. I was hungry, frozen, and in pain. Suddenly I heard a man 
coming along the road. He carried a pair of boots, and was talking to himself. 
For the first time since I became a man I saw the mortal face of a man, and his 
face seemed terrible to me and I turned from it. And I heard the man talking to 
himself of how to cover his body from the cold in winter, and how to feed wife 
and children. And I thought: "I am perishing of cold and hunger, and here is a 
man thinking only of how to clothe himself and his wife, and how to get bread 
for themselves. He cannot help me. When the man saw me he frowned and became 
still more terrible, and passed me by on the other side. I despaired, but 
suddenly I heard him coming back. I looked up, and did not recognize the same 
man: before, I had seen death in his face; but now he was alive, and I 
recognized in him the presence of God. He came up to me, clothed me, took me 
with him and brought me to his home. I entered the house a woman came to meet 
us and began to speak. The woman was still more terrible than the man had been; 
the spirit of death came from her mouth; I could not breathe for the stench of 
death that spread around her. She wished to drive me out into the cold, and I 
knew that if she did so she would die. Suddenly her husband spoke to her of 
God, and the woman changed at once. And when she brought me food and looked at 
me, I glanced at her and saw that death no longer dwelt in her; she had become 
alive, and in her too I saw God.</p><p> 
'Then I remembered the first lesson God had set me: <hi rend="italic">"Learn what dwells in 
man</hi>." And I understood that in man dwells Love! I was glad that God had 
already begun to show me what He had promised, and I smiled for the first time. 
But I had   <pb n="80"/>  not yet learnt all. I did not yet know <hi rend="italic">What is not given to 
man</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">What men live by</hi>.</p><p> 
'I lived with you, and a year passed. A man came to order boots that should 
wear for a year without losing shape or cracking. I looked at him, and 
suddenly, behind his shoulder, I saw my comrade &mdash; the angel of death. None but 
me saw that angel; but I knew him, and knew that before the sun set he would 
take that rich man's soul. And I thought to myself, "The man is making 
preparations for a year, and does not know that he will die before evening." 
And I remembered God's second saying, <hi rend="italic">"Learn what is not given to 
man</hi>."</p><p> 
'What dwells in man I already knew. Now I learnt what is not given him. It is 
not given to man to know his own needs. And I smiled for the second time. I was 
glad to have seen my comrade angel &mdash;  glad also that God had revealed to me 
the second saying.</p><p> 
'But I still did not know all. I did not know <hi rend="italic">What men live by</hi>. And I 
lived on, waiting till God should reveal to me the last lesson. In the sixth 
year came the girl-twins with the woman; and I recognized the girls, and heard 
how they had been kept alive. Having heard the story, I thought, "Their mother 
besought me for the children's sake, and I believed her when she said that 
children cannot live without father or mother; but a stranger has nursed them, 
and has brought them up." And when the woman showed her love for the children 
that were not her own, and wept over them, I saw in her the living God, and 
understood <hi rend="italic">What men live by</hi>. And I knew that God had revealed to me the 
last lesson, and had forgiven my sin. And then I smiled for the third time.'</p>   
<pb n="81"/>

<p> 
And the angel's body was bared, and he was clothed in light so that eye could 
not look on him; and his voice grew louder, as though it came not from him but 
from heaven above. And the angel said:</p><p> 
'I have learnt that all men live not by care for themselves, but by love.</p><p> 
'It was not given to the mother to know what her children needed for their 
life. Nor was it given to the rich man to know what he himself needed. Nor is 
it given to any man to know whether, when evening comes, he will need boots for 
his body or slippers for his corpse.</p><p> 
'I remained alive when I was a man, not by care of myself, but because love was 
present in a passer-by, and because he and his wife pitied and loved me. The 
orphans remained alive, not because of their mother's care, but because there 
was love in the heart of a woman a stranger to them, who pitied and loved them. 
And all men live not by the thought they spend on their own welfare, but 
because love exists in man.</p><p> 
'I knew before that God gave life to men and desires that they should live; now 
I understood more than that.</p><p> 
'I understood that God does not wish men to live apart, and therefore he does 
not reveal to them what each one needs for himself; but he wishes them to live 
united, and therefore reveals to each of them what is necessary for all.</p><p> 
'I have now understood that though it seems to men that they live by care for 
themselves, in truth it is love alone by which they live. He who has love, is 
in God, and God is in him, for God is love.'</p><p> 
And the angel sang praise to God, so that the    <pb n="82"/>  hut trembled at his voice. The 
roof opened, and a column of fire rose from earth to heaven. Simon and his wife 
and children fell to the ground. Wings appeared upon the angel's shoulders, and 
he rose into the heavens.</p><p> 
And when Simon came to himself the hut stood as before, and there was no one in 
it but his own family.</p><p>

'Then came Peter, and said to him, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against 
me, and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto 
thee, Until seven times; but, Until seventy times seven. Therefore is the 
kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would make a reckoning 
with his servants. And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, 
which owed him ten thousand talents. But forasmuch as he had not wherewith to 
pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all 
that he had, and payment to be made. The servant therefore fell down and 
worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all. 
And the lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and 
forgave him the debt. But that servant went out, and found one of his 
fellow-servants, which owed him a hundred pence: and he laid hold on him, and 
took him by the throat saying, Pay what thou owest. So his fellow-servant fell 
down and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee. And 
he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay that which 
was due. So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were exceeding 
sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done. Then his lord 
called him unto him, and saith to him, Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all 
that debt, because thou besoughtest me: shouldest not thou also have had mercy 
on thy fellow-servant, even as I had mercy on thee? And his lord was wroth, and 
delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due. So shall 
also my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye forgive not every one his brother 
from your hearts.' &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Matt</hi>. xviii. 21-35.</q></p><p> 
THERE once lived in a village a peasant named Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f. 
He was comfortably off, in the   <pb n="84"/>  prime of life, the best worker in the village, 
and had three sons all able to work. The eldest was married, the second about 
to marry, and the third was a big lad who could mind the horses and was already 
beginning to plough. Ivan's wife was an able and thrifty woman, and they were 
fortunate in having a quiet, hard-working daughter-in-law. There was nothing to 
prevent Iv&aacute;n and his family from living happily. They had only one idle 
mouth to feed; that was Iv&aacute;n's old father, who suffered from asthma and 
had been lying ill on the top of the brick oven for seven years. Iv&aacute;n 
had all he needed: three horses and a colt, a cow with a calf, and fifteen 
sheep. The women made all the clothing for the family, besides helping in the 
fields, and the men tilled the land. They always had grain enough of their own 
to last over beyond the next harvest and sold enough oats to pay the taxes and 
meet their other needs. So Iv&aacute;n and his children might have lived quite 
comfortably had it not been for a feud between him and his next-door neighbour, 
Limping Gabriel, the son of Gord&eacute;y Iv&aacute;nof.</p><p> 
As long as old Gord&eacute;y was alive and Iv&aacute;n's father was still able 
to manage the household, the peasants lived as neighbours should. If the women 
of either house happened to want a sieve or a tub, or the men required a sack, 
or if a cart-wheel got broken and could not be mended at once, they used to 
send to the other house, and helped each other in neighbourly fashion. When a 
calf strayed into the neighbour's thrashing-ground they would just drive it 
out, and only say, 'Don't let it get in again; our grain is lying there.' And 
such things as locking up the barns and outhouses, hiding things from one 
another, or backbiting were never thought of in those days.</p><p> 
That was in the fathers' time. When the sons   <pb n="85"/>  came to be at the head of the 
families, everything changed.</p><p> 
It all began about a trifle.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n's daughter-in-law had a hen that began laying rather early in the 
season, and she started collecting its eggs for Easter. Every day she went to 
the cart-shed, and found an egg in the cart; but one day the hen, probably 
frightened by the children, flew across the fence into the neighbour's yard and 
laid its egg there. The woman heard the cackling, but said to herself: 'I have 
no time now; I must tidy up for Sunday. I'll fetch the egg later on.' In the 
evening she went to the cart, but found no egg there. She went and asked her 
mother-in-law and brother-in-law whether they had taken the egg. 'No,' they had 
not; but her youngest brother-in-law, Tar&aacute;s, said: 'Your Biddy laid its 
egg in the neighbour's yard. It was there she was cackling, and she flew back 
across the fence from there.'</p><p> 
The woman went and looked at the hen. There she was on the perch with the other 
birds, her eyes just closing ready to go to sleep. The woman wished she could 
have asked the hen and got an answer from her.</p><p> 
Then she went to the neighbour's, and Gabriel's mother came out to meet her.</p><p> 
'What do you want, young woman?'</p><p> 
'Why, Granny, you see, my hen flew across this morning. Did she not lay an egg 
here?'</p><p> 
'We never saw anything of it. The Lord be thanked, our own hens started laying 
long ago. We collect our own eggs and have no need of other people's! And we 
don't go looking for eggs in other people's yards, lass!'</p><p> 
The young woman was offended, and said more than she should have done. Her 
neighbour answered   <pb n="86"/>   back with interest, and the women began abusing each other. 
Ivan's wife, who had been to fetch water, happening to pass just then, joined 
in too. Gabriel's wife rushed out, and began reproaching the young woman with 
things that had really happened and with other things that never had happened 
at all. Then a general uproar commenced, all shouting at once, trying to get 
out two words at a time, and not choice words either.</p><p> 
'You're this!' and 'You're that!' 'You're a thief!' and 'You're a slut!' and 
'You're starving your old father-in-law to death!' and 'You're a 
good-for-nothing!' and so on.</p><p> 
'And you've made a hole in the sieve I lent you, you jade! And it's our yoke 
you're carrying your pails on &mdash; you just give back our yoke!'</p><p> 
Then they caught hold of the yoke, and spilt the water, snatched off one 
another's shawls, and began fighting. Gabriel, returning from the fields, 
stopped to take his wife's part. Out rushed Iv&aacute;n and his son and joined 
in with the rest. Iv&aacute;n was a strong fellow, he scattered the whole lot 
of them, and pulled a handful of hair out of Gabriel's beard. People came to 
see what was the matter, and the fighters were separated with difficulty.</p><p> 
That was how it all began.</p><p> 
Gabriel wrapped the hair torn from his beard in a paper, and went to the 
District Court to have the law of Iv&aacute;n. 'I didn't grow my beard,' said 
he, 'for pockmarked Iv&aacute;n to pull it out!' And his wife went bragging to 
the neighbours, saying they'd have Iv&aacute;n condemned and sent to Siberia. 
And so the feud grew.</p><p> 
The old man, from where he lay on the top of the oven, tried from the very 
first to persuade them to make peace, but they would not listen. He told them, 
'It's a stupid thing you are after, children,   <pb n="87"/>  picking quarrels about such a 
paltry matter. Just think! The whole thing began about an egg. The children may 
have taken it &mdash; well, what matter? What's the value of one egg? God sends 
enough for all! And suppose your neighbour did say an unkind word &mdash; put it 
right; show her how to say a better one! If there <hi rend="italic">has</hi> been a fight &mdash; 
well, such things will happen; we're all sinners, but make it up, and let there 
be an end of  it! If you nurse your anger it will be worse for you 
yourselves.'</p><p> 
But the younger folk would not listen to the old man. They thought his words 
were mere senseless dotage. Iv&aacute;n would not humble himself before his 
neighbour.</p><p> 
'I never pulled his beard,' he said, 'he pulled the hair out himself. But his 
son has burst all the fastenings on my shirt, and torn it. . . . Look at it!'</p><p> 
And Iv&aacute;n also went to law. They were tried by the Justice of the Peace 
and by the District Court. While all this was going on, the coupling-pin of 
Gabriel's cart disappeared. Gabriel's womenfolk accused Ivan's son of having 
taken it. They said: 'We saw him in the night go past our window, towards the 
cart; and a neighbour says he saw him at the pub, offering the pin to the 
landlord.'</p><p> 
So they went to law about that. And at home not a day passed without a quarrel 
or even a fight. The children, too, abused one another, having learnt to do so 
from their elders; and when the women happened to meet by the river-side, where 
they went to rinse the clothes, their arms did not do as much wringing as their 
tongues did nagging, and every word was a bad one.</p><p> 
At first the peasants only slandered one another; but afterwards they began in 
real earnest to snatch anything that lay handy, and the children followed their 
example. Life became harder and harder for   <pb n="88"/>  them. Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f 
and Limping Gabriel kept suing one another at the Village Assembly, and at the 
District Court, and before the Justice of the Peace until all the judges were 
tired of them. Now Gabriel got Iv&aacute;n fined or imprisoned; then 
Iv&aacute;n did as much to Gabriel; and the more they spited each other the 
angrier they grew &mdash; like dogs that attack one another and get more and more 
furious the longer they fight. You strike one dog from behind, and it thinks 
it's the other dog biting him, and gets still fiercer. So these peasants: they 
went to law, and one or other of them was fined or locked up, but that only 
made them more and more angry with each other. 'Wait a bit,' they said, 'and 
I'll make you pay for it.' And so it went on for six years. Only the old man 
lying on the top of the oven kept telling them again and again: 'Children, what 
are you doing? Stop all this paying back; keep to your work, and don't bear 
malice &mdash; it will be better for you. The more you bear malice, the worse it 
will be.'</p><p> 
But they would not listen to him.</p><p> 
In the seventh year, at a wedding, Ivan's daughter-in-law held Gabriel up to 
shame, accusing him of having been caught horse-stealing. Gabriel was tipsy, 
and unable to contain his anger, gave the woman such a blow that she was laid 
up for a week; and she was pregnant at the time. Iv&aacute;n was delighted. He 
went to the magistrate to lodge a complaint. 'Now I'll get rid of my neighbour! 
He won't escape imprisonment, or exile to Siberia.' But Ivan's wish was not 
fulfilled. The magistrate dismissed the case. The woman was examined, but she 
was up and about and showed no sign of any injury. Then Ivan went to the 
Justice of the Peace, but he referred the business to the District Court. Ivan 
bestirred himself: treated   <pb n="89"/>  the clerk and the Elder of the District Court to a 
gallon of liquor and got Gabriel condemned to be flogged. The sentence was read 
out to Gabriel by the clerk: 'The Court decrees that the peasant Gabriel 
Gord&eacute;yef shall receive twenty lashes with a birch rod at the District 
Court.'</p><p> 
Ivan too heard the sentence read, and looked at Gabriel to see how he would 
take it. Gabriel grew as pale as a sheet, and turned round and went out into 
the passage. Ivan followed him, meaning to see to the horse, and he overheard 
Gabriel say, 'Very well! He will have my back flogged: that will make it burn; 
but something of his may burn worse than that!'</p><p> 
Hearing these words, Ivan at once went back into the Court, and said: 'Upright 
judges! He threatens to set my house on fire! Listen: he said it in the 
presence of witnesses!'</p><p> 
Gabriel was recalled. 'Is it true that you said this?'</p><p> 
'I haven't said anything. Flog me, since you have the power. It seems that I 
alone am to suffer, and all for being in the right, while he is allowed to do 
as he likes.'</p><p> 
Gabriel wished to say something more, but his lips and his cheeks quivered, and 
he turned towards the wall. Even the officials were frightened by his looks. 
'He may do some mischief to himself or to his neighbour,' thought they.</p><p> 
Then the old Judge said: 'Look here, my men; you'd better be reasonable and 
make it up. Was it right of you, friend Gabriel, to strike a pregnant woman? It 
was lucky it passed off so well, but think what might have happened! Was it 
right? You had better confess and beg his pardon, and he will forgive you, and 
we will alter the sentence.'</p><p> 
The clerk heard these words, and remarked:   <pb n="90"/>  'That's impossible under Statute 
117. An agreement between the parties not having been arrived at, a decision of 
the Court has been pronounced and must be executed.'</p><p> 
But the Judge would not listen to the clerk.</p><p> 
'Keep your tongue still, my friend,' said he. 'The first of all laws is to obey 
God, Who loves peace.' And the Judge began again to persuade the peasants, but 
could not succeed. Gabriel would not listen to him.</p><p> 
'I shall be fifty next year,' said he, 'and have a married son, and have never 
been flogged in my life, and now that pockmarked Ivan has had me condemned to 
be flogged, and am I to go and ask his forgiveness? No; I've borne enough. . . 
. Ivan shall have cause to remember me!'</p><p> 
Again Gabriel's voice quivered, and he could say no more, but turned round and 
went out.</p><p> 
It was seven miles from the Court to the village, and it was getting late when 
Ivan reached home. He unharnessed his horse, put it up for the night, and 
entered the cottage. No one was there. The women had already gone to drive the 
cattle in, and the young fellows were not yet back from the fields. Iv&aacute;n 
went in, and sat down, thinking. He remembered how Gabriel had listened to the 
sentence, and how pale he had become, and how he had turned to the wall; and 
Ivan's heart grew heavy. He thought how he himself would feel if he were 
sentenced, and he pitied Gabriel. Then he heard his old father up on the oven 
cough, and saw him sit up, lower his legs, and scramble down. The old man 
dragged himself slowly to a seat, and sat down. He was quite tired out with the 
exertion, and coughed a long time till he had cleared his throat. Then, leaning 
against the table, he said: 'Well, has he been condemned?'</p>   <pb n="91"/>  <p> 
'Yes, to twenty strokes with the rods,' answered Iv&aacute;n.</p><p> 
The old man shook his head.</p><p> 
'A bad business,' said he. 'You are doing wrong, Iv&aacute;n! Ah! it's very bad 
&mdash; not for him so much as for yourself! . . . Well, they'll flog him: but will 
that do you any good?'</p><p> 
'He'll not do it again,' said Iv&aacute;n.</p><p> 
'What is it he'll not do again? What has he done worse than you?'</p><p> 
'Why, think of the harm he has done me!' said Iv&aacute;n. 'He nearly killed my 
wife, and now he's threatening to burn us up. Am I to thank him for it?'</p><p> 
The old man sighed, and said: 'You go about the wide world, Iv&aacute;n, while 
I am lying on the oven all these years, so you think you see everything, and 
that I see nothing. . . . Ah, lad! It's you that don't see; malice blinds you. 
Others' sins are before your eyes, but your own are behind your back. "He's 
acted badly!" What a thing to say! If he were the only one to act badly, how 
could strife exist? Is strife among men ever bred by one alone? Strife is 
always between two. His badness you see, but your own you don't. If he were 
bad, but you were good, there would be no strife. Who pulled the hair out of 
his beard? Who spoilt his haystack? Who dragged him to the law court? Yet you 
put it all on him! You live a bad life yourself, that's what is wrong! It's not 
the way I used to live, lad, and it's not the way I taught you. Is that the way 
his old father and I used to live? How did we live? Why, as neighbours should! 
If he happened to run out of flour, one of the women would come across: "Uncle 
Trol, we want some flour." "Go to the barn, dear," I'd say: "take what you 
need." If he'd no one to take his horses to pasture, "Go, Iv&aacute;n," I'd 
say, "and look after his horses." And   <pb n="92"/>  if I was short of anything, I'd go to 
him. "Uncle Gord&eacute;y," I'd say, "I want so-and-so!" "Take it Uncle Trol!" 
That's how it was between us, and we had an easy time of it. But now? . . . 
That soldier the other day was telling us about the fight at Plevna. Why, there's war between you worse than at 
Plevna! Is that living? . . . What a sin it is! You are a man and master of the 
house; it's you who will have to answer. What are you teaching the women and 
the children? To snarl and snap? Why, the other day your Tar&aacute;ska &mdash; that 
greenhorn &mdash; was swearing at neighbour Irena, calling her names; and his mother 
listened and laughed. Is that right? It is you will have to answer. Think of 
your soul. Is this all as it should be? You throw a word at me, and I give you 
two in return; you give me a blow, and I give you two. No, lad! Christ, when He 
walked on earth, taught us fools something very different. . . . If you get a 
hard word from any one, keep silent, and his own conscience will accuse him. 
That is what our Lord taught. If you get a slap, turn the other cheek. "Here, 
beat me, if that's what I deserve!" And his own conscience will rebuke him. He 
will soften, and will listen to you. That's the way He taught us, not to be 
proud! . . . Why don't you speak? Isn't it as I say?'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n sat silent and listened.</p><p> 
The old man coughed, and having with difficulty cleared his throat, began 
again: 'You think Christ taught us wrong? Why, it's all for our own good. Just 
think of your earthly life; are you better off, or worse, since this Plevna 
began among you? Just reckon up what you've spent on all this law   <pb n="93"/>  business  &mdash; 
what the driving backwards and forwards and your food on the way have cost you! 
What fine fellows your sons have grown; you might live and get on well; but now 
your means are lessening. And why? All because of this folly; because of your 
pride. You ought to be ploughing with your lads, and do the sowing yourself; 
but the fiend carries you off to the judge, or to some pettifogger or other. 
The ploughing is not done in time, nor the sowing, and mother earth can't bear 
properly. Why did the oats fail this year? When did you sow them? When you came 
back from town! And what did you gain? A burden for your own shoulders. . . . 
Eh, lad, think of your own business! Work with your boys in the field and at 
home, and if some one offends you, forgive him, as God wished you to. Then life 
will be easy, and your heart will always be light.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n remained silent.</p><p> 
'Iv&aacute;n, my boy, hear your old father! Go and harness the roan, and go at 
once to the Government office; put an end to all this affair there; and in the 
morning go and make it up with Gabriel in God's name, and invite him to your 
house for to-morrow's holiday' (it was the eve of the Virgin's Nativity). 'Have 
tea ready, and get a bottle of v&oacute;dka and put an end to this wicked 
business, so that there should not be any more of it in future, and tell the 
women and children to do the same.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n sighed, and thought, 'What he says is true,' and his heart grew 
lighter. Only he did not know how, now, to begin to put matters right.</p><p> 
But again the old man began, as if he had guessed what was in Ivan's mind.</p><p> 
'Go, Iv&aacute;n, don't put it off! Put out the fire before it spreads, or it 
will be too late.'</p>   <pb n="94"/>  <p> 
The old man was going to say more, but before he could do so the women came in, 
chattering like magpies. The news that Gabriel was sentenced to be flogged, and 
of his threat to set fire to the house, had already reached them. They had 
heard all about it and added to it something of their own, and had again had a 
row, in the pasture, with the women of Gabriel's household. They began telling 
how Gabriel's daughter-in-law threatened a fresh action: Gabriel had got the 
right side of the examining magistrate, who would now turn the whole affair 
upside down; and the schoolmaster was writing out another petition, to the Tsar 
himself this time, about Iv&aacute;n; and everything was in the petition &mdash; all 
about the coupling-pin and the kitchen-garden &mdash; so that half of Ivan's 
homestead would be theirs soon. Iv&aacute;n heard what they were saying, and 
his heart grew cold again, and he gave up the thought of making peace with 
Gabriel.</p><p> 
In a farmstead there is always plenty for the master to do. Iv&aacute;n did not 
stop to talk to the women, but went out to the threshing-floor and to the barn. 
By the time he had tidied up there, the sun had set and the young fellows had 
returned from the field. They had been ploughing the field for the winter crops 
with two horses. Iv&aacute;n met them, questioned them about their work, helped 
to put everything in its place, set a torn horse-collar aside to be mended, and 
was going to put away some stakes under the barn, but it had grown quite dusk, 
so he decided to leave them where they were till next day. Then he gave the 
cattle their food, opened the gate, let out the horses. Tar&aacute;s was to 
take to pasture for the night, and again closed the gate and barred it. 'Now,' 
thought he, 'I'll have my supper, and then to bed.' He took the horse-collar 
and entered the hut. By this time he   <pb n="95"/>  had forgotten about Gabriel and about what 
his old father had been saying to him. But, just as he took hold of the 
door-handle to enter the passage, he heard his neighbour on the other side of 
the fence cursing somebody in a hoarse voice: 'What the devil is he good for?' 
Gabriel was saying. 'He's only fit to be killed!' At these words all Ivan's 
former bitterness towards his neighbour re-awoke. He stood listening while 
Gabriel scolded, and, when he stopped, Iv&aacute;n went into the hut.</p><p> 
There was a light inside; his daughter-in-law sat spinning, his wife was 
getting supper ready, his eldest son was making straps for bark shoes, his 
second sat near the table with a book, and Tar&aacute;s was getting ready to go 
out to pasture the horses for the night. Everything in the hut would have been 
pleasant and bright, but for that plague &mdash; a bad neighbour!</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n entered, sullen and cross; threw the cat down from the bench, and 
scolded the women for putting the slop-pail in the wrong place. He felt 
despondent, and sat down, frowning, to mend the horse-collar. Gabriel's words 
kept ringing in his ears: his threat at the law court, and what he had just 
been shouting in a hoarse voice about some one who was 'only fit to be 
killed.'</p><p> 
His wife gave Tar&aacute;s his supper, and, having eaten it, Tar&aacute;s put 
on an old sheepskin and another coat, tied a sash round his waist, took some 
bread with him, and went out to the horses. His eldest brother was going to see 
him off, but Iv&aacute;n himself rose instead, and went out into the porch. It 
had grown quite dark outside, clouds had gathered, and the wind had risen. 
Iv&aacute;n went down the steps, helped his boy to mount, started the foal 
after him, and stood listening while Tar&aacute;s rode down the village and was 
there joined by other lads with    <pb n="96"/>  their horses. Iv&aacute;n waited until they 
were all out of hearing. As he stood there by the gate he could not get 
Gabriel's words out of his head: 'Mind that something of yours does not burn 
worse!'</p><p> 
'He is desperate,' thought Iv&aacute;n. 'Everything is dry, and it's windy 
weather besides. He'll come up at the back somewhere, set fire to something, 
and be off. He'll burn the place and escape scot free, the villain! . . . There 
now, if one could but catch him in the act, he'd not get off then!' And the 
thought fixed itself so firmly in his mind that he did not go up the steps but 
went out into the street and round the corner. I'll just walk round the 
buildings; who can tell what he's after?' And Iv&aacute;n, stepping softly, 
passed out of the gate. As soon as he reached the corner, he looked round along 
the fence, and seemed to see something suddenly move at the opposite corner, as 
if some one had come out and disappeared again. Iv&aacute;n stopped, and stood 
quietly, listening and looking. Everything was still; only the leaves of the 
willows fluttered in the wind, and the straws of the thatch rustled. At first 
it seemed pitch dark, but, when his eyes had grown used to the darkness, he 
could see the far corner, and a plough that lay there, and the eaves. He looked 
a while, but saw no one.</p><p> 
'I suppose it was a mistake,' thought Iv&aacute;n; 'but still I will go round,' 
and Iv&aacute;n went stealthily along by the shed. Iv&aacute;n stepped so 
softly in his bark shoes that he did not hear his own footsteps. As he reached 
the far corner, something seemed to flare up for a moment near the plough and 
to vanish again. Iv&aacute;n felt as if struck to the heart; and he stopped. 
Hardly had he stopped, when something flared up more brightly in the same 
place, and he clearly saw a man with a cap on his head, crouching down, with 
his back towards him,    <pb n="97"/>  lighting a bunch of straw he held in his hand. 
Iv&aacute;n's heart fluttered within him like a bird. Straining every nerve, he 
approached with great strides, hardly feeling his legs under him. 'Ah,' thought 
Iv&aacute;n, 'now he won't escape! I'll catch him in the act!'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n was still some distance off, when suddenly he saw a bright light, 
but not in the same place as before, and not a small flame. The thatch had 
flared up at the eaves, the flames were reaching up to the roof, and, standing 
beneath it, Gabriel's whole figure was clearly visible.</p><p> 
Like a hawk swooping down on a lark, Iv&aacute;n rushed at Limping Gabriel. 
'Now I'll have him; he shan't escape me!' thought Iv&aacute;n. But Gabriel must 
have heard his steps, and (however he managed it) glancing round, he scuttled 
away past the barn like a hare.</p><p> 
'You shan't escape!' shouted Iv&aacute;n, darting after him.</p><p> 
Just as he was going to seize Gabriel, the latter dodged him; but Iv&aacute;n 
managed to catch the skirt of Gabriel's coat. It tore right off, and 
Iv&aacute;n fell down. He recovered his feet, and shouting, 'Help! Seize him! 
Thieves! Murder!' ran on again. But meanwhile Gabriel had reached his own gate. 
There Iv&aacute;n overtook him and was about to seize him, when something 
struck Iv&aacute;n a stunning blow, as though a stone had hit his temple, quite 
deafening him. It was Gabriel who, seizing an oak wedge that lay near the gate, 
had struck out with all his might.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n was stunned; sparks flew before his eyes, then all grew dark and he 
staggered. When he came to his senses Gabriel was no longer there: it was as 
light as day, and from the side where his homestead was something roared and 
crackled    <pb n="98"/>  like an engine at work. Iv&aacute;n turned round and saw that his back 
shed was all ablaze, and the side shed had also caught fire, and flames and 
smoke and bits of burning straw mixed with the smoke, were being driven towards 
his hut.</p><p> 
'What is this, friends? . . .' cried Iv&aacute;n, lifting his arms and striking 
his thighs.' Why, all I had to do was just to snatch it out from under the 
eaves and trample on it! What is this, friends? . . .' he kept repeating. He 
wished to shout, but his breath failed him; his voice was gone. He wanted to 
run, but his legs would not obey him, and got in each other's way. He moved 
slowly, but again staggered and again his breath failed. He stood still till he 
had regained breath, and then went on. Before he had got round the back shed to 
reach the fire, the side shed was also all ablaze; and the corner of the hut 
and the covered gateway had caught fire as well. The flames were leaping out of 
the hut, and it was impossible to get into the yard. A large crowd had 
collected, but nothing could be done. The neighbours were carrying their 
belongings out of their own houses, and driving the cattle out of their own 
sheds. After Ivan's house, Gabriel's also caught fire, then, the wind rising, 
the flames spread to the other side of the street and half the village was 
burnt down.</p><p> 
At Ivan's house they barely managed to save his old father; and the family 
escaped in what they had on; everything else, except the horses that had been 
driven out to pasture for the night, was lost; all the cattle, the fowls on 
their perches, the carts, ploughs, and harrows, the women's trunks with their 
clothes, and the grain in the granaries &mdash; all were burnt up!</p><p> 
At Gabriel's, the cattle were driven out, and a few things saved from his 
house.</p>   <pb n="99"/>  <p> 
The fire lasted all night. Iv&aacute;n stood in front of his homestead and kept 
repeating, 'What is this? . . . Friends! . . . One need only have pulled it out 
and trampled on it!' But when the roof fell in, Iv&aacute;n rushed into the 
burning place, and seizing a charred beam, tried to drag it out. The women saw 
him, and called him back; but he pulled out the beam, and was going in again 
for another when he lost his footing and fell among the flames. Then his son 
made his way in after him and dragged him out. Iv&aacute;n had singed his hair 
and beard and burnt his clothes and scorched his hands, but he felt nothing. 
'His grief has stupefied him,' said the people. The fire was burning itself 
out, but Iv&aacute;n still stood repeating: 'Friends! . . . What is this? . . . 
One need only have pulled it out!'</p><p> 
In the morning the village Elder's son came to fetch Iv&aacute;n.</p><p> 
'Daddy Iv&aacute;n, your father is dying! He has sent for you to say 
good-bye.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n had forgotten about his father, and did not understand what was 
being said to him.</p><p> 
'What father?' he said. 'Whom has he sent for?'</p><p> 
'He sent for you, to say good-bye; he is dying in our cottage! Come along, 
daddy Iv&aacute;n,' said the Elder's son, pulling him by the arm; and 
Iv&aacute;n followed the lad.</p><p> 
When he was being carried out of the hut, some burning straw had fallen on to 
the old man and burnt him, and he had been taken to the village Elder's in the 
farther part of the village, which the fire did not reach.</p><p> 
When Iv&aacute;n came to his father, there was only the Elder's wife in the 
hut, besides some little children on the top of the oven. All the rest were 
still at the fire. The old man, who was lying on a    <pb n="100"/>  bench holding a wax candle in his hand, kept turning his eyes towards 
the door. When his son entered, he moved a little. The old woman went up to him 
and told him that his son had come. He asked to have him brought nearer. 
Iv&aacute;n came closer.</p><p> 
'What did I tell you, Iv&aacute;n?' began the old man 'Who has burnt down the 
village?'</p><p> 
'It was he, father!' Iv&aacute;n answered. 'I caught him in the act. I saw him 
shove the firebrand into the thatch. I might have pulled away the burning straw 
and stamped it out, and then nothing would have happened.'</p><p> 
'Iv&aacute;n,' said the old man, 'I am dying, and you in your turn will have to 
face death. Whose is the sin?'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n gazed at his father in silence, unable to utter a word.</p><p> 
'Now, before God, say whose is the sin? What did I tell you?'</p><p> 
Only then Iv&aacute;n came to his senses and understood it all. He sniffed and 
said, 'Mine, father!' And he fell on his knees before his father, saying, 
'Forgive me, father; I am guilty before you and before God.'</p><p> 
The old man moved his hands, changed the candle from his right hand to his 
left, and tried to lift his right hand to his forehead to cross himself, but 
could not do it, and stopped.</p><p> 
'Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!' said he, and again he turned his eyes 
towards his son.</p><p> 
'Iv&aacute;n! I say, Iv&aacute;n!'</p><p> 
'What, father?'</p><p> 
'What must you do now?'</p>   <pb n="101"/>  <p> 
Iv&aacute;n was weeping.</p><p> 
'I don't know how we are to live now, father!' he said.</p><p> 
The old man closed his eyes, moved his lips as if to gather strength, and 
opening his eyes again, said: 'You'll manage. If you obey God's will, you'll 
manage!' He paused, then smiled, and said: 'Mind, Iv&aacute;n! Don't tell who 
started the fire! Hide another man's sin, and God will forgive two of yours!' 
And the old man took the candle in both hands and, folding them on his breast, 
sighed, stretched out, and died.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n did not say anything against Gabriel, and no one knew what had 
caused the fire.</p><p> 
And Ivan's anger against Gabriel passed away, and Gabriel wondered that 
Iv&aacute;n did not tell anybody. At first Gabriel felt afraid, but after 
awhile he got used to it. The men left off quarrelling, and then their families 
left off also. While rebuilding their huts, both families lived in one house; 
and when the village was rebuilt and they might have moved farther apart, 
Iv&aacute;n and Gabriel built next to each other, and remained neighbours as 
before.</p><p> 
They lived as good neighbours should. Iv&aacute;n Stcherbak&oacute;f remembered 
his old father's command to obey God's law, and quench a fire at the first 
spark; and if any one does him an injury he now tries not to revenge himself, 
but rather to set matters right again; and if any one gives him a bad word, 
instead of giving a worse in return, he tries to teach the other not to use 
evil words; and so he teaches his womenfolk and children. And Iv&aacute;n 
Stcherbak&oacute;f has got on his feet again, and now lives better even than he 
did before.</p><p>

<head>TWO OLD MEN</head> 
<div3 type="section" n="1" id="d33">

'The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. Our fathers 
worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where 
men ought to worship. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh 
when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father. . 
. . But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship 
the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his 
worshippers.' &mdash; <hi rend="italic">John</hi> iv. 19-21, 23.</q></p><p> 
THERE were once two old men who decided to go on a pilgrimage to worship God at 
Jerusalem. One of them was a well-to-do peasant named Ef&iacute;m 
Tar&aacute;sitch Shev&eacute;lev. The other, Elisha B&oacute;drov, was not so 
well off.</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m was a staid man, serious and firm. He neither drank nor smoked nor 
took snuff, and had never used bad language in his life. He had twice served as 
village Elder, and when he left office his accounts were in good order. He had 
a large family: two sons and a married grandson, all living with him. He was 
hale, long-bearded and erect, and it was only when he was past sixty that a 
little grey began to show itself in his beard.</p><p> 
Elisha was neither rich nor poor. He had formerly gone out carpentering, but 
now that he was growing old he stayed at home and kept bees. One of his sons 
had gone away to find work, the other was living at home. Elisha was a kindly 
and cheerful old man. It is true he drank sometimes, and he took snuff, and was 
fond of singing, but he was a    <pb n="103"/>  peaceable man, and lived on good terms with his 
family and with his neighbours. He was short and dark, with a curly beard, and, 
like his patron saint Elisha, he was quite bald-headed.</p><p> 
The two old men had taken a vow long since and had arranged to go on a 
pilgrimage to Jerusalem together: but Ef&iacute;m could never spare the time; 
he always had so much business on hand; as soon as one thing was finished he 
started another. First he had to arrange his grandson's marriage; then to wait 
for his youngest son's return from the army, and after that he began building a 
new hut.</p><p> 
One holiday the two old men met outside the hut and, sitting down on some 
timber, began to talk.</p><p> 
'Well,' asked Elisha, 'when are we to fulfil our vow?'</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m made a wry face.</p><p> 
'We must wait,' he said. 'This year has turned out a hard one for me. I started 
building this hut thinking it would cost me something over a hundred r&uacute;bles, 
but now it's getting on for three hundred and it's still not finished. We shall 
have to wait tin the summer. In summer, God willing, we will go without 
fail.'</p><p> 
'It seems to me we ought not to put it off, but should go at once,' said 
Elisha. 'Spring is the best time.'</p><p> 
'The time's right enough, but what about my building? How can I leave that?'</p><p> 
'As if you had no one to leave in charge! Your son can look after it.'</p><p> 
'But how? My eldest son is not trustworthy &mdash; he sometimes takes a glass too 
much.'</p><p> 
'Ah, neighbour, when we die they'll get on without us. Let your son begin now 
to get some experience.'</p>   <pb n="104"/>  <p> 
'That's true enough, but somehow when one begins a thing one likes to see it 
done.'</p><p> 
'Eh, friend, we can never get through all we have to do. The other day the 
women-folk at home were washing and house cleaning for Easter. Here something 
needed doing, there something else, and they could not get everything done. So 
my eldest daughter-in-law, who's a sensible woman, says: 'We may be thankful 
the holiday comes without waiting for us, or however hard we worked we should 
never be ready for it.'</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m became thoughtful.</p><p> 
'I've spent a lot of money on this building,' he said 'and one can't start on 
the journey with empty pockets. We shall want a hundred r&uacute;bles apiece &mdash; and 
it's no small sum.'</p><p> 
Elisha laughed.</p><p> 
'Now, come, come, old friend!' he said, 'you have ten times as much as I, and 
yet you talk about money. Only say when we are to start, and though I have 
nothing now I shall have enough by then.'</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m also smiled.</p><p> 
'Dear me, I did not know you were so rich!' said he. 'Why, where will you get 
it from?'</p><p> 
'I can scrape some together at home, and if that's not enough, I'll sell half a 
score of hives to my neighbour. He's long been wanting to buy them.'</p><p> 
'If they swarm well this year, you'll regret it.'</p><p> 
'Regret it! Not I, neighbour! I never regretted anything in my life, except my 
sins. There's nothing more precious than the soul.'</p><p> 
'That's so; still it's not right to neglect things at home.'</p><p> 
'But what if our souls are neglected? That's worse. We took the vow, so let us 
go! Now, seriously, let us go!'</p> 
  <pb n="105"/>   
</div3><div3 type="section" n="2" id="d34"> 
<head> 
II</head> 
<p>Elisha succeeded in persuading his comrade. In the morning, after thinking it 
well over, Ef&iacute;m came to Elisha.</p><p> 
'You are right,' said he, 'let us go. Life and death are in God's hands. We 
must go now, while we are still alive and have the strength.'</p><p> 
A week later the old men were ready to start. Ef&iacute;m had money enough at 
hand. He took a hundred r&uacute;bles himself, and left two hundred with his wife.</p><p> 
Elisha, too, got ready. He sold ten hives to his neighbour, with any new swarms 
that might come from them before the summer. He took seventy r&uacute;bles for the 
lot. The rest of the hundred r&uacute;bles he scraped together from the other members 
of his household, fairly clearing them all out. His wife gave him all she had 
been saving up for her funeral; and his daughter-in-law also gave him what she 
had.</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m gave his eldest son definite orders about every thing: when and how 
much grass to mow, where to cart the manure, and how to finish off and roof the 
cottage. He thought out everything, and gave his orders accordingly. Elisha, on 
the other hand, only explained to his wife that she was to keep separate the 
swarms from the hives he had sold, and to be sure to let the neighbour have 
them all, without any tricks. As to household affairs, he did not even mention 
them.</p><p> 
'You will see what to do and how to do it, as the needs arise,' he said. 'You 
are the masters, and will know how to do what's best for yourselves.'</p><p> 
So the old men got ready. Their people baked them cakes, and made bags for 
them, and cut them linen for leg-bands. 
They put on new leather    <pb n="106"/>  shoes, and took with them spare shoes of platted bark. 
Their families went with them to the end of the village and there took leave of 
them, and the old men started on their pilgrimage.</p><p> 
Elisha left home in a cheerful mood, and as soon as he was out of the village 
forgot all his home affairs. His only care was how to please his comrade, how 
to avoid saying a rude word to any one, how to get to his destination and home 
again in peace and love. Walking along the road, Elisha would either whisper 
some prayer to himself or go over in his mind such of the lives of the saints 
as he was able to remember. When he came across any one on the road, or turned 
in anywhere for the night, he tried to behave as gently as possible and to say 
a godly word. So he journeyed on, rejoicing. One thing only he could not do, he 
could not give up taking snuff. Though he had left his snuff-box behind, he 
hankered after it. Then a man he met on the road gave him some snuff; and every 
now and then he would lag behind (not to lead his comrade into temptation) and 
would take a pinch of snuff.</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m too walked well and firmly; doing no wrong and speaking no vain 
words, but his heart was not so light. Household cares weighed on his mind. He 
kept worrying about what was going on at home. Had he not forgotten to give his 
son this or that order? Would his son do things properly? If he happened to see 
potatoes being planted or manure carted, as he went along, he wondered if his 
son was doing as he had been told. And he almost wanted to turn back and show 
him how to do things, or even do them himself.</p>   
<pb n="107"/>   
</div3><div3 type="section" n="3" id="d35"> 
<head> 
III</head> 
<p> 
The old men had been walking for five weeks, they had worn out their home-made 
bark shoes, and had to begin buying new ones when they reached Little Russia. From the time they left home they had 
had to pay for their food and for their night's lodging, but when they reached 
Little Russia the people vied with one another in asking them into their huts. 
They took them in and fed them, and would accept no payment; and more than 
that, they put bread or even cakes into their bags for them to eat on the 
road.</p><p> 
The old men travelled some five hundred miles in this manner free of expense, 
but after they had crossed the next province, they came to a district where the 
harvest had failed. The peasants still gave them free lodging at night, but no 
longer fed them for nothing. Sometimes, even, they could get no bread: they 
offered to pay for it, but there was none to be had. The people said the 
harvest had completely failed the year before. Those who had been rich were 
ruined and had had to sell all they possessed; those of moderate means were 
left destitute, and those of the poor who had not left those parts, wandered 
about begging, or starved at home in utter want. In the winter they had had to 
eat husks and goosefoot.</p><p> 
One night the old men stopped in a small village; they bought fifteen pounds of 
bread, slept there, and started before sunrise, to get well on their way before 
the heat of the day. When they had gone some eight miles, on coming to a stream 
they sat    <pb n="108"/>  down, and, filling a bowl with water, they steeped some bread in it, 
and ate it. Then they changed their leg-bands, and rested for a while. Elisha 
took out his snuff-box. Ef&iacute;m shook his head at him.</p><p> 
'How is it you don't give up that nasty habit?' said he.</p><p> 
Elisha waved his hand. 'The evil habit is stronger than I,' he said.</p><p> 
Presently they got up and went on. After walking for nearly another eight 
miles, they came to a large village and passed right through it. It had now 
grown hot. Elisha was tired out and wanted to rest and have a drink, but 
Ef&iacute;m did not stop. Ef&iacute;m was the better walker of the two, and 
Elisha found it hard to keep up with him.</p><p> 
'If I could only have a drink,' said he.</p><p> 
'Well, have a drink,' said Ef&iacute;m. 'I don't want any.'</p><p> 
Elisha stopped.</p><p> 
'You go on,' he said, 'but I'll just run in to the little hut there. I will 
catch you up in a moment.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Ef&iacute;m, and he went on along the high road alone, while 
Elisha turned back to the hut.</p><p> 
It was a small hut plastered with clay, the bottom a dark colour, the top 
whitewashed; but the clay had crumbled away. Evidently it was long since it had 
been re-plastered, and the thatch was off the roof on one side. The entrance to 
the hut was through the yard. Elisha entered the yard, and saw, lying close to 
a bank of earth that ran round the hut, a gaunt, beardless man with his shirt 
tucked into his trousers, as is the custom in Little Russia. The man must have lain down in the 
shade, but the sun had come round and now shone full on him. Though not asleep, 
he still lay there. Elisha called    <pb n="109"/>  to him, and asked for a drink, but the man 
gave no answer.</p><p> 
'He is either ill or unfriendly,' thought Elisha; and going to the door he 
heard a child crying in the hut. He took hold of the ring that served as a 
door-handle, and knocked with it.</p><p> 
'Hey, masters!' he called. No answer. He knocked again with his staff.</p><p> 
'Hey, Christians!' Nothing stirred.</p><p> 
'Hey, servants of God!' Still no reply.</p><p> 
Elisha was about to turn away, when he thought ho heard a groan the other side 
of the door.</p><p> 
'Dear me, some misfortune must have happened to the people? I had better have a 
look.'</p><p> 
And Elisha entered the hut.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="4" id="d36"> 
<head> 
IV</head><p> 
Elisha turned the ring; the door was not fastened. He opened it and went along 
up the narrow passage. The door into the dwelling-room was open. To the left 
was a brick oven; in front against the wall was an icon-stand and a table before it, by the table was a 
bench on which sat an old woman, bareheaded and wearing only a single garment. 
There she sat with her head resting on the table, and near her was a thin, 
wax-coloured boy, with a protruding stomach. He was asking for something, 
pulling at her sleeve, and crying bitterly. Elisha entered. The air in the hut 
was very foul. He looked round, and saw a woman lying on the floor behind the 
oven: she lay flat on the ground with her eyes closed and her throat rattling, 
now stretching out a leg, now dragging it in, tossing from side to side; and 
the foul smell came from her. Evidently she   <pb n="110"/>  could do nothing for herself and no 
one had been attending to her needs. The old woman lifted her head, and saw the 
stranger.</p><p> 
'What do you want?' said she.' What do you want man? We have nothing.'</p><p> 
Elisha understood her, though she spoke in the Little-Russian dialect.</p><p> 
'I came in for a drink of water, servant of God,' he said.</p><p> 
'There's no one &mdash; no one &mdash; we have nothing to fetch it in. Go your way.'</p><p> 
Then Elisha asked:</p><p> 
'Is there no one among you, then, well enough to attend to that woman?'</p><p> 
'No, we have no one. My son is dying outside, and we are dying in here.'</p><p> 
The little boy had ceased crying when he saw the stranger, but when the old 
woman began to speak, he began again, and clutching hold of her sleeve cried:</p><p> 
'Bread, Granny, bread.'</p><p> 
Elisha was about to question the old woman, when the man staggered into the 
hut. He came along the passage, clinging to the wall, but as he was entering 
the dwelling-room he fell in the corner near the threshold, and without trying 
to get up again to reach the bench, he began to speak in broken words. He 
brought out a word at a time, stopping to draw breath, and gasping.</p><p> 
'Illness has seized us . . . ,' said he, 'and famine. He is dying . . . of 
hunger.'</p><p> 
And he motioned towards the boy, and began to sob.</p><p> 
Elisha jerked up the sack behind his shoulder and pulling the straps off his 
arms, put it on the floor. Then he lifted it on to the bench, and untied the 
strings. Having opened the sack, he took out a loaf of bread, and, cutting off 
a piece with his    <pb n="111"/>  knife, handed it to the man. The man would not take it, but 
pointed to the little boy and to a little girl crouching behind the oven, as if 
to say:</p><p> 
'Give it to them.'</p><p> 
Elisha held it out to the boy. When the boy smelt bread, he stretched out his 
arms, and seizing the slice with both his little hands, bit into it so that his 
nose disappeared in the chunk. The little girl came out from behind the oven 
and fixed her eyes on the bread. Elisha gave her also a slice. Then he cut off 
another piece and gave it to the old woman, and she too began munching it.</p><p> 
'If only some water could be brought,' she said, 'their mouths are parched. I 
tried to fetch some water yesterday &mdash; or was it to-day &mdash; I can't remember, 
but I fell down and could go no further, and the pail has remained there, 
unless some one has taken it.'</p><p> 
Elisha asked where the well was. The old woman told him. Elisha went out, found 
the pail, brought some water, and gave the people a drink. The children and the 
old woman ate some more bread with the water, but the man would not eat.</p><p> 
'I cannot eat,' he said.</p><p> 
All this time the younger woman did not show any consciousness, but continued 
to toss from side to side. Presently Elisha went to the village shop and bought 
some millet, salt, flour, and oil. He found an axe, chopped some wood, and made 
a fire. The little girl came and helped him. Then he boiled some soup, and gave 
the starving people a meal.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="5" id="d37"> 
<head> 
V</head><p> 
The man ate a little, the old woman had some too, and the little girl and boy 
licked the bowl clean, and then curled up and fell fast asleep in one another's 
arms.</p><p> 
The man and the old woman then began telling    <pb n="112"/>  Elisha how they had sunk to their 
present state.</p><p> 
'We were poor enough before?' said they, 'but when the crops failed, what we 
gathered hardly lasted us through the autumn. We had nothing left by the time 
winter came, and had to beg from the neighbours and from any one we could. At 
first they gave, then they began to refuse. Some would have been glad enough to 
help us, but had nothing to give. And we were ashamed of asking: we were in 
debt all round, and owed money, and flour, and bread.'</p><p> 
'I went to look for work,' the man said, 'but could find none. Everywhere 
people were offering to work merely for their own keep. One day you'd get a 
short job, and then you might spend two days looking for work. Then the old 
woman and the girl went begging, further away. But they got very little; bread 
was so scarce. Still we scraped food together somehow, and hoped to struggle 
through till next harvest, but towards spring people ceased to give anything. 
And then this illness seized us. Things became worse and worse. One day we 
might have something to eat, and then nothing for two days. We began eating 
grass. Whether it was the grass, or what, made my wife ill, I don't know. She 
could not keep on her legs, and I had no strength left, and there was nothing 
to help us to recovery.'</p><p> 
'I struggled on alone for a while,' said the old woman, 'but at last I broke 
down too for want of food, and grew quite weak. The girl also grew weak and 
timid. I told her to go to the neighbours &mdash; she would not leave the hut, but 
crept into a corner and sat there. The day before yesterday a neighbour looked 
in, but seeing that we were ill and hungry she turned away and left us. Her 
husband has had to go away, and she has nothing for her own little ones to eat. 
And so we lay, waiting for death.'</p>   <pb n="113"/>  <p> 
Having heard their story, Elisha gave up the thought of overtaking his comrade 
that day, and remained with them all night. In the morning he got up and began 
doing the housework, just as if it were his own home. He kneaded the bread with 
the old woman's help, and lit the fire. Then he went with the little girl to 
the neighbours to get the most necessary things, for there was nothing in the 
hut: everything had been sold for bread &mdash; cooking utensils, clothing, and all. 
So Elisha began replacing what was necessary, making some things himself, and 
buying some. He remained there one day, then another, and then a third. The 
little boy picked up strength and, whenever Elisha sat down, crept along the 
bench and nestled up to him. The little girl brightened up and helped in all 
the work, running after Elisha and calling,</p><p> 
'Daddy, daddy.'</p><p> 
The old woman grew stronger, and managed to go out to see a neighbour. The man 
too improved, and was able to get about, holding on to the wall. Only the wife 
could not get up, but even she regained consciousness on the third day, and 
asked for food.</p><p> 
'Well,' thought Elisha, 'I never expected to waste so much time on the way. Now 
I must be getting on.'</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="6" id="d38"> 
<head> 
VI</head><p> 
The fourth day was the feast day after the summer fast, and Elisha thought:</p><p> 
'I will stay and break the fast with these people. I'll go and buy them 
something, and keep the feast with them, and to-morrow evening I will start.'</p><p> 
So Elisha went into the village, bought milk, wheat-flour and dripping, and 
helped the old woman to boil and bake for the morrow. On the feast day Elisha 
went to church, and then broke    <pb n="114"/>  the fast with his friends at the hut. That day 
the wife got up, and managed to move about a bit. The husband had shaved and 
put on a clean shirt, which the old woman had washed for him; and he went to 
beg for mercy of a rich peasant in the village to whom his ploughland and 
meadow were mortgaged. He went to beg the rich peasant to grant him the use of 
the meadow and field till after the harvest; but in the evening he came back 
very sad, and began to weep. The rich peasant had shown no mercy, but had said: 
'Bring me the money.'</p><p> 
Elisha again grew thoughtful. 'How are they to live now?' thought he to 
himself. 'Other people will go haymaking, but there will be nothing for these 
to mow, their grass land is mortgaged. The rye will ripen. Others will reap 
(and what a fine crop mother-earth is giving this year), but they have nothing 
to look forward to. Their three acres are pledged to the rich peasant. When I 
am gone, they'll drift back into the state I found them in.'</p><p> 
Elisha was in two minds, but finally decided not to leave that evening, but to 
wait until the morrow. He went out into the yard to sleep. He said his prayers, 
and lay down; but he could not sleep. On the one hand he felt he ought to be 
going, for he had spent too much time and money as it was; on the other hand he 
felt sorry for the people.</p><p> 
'There seems to be no end to it, he said. 'First I only meant to bring them a 
little water and give them each a slice of bread: and just see where it has 
landed me. It's a case of redeeming the meadow and the cornfield. And when I 
have done that, I shall have to buy a cow for them, and a horse for the man to 
cart his sheaves. A nice coil you've got yourself into, brother Elisha! You've 
slipped your cables and lost your reckoning!'</p><p> 
Elisha got up, lifted his coat which he had been   <pb n="115"/>  using for a pillow, unfolded 
it, got out his snuff-box and took a pinch, thinking that it might perhaps 
clear his thoughts.</p><p> 
But no! He thought and thought, and came to no conclusion. He ought to be 
going; and yet pity held him back. He did not know what to do. He refolded his 
coat and put it under his head again. He lay thus for a long time, till the 
cocks had already crowed once: then he was quite drowsy. And suddenly it seemed 
as if some one had roused him. He saw that he was dressed for the journey, with 
the sack on his back and the staff in his hand, and the gate stood ajar so that 
he could just squeeze through. He was about to pass out, when his sack caught 
against the fence on one side: he tried to free it, but then his leg-band 
caught on the other side and came undone. He pulled at the sack, and saw that 
it had not caught on the fence, but that the little girl was holding it and 
crying, </p><p> 
'Bread, daddy, bread!'</p><p> 
He looked at his foot, and there was the tiny boy holding him by the leg-band, 
while the master of the hut and the old woman were looking at him through the 
window.</p><p> 
Elisha awoke, and said to himself in an audible voice:</p><p> 
'To-morrow I will redeem their cornfield, and will buy them a horse, and flour 
to last till the harvest, and a cow for the little ones; or else while I go to 
seek the Lord beyond the sea, I may lose Him in myself.'</p><p> 
Then Elisha fell asleep, and slept till morning. He awoke early, and going to 
the rich peasant, redeemed both the cornfield and the meadow land. He bought a 
scythe (for that also had been sold) and brought it back with him. Then he sent 
the man to mow, and himself went into the village. He    <pb n="116"/>  heard that there was a 
horse and cart for sale at the public-house, and he struck a bargain with the 
owner, and bought them. Then he bought a sack of flour, put it in the cart, and 
went to see about a cow. As he was going along he overtook two women talking as 
they went. Though they spake the Little-Russian dialect, he understood what 
they were saying.</p><p> 
'At first, it seems, they did not know him; they thought he was just an 
ordinary man. He came in to ask for a drink of water, and then he remained. 
Just think of the things he has bought for them! Why they say he bought a horse 
and cart for them at the publican's, only this morning! There are not many such 
men in the world. It's worth while going to have a look at him.'</p><p> 
Elisha heard and understood that he was being praised, and he did not go to buy 
the cow, but returned to the inn, paid for the horse, harnessed it, drove up to 
the hut, and got out. The people in the hut were astonished when they saw the 
horse. They thought it might be for them, but dared not ask. The man came out 
to open the gate.</p><p> 
'Where did you get a horse from, grandfather,' he asked.</p><p> 
'Why, I bought it,' said Elisha. 'It was going cheap. Go and cut some grass and 
put it in the manger for it to eat during the night. And take in the sack.'</p><p> 
The man unharnessed the horse, and carried the sack into the barn. Then he 
mowed some grass and put it in the manger. Everybody lay down to sleep. Elisha 
went outside and lay by the roadside. That evening he took his bag out with 
him. When every one was asleep, he got up, packed and fastened his bag, wrapped 
the linen bands round his legs, put on his shoes and coat, and set off to 
follow Ef&iacute;m.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="7" id="d39"> 
<head> 
VII</head><p> 
When Elisha had walked rather more than three miles it began to grow light. He 
sat down under a tree, opened his bag, counted his money, and found he had only 
seventeen r&uacute;bles and twenty kopeks left.</p><p> 
'Well,' thought he, 'it is no use trying to cross the sea with this. If I beg 
my way it may be worse than not going at all. Friend Ef&iacute;m will get to 
Jerusalem without me, and will place a candle at the shrines in my name. As for 
me, I'm afraid I shall never fulfil my vow in this life. I must be thankful it 
was made to a merciful Master, and to one who pardons sinners.'</p><p> 
Elisha rose, jerked his bag well up on his shoulders, and turned back. Not 
wishing to be recognized by any one, he made a circuit to avoid the village, 
and walked briskly homeward. Coming from home the way had seemed difficult to 
him, and he had found it hard to keep up with Ef&iacute;m, but now on his 
return journey, God helped him to get over the ground so that he hardly felt 
fatigue. Walking seemed like child's play. He went along swinging his staff, 
and did his forty to fifty miles a day.</p><p> 
When Elisha reached home the harvest was over. His family were delighted to see 
him again, and all wanted to know what had happened: Why and how he had been 
left behind? And why he had returned without reaching Jerusalem? But Elisha did 
not tell them.</p><p> 
'It was not God's will that I should get there,' said he. 'I lost my money on 
the way, and lagged behind my companion. Forgive me, for the Lord's sake!'</p><p> 
Elisha gave his old wife what money he had left. Then he questioned them about 
home affairs. Everything was going on well; all the work had    <pb n="118"/>  been done, nothing 
neglected, and all were living in peace and concord.</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m's family heard of his return the same day, and came for news of 
their old man; and to them Elisha gave the same answers.</p><p> 
'Ef&iacute;m is a fast walker. We parted three days before St. Peter's day, and 
I meant to catch him up again, but all sorts of things happened. I lost my 
money, and had no means to get any further, so I turned back.'</p><p> 
The folks were astonished that so sensible a man should have acted so 
foolishly: should have started and not got to his destination, and should have 
squandered all his money. They wondered at it for a while, and then forgot all 
about it, and Elisha forgot it too. He set to work again on his homestead. With 
his son's help he cut wood for fuel for the winter. He and the women threshed 
the corn. Then he mended the thatch on the outhouses, put the bees under cover, 
and handed over to his neighbour the ten hives he had sold him in spring, and 
all the swarms that had come from them. His wife tried not to tell how many 
swarms there had been from these hives, but Elisha knew well enough from which 
there had been swarms and from which not. And instead of ten, he handed over 
seventeen swarms to his neighbour. Having got everything ready for the winter, 
Elisha sent his son away to find work, while he himself took to platting shoes 
of bark, and hollowing out logs for hives.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="8" id="d40"><head> 
VIII</head><p> 
All that day while Elisha stopped behind in the hut with the sick people, 
Ef&iacute;m waited for him. He only went on a little way before he sat down. He 
waited and waited, had a nap, woke up again, and again sat waiting; but his 
comrade did not come. He    <pb n="119"/>  gazed till his eyes ached. The sun was already sinking 
behind a tree, and still no Elisha was to be seen.</p><p> 
'Perhaps he has passed me,' thought Ef&iacute;m, 'or perhaps some one gave him 
a lift and he drove by while I slept, and did not see me. But how could he help 
seeing me? One can see so far here in the steppe. Shall I go back? Suppose he 
is on in front, we shall then miss each other completely and it will be still 
worse. I had better go on, and we shall be sure to meet where we put up for the 
night.'</p><p> 
He came to a village, and told the watchman, if an old man of a certain 
description came along, to bring him to the hut where Ef&iacute;m stopped. But 
Elisha did not turn up that night. Ef&iacute;m went on, asking all he met 
whether they had not seen a little, bald-headed, old man? No one had seen such 
a traveller. Ef&iacute;m wondered, but went on alone, saying:</p><p> 
'We shall be sure to meet in Odessa, or on board the ship,' and he did not 
trouble more about it.</p><p> 
On the way, he came across a pilgrim wearing a priest's coat, with long hair 
and a skull-cap such as priests wear. This pilgrim had been to Mount Athos, and 
was now going to Jerusalem for the second time. They both stopped at the same 
place one night, and, having met, they travelled on together.</p><p> 
They got safely to Odessa, and there had to wait three days for a ship. Many 
pilgrims from many different parts were in the same case. Again Ef&iacute;m 
asked about Elisha, but no one had seen him.</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m got himself a foreign passport, which cost him five r&uacute;bles. He 
paid forty r&uacute;bles for a return ticket to Jerusalem, and bought a supply of 
bread and herrings for the voyage.</p><p> 
The pilgrim began explaining to Ef&iacute;m how he might get on to the ship 
without paying his fare; but Ef&iacute;m would not listen. 'No, I came prepared 
to pay, and I shall pay,' said he.</p>   <pb n="120"/>  <p> 
The ship was freighted, and the pilgrims went on board, Ef&iacute;m and his new 
comrade among them. The anchors were weighed, and the ship put out to sea.</p><p> 
All day they sailed smoothly, but towards night a wind arose, rain came on, and 
the vessel tossed about and shipped water. The people were frightened: the 
women wailed and screamed, and some of the weaker men ran about the ship 
looking for shelter. Ef&iacute;m too was frightened, but he would not show it, 
and remained at the place on deck where he had settled down when first he came 
on board, beside some old men from Tamb&oacute;f. There they sat silent, all 
night and all next day, holding on to their sacks. On the third day it grew 
calm, and on the fifth day they anchored at Constantinople. Some of the 
pilgrims went on shore to visit the Church of St. Sophia, now held by the 
Turks. Ef&iacute;m remained on the ship, and only bought some white bread. They 
lay there for twenty-four hours, and then put to sea again. At Smyrna they 
stopped again; and at Alexandria; but at last they arrived safely at Jaffa, 
where all the pilgrims had to disembark. From there still it was more than 
forty miles by road to Jerusalem. When disembarking the people were again much 
frightened. The ship was high, and the people were dropped into boats, which 
rocked so much that it was easy to miss them and fall into the water. A couple 
of men did get a wetting, but at last all were safely landed.</p><p> 
They went on on foot, and at noon on the third day reached Jerusalem. They 
stopped outside the town, at the Russian inn, where their passports were 
indorsed. Then, after dinner, Ef&iacute;m visited the Holy Places with his 
companion, the pilgrim. It was not the time when they could be admitted to the 
Holy Sepulchre, but they went to the Patriarchate.   <pb n="121"/>   All the pilgrims assembled 
there. The women were separated from the men, who were all told to sit in a 
circle, barefoot. Then a monk came in with a towel to wash their feet. He 
washed, wiped, and then kissed their feet, and did this to every one in the 
circle. Ef&iacute;m's feet were washed and kissed, with the rest. He stood 
through vespers and matins, prayed, placed candles at the shrines, handed in 
booklets inscribed with his parents, names, that they might be mentioned in the 
church prayers. Here at the Patriarchate food and wine were given them. Next 
morning they went to the cell of Mary of Egypt, where she had lived doing 
penance. Here too they placed candles and had prayers read. From there they 
went to Abraham's Monastery, and saw the place where Abraham intended to slay 
his son as an offering to God. Then they visited the spot where Christ appeared 
to Mary Magdalene, and the Church of James, the Lord's brother. The pilgrim 
showed Ef&iacute;m all these places, and told him how much money to give at 
each place. At mid-day they returned to the inn and had dinner. As they were 
preparing to lie down and rest, the pilgrim cried out, and began to search his 
clothes, feeling them all over.</p><p> 
'My purse has been stolen, there were twenty-three r&uacute;bles in it,' said he, 
'two ten-r&uacute;ble notes and the rest in change.'</p><p> 
He sighed and lamented a great deal, but as there was no help for it, they lay 
down to sleep.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="9" id="d41"> 
<head> 
IX</head><p> 
As Ef&iacute;m lay there, he was assailed by temptation.</p><p> 
'No one has stolen any money from this pilgrim,' thought he, 'I do not believe 
he had any. He gave none away anywhere, though he made me give, and even 
borrowed a r&uacute;ble of me.'</p>   <pb n="122"/>  <p> 
This thought had no sooner crossed his mind, than Ef&iacute;m rebuked himself, 
saying: 'What right have I to judge a man? It is a sin. I will think no more 
about it.' But as soon as his thoughts began to wander, they turned again to 
the pilgrim: how interested he seemed to be in money, and how unlikely it 
sounded when he declared that his purse had been stolen.</p><p> 
'He never had any money,' thought Ef&iacute;m. 'It's all an invention.'</p><p> 
Towards evening they got up, and went to midnight Mass at the great Church of 
the Resurrection, where the Lord's Sepulchre is. The pilgrim kept close to 
Ef&iacute;m and went with him everywhere. They came to the Church; a great many 
pilgrims were there; some Russians and some of other nationalities: Greeks, 
Armenians, Turks, and Syrians. Ef&iacute;m entered the Holy Gates with the 
crowd. A monk led them past the Turkish sentinels, to the place where the 
Saviour was taken down from the cross and anointed, and where candles were 
burning in nine great candlesticks. The monk showed and explained everything. 
Ef&iacute;m offered a candle there. Then the monk led Ef&iacute;m to the right, 
up the steps to Golgotha, to the place where the cross had stood. Ef&iacute;m 
prayed there. Then they showed him the cleft where the ground had been rent 
asunder to its nethermost depths; then the place where Christ's hands and feet 
were nailed to the cross; then Adam's tomb, where the blood of Christ had 
dripped on to Adam's bones. Then they showed him the stone on which Christ sat 
when the crown of thorns was placed on His head; then the post to which Christ 
was bound when He was scourged. Then Ef&iacute;m saw the stone with two holes 
for Christ's feet. They were going to show him something else, but there was a 
stir in the crowd, and the people all   <pb n="123"/>  hurried to the church of the Lord's 
Sepulchre itself. The Latin Mass had just finished there, and the Russian Mass 
was beginning. And Ef&iacute;m went with the crowd to the tomb cut in the 
rock.</p><p> 
He tried to get rid of the pilgrim, against whom he was still sinning in his 
mind, but the pilgrim would not leave him, but went with him to the Mass at the 
Holy Sepulchre. They tried to get to the front, but were too late. There was 
such a crowd that it was impossible to move either backwards or forwards. 
Ef&iacute;m stood looking in front of him, praying, and every now and then 
feeling for his purse. He was in two minds: sometimes he thought that the 
pilgrim was deceiving him, and then again he thought that if the pilgrim spoke 
the truth and his purse had really been stolen, the same thing might happen to 
himself.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="10" id="d42"> 
<head> 
X</head><p> 
Ef&iacute;m stood there gazing into the little chapel in which was the Holy 
Sepulchre itself with thirty-six lamps burning above it. As he stood looking 
over the people's heads, he saw something that surprised him. Just beneath the 
lamps in which the sacred fire burns and in front of every one, Ef&iacute;m saw 
an old man in a grey coat, whose bald, shining head was just like Elisha 
B&oacute;drov.</p><p> 
'It is like him,' thought Ef&iacute;m, 'but it cannot be Elisha. He could not 
have got ahead of me. The ship before ours started a week sooner. He could not 
have caught that; and he was not on ours, for I saw every pilgrim on board.'</p><p> 
Hardly had Ef&iacute;m thought this, when the little old man began to pray, and 
bowed three times: once forwards to God, then once on each side &mdash; to the 
brethren. And as he turned his head to the right, Ef&iacute;m recognized him. 
It was Elisha B&oacute;drov   <pb n="124"/>  himself with his dark, curly beard turning grey at 
the cheeks, with his brows, his eyes and nose, and his expression of face. Yes, 
it was he!</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m was very pleased to have found his comrade again, and wondered how 
Elisha had got ahead of him.</p><p> 
'Well done, Elisha!' thought he. 'See how he has pushed ahead. He must have 
come across some one who showed him the way. When we get out, I will find him, 
get rid of this fellow in the skull-cap, and keep to Elisha. Perhaps he will 
show me how to get to the front also.'</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m kept looking out, so as not to lose sight of Elisha. But when the 
Mass was over, the crowd began to sway, pushing forward to kiss the tomb, and 
pushed Ef&iacute;m aside. He was again seized with fear lest his purse should 
be stolen. Pressing it with his hand, he began elbowing through the crowd, 
anxious only to get out. When he reached the open, he went about for a long 
time searching for Elisha both outside and in the Church itself. In the cells 
of the Church he saw many people of all kinds, eating, and drinking wine, and 
reading and sleeping there. But Elisha was nowhere to be seen. So Ef&iacute;m 
returned to the inn without having found his comrade. That evening the pilgrim 
in the skull-cap did not turn up. He had gone off without repaying the r&uacute;ble, 
and Ef&iacute;m was left alone.</p><p> 
The next day Ef&iacute;m went to the Holy Sepulchre again, with an old man from 
Tamb&oacute;f, whom he had met on the ship. He tried to get to the front, but 
was again pressed back; so he stood by a pillar and prayed. He looked before 
him, and there in the foremost place under the lamps, close to the very 
Sepulchre of the Lord, stood Elisha, with his arms spread out like a priest at 
the altar, and with his bald head all shining.</p>   <pb n="125"/>  <p> 
'Well, now,' thought Ef&iacute;m, 'I won't lose him!'</p><p> 
He pushed forward to the front, but when he got there, there was no Elisha: he 
had evidently gone away. </p><p> 
Again on the third day Ef&iacute;m looked, and saw at the Sepulchre, in the 
holiest place, Elisha standing in the sight of all men, his arms outspread, and 
his eyes gazing upwards as if he saw something above. And his bald head was all 
shining.</p><p> 
'Well, this time,' thought Ef&iacute;m, 'he shall not escape me! I will go and 
stand at the door, then we can't miss one another!'</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m went out and stood by the door till past noon. Every one had passed 
out, but still Elisha did not appear.</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m remained six weeks in Jerusalem, and went everywhere: to Bethlehem, 
and to Bethany, and to the Jordan. He had a new shirt sealed at the Holy 
Sepulchre for his burial, and he took a bottle of water from the Jordan, and 
some holy earth, and bought candles that had been lit at the sacred flame. In 
eight places he inscribed names to be prayed for, and he spent all his money, 
except just enough to get home with. Then he started homeward. He walked to 
Jaffa, sailed thence to Odessa, and walked home from there on foot.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="11" id="d43"> 
<head> 
XI</head><p> 
Ef&iacute;m travelled the same road he had come by; and as he drew nearer home 
his former anxiety returned as to how affairs were getting on in his absence. 
'Much water flows away in a year,' the proverb says. It takes a lifetime to 
build up a homestead, but not long to ruin it, thought he. And he wondered how 
his son had managed without him, what sort of spring they were having, how the 
cattle had wintered, and whether the cottage was   <pb n="126"/>  well finished. When 
Ef&iacute;m came to the district where he had parted from Elisha the summer 
before, he could hardly believe that the people living there were the same. The 
year before they had been starving, but now they were living in comfort. The 
harvest had been good, and the people had recovered and had forgotten their 
former misery.</p><p> 
One evening Ef&iacute;m reached the very place where Elisha had remained 
behind; and as he entered the village, a little girl in a white smock ran out 
of a hut.</p><p> 
Daddy, daddy, come to our house!'</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m meant to pass on, but the little girl would not let him. She took 
hold of his coat, laughing, and pulled him towards the hut, where a woman with 
a small boy came out into the porch and beckoned to him.</p><p> 
'Come in, grandfather,' she said. 'Have supper and spend the night with us.'</p><p> 
So Ef&iacute;m went in.</p><p> 
'I may as well ask about Elisha,' he thought. 'I fancy this is the very hut he 
went to for a drink of water.'</p><p> 
The woman helped him off with the bag he carried, and gave him water to wash 
his face. Then she made him sit down to table, and set milk, curd-cakes and 
porridge before him. Ef&iacute;m thanked her, and praised her for her kindness 
to a pilgrim. The woman shook her head.</p><p> 
'We have good reason to welcome pilgrims,' she said. 'It was a pilgrim who 
showed us what life is. We were living forgetful of God, and God punished us 
almost to death. We reached such a pass last summer, that we all lay ill and 
helpless with nothing to eat. And we should have died, but that God sent an old 
man to help us &mdash; just such a one as you. He came in one day to ask for a drink 
of water, saw the state we were in, took pity on us, and remained   <pb n="127"/>  with us. He 
gave us food and drink, and set us on our feet again; and he redeemed our land, 
and bought a cart and horse and gave them to us.'</p><p> 
Here the old woman entering the hut, interrupted the younger one and said:</p><p> 
'We don't know whether it was a man, or an angel from God. He loved us all, 
pitied us all, and went away without telling us his name, so that we don't even 
know whom to pray for. I can see it all before me now! There I lay waiting for 
death, when in comes a bald-headed old man. He was not anything much to look 
at, and he asked for a drink of water. I, sinner that I am, thought to myself: 
"What does he come prowling about here for?" And just think what he did! As 
soon as he saw us, he let down his bag, on this very spot, and untied it.'</p><p> 
Here the little girl joined in.</p><p> 
'No, Granny,' said she, 'first he put it down here in the middle of the hut, 
and then he lifted it on to the bench.'</p><p> 
And they began discussing and recalling all he had said and done, where he sat 
and slept, and what he had said to each of them.</p><p> 
At night the peasant himself came home on his horse, and he too began to tell 
about Elisha and how he had lived with them.</p><p> 
'Had he not come we should all have died in our sins. We were dying in despair, 
murmuring against God and man. But he set us on our feet again; and through him 
we learned to know God, and to believe that there is good in man. May the Lord 
bless him! We used to live like animals; he made human beings of us.</p><p> 
After giving Ef&iacute;m food and drink, they showed him where he was to sleep; 
and lay down to sleep themselves.</p>   <pb n="128"/>  <p> 
But though Ef&iacute;m lay down, he could not sleep. He could not get Elisha 
out of his mind, but remembered how he had seen him three times at Jerusalem, 
standing in the foremost place.</p><p> 
'So that is how he got ahead of me,' thought Ef&iacute;m. 'God may or may not 
have accepted my pilgrimage but He has certainly accepted his!'</p><p> 
Next morning Ef&iacute;m bade farewell to the people, who put some patties in 
his sack before they went to their work, and he continued his journey.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="12" id="d44"> 
<head> 
XII</head><p> 
Ef&iacute;m had been away just a year, and it was spring again when he reached 
home one evening. His son was not at home, but had gone to the public-house and 
when he came back, he had had a drop too much. Ef&iacute;m began questioning 
him. Everything showed that the young fellow had been unsteady during his 
father's absence. The money had all been wrongly spent, and the work had been 
neglected. The father began to upbraid the son; and the son answered rudely.</p><p> 
'Why didn't you stay and look after it yourself?' he said. 'You go off, taking 
the money with you and now you demand it of me!'</p><p> 
The old man grew angry, and struck his son.</p><p> 
In the morning Ef&iacute;m went to the village Elder to complain of his son's 
conduct. As he was passing Elisha's house, his friend's wife greeted him from 
the porch.</p><p> 
'How do you do, neighbour,' she said. 'How do you do, dear friend? Did you get 
to Jerusalem safely?'</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m stopped.</p><p> 
'Yes, thank God,' he said. 'I have been there. I lost sight of your old man, 
but I hear he got home safely.'</p>   <pb n="129"/>  <p> 
The old woman was fond of talking:</p><p> 
'Yes, neighbour, he has come back,' said she. 'He's been back a long time. Soon 
after Assumption, I think it was, he returned. And we were glad the Lord had 
sent him back to us! We were dull without him. We can't expect much work from 
him any more, his years for work are past; but still he is the head of the 
household and it's more cheerful when he's at home. And how glad our lad was! 
He said, "It's like being without sunlight, when father's away!" It was dull 
without him, dear friend. We're fond of him, and take good care of him.'</p><p> 
'Is he at home now?'</p><p> 
'He is, dear friend. He is with his bees. He is hiving the swarms. He says they 
are swarming well this year. The Lord has given such strength to the bees that 
my husband doesn't remember the like. "The Lord is not rewarding us according 
to our sins," he says. Come in, dear neighbour, he will be so glad to see you 
again.'</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m passed through the passage into the yard and to the apiary, to see 
Elisha. There was Elisha in his grey coat, without any face-net or gloves, 
standing, under the birch trees, looking upwards, his arms stretched out and 
his bald head shining, as Ef&iacute;m had seen him at the Holy Sepulchre in 
Jerusalem: and above him the sunlight shone through the birches as the flames 
of fire had done in the holy place, and the golden bees flew round his head 
like a halo, and did not sting him.</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m stopped. The old woman called to her husband.</p><p> 
'Here's your friend come,' she cried.</p><p> 
Elisha looked round with a pleased face, and came towards Ef&iacute;m, gently 
picking bees out of his own beard.</p>   <pb n="130"/>  <p> 
'Good day, neighbour, good-day, dear friend. Did you get there safely?'</p><p> 
'My feet walked there, and I have brought you some water from the river Jordan. 
You must come to my house for it. But whether the Lord accepted my efforts. . . 
.'</p><p> 
'Well the Lord be thanked! May Christ bless you!' said Elisha.</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m was silent for a while, and then added:</p><p> 
'My feet have been there, but whether my soul, or another's, has been there 
more truly . . .'</p><p> 
'That's God's business, neighbour, God's business,' interrupted Elisha.</p><p> 
'On my return journey I stopped at the hut where you remained behind. . . .'</p><p> 
Elisha was alarmed, and said hurriedly:</p><p> 
'God's business, neighbour, God's business! Come into the cottage, I'll give 
you some of our honey.' And Elisha changed the conversation, and talked of home 
affairs.</p><p> 
Ef&iacute;m sighed, and did not speak to Elisha of the people in the hut, nor 
of how he had seen him in Jerusalem. But he now understood that the best way to 
keep one's vows to God and to do His will, is for each man while he lives to 
show love and do good to others.</p><p>

<head>WHERE LOVE IS, GOD IS</head> 
<p>IN a certain town there lived a cobbler, Martin Avd&eacute;iteh by name. He had 
a tiny room in a basement, the one window of which looked out on to the street. 
Through it one could only see the feet of those who passed by, but Martin 
recognized the people by their boots. He had lived long in the place and had 
many acquaintances. There was hardly a pair of boots in the neighbourhood that 
had not been once or twice through his hands, so he often saw his own handiwork 
through the window. Some he had re-soled, some patched, some stitched up, and 
to some he had even put fresh uppers. He had plenty to do, for he worked well, 
used good material, did not charge too much, and could be relied on. If he 
could do a job by the day required, he undertook it; if not, he told the truth 
and gave no false promises; so he was well known and never short of work.</p><p> 
Martin had always been a good man; but in his old age he began to think more 
about his soul and to draw nearer to God. While he still worked for a master, 
before he set up on his own account, his wife had died, leaving him with a 
three-year old son. None of his elder children had lived, they had all died in 
infancy. At first Martin thought of sending his little son to his sister's in 
the country, but then he felt sorry to part with the boy, thinking: 'It would 
be hard for my little Kapit&oacute;n to have to grow up in a strange family; I 
will keep him with me.'</p><p> 
Martin left his master and went into lodgings with his little son. But he had 
no luck with his   <pb n="132"/>  children. No sooner had the boy reached an age when he could 
help his father and be a support as well as a joy to him, than he fell ill and, 
after being laid up for a week with a burning fever, died. Martin buried his 
son, and gave way to despair so great and overwhelming that he murmured against 
God. In his sorrow he prayed again and again that he too might die, reproaching 
God for having taken the son he loved, his only son while he, old as he was, 
remained alive. After that Martin left off going to church.</p><p> 
One day an old man from Martin's native village who had been a pilgrim for the 
last eight years, called in on his way from Tr&oacute;itsa Monastery. Martin 
opened his heart to him, and told him of his sorrow.</p><p> 
'I no longer even wish to live, holy man,' he said. 'All I ask of God is that I 
soon may die. I am now quite without hope in the world.'</p><p> 
The old man replied: 'You have no right to say such things, Martin. We cannot 
judge God's ways. Not our reasoning, but God's will, decides. If God willed 
that your son should die and you should live, it must be best so. As to your 
despair &mdash; that comes because you wish to live for your own happiness.'</p><p> 
'What else should one live for?' asked Martin.</p><p> 
'For God, Martin,' said the old man. 'He gives you life, and you must live for 
Him. When you have learnt to live for Him, you will grieve no more, and all 
will seem easy to you.'</p><p> 
Martin was silent awhile, and then asked: 'But how is one to live for God?'</p><p> 
The old man answered: 'How one may live for God has been shown us by Christ. 
Can you read? Then buy the Gospels, and read them: there you will see how God 
would have you live. You have it all there.'</p>   <pb n="133"/>  <p> 
These words sank deep into Martin's heart, and that same day he went and bought 
himself a Testament in large print, and began to read.</p><p> 
At first he meant only to read on holidays, but having once begun he found it 
made his heart so light that he read every day. Sometimes he was so absorbed in 
his reading that the oil in his lamp burnt out before he could tear himself 
away from the book. He continued to read every night, and the more he read the 
more clearly he understood what God required of him, and how he might live for 
God. And his heart grew lighter and lighter. Before, when he went to bed he 
used to lie with a heavy heart, moaning as he thought of his little 
Kapit&oacute;n; but now he only repeated again and again: 'Glory to Thee, glory 
to Thee, O Lord! Thy will be done!'</p><p> 
From that time Martin's whole life changed. Formerly, on holidays he used to go 
and have tea at the public house, and did not even refuse a glass or two of 
v&oacute;dka. Sometimes, after having had a drop with a friend, he left the 
public house not drunk, but rather merry, and would say foolish things: shout 
at a man, or abuse him. Now, all that sort of thing passed away from him. His 
life became peaceful and joyful. He sat down to his work in the morning, and 
when he had finished his day's work he took the lamp down from the wall, stood 
it on the table, fetched his book from the shelf, opened it, and sat down to 
read. The more he read the better he understood, and the clearer and happier he 
felt in his mind.</p><p> 
It happened once that Martin sat up late, absorbed in his book. He was reading 
Luke's Gospel; and in the sixth chapter he came upon the verses:</p><p> 
'To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and from him 
that taketh away thy   <pb n="134"/>  cloke withhold not thy coat also. Give to every man that 
asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again. And as 
ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.'</p><p> 
He also read the verses where our Lord says:</p><p> 
'And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? Whosoever 
cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom 
he is like: He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid 
the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently 
upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. But he 
that heareth and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an 
house upon the earth, against which the stream did beat vehemently, and 
immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.'</p><p> 
When Martin read these words his soul was glad within him. He took off his 
spectacles and laid them on the book, and leaning his elbows on the table 
pondered over what he had read. He tried his own life by the standard of those 
words, asking himself:</p><p> 
'Is my house built on the rock, or on sand? If it stands on the rock, it is 
well. It seems easy enough while one sits here alone, and one thinks one has 
done all that God commands; but as soon as I cease to be on my guard, I sin 
again. Still I will persevere. It brings such joy. Help me, O Lord!'</p><p> 
He thought all this, and was about to go to bed, but was loth to leave his 
book. So he went on reading the seventh chapter &mdash; about the centurion, the 
widow's son, and the answer to John's disciples &mdash; and he came to the part 
where a rich Pharisee invited the Lord to his house; and he read how the    <pb n="135"/>  woman 
who was a sinner, anointed his feet and washed them with her tears, and how he 
justified her. Coming to the forty-fourth verse, he read:</p><p> 
'And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered 
into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my 
feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair. Thou gavest me no kiss; but 
she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with 
oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.'</p><p> 
He read these verses and thought: 'He gave no water for his feet, gave no kiss, 
his head with oil he did not anoint. . . .' And Martin took off his spectacles 
once more, laid them on his book, and pondered.</p><p> 
'He must have been like me, that Pharisee. He too thought only of himself &mdash; 
how to get a cup of tea, how to keep warm and comfortable; never a thought of 
his guest. He took care of himself, but for his guest he cared nothing at all. 
Yet who was the guest? The Lord himself! If he came to me, should I behave like 
that?'</p><p> 
Then Martin laid his head upon both his arms and, before he was aware of it, he 
fell asleep.</p><p> 
'Martin!' he suddenly heard a voice, as if some one had breathed the word above 
his ear.</p><p> 
He started from his sleep. 'Who's there?' he asked.</p><p> 
He turned round and looked at the door; no one was there. He called again. Then 
he heard quite distinctly: 'Martin, Martin! Look out into the street to-morrow, 
for I shall come.'</p><p> 
Martin roused himself, rose from his chair and rubbed his eyes, but did not 
know whether he had heard these words in a dream or awake. He put out the lamp 
and lay down to sleep.</p>   <pb n="136"/>  <p> 
Next morning he rose before daylight, and after saying his prayers he lit the 
fire and prepared his cabbage soup and buckwheat porridge. Then he lit the 
samov&aacute;r, put on his apron, and sat down by the window to his work. As he 
sat working Martin thought over what had happened the night before. At times it 
seemed to him like a dream, and at times he thought that he had really heard 
the voice. 'Such things have happened before now,' thought he.</p><p> 
So he sat by the window, looking out into the street more than he worked, and 
whenever any one passed in unfamiliar boots he would stoop and look up, so as 
to see not the feet only but the face of the passer-by as well. A house-porter 
passed in new felt boots; then a water-carrier. Presently an old soldier of 
Nicholas' reign came near the window spade in hand. Martin knew him by his 
boots, which were shabby old felt ones, goloshed with leather. The old man was 
called Step&aacute;nitch: a neighbouring tradesman kept him in his house for 
charity, and his duty was to help the house-porter. He began to clear away the 
snow before Martin's window. Martin glanced at him and then went on with his 
work.</p><p> 
'I must be growing crazy with age,' said Martin, laughing at his fancy. 
'Step&aacute;nitch comes to clear away the snow, and I must needs imagine it's 
Christ coming to visit me. Old dotard that I am!'</p><p> 
Yet after he had made a dozen stitches he felt drawn to look out of the window 
again. He saw that Step&aacute;nitch had leaned his spade against the wall, and 
was either resting himself or trying to get warm. The man was old and broken 
down, and had evidently not enough strength even to clear away the snow.</p><p> 
'What if I called him in and gave him some tea?' thought Martin. 'The 
samov&aacute;r is just on the boil.'</p>   <pb n="137"/>  <p> 
He stuck his awl in its place, and rose; and putting the samov&aacute;r on the 
table, made tea. Then he tapped the window with his fingers. Step&aacute;nitch 
turned and came to the window. Martin beckoned to him to come in, and went 
himself to open the door.</p><p> 
'Come in,' he said, 'and warm yourself a bit. I'm sure you must be cold.'</p><p> 
'May God bless you!' Step&aacute;nitch answered. 'My bones do ache to be sure.' 
He came in, first shaking off the snow, and lest he should leave marks on the 
floor he began wiping his feet; but as he did so he tottered and nearly fell.</p><p> 
'Don't trouble to wipe your feet,' said Martin 'I'll wipe up the floor &mdash; it's 
all in the day's work. Come, friend, sit down and have some tea.'</p><p> 
Filling two tumblers, he passed one to his visitor, and pouring his own out 
into the saucer, began to blow on it.</p><p> 
Step&aacute;niteh emptied his glass, and, turning it upside down, put the 
remains of his piece of sugar on the top. He began to express his thanks, but 
it was plain that he would be glad of some more.</p><p> 
'Have another glass,' said Martin, refilling the visitor's tumbler and his own. 
But while he drank his tea Martin kept looking out into the street.</p><p> 
'Are you expecting any one?' asked the visitor.</p><p> 
'Am I expecting any one? Well, now, I'm ashamed to tell you. It isn't that I 
really expect any one; but I heard something last night which I can't get out 
of my mind Whether it was a vision, or only a fancy, I can't tell. You see, 
friend, last night I was reading the Gospel, about Christ the Lord, how he 
suffered, and how he walked on earth. You have heard tell of it, I dare say.'</p>   <pb n="138"/>  <p> 
'I have heard tell of it,' answered Step&aacute;nitch; 'but I'm an ignorant man 
and not able to read.'</p><p> 
'Well, you see, I was reading of how he walked on earth. I came to that part, 
you know, where he went to a Pharisee who did not receive him well. Well, 
friend, as I read about it, I thought now that man did not receive Christ the 
Lord with proper honour. Suppose such a thing could happen to such a man as 
myself, I thought, what would I not do to receive him! But that man gave him no 
reception at all. Well, friend, as I was thinking of this, I began to doze, and 
as I dozed I heard some one call me by name. I got up, and thought I heard some 
one whispering, "Expect me; I will come to-morrow." This happened twice over. 
And to tell you the truth, it sank so into my mind that, though I am ashamed of 
it myself, I keep on expecting him, the dear Lord!'</p><p> 
Step&aacute;nitch shook his head in silence, finished his tumbler and laid it 
on its side; but Martin stood it up again and refilled it for him.</p><p> 
'Here drink another glass, bless you! And I was thinking too, how he walked on 
earth and despised no one, but went mostly among common folk. He went with 
plain people, and chose his disciples from among the likes of us, from workmen 
like us, sinners that we are. "He who raises himself," he said, "shall be 
humbled and he who humbles himself shall be raised." "You call me Lord," he 
said, "and I will wash your feet." "He who would be first," he said, "let him 
be the servant of all; because," he said, "blessed are the poor, the humble, 
the meek, and the merciful."'</p><p> 
Step&aacute;nitch forgot his tea. He was an old man easily moved to tears, and 
as he sat and listened the tears ran down his cheeks.</p><p> 
'Come, drink some more,' said Martin. But   <pb n="139"/>  Step&aacute;nitch crossed himself, 
thanked him, moved away his tumbler, and rose.</p><p> 
'Thank you, Martin Avd&eacute;itch,' he said, 'you have given me food and 
comfort both for soul and body.'</p><p> 
'You're very welcome. Come again another time. I am glad to have a guest,' said 
Martin.</p><p> 
Step&aacute;nitch went away; and Martin poured out the last of the tea and 
drank it up. Then he put away the tea things and sat down to his work, 
stitching the back seam of a boot. And as he stitched he kept looking out of 
the window, waiting for Christ, and thinking about him and his doings. And his 
head was full of Christ's sayings.</p><p> 
Two soldiers went by: one in Government boots the other in boots of his own; 
then the master of a neighbouring house, in shining goloshes; then a baker 
carrying a basket. All these passed on. Then a woman came up in worsted 
stockings and peasant-made shoes. She passed the window, but stopped by the 
wall. Martin glanced up at her through the window, and saw that she was a 
stranger, poorly dressed, and with a baby in her arms. She stopped by the wall 
with her back to the wind, trying to wrap the baby up though she had hardly 
anything to wrap it in. The woman had only summer clothes on, and even they 
were shabby and worn. Through the window Martin heard the baby crying, and the 
woman trying to soothe it, but unable to do so. Martin rose and going out of 
the door and up the steps he called to her.</p><p> 
'My dear, I say, my dear!'</p><p> 
The woman heard, and turned round.</p><p> 
'Why do you stand out there with the baby in the cold? Come inside. You can 
wrap him up better in a warm place. Come this way!'</p><p> 
The woman was surprised to see an old man in    <pb n="140"/>  an apron, with spectacles on his 
nose, calling to her, but she followed him in.</p><p> 
They went down the steps, entered the little room, and the old man led her to 
the bed.</p><p> 
'There, sit down, my dear, near the stove. Warm yourself, and feed the baby.'</p><p> 
'Haven't any milk. I have eaten nothing myself since early morning,' said the 
woman, but still she took the baby to her breast.</p><p> 
Martin shook his head. He brought out a basin and some bread. Then he opened 
the oven door and poured some cabbage soup into the basin. He took out the 
porridge pot also but the porridge was not yet ready, so he spread a cloth on 
the table and served only the soup and bread.</p><p> 
'Sit down and eat, my dear, and I'll mind the baby. Why, bless me, I've had 
children of my own; I know how to manage them.'</p><p> 
The woman crossed herself, and sitting down at the table began to eat, while 
Martin put the baby on the bed and sat down by it. He chucked and chucked, but 
having no teeth he could not do it well and the baby continued to cry. Then 
Martin tried poking at him with his finger; he drove his finger straight at the 
baby's mouth and then quickly drew it back, and did this again and again. He 
did not let the baby take his finger in its mouth, because it was all black 
with cobbler's wax. But the baby first grew quiet watching the finger, and then 
began to laugh. And Martin felt quite pleased.</p><p> 
The woman sat eating and talking, and told him who she was, and where she had 
been.</p><p> 
'I'm a soldier's wife,' said she. 'They sent my husband somewhere, far away, 
eight months ago, and I have heard nothing of him since. I had a place as cook 
till my baby was born, but then they would not keep me with a child. For three 
months    <pb n="141"/>  now I have been struggling, unable to find a place, and I've had to sell 
all I had for food. I tried to go as a wet-nurse, but no one would have me; 
they said I was too starved-looking and thin. Now I have just been to see a 
tradesman's wife (a woman from our village is in service with her) and she has 
promised to take me. I thought it was all settled at last, but she tells me not 
to come till next week. It is far to her place, and I am fagged out, and baby 
is quite starved, poor mite. Fortunately our landlady has pity on us, and lets 
us lodge free, else I don't know what we should do.'</p><p> 
Martin sighed. 'Haven't you any warmer clothing?' he asked.</p><p> 
'How could I get warm clothing?' said she. 'Why I pawned my last shawl for 
sixpence yesterday.'</p><p> 
Then the woman came and took the child, and Martin got up. He went and looked 
among some things that were hanging on the wall, and brought back an old 
cloak.</p><p> 
'Here,' he said, 'though it's a worn-out old thing, it will do to wrap him up 
in.'</p><p> 
The woman looked at the cloak, then at the old man, and taking it, burst into 
tears. Martin turned away, and groping under the bed brought out a small trunk. 
He fumbled about in it, and again sat down opposite the woman. And the woman 
said:</p><p> 
'The Lord bless you, friend. Surely Christ must have sent me to your window, 
else the child would have frozen. It was mild when I started, but now see how 
cold it has turned. Surely it must have been Christ who made you look out of 
your window and take pity on me, poor wretch!'</p><p> 
Martin smiled and said; 'It is quite true; it was he made me do it. It was no 
mere chance made me look out.'</p><p> 
And he told the woman his dream, and how he    <pb n="142"/>  had heard the Lord's voice 
promising to visit him that day.</p><p> 
'Who knows? All things are possible,' said the woman. And she got up and threw 
the cloak over her shoulders, wrapping it round herself and round the baby. 
Then she bowed, and thanked Martin once more.</p><p> 
'Take this for Christ's sake,' said Martin, and gave her sixpence to get her 
shawl out of pawn. The woman crossed herself, and Martin did the same, and then 
he saw her out.</p><p> 
After the woman had gone, Martin ate some cabbage soup, cleared the things 
away, and sat down to work again. He sat and worked, but did not forget the 
window, and every time a shadow fell on it he looked up at once to see who was 
passing. People he knew and strangers passed by, but no one remarkable.</p><p> 
After a while Martin saw an apple-woman stop just in front of his window. She 
had a large basket, but there did not seem to be many apples left in it; she 
had evidently sold most of her stock. On her back she had a sack full of chips, 
which she was taking home. No doubt she had gathered them at some place where 
building was going on. The sack evidently hurt her, and she wanted to shift it 
from one shoulder to the other, so she put it down on the footpath and, placing 
her basket on a post, began to shake down the chips in the sack. While she was 
doing this a boy in a tattered cap ran up, snatched an apple out of the basket, 
and tried to slip away; but the old woman noticed it, and turning, caught the 
boy by his sleeve. He began to struggle, trying to free himself, but the old 
woman held on with both hands, knocked his cap off his head, and seized hold of 
his hair. The boy screamed and the old woman scolded. Martin dropped his   <pb n="143"/>   awl, 
not waiting to stick it in its place, and rushed out of the door. Stumbling up 
the steps, and dropping his spectacles in his hurry, he ran out into the 
street. The old woman was pulling the boy's hair and scolding him, and 
threatening to take him to the police. The lad was struggling and protesting, 
saying, 'I did not take it. What are you beating me for? Let me go!'</p><p> 
Martin separated them. He took the boy by the hand and said, 'Let him go, 
Granny. Forgive him for Christ's sake.'</p><p> 
'I'll pay him out, so that he won't forget it for a year! I'll take the rascal 
to the police!'</p><p> 
Martin began entreating the old woman.</p><p> 
'Let him go, Granny. He won't do it again. Let him go for Christ's sake!'</p><p> 
The old woman let go, and the boy wished to run away, but Martin stopped him</p><p> 
'Ask the Granny's forgiveness!' said he. 'And don't do it another time. I saw 
you take the apple.'</p><p> 
The boy began to cry and to beg pardon.</p><p> 
'That's right. And now here's an apple for you, and Martin took an apple from 
the basket and gave it to the boy, saying, 'I will pay you, Granny.'</p><p> 
'You will spoil them that way, the young rascals,' said the old woman. 'He 
ought to be whipped so that he should remember it for a week.'</p><p> 
'Oh, Granny, Granny,' said Martin, 'that's our way  &mdash; but it's not God's way. 
If he should be whipped for stealing an apple, what should be done to us for 
our sins?'</p><p> 
The old woman was silent.</p><p> 
And Martin told her the parable of the lord who forgave his servant a large 
debt, and how the servant went out and seized his debtor by the throat. The old 
woman listened to it all, and the boy, too, stood by and listened.</p>   <pb n="144"/>  <p> 
'God bids us forgive,' said Martin, 'or else we shall not be forgiven. Forgive 
every one; and a thoughtless youngster most of all.'</p><p> 
The old woman wagged her head and sighed.</p><p> 
'It's true enough,' said she, 'but they are getting terribly spoilt.'</p><p> 
'Then we old ones must show them better ways,' Martin replied.</p><p> 
'That's just what I say,' said the old woman. 'I have had seven of them myself, 
and only one daughter is left.' And the old woman began to tell how and where 
she was living with her daughter, and how many grandchildren she had. 'There 
now,' she said, 'I have but little strength left, yet I work hard for the sake 
of my grandchildren; and nice children they are, too. No one comes out to meet 
me but the children. Little Annie, now, won't leave me for any one. "It's 
grandmother, dear grandmother, darling grandmother."' And the old woman 
completely softened at the thought.</p><p> 
'Of course, it was only his childishness, God help him,' said she, referring to 
the boy.</p><p> 
As the old woman was about to hoist her sack on her back, the lad sprang 
forward to her, saying, 'Let me carry it for you, Granny. I'm going that 
way.'</p><p> 
The old woman nodded her head, and put the sack on the boy's back, and they 
went down the street together, the old woman quite forgetting to ask Martin to 
pay for the apple. Martin stood and watched them as they went along talking to 
each other.</p><p> 
When they were out of sight Martin went back to the house. Having found his 
spectacles unbroken on the steps, he picked up his awl and sat down again to 
work. He worked a little, but could soon not see to pass the bristle through 
the holes    <pb n="145"/>  in the leather; and presently he noticed the lamplighter passing on 
his way to light the street lamps.</p><p> 
'Seems it's time to light up,' thought he. So he trimmed his lamp, hung it up, 
and sat down again to work. He finished off one boot and, turning it about, 
examined it. It was all right. Then he gathered his tools together, swept up 
the cuttings, put away the bristles and the thread and the awls, and, taking 
down the lamp, placed it on the table. Then he took the Gospels from the shelf. 
He meant to open them at the place he had marked the day before with a bit of 
morocco, but the book opened at another place. As Martin opened it, his 
yesterday's dream came back to his mind, and no sooner had he thought of it 
than he seemed to hear footsteps, as though some one were moving behind him. 
Martin turned round, and it seemed to him as if people were standing in the 
dark corner, but he could not make out who they were. And a voice whispered in 
his ear: 'Martin, Martin, don't you know me?'</p><p> 
'Who is it?' muttered Martin.</p><p> 
'It is I,' said the voice. And out of the dark corner stepped 
Step&aacute;nitch, who smiled and vanishing like a cloud was seen no more.</p><p> 
'It is I,' said the voice again. And out of the darkness stepped the woman with 
the baby in her arms and the woman smiled and the baby laughed, and they too 
vanished.</p><p> 
'It is I,' said the voice once more. And the old woman and the boy with the 
apple stepped out and both smiled, and then they too vanished.</p><p> 
And Martin's soul grew glad. He crossed himself put on his spectacles, and 
began reading the Gospel just where it had opened; and at the top of the page 
he read</p><p> 
'I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was   <pb n="146"/>  thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I 
was a stranger, and ye took me in.'</p><p> 
And at the bottom of the page he read </p><p> 
'Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren even these least, ye did 
it unto me' (<hi rend="italic">Matt</hi>. xxv).</p><p> 
And Martin understood that his dream had come true; and that the Saviour had 
really come to him that day, and he had welcomed him.</p><p>

<head>THE STORY OF IV&Aacute;N THE FOOL,
<lb/> AND OF HIS TWO BROTHERS, SIMON THE SOLDIER<lb/>  AND TAR&Aacute;S THE STOUT; AND OF 
HIS DUMB SISTER<lb/>  MARTHA, AND OF THE OLD DEVIL AND THE THREE<lb/> LITTLE IMPS.</head> 
<div3 type="section" n="1" id="d48"> 
<head>I</head><p> 
ONCE upon a time, in a certain province of a certain country, there lived a 
rich peasant, who had three sons: Simon the Soldier, Tar&aacute;s the Stout, 
and Iv&aacute;n the Fool, besides an unmarried daughter, Martha, who was deaf 
and dumb. Simon the Soldier went to the wars to serve the king; Tar&aacute;s 
the Stout went to a merchant's in town to trade, and Iv&aacute;n the Fool 
stayed at home with the lass, to till the ground till his back bent.</p><p> 
Simon the Soldier obtained high rank and an estate, and married a nobleman's 
daughter. His pay was large and his estate was large, but yet he could not make 
ends meet. What the husband earned his lady wife squandered, and they never had 
money enough.</p><p> 
So Simon the Soldier went to his estate to collect the income, but his steward 
said, 'where is any income to come from? We have neither cattle, nor tools, nor 
horse, nor plough, nor harrow. We must first get all these, and then the money 
will come.'</p><p> 
Then Simon the Soldier went to his father and said: 'You, father, are rich, but 
have given me    <pb n="148"/>  nothing. Divide what you have, and give me a third part, that I 
may improve my estate.'</p><p> 
But the old man said: 'You brought nothing into my house; why should I give you 
a third part? It would be unfair to Iv&aacute;n and to the girl.'</p><p> 
But Simon answered, 'He is a fool; and she is an old maid, and deaf and dumb 
besides; what's the good of property to them?'</p><p> 
The old man said, 'We will see what Iv&aacute;n says about it.'</p><p> 
And Iv&aacute;n said, 'Let him take what he wants.'</p><p> 
So Simon the Soldier took his share of his father's goods and removed them to 
his estate, and went off again to serve the king.</p><p> 
Tar&aacute;s the Stout also gathered much money, and married into a merchant's 
family, but still he wanted more. So he, also, came to his father and said, 
'Give me my portion.'</p><p> 
But the old man did not wish to give Tar&aacute;s a share either, and said, 
'You brought nothing here. Iv&aacute;n has earned all we have in the house, and 
why should we wrong him and the girl?'</p><p> 
But Tar&aacute;s said, 'What does he need? He is a fool! He cannot marry, no 
one would have him; and the dumb lass does not need anything either. Look here, 
Iv&aacute;n!' said he, 'give me half the corn; I don't want the tools, and of 
the live stock I will take only the grey stallion, which is of no use to you 
for the plough.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n laughed and said, 'Take what you want. I will work to earn some 
more.'</p><p> 
So they gave a share to Tar&aacute;s also, and he carted the corn away to town, 
and took the grey stallion. And Iv&aacute;n was left with one old mare, to lead 
his peasant life as before, and to support his father and mother.</p>

II</head><p> 
Now the old Devil was vexed that the brothers had not quarrelled over the 
division, but had parted peacefully; and he summoned three imps.</p><p> 
'Look here,' said he, 'there are three brothers Simon the Soldier, Tar&aacute;s 
the Stout, and Iv&aacute;n the Fool. They should have quarrelled, but are 
living peaceably and meet on friendly terms. The fool Iv&aacute;n has spoilt 
the whole business for me. Now you three go and tackle those three brothers, 
and worry them till they scratch each other's eyes out! Do you think you can do 
it?'</p><p> 
'Yes, we'll do it,' said they.</p><p> 
'How will you set about it?'</p><p> 
'Why,' said they, 'first we'll ruin them. And when they haven't a crust to eat 
we'll tie them up together, and then they'll fight each other, sure enough!'</p><p> 
'That's capital; I see you understand your business. Go, and don't come back 
till you've set them by the ears, or I'll skin you alive!'</p><p> 
The imps went off into a swamp, and began to consider how they should set to 
work. They disputed and disputed, each wanting the lightest job; but at last 
they decided to cast lots which of the brothers each imp should tackle. If one 
imp finished his task before the others, he was to come and help them. So the 
imps cast lots, and appointed a time to meet again in the swamp to learn who 
had succeeded and who needed help.</p><p> 
The appointed time came round, and the imps met again in the swamp as agreed. 
And each began to tell how matters stood. The first, who had undertaken Simon 
the Soldier, began: 'My business is going on well. To-morrow Simon will return 
to his father's house.'</p>   <pb n="150"/>  <p> 
His comrades asked, 'How did you manage it?'</p><p> 
'First,' says he, 'I made Simon so bold that he offered to conquer the whole 
world for his king; and the king made him his general and sent him to fight the 
King of India. They met for battle, but the night before, I damped all the 
powder in Simon's camp, and made more straw soldiers for the Indian King than 
you could count. And when Simon's soldiers saw the straw soldiers surrounding 
them, they grew frightened. Simon ordered them to fire; but their cannons and 
guns would not go off. Then Simon's soldiers were quite frightened, and ran 
like sheep, and the Indian King slaughtered them. Simon was disgraced. He has 
been deprived of his estate, and to-morrow they intend to execute him. There is 
only one day's work left for me to do; I have just to let him out of prison 
that he may escape home. To-morrow I shall be ready to help whichever of you 
needs me.</p><p> 
Then the second imp, who had Tar&aacute;s in hand, began to tell how he had 
fared. 'I don't want any help,' said he, 'my job is going all right. 
Tar&aacute;s can't hold out for more than a week. First I caused him to grow 
greedy and fat. His covetousness became so great that whatever he saw he wanted 
to buy. He has spent all his money in buying immense lots of goods, and still 
continues to buy. Already he has begun to use borrowed money. His debts hang 
like a weight round his neck, and he is so involved that he can never get 
clear. In a week his bills come due, and before then I will spoil all his 
stock. He will be unable to pay and will have to go home to his father.'</p><p> 
Then they asked the third imp (Ivan's), 'And how are you getting on?'</p><p> 
'Well,' said he, 'my affair goes badly. First I spat into his drink to make his 
stomach ache, and    <pb n="151"/>  then I went into his field and hammered the ground hard as a 
stone that he should not be able to till it. I thought he wouldn't plough it, 
but like the fool that he is, he came with his plough and began to make a 
furrow. He groaned with the pain in his stomach, but went on ploughing. I broke 
his plough for him, but he went home, got out another, and again started 
ploughing. I crept under the earth and caught hold of the ploughshares, but 
there was no holding them; he leant heavily upon the plough, and the 
ploughshare was sharp and cut my hands. He has all but finished ploughing the 
field, only one little strip is left. Come brothers, and help me; for if we 
don't get the better of him, all our labour is lost. If the fool holds out and 
keeps on working the land, his brothers will never know want, for he will feed 
them both.'</p><p> 
Simon the Soldier's imp promised to come next day to help, and so they 
parted.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="3" id="d50"> 
<head> 
III</head><p> 
Iv&aacute;n had ploughed up the whole fallow, all but one little strip. He came 
to finish it. Though his stomach ached, the ploughing must be done. He freed 
the harness ropes, turned the plough, and began to work. He drove one furrow, 
but coming back the plough began to drag as if it had caught in a root. It was 
the imp, who had twisted his legs round the ploughshare and was holding it 
back.</p><p> 
'What a strange thing!' thought Iv&aacute;n. 'There were no roots here at all, 
and yet here's a root.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n pushed his hand deep into the furrow, groped about, and, feeling 
something soft, seized hold of it and pulled it out. It was black like a root, 
but it wriggled. Why, it was a live imp!</p><p> 
'What a nasty thing!' said Iv&aacute;n, and he lifted   <pb n="152"/>  his hand to dash it 
against the plough, but the imp squealed out:</p><p> 
'Don't hurt me, and I'll do anything you tell me to.'</p><p> 
'What can you do?'</p><p> 
'Anything you tell me to.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n scratched his head.</p><p> 
'My stomach aches,' said he; 'can you cure that?'</p><p> 
'Certainly I can.'</p><p> 
'Well then, do so.'</p><p> 
The imp went down into the furrow, searched about scratched with his claws, and 
pulled out a bunch of three little roots, which he handed to Iv&aacute;n.</p><p> 
'Here,' says he, 'whoever swallows one of these will be cured of any 
illness.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n took the roots, separated them, and swallowed one. The pain in his 
stomach was cured at once. The imp again begged to be let off; 'I will jump 
right into the earth, and never come back,' said he.</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n; 'begone, and God be with you!'</p><p> 
And as soon as Iv&aacute;n mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth like a 
stone thrown into the water. Only a hole was left.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n put the other two pieces of root into his cap and went on with his 
ploughing. He ploughed the strip to the end, turned his plough over, and went 
home. He unharnessed the horse, entered the hut, and there he saw his elder 
brother, Simon the Soldier and his wife, sitting at supper. Simon's estate had 
been confiscated, he himself had barely managed to escape from prison, and he 
had come back to live in his father's house.</p><p> 
Simon saw Iv&aacute;n, and said: 'I have come to live with you. Feed me and my 
wife till I get another appointment.'</p>   <pb n="153"/>  <p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'you can stay with us.'</p><p> 
But when Iv&aacute;n was about to sit down on the bench the lady disliked the 
smell, and said to her husband. 'I cannot sup with a dirty peasant.'</p><p> 
So Simon the Soldier said, 'My lady says you don't smell nice. You'd better go 
and eat outside.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n; 'any way I must spend the night outside, for I 
have to pasture the mare.'</p><p> 
So he took some bread, and his coat, and went with the mare into the fields.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="4" id="d51"> 
<head> 
IV</head> 
<p> 
Having finished his work that night, Simon's imp came, as agreed, to find 
Iv&aacute;n's imp and help him to subdue the fool. He came to the field and 
searched and searched; but instead of his comrade he found only a hole.</p><p> 
'Clearly,' thought he, 'some evil has befallen my comrade. I must take his 
place. The field is ploughed up, so the fool must be tackled in the meadow.'</p><p> 
So the imp went to the meadows and flooded Iv&aacute;n's hayfield with water, 
which left the grass all covered with mud.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n returned from the pasture at dawn, sharpened his scythe, and went 
to mow the hayfield. He began to mow but had only swung the scythe once or 
twice when the edge turned so that it would not cut at all, but needed 
resharpening. Iv&aacute;n struggled on for awhile, and then said: 'It's no 
good. I must go home and bring a tool to straighten the scythe, and I'll get a 
chunk of bread at the same time. If I have to spend a week here, I won't leave 
till the mowing's done.'</p><p> 
The imp heard this and thought to himself, 'This fool is a tough 'un; I can't 
get round him this way. I must try some other dodge.'</p>   <pb n="154"/>  <p> 
Iv&aacute;n returned, sharpened his scythe, and began to mow. The imp crept 
into the grass and began to catch the scythe by the heel, sending the point 
into the earth. Iv&aacute;n found the work very hard, but he mowed the whole 
meadow, except one little bit which was in the swamp. The imp crept into the 
swamp and, thought he to himself, 'Though I cut my paws I will not let him 
mow.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n reached the swamp. The grass didn't seem thick, but yet it resisted 
the scythe. Iv&aacute;n grew angry and began to swing the scythe with all his 
might. The imp had to give in; he could not keep up with the scythe, and, 
seeing it was a bad business, he scrambled into a bush. Iv&aacute;n swung the 
scythe, caught the bush, and cut off half the imp's tail. Then he finished 
mowing the grass, told his sister to rake it up, and went himself to mow the 
rye. He went with the scythe, but the dock-tailed imp was there first, and 
entangled the rye so that the scythe was of no use. But Iv&aacute;n went home 
and got his sickle, and began to reap with that and he reaped the whole of the 
rye.</p><p> 
'Now it's time,' said he, 'to start on the oats.'</p><p> 
The dock-tailed imp heard this, and thought, 'I couldn't get the better of him 
on the rye, but I shall on the oats. Only wait till the morning.'</p><p> 
In the morning the imp hurried to the oat field, but the oats were already 
mowed down! Iv&aacute;n had mowed them by night, in order that less grain 
should shake out. The imp grew angry.</p><p> 
'He has cut me all over and tired me out &mdash; the fool. It is worse than war. The 
accursed fool never sleeps; one can't keep up with him. I will get into his 
stacks now and rot them.'</p><p> 
So the imp entered the rye, and crept among the sheaves, and they began to rot. 
He heated them, grew warm himself, and fell asleep.</p>   <pb n="155"/>  <p> 
Iv&aacute;n harnessed the mare, and went with the lass to cart the rye. He came 
to the heaps, and began to pitch the rye into the cart. He tossed two sheaves 
and again thrust his fork &mdash; right into the imp's back. He lifts the fork and 
sees on the prongs a live imp; dock-tailed, struggling, wriggling, and trying 
to jump.</p><p> 
'What, you nasty thing, are you here again?'</p><p> 
'I'm another,' said the imp. 'The first was my brother. I've been with your 
brother Simon.'</p><p> 
'Well,' said Iv&aacute;n, whoever you are, you've met the same fate!'</p><p> 
He was about to dash him against the cart, but the imp cried out: 'Let me off, 
and I will not only let you alone, but I'll do anything you tell me to do.'</p><p> 
'What can you do?'</p><p> 
'I can make soldiers out of anything you like.' </p><p> 
'But what use are they?'</p><p> 
'You can turn them to any use; they can do anything you please.'</p><p> 
'Can they sing?'</p><p> 
'Yes, if you want them to.'</p><p> 
'All right; you may make me some.'</p><p> 
And the imp said, 'Here, take a sheaf of rye, then bump it upright on the 
ground, and simply say:</p> 
<q ><lg type="poem"> 
<l>"O sheaf! my slave</l> 
<l>This order gave:</l> 
<l>Where a straw has</l> 
<l>been Let a soldier be seen!'"</l> 
</lg></q> 
<p>Iv&aacute;n took the sheaf, struck it on the ground, and 
said what the imp had told him to. The sheaf fell asunder, and all the straws 
changed into soldiers, with a trumpeter and a drummer playing in front, so that 
there was a whole regiment.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n laughed.</p><p> 
'How clever!' said he. 'This is fine! How pleased the girls will be!'</p>   <pb n="156"/>  <p> 
'Now let me go,' said the imp.</p><p> 
'No,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'I must make my soldiers of thrashed straw, otherwise 
good grain will be wasted. Teach me how to change them back again into the 
sheaf. I want to thrash it.'</p><p> 
And the imp said, 'Repeat:</p> 
<q><lg type="poem"> 
<l>'Let each be a straw</l> 
<l>Who was soldier before,</l> 
<l>For my true slave</l> 
<l>This order gave!"'</l> 
</lg></q> 
<p>Iv&aacute;n said this, and the sheaf reappeared.</p><p> 
Again the imp began to beg, 'Now let me go!</p><p> 
'All right.' And Iv&aacute;n pressed him against the side of the cart, held him 
down with his hand, and pulled him off the fork.</p><p> 
'God be with you,' said he.</p><p> 
And as soon as he mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth like a stone 
into water. Only a hole was left.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n returned home, and there was his other brother, Tar&aacute;s with 
his wife, sitting at supper.</p><p> 
Taras the Stout had failed to pay his debts, had run away from his creditors, 
and had come home to his father's house. When he saw Iv&aacute;n, 'Look here', 
said he, 'till I can start in business again, I want you to keep me and my 
wife.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'you can live here, if you like.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n took off his coat and sat down to table, but the merchant's wife 
said: 'I cannot sit at table with this clown, he smells of perspiration.'</p><p> 
Then Tar&aacute;s the Stout said, 'Iv&aacute;n, you smell too strong. Go and 
eat outside.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, taking some bread and going into the yard. 'It 
is time, anyhow, for me to go and pasture the mare.'</p> 
</div3>   <pb n="157"/>  <div3 type="section" n="5" id="d52"> 
<head> 
V</head> 
<p> 
Tar&aacute;s's imp, being also free that night, came, as agreed, to help his 
comrades subdue Iv&aacute;n the Fool. He came to the cornfield, looked and 
looked for his comrades &mdash; no one was there. He only found a hole. He went to 
the meadow, and there he found an imp's tail in the swamp, and another hole in 
the rye stubble.</p><p> 
'Evidently, some ill-luck has befallen my comrades,' thought he. 'I must take 
their place and tackle the fool.'</p><p> 
So the imp went to look for Iv&aacute;n, who had already stacked the corn and 
was cutting trees in the wood. The two brothers had begun to feel crowded, 
living together, and had told Iv&aacute;n to cut down trees to build new houses 
for them.</p><p> 
The imp ran to the wood, climbed among the branches, and began to hinder 
Iv&aacute;n from felling the trees. Iv&aacute;n undercut one tree so that it 
should fall clear, but in falling it turned askew and caught among some 
branches. Iv&aacute;n cut a pole with which to lever it aside, and with 
difficulty contrived to bring it to the ground. He set to work to fell another 
tree &mdash; again the same thing occurred; and with all his efforts he could hardly 
get the tree clear. He began on a third tree, and again the same thing 
happened.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n had hoped to cut down half a hundred small trees, but had not 
felled even half a score, and now the night was come and he was tired out. The 
steam from him spread like a mist through the wood, but still he stuck to his 
work. He undercut another tree, but his back began to ache so that he could not 
stand. He drove his axe into the tree and sat down to rest.</p><p> 
The imp, noticing that Iv&aacute;n had stopped work, grew cheerful.</p>   <pb n="158"/>  <p> 
'At last,' thought he, 'he is tired out! He will give it up. Now I can take a 
rest myself.'</p><p> 
He seated himself astride a branch and chuckled. But soon Iv&aacute;n got up, 
pulled the axe out, swung it and smote the tree from the opposite side with 
such force that the tree gave way at once and came crashing down. The imp had 
not expected this, and had no time to get his feet clear, and the tree in 
breaking, gripped his paw. Iv&aacute;n began to lop off the branches, when he 
noticed a live imp hanging in the tree! Iv&aacute;n was surprised.</p><p> 
'What, you nasty thing,' says he, 'so you are here again!'</p><p> 
'I am another one,' says the imp. 'I have been with your brother 
Tar&aacute;s.'</p><p> 
'Whoever you are you have met your fate,' said Iv&aacute;n, and swinging his 
axe he was about to strike him with the haft, but the imp begged for mercy: 
'Don't strike me,' said he, 'and I will do anything you tell me to.'</p><p> 
'What can you do?'</p><p> 
'I can make money for you, as much as you want.'</p><p> 
'All right, make some.' So the imp showed him how to do it.</p><p> 
'Take,' said he, 'some leaves from this oak and rub them in your hands, and 
gold will fall out on the ground.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n took some leaves and rubbed them, and gold ran down from his 
hands.</p><p> 
'This stuff will do fine,' said he, 'for the fellows to play with on their 
holidays.'</p><p> 
'Now let me go.' said the imp.</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, and taking a lever he set the imp free. 'Now 
begone! And God be with you,' says he.</p><p> 
And as soon as he mentioned God, the imp plunged into the earth, like a stone 
into water. Only a hole was left.</p> 
</div3>   <pb n="159"/>  <div3 type="section" n="6" id="d53"> 
<head> 
VI</head> 
<p> 
So the brothers built houses, and began to live apart; and Iv&aacute;n finished 
the harvest work, brewed beer, and invited his brothers to spend the next 
holiday with him. His brothers would not come.</p><p> 
'We don't care about peasant feasts,' said they.</p><p> 
So Iv&aacute;n entertained the peasants and their wives, and drank until he was 
rather tipsy. Then he went into the street to a ring of dancers; and going up 
to them he told the women to sing a song in his honour; 'for,' said he, 'I will 
give you something you never saw in your lives before!'</p><p> 
The women laughed and sang his praises, and when they had finished they said, 
'Now let us have your gift.'</p><p> 
'I will bring it directly,' said he.</p><p> 
He took a seed-basket and ran into the woods. The women laughed. 'He is a 
fool!' said they, and they began to talk of something else.</p><p> 
But soon Iv&aacute;n came running back, carrying the basket full of something 
heavy.</p><p> 
'Shall I give it you?'</p><p> 
'Yes! give it to us.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n took a handful of gold and threw it to the women. You should have 
seen them throw themselves upon it to pick it up! And the men around scrambled 
for it, and snatched it from one another. One old woman was nearly crushed to 
death. Iv&aacute;n laughed.</p><p> 
'Oh, you fools!' says he. 'Why did you crush the old grandmother? Be quiet, and 
I will give you some more,' and he threw them some more. The people all crowded 
round, and Iv&aacute;n threw them all the gold he had. They asked for more, but 
Iv&aacute;n said,   <pb n="160"/>   'I have no more just now. Another time I'll give you some 
more. Now let us dance, and you can sing me your songs.'</p><p> 
The women began to sing.</p><p> 
'Your songs are no good,' says he.</p><p> 
'Where will you find better ones?' say they.</p><p> 
'I'll soon show you,' says he.</p><p> 
He went to the barn, took a sheaf, thrashed it, stood it up, and bumped it on 
the ground.</p><p> 
'Now,' said he:</p> 
<q ><lg type="poem"> 
<l>'O sheaf! my slave</l> 
<l>This order gave:</l> 
<l>Where a straw has been</l> 
<l>Let a soldier be seen!'</l> 
</lg></q> 
<p>And the sheaf fell asunder and became so many soldiers. The 
drums and trumpets began to play. Iv&aacute;n ordered the soldiers to play and 
sing. He led them out into the street, and the people were amazed, The soldiers 
played and sang, and then Iv&aacute;n (forbidding any one to follow him) led 
them back to the thrashing ground, changed them into a sheaf again, and threw 
it in its place.</p><p> 
He then went home and lay down in the stables to sleep.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="7" id="d54"> 
<head>VII</head> 
<p>Simon the Soldier heard of all these things next morning, and went to his 
brother.</p><p> 
'Tell me,' says he, 'where you got those soldiers from, and where you have 
taken them to?'</p><p> 
'What does it matter to you?' said Iv&aacute;n.</p><p> 
'What does it matter? Why, with soldiers one can do anything. One can win a 
kingdom.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n wondered.</p><p> 
'Really!' said he; 'Why didn't you say so before? I'll make you as many as you 
like. It's well the lass and I have thrashed so much straw.'</p>   <pb n="161"/>  <p> 
Iv&aacute;n took his brother to the barn and said:</p><p> 
'Look here; if I make you some soldiers, you must take them away at once, for 
if we have to feed them, they will eat up the whole village in a day.'</p><p> 
Simon the Soldier promised to lead the soldiers away; and Iv&aacute;n began to 
make them. He bumped a sheaf on the thrashing floor &mdash; a company appeared. He 
bumped another sheaf, and there was a second company. He made so many that they 
covered the field.</p><p> 
'Will that do?' he asked.</p><p> 
Simon was overjoyed, and said: 'That will do! Thank you, Iv&aacute;n!'</p><p> 
'All right' said Iv&aacute;n. 'If you want more, come back, and I'll make them. 
There is plenty of straw this season.'</p><p> 
Simon the Soldier at once took command of his army, collected and organized it, 
and went off to make war.</p><p> 
Hardly had Simon the Soldier gone, when Tar&aacute;s the Stout came along. He, 
too, had heard of yesterday's affair, and he said to his brother:</p><p> 
'Show me where you get gold money! If I only had some to start with, I could 
make it bring me in money from all over the world.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n was astonished.</p><p> 
'Really!' said he. 'You should have told me sooner. I will make you as much as 
you like.'</p><p> 
His brother was delighted.</p><p> 
'Give me three baskets-full to begin with.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n. 'Come into the forest; or better still, let us 
harness the mare, for you won't be able to carry it all.'</p><p> 
They drove to the forest, and Iv&aacute;n began to rub the oak leaves. He made 
a great heap of gold.</p><p> 
'Will that do?'</p><p> 
Tar&aacute;s was overjoyed.</p>   <pb n="162"/>  <p> 
'It will do for the present,' said he. 'Thank you, Iv&aacute;n!'</p><p> 
'All right,' says Iv&aacute;n, 'if you want more, come back for it. There are 
plenty of leaves left.'</p><p> 
Tar&aacute;s the Stout gathered up a whole cartload of money, and went off to 
trade.</p><p> 
So the two brothers went away: Simon to fight and Tar&aacute;s to buy and sell. 
And Simon the Soldier conquered a kingdom for himself; and Tar&aacute;s the 
Stout made much money in trade.</p><p> 
When the two brothers met, each told the other: Simon how he got the soldiers, 
and Tar&aacute;s how he got the money. And Simon the Soldier said to his 
brother, I have conquered a kingdom and live in grand style but I have not 
money enough to keep my soldiers.'</p><p> 
And Tar&aacute;s the Stout said, 'And I have made much money, but the trouble 
is, I have no one to guard it.'</p><p> 
Then said Simon the Soldier, 'Let us go to our brother. I will tell him to make 
more soldiers, and will give them to you to guard your money, and you can tell 
him to make money for me to feed my men.</p><p> 
And they drove away to Iv&aacute;n; and Simon said, 'Dear brother, I have not 
enough soldiers; make me another couple of ricks or so.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n shook his head.</p><p> 
'No!' says he' 'I will not make any more soldiers.'</p><p> 
'But you promised you would.'</p><p> 
'I know I promised, but I won't make any more.'</p><p> 
'But why not, fool?'</p><p> 
'Because your soldiers killed a man. I was ploughing the other day near the 
road, and I saw a woman taking a coffin along in a cart, and crying. I asked 
her who was dead. She said, "Simon's soldiers have killed my husband in the 
war." I thought the soldiers would only play tunes, but they have killed a man. 
I won't give you any more.'</p>   <pb n="163"/>  <p> 
And he stuck to it, and would not make any more soldiers.</p><p> 
Tar&aacute;s the Stout, too, began to beg Iv&aacute;n to make him more gold 
money. But Iv&aacute;n shook his head.</p><p> 
'No, I won't make any more,' said he.</p><p> 
'Didn't you promise?'</p><p> 
'I did, but I'll make no more,' said he.</p><p> 
'Why not, fool?'</p><p> 
'Because your gold coins took away the cow from Michael's daughter.'</p><p> 
'How?'</p><p> 
'Simply took it away! Michael's daughter had a cow. Her children used to drink 
the milk. But the other day her children came to me to ask for milk. I said, 
"Where's your cow?" They answered, "The steward of Tar&aacute;s the Stout came 
and gave mother three bits of gold, and she gave him the cow, so we have 
nothing to drink." I thought you were only going to play with the gold pieces, 
but you have taken the children's cow away. I will not give you any more.'</p><p> 
And Iv&aacute;n stuck to it and would not give him any more. So the brothers 
went away. And as they went they discussed how they could meet their 
difficulties. And Simon said:</p><p> 
'Look here, I tell you what to do. You give me money to feed my soldiers, and I 
will give you half my kingdom with soldiers enough to guard your money.' 
Tar&aacute;s agreed. So the brothers divided what they possessed, and both 
became kings, and both were rich.</p>

VIII</head> 
<p>Iv&aacute;n lived at home, supporting his father and mother and working in the 
fields with his dumb sister. Now it happened that Iv&aacute;n's yard-dog fell 
sick, grew mangy, and was near dying. Iv&aacute;n, pitying it, got some bread 
from his sister, put it in his cap,    <pb n="164"/>  carried it out, and threw it to the dog. 
But the cap was torn, and together with the bread one of the little roots fell 
to the ground. The old dog ate it up with the bread, and as soon as she had 
swallowed it she jumped up and began to play, bark, and wag her tail &mdash; in 
short became quite well again.</p><p> 
The father and mother saw it and were amazed.</p><p> 
'How did you cure the dog?' asked they.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n answered: 'I had two little roots to cure any pain, and she 
swallowed one.'</p><p> 
Now about that time it happened that the King's daughter fell ill, and the King 
proclaimed in every town and village, that he would reward any one who could 
heal her, and if any unmarried man could heal the King's daughter he should 
have her for his wife. This was proclaimed in Ivan's village as well as 
everywhere else.</p><p> 
His father and mother called Iv&aacute;n, and said to him: 'Have you heard what 
the King has proclaimed? You said you had a root that would cure any sickness. 
Go and heal the King's daughter, and you will be made happy for life.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said he.</p><p> 
And Iv&aacute;n prepared to go, and they dressed him in his best. But as he 
went out of the door he met a beggar woman with a crippled hand.</p><p> 
'I have heard,' said she, 'that you can heal people. I pray you cure my arm, 
for I cannot even put on my boots myself.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, and giving the little root to the beggar woman 
he told her to swallow it. She swallowed it, and was cured. She was at once 
able to move her arm freely.</p><p> 
His father and mother came out to accompany Iv&aacute;n to the King, but when 
they heard that he had given away the root, and that he had nothing left to 
cure the King's daughter with, they began to scold him.</p>   <pb n="165"/>  <p> 
'You pity a beggar woman, but are not sorry for the King's daughter!' said 
they. But Iv&aacute;n felt sorry for the King's daughter also. So he harnessed 
the horse, put straw in the cart to sit on, and sat down to drive away.</p><p> 
'Where are you going, fool?'</p><p> 
'To cure the King's daughter.'</p><p> 
'But you've nothing left to cure her with?'</p><p> 
'Never mind,' said he, and drove off.</p><p> 
He drove to the King's palace, and as soon as he stepped on the threshold the 
King's daughter got well.</p><p> 
The King was delighted, and had Iv&aacute;n brought to him, and had him dressed 
in fine robes.</p><p> 
'Be my son-in-law,' said he.</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n.</p><p> 
And Iv&aacute;n married the Princess. Her father died soon after, and 
Iv&aacute;n became King. So all three brothers were now kings.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="9" id="d56"> 
<head>IX</head> 
<p>The three brothers lived and reigned. The eldest brother, Simon the Soldier, 
prospered. With his straw soldiers he levied real soldiers. He ordered 
throughout his whole kingdom a levy of one soldier from every ten houses, and 
each soldier had to be tall, and clean in body and in face. He gathered many 
such soldiers and trained them; and when any one opposed him, he sent these 
soldiers at once, and got his own way, so that every one began to fear him, and 
his life was a comfortable one. Whatever he cast his eyes on and wished for, 
was his. He sent soldiers, and they brought him all he desired.</p><p> 
Tar&aacute;s the Stout also lived comfortably. He did not waste the money he 
got from Iv&aacute;n, but increased it largely. He introduced law and order 
into his kingdom. He kept his money in coffers, and taxed    <pb n="166"/>  the people. He 
instituted a poll-tax, tolls for walking and driving, and a tax on shoes and 
stockings and dress trimmings. And whatever he wished for he got. For the sake 
of money, people brought him everything, and they offered to work for him &mdash; 
for every one wanted money.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n the Fool, also, did not live badly. As soon as he had buried his 
father-in-law, he took off all his royal robes and gave them to his wife to put 
away in a chest; and he again donned his hempen shirt, his breeches and peasant 
shoes, and started again to work.</p><p> 
'It's dull for me,' said he. 'I'm getting fat and have lost my appetite and my 
sleep.' So he brought his father and mother and his dumb sister to live with 
him, and worked as before.</p><p> 
People said, 'But you are a king!'</p><p> 
'Yes,' said he, 'but even a king must eat.'</p><p> 
One of his ministers came to him and said, 'We have no money to pay 
salaries.'</p><p> 
'All right,' says he, 'then don't pay them.'</p><p> 
'Then no one will serve.'</p><p> 
'All right; let them not serve. They will have more time to work; let them cart 
manure. There is plenty of scavenging to be done.'</p><p> 
And people came to Iv&aacute;n to be tried. One said. 'He stole my money.' And 
Iv&aacute;n said, 'All right, that shows that he wanted it.'</p><p> 
And they all got to know that Iv&aacute;n was a fool. And his wife said to him, 
'People say that you are a fool.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n.</p><p> 
His wife thought and thought about it, but she also was a fool.</p><p> 
'Shall I go against my husband? Where the needle goes the thread follows,' said 
she.</p><p> 
So she took off her royal dress, put it away in    <pb n="167"/>  a chest, and went to the dumb 
girl to learn to work. And she learned to work and began to help her husband.</p><p> 
And all the wise men left Iv&aacute;n's kingdom; only the fools remained.</p><p> 
Nobody had money. They lived and worked. They fed themselves; and they fed 
others.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="10" id="d57"> 
<head>X</head> 
<p>The old Devil waited and waited for news from the imps of their having ruined 
the three brothers. But no news came. So he went himself to inquire about it. 
He searched and searched, but instead of finding the three imps he found only 
the three holes.</p><p> 
'Evidently they have failed,' thought he. 'I shall have to tackle it myself.'</p><p> 
So he went to look for the brothers, but they were no longer in their old 
places. He found them in three different kingdoms. All three were living and 
reigning. This annoyed the old Devil very much.</p><p> 
'Well,' said he, 'I must try my own hand at the job.'</p><p> 
First he went to King Simon. He did not go to him in his own shape, but 
disguised himself as a general, and drove to Simon's palace.</p><p> 
'I hear, King Simon,' said he, 'that you are a great warrior, and as I know 
that business well, I desire to serve you.'</p><p> 
King Simon questioned him, and seeing that he was a wise man, took him into his 
service.</p><p> 
The new commander began to teach King Simon how to form a strong army.</p><p> 
'First,' said he, 'we must levy more soldiers, for there are in your kingdom 
many people unemployed. We must recruit all the young men without exception. 
Then you will have five times as many    <pb n="168"/>  soldiers as formerly. Secondly, we must 
get new rifles and cannons. I will introduce rifles that will fire a hundred 
balls at once; they will fly out like peas. And I will get cannons that will 
consume with fire either man, or horse, or wall. They will burn up 
everything!'</p><p> 
Simon the King listened to the new commander, ordered all young men without 
exception to be enrolled as soldiers, and had new factories built in which he 
manufactured large quantities of improved rifles and cannons. Then he made 
haste to declare war against a neighbouring king. As soon as he met the other 
army, King Simon ordered his soldiers to rain balls against it and shoot fire 
from the cannons, and at one blow he burned and crippled half the enemy's army. 
The neighbouring king was so thoroughly frightened that he gave way and 
surrendered his kingdom. King Simon was delighted.</p><p> 
'Now,' said he, 'I will conquer the King of India.'</p><p> 
But the Indian King had heard about King Simon and had adopted all his 
inventions, and added more of his own. The Indian King enlisted not only all 
the young men, but all the single women also, and got together a greater army 
even than King Simon's. And he copied all King Simon's rifles and cannons, and 
invented a way of flying through the air to throw explosive bombs from above.</p><p> 
King Simon set out to fight the Indian King, expecting to beat him as he had 
beaten the other king; but the scythe that had cut so well had lost its edge. 
The King of India did not let Simon's army come within gunshot, but sent his 
women through the air to hurl down explosive bombs on to Simon's army. The 
women began to rain down bombs on to the army like borax upon cockroaches. The 
army    <pb n="169"/>  ran away, and Simon the King was left alone. So the Indian King took 
Simon's kingdom, and Simon the Soldier fled as best he might.</p><p> 
Having finished with this brother, the old Devil went to King Tar&aacute;s. 
Changing himself into a merchant, he settled in Tar&aacute;s's kingdom, started 
a house of business, and began spending money. He paid high prices for 
everything, and everybody hurried to the new merchant's to get money. And so 
much money spread among the people that they began to pay all their taxes 
promptly, and paid up all their arrears, and King Tar&aacute;s rejoiced.</p><p> 
'Thanks to the new merchant,' thought he, 'I shall have more money than ever; 
and my life will be yet more comfortable.'</p><p> 
And Tar&aacute;s the King began to form fresh plans, and began to build a new 
palace. He gave notice that people should bring him wood and stone, and come to 
work, and he fixed high prices for everything. King Tar&aacute;s thought people 
would come in crowds to work as before, but to his surprise all the wood and 
stone was taken to the merchant's, and all the workmen went there too. King 
Tar&aacute;s increased his price, but the merchant bid yet more. King 
Tar&aacute;s had much money, but the merchant had still more, and outbid the 
King at every point.</p><p> 
The King's palace was at a standstill; the building did not get on.</p><p> 
King Tar&aacute;s planned a garden, and when autumn came he called for the 
people to come and plant the garden, but nobody came. All the people were 
engaged digging a pond for the merchant. Winter came, and King Tar&aacute;s 
wanted to buy sable furs for a new overcoat. He sent to buy them, but the 
messengers returned and said, 'There are no sables left. The merchant has all 
the furs. He gave the best price, and made carpets of the skins.'</p>   <pb n="170"/>  <p> 
King Tar&aacute;s wanted to buy some stallions. He sent to buy them, but the 
messengers returned saying, 'The merchant has all the good stallions; they are 
carrying water to fill his pond.</p><p> 
All the King's affairs came to a standstill. Nobody would work for him, for 
every one was busy working for the merchant; and they only brought King 
Tar&aacute;s the merchant's money to pay their taxes.</p><p> 
And the King collected so much money that he had nowhere to store it, and his 
life became wretched. He ceased to form plans, and would have been glad enough 
simply to live, but he was hardly able even to do that. He ran short of 
everything. One after another his cooks, coachmen, and servants left him to go 
to the merchant. Soon he lacked even food. When he sent to the market to buy 
anything, there was nothing to be got &mdash; the merchant had bought up everything, 
and people only brought the King money to pay their taxes.</p><p> 
Tar&aacute;s the King got angry and banished the merchant from the country. But 
the merchant settled just across the frontier, and went on as before. For the 
sake of the merchant's money, people took everything to him instead of to the 
King.</p><p> 
Things went badly with King Tar&aacute;s. For days together he had nothing to 
eat, and a rumour even got about that the merchant was boasting that he would 
buy up the King himself! King Tar&aacute;s got frightened, and did not know 
what to do.</p><p> 
At this time Simon the Soldier came to him, saying, 'Help me, for the King of 
India has conquered me.'</p><p> 
But King Tar&aacute;s himself was over head and ears in difficulties. 'I 
myself,' said he, 'have had nothing to eat for two days.'</p> 
</div3>   <pb n="171"/>  <div3 type="section" n="11" id="d58"> 
<head> 
XI</head> 
<p>Having done with the two brothers, the old Devil went to Iv&aacute;n. He 
changed himself into a General, and coming to Iv&aacute;n began to persuade him 
that he ought to have an army.</p><p> 
'It does not become a king,' said he, 'to be without an army. Only give me the 
order, and I will collect soldiers from among your people, and form one.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n listened to him. 'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'form an army, and 
teach them to sing songs well. I like to hear them do that.'</p><p> 
So the old Devil went through Ivan's kingdom to enlist men. He told them to go 
and be entered as soldiers, and each should have a quart of spirits and a fine 
red cap.</p><p> 
The people laughed.</p><p> 
'We have plenty of spirits,' said they. 'We make it ourselves; and as for caps, 
the women make all kinds of them, even striped ones with tassels.'</p><p> 
So nobody would enlist.</p><p> 
The old Devil came to Iv&aacute;n and said: 'Your fools won't enlist of their 
own free will. We shall have to make them.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'you can try.'</p><p> 
So the old Devil gave notice that all the people were to enlist, and that 
Iv&aacute;n would put to death any one who refused.</p><p> 
The people came to the General and said, 'You say that if we do not go as 
soldiers the King will put us to death, but you don't say what will happen if 
we do enlist. We have heard say that soldiers get killed!'</p><p> 
'Yes, that happens sometimes.'</p><p> 
When the people heard this they became obstinate.</p>   <pb n="172"/>  <p> 
'We won't go,' said they. 'Better meet death at home. Either way we must 
die.'</p><p> 
'Fools! You are fools!' said the old Devil. 'A soldier may be killed or he may 
not, but if you don't go, King Iv&aacute;n will have you killed for certain.'</p><p> 
The people were puzzled, and went to Iv&aacute;n the Fool to consult him.</p><p> 
'A General has come,' said they, 'who says we must all become soldiers. "If you 
go as soldiers," says he "you may be killed or you may not, but if you don't 
go, King Iv&aacute;n will certainly kill you." Is this true?'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n laughed and said, 'How can I, alone, put all you to death? If I 
were not a fool I would explain it to you but as it is, I don't understand it 
myself.'</p><p> 
'Then' said they, 'we will not serve.'</p><p> 
'All right,' says he, 'don't.'</p><p> 
So the people went to the General and refused to enlist. And the old Devil saw 
that this game was up, and he went off and ingratiated himself with the King of 
Tarak&aacute;n.</p><p> 
'Let us make war,' says he, 'and conquer King Iv&aacute;n's country. It is true 
there is no money, but there is plenty of corn and cattle and everything 
else.'</p><p> 
So the King of Tarak&aacute;n prepared to make war. He mustered a great army, 
provided rifles and cannons, marched to the frontier, and entered Iv&aacute;n's 
kingdom.</p><p> 
And people came to Iv&aacute;n and said, 'The King of Tarak&aacute;n is coming 
to make war on us.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'let him come.'</p><p> 
Having crossed the frontier, the King of Tarak&aacute;n sent scouts to look for 
Iv&aacute;n's army. They looked and looked, but there was no army! They waited 
and waited for one to appear somewhere, but there were no signs of an army, and   <pb n="173"/>   
nobody to fight with. The King of Tarak&aacute;n then sent to seize the 
villages. The soldiers came to a village, and the people, both men and women, 
rushed out in astonishment to stare at the soldiers. The soldiers began to take 
their corn and cattle; the people let them have it, and did not resist. The 
soldiers went on to another village; the same thing happened again. The 
soldiers went on for one day, and for two days, and everywhere the same thing 
happened. The people let them have everything, and no one resisted, but only 
invited the soldiers to live with them.</p><p> 
'Poor fellows,' said they, 'if you have a hard life in your own land, why don't 
you come and stay with us altogether?'</p><p> 
The soldiers marched and marched: still no army, only people living and feeding 
themselves and others, and not resisting, but inviting the soldiers to stay and 
live with them. The soldiers found it dull work, and they came to the King of 
Tarak&aacute;n and said, 'We cannot fight here, lead us elsewhere. War is all 
right, but what is this? It is like cutting pea-soup! We will not make war here 
any more.'</p><p> 
The King of Tarak&aacute;n grew angry, and ordered his soldiers to over-run the 
whole kingdom, to destroy the villages, to burn the grain and the houses, and 
to slaughter the cattle. 'And if you do not obey my orders,' said he, 'I will 
execute you all.'</p><p> 
The soldiers were frightened, and began to act according to the King's orders. 
They began to burn houses and corn, and to kill cattle. But the fools still 
offered no resistance, and only wept. The old men wept, and the old women wept, 
and the young people wept.</p><p> 
'Why do you harm us?' they said. 'Why do you waste good things? If you need 
them, why do you not take them for yourselves?'</p>   <pb n="174"/>  <p> 
At last the soldiers could stand it no longer. They refused to go any further, 
and the army disbanded and fled.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="12" id="d59"> 
<head>XII</head> 
<p>The old Devil had to give it up. He could not get the better of Iv&aacute;n 
with soldiers. So he changed himself into a fine gentleman, and settled down in 
Ivan's kingdom. He meant to overcome him by means of money, as he had overcome 
Tar&aacute;s the Stout.</p><p> 
'I wish,' says he, 'to do you a good turn, to teach you sense and reason. I 
will build a house among you and organize a trade.'</p><p> 
'All right,' said Iv&aacute;n, 'come and live among us if you like.'</p><p> 
Next morning the fine gentleman went out into the public square with a big sack 
of gold and a sheet of paper, and said, 'You all live like swine. I wish to 
teach you how to live properly. Build me a house according to this plan. You 
shall work, I will tell you how, and I will pay you with gold coins.' And he 
showed them the gold.</p><p> 
The fools were astonished; there was no money in use among them; they bartered 
their goods, and paid one another with labour. They looked at the gold coins 
with surprise.</p><p> 
'What nice little things they are!' said they.</p><p> 
And they began to exchange their goods and labour for the gentleman's gold 
pieces. And the old Devil began, as in Tar&aacute;s's kingdom, to be free with 
his gold, and the people began to exchange everything for gold and to do all 
sorts of work for it.</p><p> 
The old Devil was delighted, and thought he to himself, 'Things are going right 
this time. Now I shall ruin the Fool as I did Tar&aacute;s, and I shall buy him 
up body and soul.'</p>   <pb n="175"/>  <p> 
But as soon as the fools had provided themselves with gold pieces they gave 
them to the women for necklaces. The lasses plaited them into their tresses, 
and at last the children in the street began to play with the little pieces. 
Everybody had plenty of them, and they stopped taking them. But the fine 
gentleman's mansion was not yet half-built, and the grain and cattle for the 
year were not yet provided. So he gave notice that he wished people to come and 
work for him, and that he wanted cattle and grain; for each thing, and for each 
service, he was ready to give many more pieces of gold.</p><p> 
But nobody came to work and nothing was brought. Only sometimes a boy or a 
little girl would run up to exchange an egg for a gold coin, but nobody else 
came, and he had nothing to eat. And being hungry, the fine gentleman went 
through the village to try and buy something for dinner. He tried at one house, 
and offered a gold piece for a fowl, but the housewife wouldn't take it.</p><p> 
'I have a lot already,' said she.</p><p> 
He tried at a widow's house to buy a herring, and offered a gold piece.</p><p> 
'I don't want it, my good sir,' said she. 'I have no children to play with it, 
and I myself already have three coins as curiosities.'</p><p> 
He tried at a peasant's house to get bread, but neither would the peasant take 
money.</p><p> 
'I don't need it,' said he, 'but if you are begging "for Christ's sake," wait a bit and I'll tell the housewife 
to cut you a piece of bread.'</p><p> 
At that the Devil spat, and ran away. To hear Christ's name mentioned, let 
alone receiving anything for Christ's sake, hurt him more than sticking a knife 
into him.</p>   <pb n="176"/>  <p> 
And so he got no bread. Every one had gold, and no matter where the old Devil 
went, nobody would give anything for money, but every one said, 'Either bring 
something else, or come and work, or receive what you want in charity for 
Christ's sake.'</p><p> 
But the old Devil had nothing but money; for work he had no liking, and as for 
taking anything 'for Christ's sake' he could not do that. The old Devil grew 
very angry.</p><p> 
'What more do you want, when I give you money?' said he. 'You can buy 
everything with gold, and hire any kind of labourer.' But the fools did not 
heed him.</p><p> 
'No, we do not want money,' said they. 'We have no payments to make, and no 
taxes, so what should we do with it?'</p><p> 
The old Devil lay down to sleep &mdash; supperless.</p><p> 
The affair was told to Iv&aacute;n the Fool. People came and asked him, 'What 
are we to do? A fine gentleman has turned up, who likes to eat and drink and 
dress well, but he does not like to work, does not beg in "Christ's name," but 
only offers gold pieces to every one. At first people gave him all he wanted 
until they had plenty of gold pieces, but now no one gives him anything. What's 
to be done with him? He will die of hunger before long.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n listened.</p><p> 
'All right,' says he, 'we must feed him. Let him live by turn at each house as 
a shepherd does.'</p><p> 
There was no help for it. The old Devil had to begin making the round.</p><p> 
In due course the turn came for him to go to   <pb n="177"/>   Ivan's house. The old Devil came 
in to dinner, and the dumb girl was getting it ready.</p><p> 
She had often been deceived by lazy folk who came early to dinner &mdash; without 
having done their share of work &mdash; and ate up all the porridge, so it had 
occurred to her to find out the sluggards by their hands. Those who had horny 
hands, she put at the table, but the others got only the scraps that were left 
over.</p><p> 
The old Devil sat down at the table, but the dumb girl seized him by the hands 
and looked at them &mdash;  there were no hard places there: the hands were clean 
and smooth, with long nails. The dumb girl gave a grunt and pulled the Devil 
away from the table. And Iv&aacute;n's wife said to him, 'Don't be offended, 
fine gentleman. My sister-in-law does not allow any one to come to table who 
hasn't horny hands. But wait awhile, after the folk have eaten you shall have 
what is left.'</p><p> 
The old Devil was offended that in the King's house they wished him to feed 
like a pig. He said to Iv&aacute;n, 'It is a foolish law you have in your 
kingdom that every one must work with his hands. It's your stupidity that 
invented it. Do people work only with their hands? What do you think wise men 
work with?'</p><p> 
And Iv&aacute;n said, 'How are we fools to know? We do most of our work with 
our hands and our backs.'</p><p> 
'That is because you are fools! But I will teach you how to work with the head. 
Then you will know that it is more profitable to work with the head than with 
the hands.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n was surprised.</p><p> 
'If that is so' said he, 'then there is some sense in calling us fools!'</p><p> 
And the old Devil went on. 'Only it is not easy to work with one's head. You 
give me nothing to   <pb n="178"/>  eat, because I have no hard places on my hands, but you do 
not know that it is a hundred times more difficult to work with the head. 
Sometimes one's head quite splits.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n became thoughtful.</p><p> 
'Why, then, friend, do you torture yourself so? Is it pleasant when the head 
splits? Would it not be better to do easier work with your hands and your 
back?'</p><p> 
But the Devil said, 'I do it all out of pity for you fools. If I didn't torture 
myself you would remain fools for ever. But, having worked with my head, I can 
now teach you.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n was surprised.</p><p> 
'Do teach us!' said he, 'so that when our hands get cramped we may use our 
heads for a change.'</p><p> 
And the Devil promised to teach the people. So Iv&aacute;n gave notice 
throughout the kingdom that a fine gentleman had come who would teach everybody 
how to work with their heads; that with the head more could be done than with 
the hands; and that the people ought all to come and learn.</p><p> 
Now there was in Ivan's kingdom a high tower, with many steps leading up to a 
lantern on the top. And Iv&aacute;n took the gentleman up there that every one 
might see him.</p><p> 
So the gentleman took his place on the top of the tower and began to speak, and 
the people came together to see him. They thought the gentleman would really 
show them how to work with the head without using the hands. But the old Devil 
only taught them in many words how they might live without working. The people 
could make nothing of it. They looked and considered, and at last went off to 
attend to their affairs.</p><p> 
The old Devil stood on the tower a whole day, and after that a second day, 
talking all the time.   <pb n="179"/>   But standing there so long he grew hungry, and the fools 
never thought of taking food to him up in the tower. They thought that if he 
could work with his head better than with his hands, he could at any rate 
easily provide himself with bread.</p><p> 
The old Devil stood on the top of the tower yet another day, talking away. 
People came near, looked on for awhile, and then went away.</p><p> 
And Iv&aacute;n asked, 'Well, has the gentleman begun to work with his head 
yet?'</p><p> 
'Not yet,' said the people; 'he's still spouting away.'</p><p> 
The old Devil stood on the tower one day more, but he began to grow weak, so 
that he staggered and hit his head against one of the pillars of the lantern. 
One of the people noticed it and told Ivan's wife, and she ran to her husband, 
who was in the field.</p><p> 
'Come and look,' said she. 'They say the gentleman is beginning to work with 
his head.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n was surprised.</p><p> 
'Really?' says he, and he turned his horse round, and went to the tower. And by 
the time he reached the tower the old Devil was quite exhausted with hunger, 
and was staggering and knocking his head against the pillars. And just as 
Iv&aacute;n arrived at the tower, the Devil stumbled, fell, and came bump, 
bump, bump, straight down the stairs to the bottom, counting each step with a 
knock of his head!</p><p> 
'Well!' says Iv&aacute;n, 'the fine gentleman told the truth when he said that 
"sometimes one's head quite splits." This is worse than blisters; after such 
work there will be swellings on the head.'</p><p> 
The old Devil tumbled out at the foot of the stairs, and struck his head 
against the ground. Iv&aacute;n was about to go up to him to see how much work   <pb n="180"/>   
he had done &mdash; when suddenly the earth opened and the old Devil fell through. 
Only a hole was left.</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n scratched his head.</p><p> 
'What a nasty thing,' says he. 'It's one of those devils again! What a whopper! 
He must be the father of them all.'</p><p> 
Iv&aacute;n is still living, and people crowd to his kingdom. His own brothers 
have come to live with him, and he feeds them, too. To every one who comes and 
says 'Give me food!' Iv&aacute;n says, 'All right. You can stay with us; we 
have plenty of everything.'</p><p> 
Only there is one special custom in his kingdom; whoever has horny hands comes 
to table, but whoever has not, must eat what the others leave.</p><p>

<head>EVIL ALLURES, BUT GOOD ENDURES</head> 
<p>THERE lived in olden times a good and kindly man. He had this world's goods in 
abundance, and many slaves to serve him. And the slaves prided themselves on 
their master, saying:</p><p> 
'There is no better lord than ours under the sun. He feeds and clothes us well, 
and gives us work suited to our strength. He bears no malice and never speaks a 
harsh word to any one. He is not like other masters, who treat their slaves 
worse than cattle: punishing them whether they deserve it or not, and never 
giving them a friendly word. He wishes us well, does good, and speaks kindly to 
us. We do not wish for a better life.'</p><p> 
Thus the slaves praised their lord, and the Devil, seeing it, was vexed that 
slaves should live in such love and harmony with their master. So getting one 
of them, whose name was Aleb, into his power, the Devil ordered him to tempt 
the other slaves. And one day, when they were all sitting together resting and 
talking of their master's goodness, Aleb raised his voice, and said:</p><p> 
'It is stupid to make so much of our master's goodness. The Devil himself would 
be kind to you, if you did what he wanted. We serve our master well, and humour 
him in all things. As soon as he thinks of anything, we do it: foreseeing all 
his wishes. What can he do but be kind to us? Just try how it will be if, 
instead of humouring him, we do him some harm instead. He will act like any one 
else, and will repay evil for evil, as the worst of masters do.</p>   <pb n="182"/>  <p> 
The other slaves began denying what Aleb had said and at last bet with him. 
Aleb undertook to make their master angry. If he failed, he was to lose his 
holiday garment; but if he succeeded, the other slaves were to give him theirs. 
Moreover, they promised to defend him against the master, and to set him free 
if he should be put in chains or imprisoned. Having arranged this bet, Aleb 
agreed to make his master angry next morning.</p><p> 
Aleb was a shepherd, and had in his charge a number of valuable, pure-bred 
sheep, of which his master was very fond. Next morning, when the master brought 
some visitors into the inclosure to show them the valuable sheep, Aleb winked 
at his companions, as if to say:</p><p> 
'See, now, how angry I will make him.'</p><p> 
All the other slaves assembled, looking in at the gates or over the fence, and 
the Devil climbed a tree near by to see how his servant would do his work. The 
master walked about the inclosure, showing his guests the ewes and lambs, and 
presently he wished to show them his finest ram.</p><p> 
'All the rams are valuable,' said he, 'but I have one with closely twisted 
horns, which is priceless. I prize him as the apple of my eye.'</p><p> 
Startled by the strangers, the sheep rushed about the inclosure, so that the 
visitors could not get a good look at the ram. As soon as it stood still, Aleb 
startled the sheep as if by accident, and they all got mixed up again. The 
visitors could not make out which was the priceless ram. At last the master got 
tired of it.</p><p> 
'Aleb, dear friend,' he said, 'pray catch our best ram for me, the one with the 
tightly twisted horns. Catch him very carefully, and hold him still for a 
moment.'</p><p> 
Scarcely had the master said this, when Aleb   <pb n="183"/>   rushed in among the sheep like a 
lion, and clutched the priceless ram. Holding him fast by the wool, he seized 
the left hind leg with one hand, and, before his master's eyes, lifted it and 
jerked it so that it snapped like a dry branch. He had broken the ram's leg and 
it fell bleating on to its knees. Then Aleb seized the right hind leg, while 
the left twisted round and hung quite limp. The visitors and the slaves 
exclaimed in dismay, and the Devil, sitting up in the tree, rejoiced that Aleb 
had done his task so cleverly. The master looked as black as thunder, frowned, 
bent his head, and did not say a word. The visitors and the slaves were silent, 
too, waiting to see what would follow. After remaining silent for a while, the 
master shook himself as if to throw off some burden. Then he lifted his head, 
and raising his eyes heavenward, remained so for a short time. Presently the 
wrinkles passed from his face, and he looked down at Aleb with a smile 
saying:</p><p> 
'Oh, Aleb, Aleb! Your master bade you anger me; but my master is stronger than 
yours. I am not angry with you, but I will make your master angry. You are 
afraid that I shall punish you, and you have been wishing for your freedom. 
Know, then, Aleb, that I shall not punish you; but, as you wish to be free, 
here, before my guests, I set you free. Go where you like, and take your 
holiday garment with you!'</p><p> 
And the kind master returned with his guests to the house; but the Devil, 
grinding his teeth, fell down from the tree, and sank through the ground.</p><p>

<head>LITTLE GIRLS WISER THAN MEN</head> 
<p> 
IT was an early Easter. Sledging was only just over; snow still lay in the 
yards; and water ran in streams down the village street.</p><p> 
Two little girls from different houses happened to meet in a lane between two 
homesteads, where the dirty water after running through the farm-yards had 
formed a large puddle. One girl was very small, the other a little bigger. 
Their mothers had dressed them both in new frocks. The little one wore a blue 
frock the other a yellow print, and both had red kerchiefs on their heads. They 
had just come from church when they met, and first they showed each other their 
finery, and then they began to play. Soon the fancy took them to splash about 
in the water, and the smaller one was going to step into the puddle, shoes and 
all, when the elder checked her:</p><p> 
'Don't go in so, Mal&aacute;sha,' said she, 'your mother will scold you. I will 
take off my shoes and stockings, and you take off yours.'</p><p> 
They did so, and then, picking up their skirts, began walking towards each 
other through the puddle. The water came up to Mal&aacute;sha's ankles, and she 
said:</p><p> 
'It is deep, Ako&uacute;lya, I'm afraid!'</p><p> 
'Come on,' replied the other. 'Don't be frightened. It won't get any deeper.'</p><p> 
When they got near one another, Ako&uacute;lya said:</p><p> 
'Mind, Mal&aacute;sha, don't splash. Walk carefully!'</p><p> 
She had hardly said this, when Mal&aacute;sha plumped down her foot so that the 
water splashed right on to Ako&uacute;lya's frock. The frock was splashed, and 
so were Ako&uacute;lya's eyes and nose. When she saw the   <pb n="185"/>   stains on her frock, 
she was angry and ran after Mal&aacute;sha to strike her. Mal&aacute;sha was 
frightened, and seeing that she had got herself into trouble, she scrambled out 
of the puddle, and prepared to run home. Just then Ako&uacute;lya's mother 
happened to be passing, and seeing that her daughter's skirt was splashed, and 
her sleeves dirty, she said:</p><p> 
'You naughty, dirty girl, what have you been doing?'</p><p> 
'Mal&aacute;sha did it on purpose,' replied the girl.</p><p> 
At this Ako&uacute;lya's mother seized Mal&aacute;sha, and struck her on the 
back of her neck. Mal&aacute;sha began to howl so that she could be heard all 
down the street. Her mother came out.</p><p> 
'What are you beating my girl for?' said she; and began scolding her neighbour. 
One word led to another and they had an angry quarrel. The men came out and a 
crowd collected in the street, every one shouting and no one listening. They 
all went on quarrelling, till one gave another a push, and the affair had very 
nearly come to blows, when Ako&uacute;lya's old grandmother, stepping in among 
them, tried to calm them.</p><p> 
'What are you thinking of, friends? Is it right to behave so? On a day like 
this, too! It is a time for rejoicing, and not for such folly as this.'</p><p> 
They would not listen to the old woman and nearly knocked her off her feet. And 
she would not have been able to quiet the crowd, if it had not been for 
Ako&uacute;lya and Mal&aacute;sha themselves. While the women were abusing each 
other, Ako&uacute;lya had wiped the mud off her frock, and gone back to the 
puddle. She took a stone and began scraping away the earth in front of the 
puddle to make a channel through which the water could run out into the street. 
Presently Mal&aacute;sha joined her, and with a chip of wood helped her dig the 
channel. Just as the men   <pb n="186"/>   were beginning to fight, the water from the little 
girls' channel ran streaming into the street towards the very place where the 
old woman was trying to pacify the men. The girls followed it; one running each 
side of the little stream.</p><p> 
'Catch it, Mal&aacute;sha! Catch it!' shouted Ako&uacute;lya; while 
Mal&aacute;sha could not speak for laughing.</p><p> 
Highly delighted, and watching the chip float along on their stream, the little 
girls ran straight into the group of men; and the old woman, seeing them, said 
to the men:</p><p> 
'Are you not ashamed of yourselves? To go fighting on account of these lassies, 
when they themselves have forgotten all about it, and are playing happily 
together. Dear little souls! They are wiser than you!'</p><p> 
The men looked at the little girls, and were ashamed, and, laughing at 
themselves, went back each to his own home.</p><p> 
'Except ye turn, and become as little children, ye shall in no wise enter into 
the kingdom of heaven.'</p><p>

<head>ELIAS</head> 
<p>THERE once lived, in the Government of Uf&aacute; a Bashk&iacute;r named 
Elias. His father, who died a year after he had found his son a wife, 
did not leave him much property. Elias then had only seven mares, two 
cows, and about a score of sheep. He was a good manager, however, and soon 
began to acquire more. He and his wife worked from morn till night; rising 
earlier than others and going later to bed; and his possessions increased year 
by year. Living in this way, Elias little by little acquired great 
wealth. At the end of thirty-five years he had 200 horses, 150 head of cattle, 
and 1,200 sheep. Hired labourers tended his flocks and herds, and hired women 
milked his mares and cows, and made kumiss, butter and cheese. Elias had 
abundance of everything, and every one in the district envied him. They said of 
him:</p><p> 
'Elias is a fortunate man: he has plenty of everything. This world must 
be a pleasant place for him.'</p><p> 
People of position heard of Elias and sought his acquaintance. Visitors 
came to him from afar; and he welcomed every one, and gave them food and drink. 
Whoever might come, there was always kumiss, tea, sherbet, and mutton to set 
before them. Whenever visitors arrived a sheep would be killed, or sometimes 
two; and if many guests came he would even slaughter a mare for them.</p><p> 
Elias had three children: two sons and a daughter; and he married them 
all off. While he was poor, his sons worked with him, and looked after the   <pb n="188"/>   
flocks and herds themselves; but when he grew rich they got spoiled and one of 
them took to drink. The eldest was killed in a brawl; and the younger, who had 
married a self-willed woman, ceased to obey his father, and they could not live 
together any more.</p><p> 
So they parted, and Elias gave his son a house and some of the cattle; 
and this diminished his wealth. Soon after that, a disease broke out among 
Elias's sheep, and many died. Then followed a bad harvest, and the hay 
crop failed; and many cattle died that winter. Then the Kirgh&iacute;z captured 
his best herd of horses; and Elias's property dwindled away. It became 
smaller and smaller, while at the same time his strength grew less; till, by 
the time he was seventy years old, he had begun to sell his furs, carpets, 
saddles, and tents. At last he had to part with his remaining cattle, and found 
himself face to face with want. Before he knew how it had happened, he had lost 
everything, and in their old age he and his wife had to go into service. 
Elias had nothing left, except the clothes on his back, a fur cloak, a 
cup, his indoor shoes and overshoes, and his wife, Sham-Shemagi, who also was 
old by this time. The son who had parted from him had gone into a far country, 
and his daughter was dead, so that there was no one to help the old couple.</p><p> 
Their neighbour, Muhammad-Shah, took pity on them. Muhammad-Shah was neither 
rich nor poor, but lived comfortably, and was a good man. He remembered 
Elias's hospitality, and pitying him, said:</p><p> 
'Come and live with me, Elias, you and your old woman. In summer you can 
work in my melon-garden as much as your strength allows, and in winter feed my 
cattle; and Sham-Shemagi shall milk my mares and make kumiss. I will feed and   <pb n="189"/>   
clothe you both. When you need anything, tell me, and you shall have it.'</p><p> 
Elias thanked his neighbour, and he and his wife took service with 
Muhammad-Shah as labourers. At first the position seemed hard to them, but they 
got used to it, and lived on, working as much as their strength allowed.</p><p> 
Muhammad-Shah found it was to his advantage to keep such people, because, 
having been masters themselves, they knew how to manage and were not lazy, but 
did all the work they could. Yet it grieved Muhammad-Shah to see people brought 
so low who had been of such high standing.</p><p> 
It happened once that some of Muhammad-Shah's relatives came from a great 
distance to visit him, and a Mullah came too. Muhammad-Shah told Elias 
to catch a sheep and kill it. Elias skinned the sheep, and boiled it, 
and sent it in to the guests. The guests ate the mutton, had some tea, and then 
began drinking kumiss. As they were sitting with their host on down cushions on 
a carpet, conversing and sipping kumiss from their cups, Elias, having 
finished his work passed by the open door. Muhammad-Shah, seeing him pass, said 
to one of the guests:</p><p> 
'Did you notice that old man who passed just now?'</p><p> 
'Yes,' said the visitor, 'what is there remarkable about him?'</p><p> 
'Only this &mdash; that he was once the richest man among us,' replied the host. 
'His name is Elias. You may have heard of him.'</p><p> 
'Of course I have heard of him,' the guest answered 'I never saw him before, 
but his fame has spread far and wide.'</p><p> 
'Yes, and now he has nothing left,' said Muhammad-Shah, 'and he lives with me 
as my labourer, and his old woman is here too &mdash; she milks the mares.'</p>   <pb n="190"/>  <p> 
The guest was astonished: he clicked with his tongue, shook his head, and 
said:</p><p> 
'Fortune turns like a wheel. One man it lifts, another it sets down! Does not 
the old man grieve over all he has lost?'</p><p> 
'Who can tell. He lives quietly and peacefully, and works well.'</p><p> 
'May I speak to him?' asked the guest. 'I should like to ask him about his 
life.'</p><p> 
'Why not?' replied the master, and he called from the kib&iacute;tka in which they were sitting:</p><p> 
'Babay;' (which in the Bashkir tongue means 'Grandfather ') 'come in and have a 
cup of kumiss with us, and call your wife here also.'</p><p> 
Elias entered with his wife; and after exchanging greetings with his 
master and the guests, he repeated a prayer, and seated himself near the door. 
His wife passed in behind the curtain and sat down with her mistress.</p><p> 
A Cap of kumiss was handed to Elias; he wished the guests and his master 
good health, bowed, drank a little, and put down the cup.</p><p> 
'Well, Daddy,' said the guest who had wished to speak to him, 'I suppose you 
feel rather sad at the sight of us. It must remind you of your former 
prosperity, and of your present sorrows.'</p><p> 
Elias smiled, and said:</p><p> 
'If I were to tell you what is happiness and what is misfortune, you would not 
believe me. You had better ask my wife. She is a woman, and what is in her 
heart is on her tongue. She will tell you the whole truth.'</p><p> 
The guest turned towards the curtain.</p><p> 
'Well, Granny,' he cried, 'tell me how your   <pb n="191"/>  former happiness compares with your 
present misfortune.'</p><p> 
And Sham-Shemagi answered from behind the curtain:</p><p> 
'This is what I think about it: My old man and I lived for fifty years seeking 
happiness and not finding it; and it is only now, these last two years, since 
we had nothing left and have lived as labourers, that we have found real 
happiness, and we wish for nothing better than our present lot.'</p><p> 
The guests were astonished, and so was the master; he even rose and drew the 
curtain back, so as to see the old woman's face. There she stood with her arms 
folded, looking at her old husband, and smiling; and he smiled back at her. The 
old woman went on:</p><p> 
'I speak the truth and do not jest. For half a century we sought for happiness, 
and as long as we were rich we never found it. Now that we have nothing left, 
and have taken service as labourers, we have found such happiness that we want 
nothing better.'</p><p> 
'But in what does your happiness consist?' asked the guest.</p><p> 
'Why, in this,' she replied, 'when we were rich my husband and I had so many 
cares that we had no time to talk to one another, or to think of our souls, or 
to pray to God. Now we had visitors, and had to consider what food to set 
before them, and what presents to give them, lest they should speak ill of us. 
When they left, we had to look after our labourers who were always trying to 
shirk work and get the best food, while we wanted to get all we could out of 
them. So we sinned. Then we were in fear lest a wolf should kill a foal or a 
calf, or thieves steal our horses. We lay awake at night, worrying lest the 
ewes should overlie their lambs, and we got   <pb n="192"/>  up again and again to see that all 
was well. One thing attended to, another care would spring up: how, for 
instance, to get enough fodder for the winter. And besides that, my old man and 
I used to disagree. He would say we must do so and so, and I would differ from 
him; and then we disputed &mdash; sinning again. So we passed from one trouble to 
another, from one sin to another, and found no happiness.'</p><p> 
'Well, and now?'</p><p> 
'Now, when my husband and I wake in the morning, we always have a loving word 
for one another and we live peacefully, having nothing to quarrel about. We 
have no care but how best to serve our master. We work as much as our strength 
allows and do it with a will, that our master may not lose but profit by us. 
When we come in, dinner or supper is ready and there is kumiss to drink. We 
have fuel to burn when it is cold and we have our fur cloak. And we have time 
to talk, time to think of our souls, and time to pray. For fifty years we 
sought happiness, but only now at last have we found it.'</p><p> 
The guests laughed.</p><p> 
But Elias said:</p><p> 
'Do not laugh, friends. It is not a matter for jesting &mdash; it is the truth of 
life. We also were foolish at first, and wept at the loss of our wealth; but 
now God has shown us the truth, and we tell it, not for our own consolation, 
but for your good.'</p><p> 
And the Mullah said:</p><p> 
'That is a wise speech. Elias has spoken the exact truth. The same is 
said in Holy Writ.'</p><p> 
And the guests ceased laughing and became thoughtful.</p><p>

<head>THE THREE HERMITS</head> 
<p>AN OLD LEGEND CURRENT IN THE VOLGA DISTRICT</p> 
<p><q>'And in praying use not vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do: for they think 
that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not therefore like unto 
them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask Him.' 
&mdash; <hi rend="italic">Matt</hi>. vi. 7, 8.</q></p><p> 
A BISHOP was sailing from Archangel to the Solov&eacute;tsk Monastery; and on 
the same vessel were a number of pilgrims on their way to visit the shrines at 
that place. The voyage was a smooth one. The wind favourable, and the weather 
fair. The pilgrims lay on deck, eating, or sat in groups talking to one 
another. The Bishop, too, came on deck, and as he was pacing up and down, he 
noticed a group of men standing near the prow and listening to a fisherman who 
was pointing to the sea and telling them something. The Bishop stopped, and 
looked in the direction in which the man was pointing. He could see nothing 
however, but the sea glistening in the sunshine. He drew nearer to listen, but 
when the man saw him, he took off his cap and was silent. The rest of the 
people also took off their caps, and bowed.</p><p> 
'Do not let me disturb you, friends,' said the Bishop. 'I came to hear what 
this good man was saying.'</p><p> 
'The fisherman was telling us about the hermits,' replied one, a tradesman, 
rather bolder than the rest.</p><p> 
'What hermits?' asked the Bishop, going to the   <pb n="194"/>  side of the vessel and seating 
himself on a box. 'Tell me about them. I should like to hear. What were you 
pointing at?'</p><p> 
'Why, that little island you can just see over there,' answered the man, 
pointing to a spot ahead and a little to the right. 'That is the island where 
the hermits live for the salvation of their souls.'</p><p> 
'Where is the island?' asked the Bishop. 'I see nothing.'</p><p> 
'There, in the distance, if you will please look along my hand. Do you see that 
little cloud? Below it and a bit to the left, there is just a faint streak. 
That is the island.'</p><p> 
The Bishop looked carefully, but his unaccustomed eyes could make out nothing 
but the water shimmering in the sun.</p><p> 
'I cannot see it,' he said. 'But who are the hermits that live there?'</p><p> 
'They are holy men,' answered the fisherman. 'I had long heard tell of them, 
but never chanced to see them myself till the year before last.'</p><p> 
And the fisherman related how once, when he was out fishing, he had been 
stranded at night upon that island, not knowing where he was. In the morning, 
as he wandered about the island, he came across an earth hut, and met an old 
man standing near it. Presently two others came out, and after having fed him, 
and dried his things, they helped him mend his boat.</p><p> 
'And what are they like?' asked the Bishop.</p><p> 
'One is a small man and his back is bent. He wears a priest's cassock and is 
very old; he must be more than a hundred, I should say. He is so old that the 
white of his beard is taking a greenish tinge, but he is always smiling, and 
his face is as bright as an angel's from heaven. The second is taller, but he 
also is very old. He wears tattered,   <pb n="195"/>  peasant coat. His beard is broad, and of a 
yellowish grey colour. He is a strong man. Before I had time to help him, he 
turned my boat over as if it were only a pail. He too, is kindly and cheerful. 
The third is tall, and has a beard as white as snow and reaching to his knees. 
He is stern, with over-hanging eyebrows; and he wears nothing but a mat tied 
round his waist.'</p><p> 
'And did they speak to you?' asked the Bishop.</p><p> 
'For the most part they did everything in silence and spoke but little even to 
one another. One of them would just give a glance, and the others would 
understand him. I asked the tallest whether they had lived there long. He 
frowned, and muttered something as if he were angry; but the oldest one took 
his hand and smiled, and then the tall one was quiet. The oldest one only said: 
"Have mercy upon us," and smiled.'</p><p> 
While the fisherman was talking, the ship had drawn nearer to the island.</p><p> 
'There, now you can see it plainly, if your Grace will please to look,' said 
the tradesman, pointing with his hand.</p><p> 
The Bishop looked, and now he really saw a dark streak &mdash; which was the island. 
Having looked at it a while, he left the prow of the vessel, and going to the 
stern, asked the helmsman:</p><p> 
'What island is that?'</p><p> 
'That one,' replied the man, 'has no name. There are many such in this sea.'</p><p> 
'Is it true that there are hermits who live there for the salvation of their 
souls?'</p><p> 
'So it is said, your Grace, but I don't know if it's true. Fishermen say they 
have seen them; but of course they may only be spinning yarns.'</p><p> 
'I should like to land on the island and see these men,' said the Bishop. 'How 
could I manage it?'</p>   <pb n="196"/>  <p> 
'The ship cannot get close to the island,' replied the helmsman, 'but you might 
be rowed there in a boat. You had better speak to the captain.'</p><p> 
The captain was sent for and came.</p><p> 
'I should like to see these hermits,' said the Bishop. 'Could I not be rowed 
ashore?'</p><p> 
The captain tried to dissuade him.</p><p> 
'Of course it could be done,' said he, 'but we should lose much time. And if I 
might venture to say so to your Grace, the old men are not worth your pains. I 
have heard say that they are foolish old fellows, who understand nothing, and 
never speak a word, any more than the fish in the sea.'</p><p> 
'I wish to see them,' said the Bishop, 'and I will pay you for your trouble and 
loss of time. Please let me have a boat.'</p><p> 
There was no help for it; so the order was given. The sailors trimmed the 
sails, the steersman put up the helm, and the ship's course was set for the 
island. A chair was placed at the prow for the Bishop, and he sat there, 
looking ahead. The passengers all collected at the prow, and gazed at the 
island. Those who had the sharpest eyes could presently make out the rocks on 
it, and then a mud hut was seen. At last one man saw the hermits themselves. 
The captain brought a telescope and, after looking through it, handed it to the 
Bishop.</p><p> 
'It's right enough. There are three men standing on the shore. There, a little 
to the right of that big rock.'</p><p> 
The Bishop took the telescope, got it into position, and he saw the three men: 
a tall one, a shorter one, and one very small and bent, standing on the shore 
and holding each other by the hand.</p><p> 
The captain turned to the Bishop.</p><p> 
'The vessel can get no nearer in than this, your Grace. If you wish to go 
ashore, we must ask you to go in the boat, while we anchor here.'</p>   <pb n="197"/>  <p> 
The cable was quickly let out, the anchor cast, and the sails furled. There was 
a jerk, and the vessel shook. Then a boat having been lowered, the oarsmen 
jumped in, and the Bishop descended the ladder and took his seat. The men 
pulled at their oars, and the boat moved rapidly towards the island. When they 
came within a stone's throw they saw three old men: a tall one with only a mat 
tied round his waist: a shorter one in a tattered peasant coat, and a very old 
one bent with age and wearing an old cassock &mdash; all three standing hand in 
hand.</p><p> 
The oarsmen pulled in to the shore, and held on with the boathook while the 
Bishop got out.</p><p> 
The old men bowed to him, and he gave them his benediction, at which they bowed 
still lower. Then the Bishop began to speak to them.</p><p> 
'I have heard,' he said, 'that you, godly men, live here saving your own souls, 
and praying to our Lord Christ for your fellow men. I, an unworthy servant of 
Christ, am called, by God's mercy, to keep and teach His flock. I wished to see 
you, servants of God, and to do what I can to teach you, also.'</p><p> 
The old men looked at each other smiling, but remained silent.</p><p> 
'Tell me,' said the Bishop, 'what you are doing to save your souls, and how you 
serve God on this island.'</p><p> 
The second hermit sighed, and looked at the oldest, the very ancient one. The 
latter smiled, and said:</p><p> 
'We do not know how to serve God. We only serve and support ourselves, servant 
of God.'</p><p> 
'But how do you pray to God?' asked the Bishop.</p><p> 
'We pray in this way,' replied the hermit. 'Three are ye, three are we, have 
mercy upon us.'</p>   <pb n="198"/>  <p> 
And when the old man said this, all three raised their eyes to heaven, and 
repeated:</p><p> 
'Three are ye, three are we, have mercy upon us!'</p><p> 
The Bishop smiled.</p><p> 
'You have evidently heard something about the Holy Trinity,' said he. 'But you 
do not pray aright. You have won my affection, godly men. I see you wish to 
please the Lord, but you do not know how to serve Him. That is not the way to 
pray; but listen to me, and I will teach you. I will teach you, not a way of my 
own, but the way in which God in the Holy Scriptures has commanded all men to 
pray to Him.'</p><p> 
And the Bishop began explaining to the hermits how God had revealed Himself to 
men; telling them of God the Father, and God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.</p><p> 
'God the Son came down on earth,' said he, 'to save men, and this is how He 
taught us all to pray. Listen and repeat after me: "Our Father."'</p><p> 
And the first old man repeated after him, 'Our Father,' and the second said, 
'Our Father,' and the third said, 'Our Father.'</p><p> 
'Which art in heaven,' continued the Bishop.</p><p> 
The first hermit repeated, 'Which art in heaven,' but the second blundered over 
the words, and the tall hermit could not say them properly. His hair had grown 
over his mouth so that he could not speak plainly. The very old hermit, having 
no teeth, also mumbled indistinctly.</p><p> 
The Bishop repeated the words again, and the old men repeated them after him. 
The Bishop sat down on a stone, and the old men stood before him, watching his 
mouth, and repeating the words as he uttered them. And all day long the Bishop 
laboured, saying a word twenty, thirty, a hundred times over, and the old men 
repeated it after him. They   <pb n="199"/>  blundered, and he corrected them, and made them 
begin again.</p><p> 
The Bishop did not leave off till he had taught them the whole of the Lord's 
prayer so that they could not only repeat it after him, but could say it by 
themselves. The middle one was the first to know it, and to repeat the whole of 
it alone. The Bishop made him say it again and again, and at last the others 
could say it too.</p><p> 
It was getting dark, and the moon was appearing over the water, before the 
Bishop rose to return to the vessel. When he took leave of the old men, they 
all bowed down to the ground before him. He raised them, and kissed each of 
them, telling them to pray as he had taught them. Then he got into the boat and 
returned to the ship.</p><p> 
And as he sat in the boat and was rowed to the ship he could hear the three 
voices of the hermits loudly repeating the Lord's prayer. As the boat drew near 
the vessel their voices could no longer be heard, but they could still be seen 
in the moonlight, standing as he had left them on the shore, the shortest in 
the middle, the tallest on the right, the middle one on the left. As soon as 
the Bishop had reached the vessel and got on board, the anchor was weighed and 
the sails unfurled. The wind filled them, and the ship sailed away, and the 
Bishop took a seat in the stern and watched the island they had left. For a 
time he could still see the hermits, but presently they disappeared from sight, 
though the island was still visible. At last it too vanished, and only the sea 
was to be seen, rippling in the moonlight.</p><p> 
The pilgrims lay down to sleep, and all was quiet on deck. The Bishop did not 
wish to sleep, but sat alone at the stern, gazing at the sea where the island 
was no longer visible, and thinking of the good old   <pb n="200"/>   men. He thought how pleased 
they had been to learn the Lord's prayer; and he thanked God for having sent 
him to teach and help such godly men.</p><p> 
So the Bishop sat, thinking, and gazing at the sea where the island had 
disappeared. And the moonlight flickered before his eyes, sparkling, now here, 
now there, upon the waves. Suddenly he saw something white and shining, on the 
bright path which the moon cast across the sea. Was it a seagull, or the little 
gleaming sail of some small boat? The Bishop fixed his eyes on it, wondering.</p><p> 
'It must be a boat sailing after us,' thought he 'but it is overtaking us very 
rapidly. It was far, far away a minute ago, but now it is much nearer. It 
cannot be a boat, for I can see no sail; but whatever it may be, it is 
following us, and catching us up.'</p><p> 
And he could not make out what it was. Not a boat, nor a bird, nor a fish! It 
was too large for a man, and besides a man could not be out there in the midst 
of the sea. The Bishop rose, and said to the helmsman:</p><p> 
'Look there, what is that, my friend? What is it?' the Bishop repeated, though 
he could now see plainly what it was &mdash; the three hermits running upon the 
water, all gleaming white, their grey beards shining, and approaching the ship 
as quickly as though it were not morning.</p><p> 
The steersman looked and let go the helm in terror.</p><p> 
'Oh Lord! The hermits are running after us on the water as though it were dry 
land!'</p><p> 
The passengers hearing him, jumped up, and crowded to the stern. They saw the 
hermits coming along hand in hand, and the two outer ones beckoning the ship to 
stop. All three were gliding along upon the water without moving their feet. 
Before the ship could be stopped, the hermits had reached   <pb n="201"/>   it, and raising their 
heads, all three as with one voice, began to say:</p><p> 
'We have forgotten your teaching, servant of God. As long as we kept repeating 
it we remembered, but when we stopped saying it for a time, a word dropped out, 
and now it has all gone to pieces. We can remember nothing of it. Teach us 
again.'</p><p> 
The Bishop crossed himself, and leaning over the ship's side, said:</p><p> 
'Your own prayer will reach the Lord, men of God. It is not for me to teach 
you. Pray for us sinners.</p><p> 
And the Bishop bowed low before the old men; and they turned and went back 
across the sea. And a light shone until daybreak on the spot where they were 
lost to sight.</p><p>

<div2 type="story" n="13" id="d66"> 
<head>THE IMP AND THE CRUST</head> 
<p>A POOR peasant set out early one morning to plough, taking with him for his 
breakfast a crust of bread. He got his plough ready, wrapped the bread in his 
coat, put it under a bush, and set to work. After a while when his horse was 
tired and he was hungry, the peasant fixed the plough, let the horse loose to 
graze and went to get his coat and his breakfast</p><p> 
He lifted the coat, but the bread was gone! He looked and looked, turned the 
coat over, shook it out  &mdash; but the bread was gone. The peasant could not make 
this out at all.</p><p> 
'That's strange,' thought he; 'I saw no one, but all the same some one has been 
here and has taken the bread!'</p><p> 
It was an imp who had stolen the bread while the peasant was ploughing, and at 
that moment he was sitting behind the bush, waiting to hear the peasant swear 
and call on the Devil.</p><p> 
The peasant was sorry to lose his breakfast, but 'It can't be helped,' said he. 
'After all, I shan't die of hunger! No doubt whoever took the bread needed it. 
May it do him good!'</p><p> 
And he went to the well, had a drink of water, and rested a bit. Then he caught 
his horse, harnessed it, and began ploughing again.</p><p> 
The imp was crestfallen at not having made the peasant sin, and he went to 
report what had happened to the Devil, his master.</p><p> 
He came to the Devil and told how he had taken the peasant's bread, and how the 
peasant instead of cursing had said, 'May it do him good!'</p><p> 
The Devil was angry, and replied: 'If the man   <pb n="203"/>   got the better of you, it was 
your own fault &mdash; you don't understand your business! If the peasants, and 
their wives after them, take to that sort of thing, it will be all up with us. 
The matter can't be left like that! Go back at once,' said he, 'and put things 
right. If in three years you don't get the better of that peasant, I'll have 
you ducked in holy water!'</p><p> 
The imp was frightened. He scampered back to earth, thinking how he could 
redeem his fault. He thought and thought, and at last hit upon a good plan.</p><p> 
He turned himself into a labouring man, and went and took service with the poor 
peasant. The first year he advised the peasant to sow corn in a marshy place. 
The peasant took his advice, and sowed in the marsh. The year turned out a very 
dry one, and the crops of the other peasants were all scorched by the sun, but 
the poor peasant's corn grew thick and tall and full-eared. Not only had he 
grain enough to last him for the whole year, but he had much left over 
besides.</p><p> 
The next year the imp advised the peasant to sow on the hill; and it turned out 
a wet summer. Other people's corn was beaten down and rotted and the ears did 
not fill; but the peasant's crop, up on the hill, was a fine one. He had more 
grain left over than before, so that he did not know what to do with it all.</p><p> 
Then the imp showed the peasant how he could mash the grain and distil spirit 
from it; and the peasant made strong drink, and began to drink it himself and 
to give it to his friends.</p><p> 
So the imp went to the Devil, his master, and boasted that he had made up for 
his failure. The Devil said that he would come and see for himself how the case 
stood.</p><p> 
He came to the peasant's house, and saw that the   <pb n="204"/>   peasant had invited his 
well-to-do neighbours and was treating them to drink. His wife was offering the 
drink to the guests, and as she handed it round she tumbled against the table 
and spilt a glassful.</p><p> 
The peasant was angry, and scolded his wife: 'What do you mean, you slut? Do 
you think it's ditchwater, you cripple, that you must go pouring good stuff 
like that over the floor?'</p><p> 
The imp nudged the Devil, his master, with his elbow: 'See,' said he, 'that's 
the man who did not grudge his last crust!'</p><p> 
The peasant, still railing at his wife, began to carry the drink round himself. 
Just then a poor peasant returning from work came in uninvited. He greeted the 
company, sat down, and saw that they were drinking. Tired with his day's work 
he felt that he too would like a drop. He sat and sat, and his mouth kept 
watering, but the host instead of offering him any only muttered: 'I can't find 
drink for every one who comes along.'</p><p> 
This pleased the Devil; but the imp chuckled and said, 'Wait a bit, there's 
more to come yet!'</p><p> 
The rich peasants drank, and their host drank too. And they began to make 
false, oily speeches to one another.</p><p> 
The Devil listened and listened, and praised the imp.</p><p> 
'If,' said he, 'the drink makes them so foxy that they begin to cheat each 
other, they will soon all be in our hands.'</p><p> 
'Wait for what's coming,' said the imp. 'Let them have another glass all round. 
Now they are like foxes, wagging their tails and trying to get round one 
another; but presently you will see them like savage wolves.'</p><p> 
The peasants had another glass each, and their talk became wilder and rougher. 
Instead of oily   <pb n="205"/>   speeches they began to abuse and snarl at one another. Soon 
they took to fighting, and punched one another's noses. And the host joined in 
the fight, and he too got well beaten.</p><p> 
The Devil looked on and was much pleased at all this. 'This is first-rate!' 
said he.</p><p> 
But the imp replied: 'Wait a bit &mdash; the best is yet to come. Wait till they 
have had a third glass. Now they are raging like wolves, but let them have one 
more glass, and they will be like swine.'</p><p> 
The peasants had their third glass, and became quite like brutes. They muttered 
and shouted, not knowing why, and not listening to one another.</p><p> 
Then the party began to break up. Some went alone, some in twos, and some in 
threes, all staggering down the street. The host went out to speed his guests, 
but he fell on his nose into a puddle, smeared himself from top to toe, and lay 
there grunting like a hog.</p><p> 
This pleased the Devil still more.</p><p> 
'Well,' said he, 'you have hit on a first-rate drink, and have quite made up 
for your blunder about the bread. But now tell me how this drink is made. You 
must first have put in fox's blood: that was what made the peasants sly as 
foxes. Then, I suppose, you added wolf's blood: that is what made them fierce 
like wolves. And you must have finished off with swine's blood, to make them 
behave like swine.'</p><p> 
'No,' said the imp, 'that was not the way I did it. All I did was to see that 
the peasant had more corn than he needed. The blood of the beasts is always in 
man; but as long as he has only enough corn for his needs, it is kept in 
bounds. While that was the case, the peasant did not grudge his last crust. But 
when he had corn left over, he looked for ways of getting pleasure out of it. 
And I showed him a pleasure &mdash;  drinking! And when he began to turn God's good 
gifts into spirits for his own pleasure &mdash; the fox's, wolf's and swine's blood 
in him all came out. If only he goes on drinking, he will always be a beast!'</p><p> 
The Devil praised the imp, forgave him for his former blunder, and advanced him 
to a post of high honour.</p><p>

<div2 type="story" n="14" id="d67"><head>HOW MUCH LAND DOES A MAN NEED?</head> 
<div3 type="section" n="1" id="d68"> 
<p>I</p> 
<p>AN elder sister came to visit her younger sister in the country. The elder was 
married to a tradesman in town, the younger to a peasant in the village. As the 
sisters sat over their tea talking, the elder began to boast of the advantages 
of town life: saying how comfortably they lived there, how well they dressed, 
what fine clothes her children wore what good things they ate and drank, and 
how she went to the theatre, promenades, and entertainments.</p><p> 
The younger sister was piqued, and in turn disparage the life of a tradesman, 
and stood up for that of a peasant.</p><p> 
'I would not change my way of life for yours,' said she. We may live roughly, 
but at least we are free from anxiety. You live in better style than we do but 
though you often earn more than you need, you are very likely to lose all you 
have. You know the proverb, "Loss and gain are brothers twain." It often 
happens that people who are wealthy one day are begging their bread the next. 
Our way is safer. Though a peasant's life is not a fat one, it is a long one. 
We shall never grow rich, but we shall always have enough to eat.'</p><p> 
The elder sister said sneeringly:</p><p> 
'Enough? Yes, if you like to share with the pigs and the calves! What do you 
know of elegance or manners! However much your goodman may slave, you will die 
as you are living &mdash; on a dung heap &mdash; and your children the same.'</p><p> 
'Well, what of that?' replied the younger. 'Of   <pb n="208"/>   course our work is rough and 
coarse. But, on the other hand, it is sure; and we need not bow to any one. But 
you, in your towns, are surrounded by temptations; to-day all may be right, but 
to-morrow the Evil One may tempt your husband with cards, wine, or women, and 
all will go to ruin. Don't such things happen often enough?'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m, the master of the house, was lying on the top of the oven, and he 
listened to the women's chatter.</p><p> 
'It is perfectly true,' thought he. 'Busy as we are from childhood tilling 
mother earth, we peasants have no time to let any nonsense settle in our heads. 
Our only trouble is that we haven't land enough. If I had plenty of land, I 
shouldn't fear the Devil himself!'</p><p> 
The women finished their tea, chatted a while about dress, and then cleared 
away the tea-things and lay down to sleep.</p><p> 
But the Devil had been sitting behind the oven, and had heard all that was 
said. He was pleased that the peasant's wife had led her husband into boasting, 
and that he had said that if he had plenty of land he would not fear the Devil 
himself.</p><p> 
'All right,' thought the Devil. 'We will have a tussle. I'll give you land 
enough; and by means of that land I will get you into my power.'</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="2" id="d69"> 
<p> 
II</p><p>Close to the village there lived a lady, a small landowner, who had an estate 
of about three hundred acres. She had 
always lived on good terms with the peasants, until she engaged as her steward 
an old soldier, who took to burdening the people with fines. However careful 
Pah&oacute;m tried to be,   <pb n="209"/>   it happened again and again that now a horse of his 
got among the lady's oats, now a cow strayed into her garden, now his calves 
found their way into her meadows &mdash; and he always had to pay a fine.</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m paid up, but grumbled, and, going home in a temper, was rough with 
his family. All through that summer, Pah&oacute;m had much trouble because of 
this steward; and he was even glad when winter came and the cattle had to be 
stabled. Though he grudged the fodder when they could no longer graze on the 
pasture-land, at least he was free from anxiety about them.</p><p> 
In the winter the news got about that the lady was going to sell her land, and 
that the keeper of the inn on the high road was bargaining for it. When the 
peasants heard this they were very much alarmed.</p><p> 
'Well', thought they, 'if the innkeeper gets the land, he will worry us with 
fines worse than the lady's steward. We all depend on that estate.'</p><p> 
So the peasants went on behalf of their Commune and asked the lady not to sell 
the land to the innkeeper offering her a better price for it themselves. The 
lady agreed to let them have it. Then the peasants tried to arrange for the 
Commune to buy the whole estate so that it might be held by them all in common. 
They met twice to discuss it, but could not settle the matter; the Evil One 
sowed discord among them, and they could not agree. So they decided to buy the 
land individually, each according to his means; and the lady agreed to this 
plan as she had to the other.</p><p> 
Presently Pah&oacute;m heard that a neighbour of his was buying fifty acres, 
and that the lady had consented to accept one half in cash and to wait a year 
for the other half. Pah&oacute;m felt envious</p><p> 
'Look at that,' thought he, 'the land is all being   <pb n="210"/>   sold, and I shall get none 
of it.' So he spoke to his wife.</p><p> 
'Other people are buying,' said he, 'and we must also buy twenty acres or so. 
Life is becoming impossible. That steward is simply crushing us with his 
fines.'</p><p> 
So they put their heads together and considered how they could manage to buy 
it. They had one hundred r&uacute;bles laid by. They sold a colt, and one half of 
their bees; hired out one of their sons as a labourer, and took his wages in 
advance; borrowed the rest from a brother-in-law, and so scraped together half 
the purchase money.</p><p> 
Having done this, Pah&oacute;m chose out a farm of forty acres, some of it 
wooded, and went to the lady to bargain for it. They came to an agreement, and 
he shook hands with her upon it, and paid her a deposit in advance. Then they 
went to town and signed the deeds; he paying half the price down, and 
undertaking to pay the remainder within two years.</p><p> 
So now Pah&oacute;m had land of his own. He borrowed seed, and sowed it on the 
land he had bought. The harvest was a good one, and within a year he had 
managed to pay off his debts both to the lady and to his brother-in-law. So he 
became a landowner, ploughing and sowing his own land, making hay on his own 
land, cutting his own trees, and feeding his cattle on his own pasture. When he 
went out to plough his fields, or to look at his growing corn, or at his 
grass-meadows, his heart would fill with joy. The grass that grew and the 
flowers that bloomed there, seemed to him unlike any that grew elsewhere. 
Formerly, when he had passed by that land it had appeared the same as any other 
land, but now it seemed quite different.</p> 
</div3>   <pb n="211"/>  <div3 type="section" n="3" id="d70"> 
<p>III</p><p>So Pah&oacute;m was well-contented, and everything would have been right if the 
neighbouring peasants would only not have trespassed on his corn-fields and 
meadows. He appealed to them most civilly, but they still went on: now the 
Communal herdsmen would let the village cows stray into his meadows; then 
horses from the night pasture would get among his corn. Pah&oacute;m turned 
them out again and again, and forgave their owners, and for a long time he 
forbore from prosecuting any one. But at last he lost patience and complained 
to the District Court. He knew it was the peasants' want of land, and no evil 
intent on their part, that caused the trouble; but he thought:</p><p> 
'I cannot go on overlooking it, or they will destroy all I have. They must be 
taught a lesson.'</p><p> 
So he had them up, gave them one lesson, and then another, and two or three of 
the peasants were fined. After a time Pah&oacute;m's neighbours began to bear 
him a grudge for this, and would now and then let their cattle on to his land 
on purpose. One peasant even got into Pah&oacute;m's wood at night and cut down 
five young lime trees for their bark. Pah&oacute;m passing through the wood one 
day noticed something white. He came nearer, and saw the stripped trunks lying 
on the ground, and close by stood the stumps, where the trees had been. 
Pah&oacute;m was furious.</p><p> 
'If he had only cut one here and there it would have been bad enough,' thought 
Pah&oacute;m, 'but the rascal has actually cut down a whole clump. If I could 
only find out who did this, I would pay him out.'</p><p> 
He racked his brains as to who it could be. Finally he decided: 'It must be 
Simon &mdash; no one else   <pb n="212"/>   could have done it.' So he went to Simon's homestead to 
have a look round, but he found nothing, and only had an angry scene. However, 
he now felt more certain than ever that Simon had done it, and he lodged a 
complaint. Simon was summoned. The case was tried, and re-tried, and at the end 
of it all Simon was acquitted, there being no evidence against him. 
Pah&oacute;m felt still more aggrieved, and let his anger loose upon the Elder 
and the Judges.</p><p> 
'You let thieves grease your palms,' said he. 'If you were honest folk 
yourselves, you would not let a thief go free.'</p><p> 
So Pah&oacute;m quarrelled with the Judges and with his neighbours. Threats to 
burn his building began to be uttered. So though Pah&oacute;m had more land, 
his place in the Commune was much worse than before.</p><p> 
About this time a rumour got about that many people were moving to new parts.</p><p> 
'There's no need for me to leave my land,' thought Pah&oacute;m. 'But some of 
the others might leave our village and then there would be more room for us. I 
would take over their land myself, and make my estate a bit bigger. I could 
then live more at ease. As it is, I am still too cramped to be comfortable.</p><p> 
One day Pah&oacute;m was sitting at home, when a peasant, passing through the 
village, happened to call in. He was allowed to stay the night, and supper was 
given him. Pah&oacute;m had a talk with this peasant and asked him where he 
came from. The stranger answered that he came from beyond the Volga, where he 
had been working. One word led to another, and the man went on to say that many 
people were settling in those parts. He told how some people from his village 
had settled there. They had joined the Commune, and had had twenty-<pb n="213"/>  five acres 
per man granted them. The land was so good, he said, that the rye sown on it 
grew as high as a horse, and so thick that five cuts of a sickle made a sheaf. 
One peasant, he said, had brought nothing with him but his bare hands, and now 
he had six horses and two cows of his own.</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m's heart kindled with desire. He thought:</p><p> 
'Why should I suffer in this narrow hole, if one can live so well elsewhere? I 
will sell my land and my homestead here, and with the money I will start afresh 
over there and get everything new. In this crowded place one is always having 
trouble. But I must first go and find out all about it myself.</p><p> 
Towards summer he got ready and started. He went down the Volga on a steamer to 
Sam&aacute;ra, then walked another three hundred miles on foot, and at last 
reached the place. It was just as the stranger had said. The peasants had 
plenty of land: every man had twenty-five acres of Communal land given him for   <pb n="214"/>   
his use, and any one who had money could buy, besides, at two shillings an 
acre as much good freehold land as he 
wanted.</p><p> 
Having found out all he wished to know, Pah&oacute;m returned home as autumn 
came on, and began selling off his belongings. He sold his land at a profit, 
sold his homestead and all his cattle, and withdrew from membership of the 
Commune. He only waited till the spring, and then started with his family for 
the new settlement.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="4" id="d71"> 
<p>IV</p> 
<p>As soon as Pah&oacute;m and his family arrived at their new abode, he applied 
for admission into the Commune of a large village. He stood treat to the 
Elders, and obtained the necessary documents. Five shares of Communal land were 
given him for his own and his sons' use: that is to say &mdash; 125 acres (not all 
together but in different fields) besides the use of the Communal pasture. 
Pah&oacute;m put up the buildings he needed, and bought cattle. Of the Communal 
land alone he had three times as much as at his former home, and the land was 
good corn-land. He was ten times better off than he had been. He had plenty of 
arable land and pasturage, and could keep as many head of cattle as he liked.</p><p> 
At first, in the bustle of building and settling down, Pah&oacute;m was pleased 
with it all, but when he got used to it he began to think that even here he had 
not enough land. The first year, he sowed wheat on his share of the Communal 
land, and had a good crop. He wanted to go on sowing wheat, but had not enough 
Communal land for the purpose, and what he had already used was not available; 
for in those parts wheat is only sown on virgin soil or on fallow land. It is 
sown for one or two years, and then the land lies fallow till it is again 
overgrown with prairie grass. There were many who wanted such land, and there 
was not enough for all; so that people quarrelled about it. Those who were 
better off, wanted it for growing wheat, and those who were poor, wanted it to 
let to dealers, so that they might raise money to pay their taxes. Pah&oacute;m 
wanted to sow more wheat; so he rented land from a dealer for a year. He sowed 
much wheat and had a fine crop, but the land was too far from the village &mdash; 
the wheat had to be carted more than ten miles. After a time Pah&oacute;m 
noticed that some peasant-dealers were living on separate farms, and were 
growing wealthy; and he thought:</p><p> 
'If I were to buy some freehold land, and have a homestead on it, it would be a 
different thing altogether. Then it would all be nice and compact.'</p>   <pb n="215"/>  <p> 
The question of buying freehold land recurred to him again and again.</p><p> 
He went on in the same way for three years: renting land and sowing wheat. The 
seasons turned out well and the crops were good, so that he began to lay money 
by. He might have gone on living contentedly, but he grew tired of having to 
rent other people's land every year, and having to scramble for it. Wherever 
there was good land to be had, the peasants would rush for it and it was taken 
up at once, so that unless you were sharp about it you got none. It happened in 
the third year that he and a dealer together rented a piece of pasture land 
from some peasants; and they had already ploughed it up, when there was some 
dispute, and the peasants went to law about it, and things fell out so that the 
labour was all lost.</p><p> 
'If it were my own land,' thought Pah&oacute;m, 'I should be independent, and 
there would not be all this unpleasantness.'</p><p> 
So Pah&oacute;m began looking out for land which he could buy; and he came 
across a peasant who had bought thirteen hundred acres, but having got into 
difficulties was willing to sell again cheap. Pah&oacute;m bargained and 
haggled with him, and at last they settled the price at 1,500 r&uacute;bles, part in 
cash and part to be paid later. They had all but clinched the matter, when a 
passing dealer happened to stop at Pah&oacute;m's one day to get a feed for his 
horses. He drank tea with Pah&oacute;m, and they had a talk. The dealer said 
that he was just returning from the land of the Bashk&iacute;rs, far away, 
where he had bought thirteen thousand acres of land, all for 1,000 r&uacute;bles. 
Pah&oacute;m questioned him further, and the tradesman said:</p><p> 
'All one need do is to make friends with the chiefs. I gave away about one 
hundred r&uacute;bles, worth of dressing-gowns and carpets, besides a case of tea,   <pb n="216"/>   
and I gave wine to those who would drink it; and I got the land for less than 
twopence an acre. And he showed 
Pah&oacute;m the title-deeds, saying:</p><p> 
'The land lies near a river, and the whole prairie is virgin soil.'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m plied him with questions, and the tradesman said:</p><p> 
'There is more land there than you could cover if you walked a year, and it all 
belongs to the Bashk&iacute;rs. They are as simple as sheep, and land can be 
got almost for nothing.'</p><p> 
'There now,' thought Pah&oacute;m, 'with my one thousand r&uacute;bles, why should I 
get only thirteen hundred acres, and saddle myself with a debt besides. If I 
take it out there, I can get more than ten times as much for the money.'</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="5" id="d72"> 
<p> 
V</p> 
<p>Pah&oacute;m inquired how to get to the place, and as soon as the tradesman had 
left him, he prepared to go there himself. He left his wife to look after the 
homestead, and started on his journey taking his man with him. They stopped at 
a town on their way, and bought a case of tea, some wine, and other presents, 
as the tradesman had advised. On and on they went until they had gone more than 
three hundred miles, and on the seventh day they came to a place where the 
Bashk&iacute;rs had pitched their tents. It was all just as the tradesman had 
said. The people lived on the steppes, by a river, in felt-covered tents. They neither tilled the ground, nor ate 
bread. Their cattle and horses grazed in herds on the steppe. The colts were 
tethered behind the tents, and the mares were driven to them twice a day. The 
mares were milked,   <pb n="217"/>   and from the milk kumiss was made. It was the women who 
prepared kumiss, and they also made cheese. As far as the men were concerned, 
drinking kumiss and tea, eating mutton, and playing on their pipes, was all 
they cared about. They were all stout and merry, and all the summer long they 
never thought of doing any work. They were quite ignorant, and knew no Russian, 
but were good-natured enough.</p><p> 
As soon as they saw Pah&oacute;m, they came out of their tents and gathered 
round their visitor. An interpreter was found, and Pah&oacute;m told them he 
had come about some land. The Bashk&iacute;rs seemed very glad they took 
Pah&oacute;m and led him into one of the best tents, where they made him sit on 
some down cushions placed on a carpet, while they sat round him. They gave him 
tea and kumiss, and had a sheep killed, and gave him mutton to eat. 
Pah&oacute;m took presents out of his cart and distributed them among the 
Bashk&iacute;rs, and divided amongst them the tea. The Bashk&iacute;rs were 
delighted. They talked a great deal among themselves, and then told the 
interpreter to translate.</p><p> 
'They wish to tell you,' said the interpreter, 'that they like you, and that it 
is our custom to do all we can to please a guest and to repay him for his 
gifts. You have given us presents, now tell us which of the things we possess 
please you best, that we may present them to you.'</p><p> 
'What pleases me best here,' answered Pah&oacute;m 'is your land. Our land is 
crowded, and the soil is exhausted; but you have plenty of land and it is good 
land. I never saw the like of it.'</p><p> 
The interpreter translated. The Bashk&iacute;rs talked among themselves for a 
while. Pah&oacute;m could not understand what they were saying, but saw that 
they were much amused, and that they shouted   <pb n="218"/>   and laughed. Then they were silent 
and looked at Pah&oacute;m while the interpreter said:</p><p> 
'They wish me to tell you that in return for your presents they will gladly 
give you as much land as you want. You have only to point it out with your hand 
and it is yours.'</p><p> 
The Bashk&iacute;rs talked again for a while and began to dispute. Pah&oacute;m 
asked what they were disputing about, and the interpreter told him that some of 
them thought they ought to ask their Chief about the land and not act in his 
absence, while others thought there was no need to wait for his return.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="6" id="d73"> 
<p> 
VI</p> 
<p>While the Bashk&iacute;rs were disputing, a man in a large fox-fur cap appeared 
on the scene. They all became silent and rose to their feet. The interpreter 
said, 'This is our Chief himself.'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m immediately fetched the best dressing-gown and five pounds of tea, 
and offered these to the Chief. The Chief accepted them, and seated himself in 
the place of honour. The Bashk&iacute;rs at once began telling him something. 
The Chief listened for a while, then made a sign with his head for them to be 
silent, and addressing himself to Pah&oacute;m, said in Russian:</p><p> 
'Well, let it be so. Choose whatever piece of land you like; we have plenty of 
it.'</p><p> 
'How can I take as much as I like?' thought Pah&oacute;m. 'I must get a deed to 
make it secure, or else they may say, "It is yours," and afterwards may take it 
away again.'</p><p> 
'Thank you for your kind words,' he said aloud. 'You have much land, and I only 
want a little. But I should like to be sure which bit is mine. Could it not be 
measured and made over to me? Life and death are in God's hands. You good 
people   <pb n="219"/>   give it to me, but your children might wish to take it away again.'</p><p> 
'You are quite right,' said the Chief. 'We will make it over to you.'</p><p> 
'I heard that a dealer had been here,' continued Pah&oacute;m, 'and that you 
gave him a little land, too, and signed title-deeds to that effect. I should 
like to have it done in the same way.'</p><p> 
The Chief understood.</p><p> 
'Yes,' replied he, 'that can be done quite easily. We have a scribe, and we 
will go to town with you and have the deed properly sealed.'</p><p> 
'And what will be the price?' asked Pah&oacute;m.</p><p> 
'Our price is always the same: one thousand r&uacute;bles a day.'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m did not understand.</p><p> 
'A day? What measure is that? How many acres would that be?'</p><p> 
'We do not know how to reckon it out,' said the Chief. 'We sell it by the day. 
As much as you can go round on your feet in a day is yours, and the price is 
one thousand r&uacute;bles a day.'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m was surprised.</p><p> 
'But in a day you can get round a large tract of land,' he said.</p><p> 
The Chief laughed.</p><p> 
'It will all be yours!' said he. 'But there is one condition: If you don't 
return on the same day to the spot whence you started, your money is lost.'</p><p> 
'But how am I to mark the way that I have gone?'</p><p> 
'Why, we shall go to any spot you like, and stay there. You must start from 
that spot and make your round, taking a spade with you. Wherever you think 
necessary, make a mark. At every turning, dig a hole and pile up the turf; then 
afterwards we will go round with a plough from hole to hole.   <pb n="220"/>   You may make as 
large a circuit as you please, but before the sun sets you must return to the 
place you started from. All the land you cover will be yours.'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m was delighted. It was decided to start early next morning. They 
talked a while, and after drinking some more kumiss and eating some more 
mutton, they had tea again, and then the night came on. They gave Pah&oacute;m 
a feather-bed to sleep on, and the Bashk&iacute;rs dispersed for the night, 
promising to assemble the next morning at daybreak and ride out before sunrise 
to the appointed spot.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="7" id="d74"> 
<p>VII</p><p>Pah&oacute;m lay on the feather-bed, but could not sleep. He kept thinking 
about the land.</p><p> 
'What a large tract I will mark off!' thought he. 'I can easily do thirty-five 
miles in a day. The days are long now, and within a circuit of thirty-five 
miles what a lot of land there will be! I will sell the poorer land, or let it 
to peasants, but I'll pick out the best and farm it. I will buy two ox-teams, 
and hire two more labourers. About a hundred and fifty acres shall be 
plough-land, and I will pasture cattle on the rest.'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m lay awake all night, and dozed off only just before dawn. Hardly 
were his eyes closed when he had a dream. He thought he was lying in that same 
tent, and heard somebody chuckling outside. He wondered who it could be, and 
rose and went out and he saw the Bashk&iacute;r Chief sitting in front of the 
tent holding his sides and rolling about with laughter. Going nearer to the 
Chief, Pah&oacute;m asked: 'What are you laughing at?' But he saw that it was 
no longer the Chief, but the dealer who had recently stopped at his house and 
had told him   <pb n="221"/>   about the land. Just as Pah&oacute;m was going to ask, 'Have you 
been here long?' he saw that it was not the dealer, but the peasant who had 
come up from the Volga, long ago, to Pah&oacute;m's old home. Then he saw that 
it was not the peasant either, but the Devil himself with hoofs and horns 
sitting there and chuckling, and before him lay a man barefoot, prostrate on 
the ground, with only trousers and a shirt on. And Pah&oacute;m dreamt that he 
looked more attentively to see what sort of a man it was that was lying there, 
and he saw that the man was dead and that it was himself! He awoke 
horror-struck.</p><p> 
'What things one does dream,' thought he.</p><p> 
Looking round he saw through the open door that the dawn was breaking.</p><p> 
'It's time to wake them up,' thought he. 'We ought to be starting.'</p><p> 
He got up, roused his man (who was sleeping in his cart), bade him harness; and 
went to call the Bashk&iacute;rs.</p><p> 
'It's time to go to the steppe to measure the land,' he said.</p><p> 
The Bashk&iacute;rs rose and assembled, and the Chief came too. Then they began 
drinking kumiss again, and offered Pah&oacute;m some tea, but he would not 
wait.</p><p> 
'If we are to go, let us go. It is high time,' said he.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="8" id="d75"> 
<p>VIII</p><p>The Bashk&iacute;rs got ready and they all started: some mounted on horses, and 
some in carts. Pah&oacute;m drove in his own small cart with his servant, and 
took a spade with him. When they reached the steppe, the morning red was 
beginning to kindle. They ascended a hillock (called by the Bashk&iacute;rs a 
<hi rend="italic">shikhan</hi>) and dismounting from their carts and their horses, gathered in 
one spot. The Chief came   <pb n="222"/>   up to Pah&oacute;m and stretching out his arm towards 
the plain:</p><p> 
'See,' said he, 'all this, as far as your eye can reach, is ours. You may have 
any part of it you like.'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m's eyes glistened: it was all virgin soil, as flat as the palm of 
your hand, as black as the seed of a poppy, and in the hollows different kinds 
of grasses grew breast high.</p><p> 
The Chief took off his fox-fur cap, placed it on the ground and said:</p><p> 
'This will be the mark. Start from here, and return here again. All the land 
you go round shall be yours.'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m took out his money and put it on the cap. Then he took off his 
outer coat, remaining in his sleeveless under-coat. He unfastened his girdle 
and tied it tight below his stomach, put a little bag of bread into the breast 
of his coat, and tying a flask of water to his girdle, he drew up the tops of 
his boots, took the spade from his man, and stood ready to start. He considered 
for some moments which way he had better go &mdash; it was tempting everywhere.</p><p> 
'No matter,' he concluded, 'I will go towards the rising sun.'</p><p> 
He turned his face to the east, stretched himself and waited for the sun to 
appear above the rim.</p><p> 
'I must lose no time,' he thought, 'and it is easier walking while it is still 
cool.'</p><p> 
The sun's rays had hardly flashed above the horizon, before Pah&oacute;m, 
carrying the spade over his shoulder went down into the steppe.</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m started walking neither slowly nor quickly. After having gone a 
thousand yards he stopped, dug a hole, and placed pieces of turf one on another 
to make it more visible. Then he went on; and now that he had walked off his 
stiffness he   <pb n="223"/>   quickened his pace. After a while he dug another hole.</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m looked back. The hillock could be distinctly seen in the sunlight, 
with the people on it, and the glittering tyres of the cart-wheels. At a rough 
guess Pah&oacute;m concluded that he had walked three miles. It was growing 
warmer; he took off his under-coat, flung it across his shoulder, and went on 
again. It had grown quite warm now; he looked at the sun, it was time to think 
of breakfast.</p><p> 
'The first shift is done, but there are four in a day, and it is too soon yet 
to turn. But I will just take off my boots,' said he to himself.</p><p> 
He sat down, took off his boots, stuck them into his girdle, and went on. It 
was easy walking now.</p><p> 
'I will go on for another three miles,' thought he, 'and then turn to the left. 
This spot is so fine, that it would be a pity to lose it. The further one goes, 
the better the land seems.'</p><p> 
He went straight on for a while, and when he looked round, the hillock was 
scarcely visible and the people on it looked like black ants, and he could just 
see something glistening there in the sun.</p><p> 
'Ah,' thought Pah&oacute;m, 'I have gone far enough in this direction, it is 
time to turn. Besides I am in a regular sweat, and very thirsty.'</p><p> 
He stopped, dug a large hole, and heaped up pieces of turf. Next he untied his 
flask, had a drink, and then turned sharply to the left. He went on and on; the 
grass was high, and it was very hot.</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m began to grow tired: he looked at the sun and saw that it was 
noon.</p><p> 
'Well,' he thought, 'I must have a rest.'</p><p> 
He sat down, and ate some bread and drank some water; but he did not lie down, 
thinking that if he did he might fall asleep. After sitting a little while, he 
went on again. At first he walked easily: the   <pb n="224"/>  food had strengthened him; but it 
had become terribly hot, and he felt sleepy; still he went on, thinking: 'An 
hour to suffer, a life-time to live.'</p><p> 
He went a long way in this direction also, and was about to turn to the left 
again, when he perceived a damp hollow: 'It would be a pity to leave that out,' 
he thought. 'Flax would do well there.' So he went on past the hollow, and dug 
a hole on the other side of it before he turned the corner. Pah&oacute;m looked 
towards the hillock. The heat made the air hazy: it seemed to be quivering, and 
through the haze the people on the hillock could scarcely be seen.</p><p> 
'Ah!' thought Pah&oacute;m, 'I have made the sides too long; I must make this 
one shorter.' And he went along the third side stepping faster. He looked at 
the sun: it was nearly half way to the horizon, and he had not yet done two 
miles of the third side of the square. He was still ten miles from the goal.</p><p> 
'No,' he thought, 'though it will make my land lop-sided, I must hurry back in 
a straight line now. I might go too far, and as it is I have a great deal of 
land.'</p><p> 
So Pah&oacute;m hurriedly dug a hole, and turned straight towards the 
hillock.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="9" id="d76"> 
<p> 
IX</p><p>Pah&oacute;m went straight towards the hillock, but he now walked with 
difficulty. He was done up with the heat, his bare feet were cut and bruised, 
and his legs began to fail. He longed to rest, but it was impossible if he 
meant to get back before sunset. The sun waits for no man, and it was sinking 
lower and lower.</p><p> 
'Oh dear,' he thought, 'if only I have not blundered trying for too much! What 
if I am too late?'</p><p> 
He looked towards the hillock and at the sun.   <pb n="225"/>   He was still far from his goal, 
and the sun was already near the rim</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m walked on and on; it was very hard walking, but he went quicker 
and quicker. He pressed on, but was still far from the place. He began running, 
threw away his coat, his boots, his flask, and his cap, and kept only the spade 
which he used as a support.</p><p> 
'What shall I do,' he thought again, 'I have grasped too much, and ruined the 
whole affair. I can't get there before the sun sets.'</p><p> 
And this fear made him still more breathless. Pah&oacute;m went on running, his 
soaking shirt and trousers stuck to him, and his mouth was parched. His breast 
was working like a blacksmith's bellows, his heart was beating like a hammer, 
and his legs were giving way as if they did not belong to him. Pah&oacute;m was 
seized with terror lest he should die of the strain.</p><p> 
Though afraid of death, he could not stop. 'After having run all that way they 
will call me a fool if I stop now,' thought he. And he ran on and on, and drew 
near and heard the Bashk&iacute;rs yelling and shouting to him, and their cries 
inflamed his heart still more. He gathered his last strength and ran on.</p><p> 
The sun was close to the rim, and cloaked in mist looked large, and red as 
blood. Now, yes now, it was about to set! The sun was quite low, but he was 
also quite near his aim. Pah&oacute;m could already see the people on the 
hillock waving their arms to hurry him up. He could see the fox-fur cap on the 
ground, and the money on it, and the Chief sitting on the ground holding his 
sides. And Pah&oacute;m remembered his dream.</p><p> 
'There is plenty of land,' thought he, 'but will God let me live on it? I have 
lost my life, I have lost my life! I shall never reach that spot!'</p>   <pb n="226"/>  <p> 
Pah&oacute;m looked at the sun, which had reached the earth: one side of it had 
already disappeared. With all his remaining strength he rushed on, bending his 
body forward so that his legs could hardly follow fast enough to keep him from 
falling. Just as he reached the hillock it suddenly grew dark. He looked up &mdash; 
the sun had already set! He gave a cry: 'All my labour has been in vain,' 
thought he, and was about to stop, but he heard the Bashk&iacute;rs still 
shouting, and remembered that though to him, from below, the sun seemed to have 
set, they on the hillock could still see it. He took a long breath and ran up 
the hillock. It was still light there. He reached the top and saw the cap. 
Before it sat the Chief laughing and holding his sides. Again Pah&oacute;m 
remembered his dream, and he uttered a cry: his legs gave way beneath him, he 
fell forward and reached the cap with his hands.</p><p> 
'Ah, that's a fine fellow!' exclaimed the Chief 'He has gained much land!'</p><p> 
Pah&oacute;m's servant came running up and tried to raise him, but he saw that 
blood was flogging from his mouth. Pah&oacute;m was dead!</p><p> 
The Bashk&iacute;rs clicked their tongues to show their pity.</p><p> 
His servant picked up the spade and dug a grave long enough for Pah&oacute;m to 
he in, and buried him in it. Six feet from his head to his heels was all he 
needed.</p><p>

<div2 type="story" n="15" id="d77"> 
<head>A GRAIN AS BIG AS A HEN'S EGG</head> 
<p>ONE day some children found, in a ravine, a thing shaped like a grain of corn, 
with a groove down the middle, but as large as a hen's egg. A traveller passing 
by saw the thing, bought it from the children for a penny, and taking it to 
town sold it to the King as a curiosity.</p><p> 
The King called together his wise men, and told them to find out what the thing 
was. The wise men pondered and pondered and could not make head or tail of it, 
till one day, when the thing was lying on a window-sill, a hen flew in and 
pecked at it till she made a hole in it, and then every one saw that it was a 
grain of corn. The wise men went to the King and said:</p><p> 
'It is a grain of corn.'</p><p> 
At this the King was much surprised; and he ordered the learned men to find out 
when and where such corn had grown. The learned men pondered again, and 
searched in their books, but could find nothing about it. So they returned to 
the King and said:</p><p> 
'We can give you no answer. There is nothing about it in our books. You will 
have to ask the peasants; perhaps some of them may have heard from their 
fathers when and where grain grew to such a size.'</p><p> 
So the King gave orders that some very old peasant should be brought before 
him; and his servants found such a man and brought him to the King. Old and 
bent, ashy pale and toothless, he just managed with the help of two crutches to 
totter into the King's presence.</p><p> 
The King showed him the grain, but the old man   <pb n="228"/>  could hardly see it; he took it, 
however, and felt it with his hands. The King questioned him, saying:</p><p> 
'Can you tell us, old man, where such grain as this grew? Have you ever bought 
such corn, or sown such in your fields?'</p><p> 
The old man was so deaf that he could hardly hear what the King said, and only 
understood with great difficulty.</p><p> 
'No!' he answered at last, 'I never sowed nor reaped any like it in my fields, 
nor did I ever buy any such. When we bought corn, the grains were always as 
small as they are now. But you might ask my father. He may have heard where 
such grain grew.'</p><p> 
So the King sent for the old man's father, and he was found and brought before 
the King. He came walking with one crutch. The King showed him the grain, and 
the old peasant, who was still able to see, took a good look at it. And the 
King asked him:</p><p> 
'Can you not tell us, old man, where corn like this used to grow? Have you ever 
bought any like it, or sown any in your fields?'</p><p> 
Though the old man was rather hard of hearing, he still heard better than his 
son had done.</p><p> 
'No,' he said, 'I never sowed nor reaped any grain like this in my field. As to 
buying, I never bought any, for in my time money was not yet in use. Every one 
grew his own corn, and when there was any need we shared with one another. I do 
not know where corn like this grew. Ours was larger and yielded more flour than 
present-day grain, but I never saw any like this. I have, however, heard my 
father say that in his time the grain grew larger and yielded more flour than 
ours. You had better ask him.'</p><p> 
So the King sent for this old man's father,   <pb n="229"/>   and they found him too, and brought 
him before the King. He entered walking easily and without crutches: his eye 
was clear, his hearing good, and he spoke distinctly. The King showed him the 
grain, and the old grandfather looked at it, and turned it about in his hand.</p><p> 
'It is long since I saw such a fine grain,' said he, and he bit a piece off and 
tasted it.</p><p> 
'It's the very same kind,' he added.</p><p> 
'Tell me, grandfather,' said the King, 'when and where was such corn grown? 
Have you ever bought any like it, or sown any in your fields?'</p><p> 
And the old man replied:</p><p> 
'Corn like this used to grow everywhere in my time. I lived on corn like this 
in my young days, and fed others on it. It was grain like this that we used to 
sow and reap and thrash.'</p><p> 
And the King asked:</p><p> 
'Tell me, grandfather, did you buy it anywhere, or did you grow it all 
yourself?'</p><p> 
The old man smiled.</p><p> 
'In my time,' he answered, 'no one ever thought of such a sin as buying or 
selling bread; and we knew nothing of money. Each man had corn enough of his 
own.'</p><p> 
'Then tell me, grandfather,' asked the King, 'where was your field, where did 
you grow corn like this?'</p><p> 
And the grandfather answered:</p><p> 
'My field was God's earth. Wherever I ploughed, there was my field. Land was 
free. It was a thing no man called his own. Labour was the only thing men 
called their own.'</p><p> 
'Answer me two more questions,' said the King. 'The first is, Why did the earth 
bear such grain then and has ceased to do so now? And the second is, Why your 
grandson walks with two crutches, your   <pb n="230"/>   son with one, and you yourself with 
none? Your eyes are bright, your teeth sound, and your speech clear and 
pleasant to the ear. How have these things come about?'</p><p> 
And the old man answered:</p><p> 
'These things are so, because men have ceased to live by their own labour, and 
have taken to depending on the labour of others. In the old time, men lived 
according to God's law. They had what was their own, and coveted not what 
others had produced.</p><p>

I</p> 
<p>A SON was born to a poor peasant. He was glad and went to his neighbour to ask 
him to stand godfather to the boy. The neighbour refused &mdash; he did not like 
standing godfather to a poor man's child. The peasant asked another neighbour, 
but he too refused, and after that the poor father went to every house in the 
village, but found no one willing to be godfather to his son. So he set off to 
another village, and on the way he met a man who stopped and said:</p><p> 
'Good-day, my good man; where are you off to?'</p><p> 
'God has given me a child,' said the peasant, 'to rejoice my eyes in youth, to 
comfort my old age, and to pray for my soul after death. But I am poor, and no 
one in our village will stand godfather to him, so I am now on my way to seek a 
godfather for him elsewhere.'</p><p> 
'Let me be godfather,' said the stranger.</p><p> 
The peasant was glad, and thanked him, but added: 'And whom shall I ask to be 
godmother?'</p><p> 
'Go to the town,' replied the stranger, 'and, in the square, you will see a 
stone house with shop-windows in the front. At the entrance you will find the 
tradesman to whom it belongs. Ask him to let his daughter stand godmother to 
your child.'</p><p> 
The peasant hesitated.</p><p> 
'How can I ask a rich tradesman?' said he. 'He will despise me, and will not 
let his daughter come.'</p><p> 
'Don't trouble about that. Go and ask. Get everything ready by to-morrow 
morning, and I will come to the christening.'</p><p> 
The poor peasant returned home, and then drove to the town to find the 
tradesman. He had hardly taken his horse into the yard, when the tradesman 
himself came out.</p><p> 
'What do you want?' said he.</p><p> 
'Why, sir,' said the peasant, 'you see God has given me a son to rejoice my 
eyes in youth, to comfort my old age, and to pray for my soul after death. Be 
so kind as to let your daughter stand godmother to him.</p><p> 
'And when is the christening?' said the tradesman.</p><p> 
'To-morrow morning.'</p><p> 
'Very well. Go in peace. She shall be with you at Mass to-morrow morning.'</p><p> 
The next day the godmother came, and the godfather also, and the infant was 
baptized. Immediately after the christening the godfather went away. They did 
not know who he was, and never saw him again.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="2" id="d80"><p> 
II</p><p> 
The child grew up to be a joy to his parents. He was strong, willing to work, 
clever and obedient. When he was ten years old his parents sent him to school 
to learn to read and write. What others learnt in five years, he learnt in one, 
and soon there was nothing more they could teach him.</p><p> 
Easter came round, and the boy went to see his godmother, to give her his 
Easter greeting.</p><p> 
'Father and mother,' said he when he got home again, 'where does my godfather 
live? I should like to give him my Easter greeting, too.'</p>   <pb n="233"/>  <p> 
And his father answered:</p><p> 
'We know nothing about your godfather, dear son. We often regret it ourselves. 
Since the day you were christened we have never seen him, nor had any news of 
him. We do not know where he lives, or even whether he is still alive.'</p><p> 
The son bowed to his parents.</p><p> 
'Father and mother,' said he, 'let me go and look for my godfather. I must find 
him and give him my Easter greeting.</p><p> 
So his father and mother let him go, and the boy set off to find his 
godfather.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="3" id="d81"><p> 
III</p><p> 
The boy left the house and set out along the road. He had been walking for 
several hours when he met a stranger who stopped him and said:</p><p> 
'Good-day to you, my boy. Where are you going?'</p><p> 
And the boy answered:</p><p> 
'I went to see my godmother and to give her my Easter greeting, and when I got 
home I asked my parents where my godfather lives, that I might go and greet him 
also. They told me they did not know. They said he went away as soon as I was 
christened, and they know nothing about him, not even if he be still alive. But 
I wished to see my godfather, and so I have set out to look for him.'</p><p> 
Then the stranger said: 'I am your godfather.'</p><p> 
The boy was glad to hear this. After kissing his godfather three times for an 
Easter greeting, he asked him:</p><p> 
'Which way are you going now, godfather? If you are coming our way, please come 
to our house; but if you are going home, I will go with you.'</p><p> 
'I have no time now,' replied his godfather, 'to come to your house. I have 
business in several   <pb n="234"/>   villages; but I shall return home again to-morrow. Come and 
see me then.'</p><p> 
'But how shall I find you, godfather?'</p><p> 
'When you leave home, go straight towards the rising sun, and you will come to 
a forest; going through the forest you will come to a glade. When you reach 
this glade sit down and rest awhile, and look around you and see what happens. 
On the further side of the forest you will find a garden, and in it a house 
with a golden roof. That is my home. Go up to the gate, and I will myself be 
there to meet you.'</p><p> 
And having said this the godfather disappeared from his godson's sight.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="4" id="d82"><p> 
IV</p><p> 
The boy did as his godfather had told him. He walked eastward until he reached 
a forest, and there he came to a glade, and in the midst of the glade he saw a 
pine tree to a branch of which was tied a rope supporting a heavy log of oak. 
Close under this log stood a wooden trough filled with honey. Hardly had the 
boy had time to wonder why the honey was placed there, and why the log hung 
above it, when he heard a crackling in the wood, and saw some bears 
approaching; a she-bear, followed by a yearling and three tiny cubs. The 
she-bear, sniffing the air, went straight to the trough, the cubs following 
her. She thrust her muzzle into the honey, and called the cubs to do the same. 
They scampered up and began to eat. As they did so, the log, which the she-bear 
had moved aside with her head, swung away a little and, returning, gave the 
cubs a push. Seeing this the she-bear shoved the log away with her paw. It 
swung further out and returned more forcibly, striking one cub on the back and 
another on the   <pb n="235"/>   head. The cubs ran away howling with pain, and the mother, with 
a growl, caught the log in her fore paws and, raising it above her head flung 
it away. The log flew high in the air and the yearling, rushing to the trough, 
pushed his muzzle into the honey and began to suck noisily. The others also 
drew near, but they had not reached the trough when the log, flying back, 
struck the yearling on the head and killed him. The mother growled louder than 
before and, seizing the log, flung it from her with all her might. It flew 
higher than the branch it was tied to; so high that the rope slackened; and the 
she-bear returned to the trough, and the little cubs after her. The log flew 
higher and higher, then stopped, and began to fall. The nearer it came the 
faster it swung, and at last, at full speed, it crashed down on her head. The 
she-bear rolled over, her legs jerked and she died! The cubs ran away into the 
forest.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="5" id="d83"><p> 
V</p><p> 
The boy watched all this in surprise, and then continued his way. Leaving the 
forest, he came upon a large garden in the midst of which stood a lofty palace 
with a golden roof. At the gate stood his godfather, smiling. He welcomed his 
godson, and led him through the gateway into the garden. The boy had never 
dreamed of such beauty and delight as surrounded him in that place.</p><p> 
Then his godfather led him into the palace, which was even more beautiful 
inside than outside. The godfather showed the boy through all the rooms: each 
brighter and finer than the other, but at last they came to one door that was 
sealed up.</p><p> 
'You see this door,' said he. 'It is not locked, but only sealed. It can be 
opened, but I forbid you to open it. You may live here, and go where you   <pb n="236"/>   please 
and enjoy all the delights of the place. My only command is &mdash; do not open that 
door! But should you ever do so, remember what you saw in the forest.'</p><p> 
Having said this the godfather went away. The godson remained in the palace, 
and life there was so bright and joyful that he thought he had only been there 
three hours, when he had really lived there thirty years. When thirty years had 
gone by, the godson happened to be passing the sealed door one day, and he 
wondered why his godfather had forbidden him to enter that room.</p><p> 
'I'll just look in and see what is there,' thought he, and he gave the door a 
push. The seals gave way, the door opened, and the godson entering saw a hall 
more lofty and beautiful than all the others, and in the midst of it a throne. 
He wandered about the hall for a while, and then mounted the steps and seated 
himself upon the throne. As he sat there he noticed a sceptre leaning against 
the throne, and took it in his hand. Hardly had he done so when the four walls 
of the hall suddenly disappeared. The godson looked around, and saw the whole 
world, and all that men were doing in it. He looked in front, and saw the sea 
with ships sailing on it. He looked to the right, and saw where strange heathen 
people lived. He looked to the left, and saw where men who were Christians, but 
not Russians, lived. He looked round, and on the fourth side, he saw Russian 
people, like himself.</p><p> 
'I will look,' said he, 'and see what is happening at home, and whether the 
harvest is good.'</p><p> 
He looked towards his father's fields and saw the sheaves standing in stooks. 
He began counting them to see whether there was much corn, when he noticed a 
peasant driving in a cart. It was night,   <pb n="237"/>   and the godson thought it was his 
father coming to cart the corn by night. But as he looked he recognized 
Vas&iacute;ly Koudryash&oacute;f, the thief, driving into the field and 
beginning to load the sheaves on to his cart. This made the godson angry, and 
he called out:</p><p> 
'Father, the sheaves are being stolen from our field!'</p><p> 
His father, who was out with the horses in the night-pasture, woke up.</p><p> 
'I dreamt the sheaves were being stolen,' said he. 'I will just ride down and 
see.'</p><p> 
So he got on a horse and rode out to the field. Finding Vas&iacute;ly there, he 
called together other peasants to help him, and Vas&iacute;ly was beaten, 
bound, and taken to prison.</p><p> 
Then the godson looked at the town, where his godmother lived. He saw that she 
was now married to a tradesman. She lay asleep, and her husband rose and went 
to his mistress. The godson shouted to her:</p><p> 
'Get up, get up, your husband has taken to evil ways.'</p><p> 
The godmother jumped up and dressed, and finding out where her husband was, she 
shamed and beat his mistress, and drove him away.</p><p> 
Then the godson looked for his mother, and saw her lying asleep in her cottage. 
And a thief crept into the cottage and began to break open the chest in which 
she kept her things. The mother awoke and screamed, and the robber seizing an 
axe, swung it over his head to kill her.</p><p> 
The godson could not refrain from hurling the sceptre at the robber. It struck 
him upon the temple, and killed him on the spot.</p> 
</div3>   <pb n="238"/>  <div3 type="section" n="6" id="d84"><p> 
VI</p><p> 
As soon as the godson had killed the robber, the walls closed and the hall 
became just as it had been before.</p><p> 
Then the door opened and the godfather entered, and coming up to his godson he 
took him by the hand and led him down from the throne.</p><p> 
'You have not obeyed my command,' said he. 'You did one wrong thing, when you 
opened the forbidden door; another, when you mounted the throne and took my 
sceptre into your hands; and you have now done a third wrong, which has much 
increased the evil in the world. Had you sat here an hour longer, you would 
have ruined half mankind.'</p><p> 
Then the godfather led his godson back to the throne, and took the sceptre in 
his hand; and again the walls fell asunder and all things became visible. And 
the godfather said:</p><p> 
'See what you have done to your father. Vas&iacute;ly has now been a year in 
prison, and has come out having learnt every kind of wickedness, and has become 
quite incorrigible. See, he has stolen two of your father's horses, and he is 
now setting fire to his barn. All this you have brought upon your father.'</p><p> 
The godson saw his father's barn breaking into flames, but his godfather shut 
off the sight from him, and told him to look another way.</p><p> 
'Here is your godmother's husband,' he said. 'It is a year since he left his 
wife, and now he goes after other women. His former mistress has sunk to still 
lower depths. Sorrow has driven his wife to drink. That's what you have done to 
your godmother.'</p><p> 
The godfather shut off this also, and showed the   <pb n="239"/>   godson his father's house. 
There he saw his mother weeping for her sins, repenting, and saying:</p><p> 
'It would have been better had the robber killed me that night. I should not 
have sinned so heavily.'</p><p> 
'That,' said the godfather, 'is what you have done to your mother.'</p><p> 
He shut this off also, and pointed downwards; and the godson saw two warders 
holding the robber in front of a prison-house.</p><p> 
And the godfather said:</p><p> 
'This man had murdered ten men. He should have expiated his sins himself, but 
by killing him you have taken his sins on yourself. Now you must answer for all 
his sins. That is what you have done to yourself. The she-bear pushed the log 
aside once, and disturbed her cubs; she pushed it again, and killed her 
yearling; she pushed it a third time, and was killed herself. You have done the 
same. Now I give you thirty years to go into the world and atone for the 
robber's sins. If you do not atone for them, you will have to take his 
place.'</p><p> 
'How am I to atone for his sins?' asked the godson.</p><p> 
And the godfather answered:</p><p> 
'When you have rid the world of as much evil as you have brought into it, you 
will have atoned both for your own sins and for those of the robber.'</p><p> 
'How can I destroy evil in the world?' the godson asked.</p><p> 
'Go out,' replied the godfather, 'and walk straight towards the rising sun. 
After a time you will come to a field with some men in it. Notice what they are 
doing, and teach them what you know. Then go on and note what you see. On the 
fourth day you will come to a forest. In the midst of the forest is a cell and 
in the cell lives a hermit. Tell him all that has happened. He will teach you 
what to do. When you have done all he tells you,   <pb n="240"/>   you will have atoned for your 
own and the robber's sins.'</p><p> 
And, having said this, the godfather led his godson out of the gate.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="7" id="d85"><p> 
VII</p><p> 
The godson went his way, and as he went he thought: How am I to destroy evil in 
the world? Evil is destroyed by banishing evil men, keeping them in prison, or 
putting them to death. How then am I to destroy evil without taking the sins of 
others upon myself?'</p><p> 
The godson pondered over it for a long time, but could come to no conclusion. 
He went on until he came to a field where corn was growing thick and good and 
ready for the reapers. The godson saw that a little calf had got in among the 
corn. Some men who were at hand saw it, and mounting their horses they chased 
it backwards and forwards through the corn. Each time the calf was about to 
come out of the corn some one rode up and the calf got frightened and turned 
back again, and they all galloped after it, trampling down the corn. On the 
road stood a woman crying.</p><p> 
'They will chase my calf to death,' she said.</p><p> 
And the godson said to the peasants:</p><p> 
'What are you doing? Come out of the cornfield all of you, and let the woman 
call her calf.'</p><p> 
The men did so; and the woman came to the edge of the cornfield and called to 
the calf. 'Come along browney, come along,' said she. The calf pricked up its 
ears, listened a while, and then ran towards the woman of its own accord, and 
hid its head in her skirts, almost knocking her over. The men were glad the 
woman was glad, and so was the little calf.</p>   <pb n="241"/>  <p> 
The godson went on, and he thought:</p><p> 
'Now I see that evil spreads evil. The more people try to drive away evil, the 
more the evil grows. Evil, it seems, cannot be destroyed by evil; but in what 
way it can be destroyed, I do not know. The calf obeyed its mistress and so all 
went well; but if it had not obeyed her, how could we have got it out of the 
field?'</p><p> 
The godson pondered again, but came to no conclusion, and continued his way.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="8" id="d86"><p> 
VIII</p><p> 
He went on until he came to a village. At the furthest end he stopped and asked 
leave to stay the night. The woman of the house was there alone, 
house-cleaning, and she let him in. The godson entered, and taking his seat 
upon the brick oven he watched what the woman was doing. He saw her finish 
scrubbing the room and begin scrubbing the table. Having done this, she began 
wiping the table with a dirty cloth. She wiped it from side to side &mdash;  but it 
did not come clean. The soiled cloth left streaks of dirt. Then she wiped it 
the other way. The first streaks disappeared, but others came in their place. 
Then she wiped it from one end to the other, but again the same thing happened. 
The soiled cloth messed the table; when one streak was wiped off another was 
left on. The godson watched for awhile in silence, and then said:</p><p> 
'What are you doing, mistress?'</p><p> 
'Don't you see I'm cleaning up for the holiday. Only I can't manage this table, 
it won't come clean. I'm quite tired out.'</p><p> 
'You should rinse your cloth,' said the godson, 'before you wipe the table with 
it.'</p><p> 
The woman did so, and soon had the table clean.</p><p> 
'Thank you for telling me,' said she.</p>   <pb n="242"/>  <p> 
In the morning he took leave of the woman and went on his way. After walking a 
good while, he came to the edge of a forest. There he saw some peasants who 
were making wheel-rims of bent wood. Coming nearer, the godson saw that the men 
were going round and round, but could not bend the wood.</p><p> 
He stood and looked on, and noticed that the block, to which the piece of wood 
was fastened, was not fixed, but as the men moved round it went round too. Then 
the godson said:</p><p> 
'What are you doing, friends?'</p><p> 
'Why, don't you see, we are making wheel rims. We have twice steamed the wood, 
and are quite tired out, but the wood will not bend.'</p><p> 
'You should fix the block, friends,' said the godson, 'or else it goes round 
when you do.'</p><p> 
The peasants took his advice and fixed the block, and then the work went on 
merrily.</p><p> 
The godson spent the night with them, and then went on. He walked all day and 
all night, and just before dawn he came upon some drovers encamped for the 
night, and lay down beside them. He saw that they had got all their cattle 
settled, and were trying to light a fire. They had taken dry twigs and lighted 
them, but before the twigs had time to burn up, they smothered them with damp 
brushwood. The brushwood hissed and the fire smouldered and went out. Then the 
drovers brought more dry wood, lit it, and again put on the brushwood &mdash; and 
again the fire went out. They struggled with it for a long time, but could not 
get the fire to burn. Then the godson said:</p><p> 
'Do not be in such a hurry to put on the brushwood. Let the dry wood burn up 
properly before you put any on. When the fire is well alight you can put on as 
much as you please.'</p>   <pb n="243"/>  <p> 
The drovers followed his advice. They let the fire burn up fiercely before 
adding the brushwood, which then flared up so that they soon had a roaring 
fire.</p><p> 
The godson remained with them for a while, and then continued his way. He went 
on, wondering what the three things he had seen might mean; but he could not 
fathom them.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="9" id="d87"><p> 
IX</p><p> 
The godson walked the whole of that day, and in the evening came to another 
forest. There he found a hermit's cell, at which he knocked.</p><p> 
'Who is there?' asked a voice from within.</p><p> 
'A great sinner,' replied the godson. I must atone for another's sins as well 
as for my own.</p><p> 
The hermit hearing this came out.</p><p> 
'What sins are those that you have to bear for another?'</p><p> 
The godson told him everything: about his godfather; about the she-bear with 
the cubs; about the throne in the sealed room; about the commands his godfather 
had given him, as well as about the peasants he had seen trampling down the 
corn, and the calf that ran out when its mistress called it.</p><p> 
'I have seen that one cannot destroy evil by evil,' said he, 'but I cannot 
understand how it is to be destroyed. Teach me how it can be done.</p><p> 
'Tell me,' replied the hermit, 'what else you have seen on your way.'</p><p> 
The godson told him about the woman washing the table, and the men making 
cart-wheels, and the drovers fighting their fire.</p><p> 
The hermit listened to it all, and then went back to his cell and brought out 
an old jagged axe.</p><p> 
'Come with me,' said he.</p><p> 
When they had gone some way, the hermit pointed to a tree.</p>   <pb n="244"/>  <p> 
'Cut it down,' he said.</p><p> 
The godson felled the tree.</p><p> 
'Now chop it into three,' said the hermit.</p><p> 
The godson chopped the tree into three pieces. Then the hermit went back to his 
cell, and brought out some blazing sticks.</p><p> 
'Burn those three logs,' said he.</p><p> 
So the godson made a fire, and burnt the three logs till only three charred 
stumps remained.</p><p> 
'Now plant them half in the ground, like this.'</p><p> 
The godson did so.</p><p> 
'You see that river at the foot of the hill. Bring water from there in your 
mouth, and water these stumps. Water this stump, as you taught the woman: this 
one as you taught the wheel-wrights: and this one, as you taught the drovers. 
When all three have taken root and from these charred stumps apple-trees have 
sprung you will know how to destroy evil in men, and will have atoned for all 
your sins.'</p><p> 
Having said this, the hermit returned to his cell. The godson pondered for a 
long time, but could not understand what the hermit meant. Nevertheless he set 
to work to do as he had been told.</p><p> 
The godson went down to the river, filled his mouth with water, and returning, 
emptied it on to one of the charred stumps. This he did again and again, and 
watered all three-stumps. When he was hungry and quite tired out, he went to 
the cell to ask the old hermit for some food. He opened the door, and there 
upon a bench he saw the old man lying dead. The godson looked round for food, 
and he found some dried bread and ate a little of it. Then he took a spade and 
set to work to dig the hermit's grave. During the night he carried water   <pb n="245"/>   and 
watered the stumps, and in the day he dug the grave. He had hardly finished the 
grave and was about to bury the corpse, when some people from the village came, 
bringing food for the old man.</p><p> 
The people heard that the old hermit was dead, and that he had given the godson 
his blessing, and left him in his place. So they buried the old man, gave the 
bread they had brought to the godson, and promising to bring him some more, 
they went away.</p><p> 
The godson remained in the old man's place. There he lived, eating the food 
people brought him, and doing as he had been told: carrying water from the 
river in his mouth and watering the charred stumps.</p><p> 
He lived thus for a year, and many people visited him. His fame spread abroad, 
as a holy man who lived in the forest and brought water from the bottom of a 
hill in his mouth to water charred stumps for the salvation of his soul. People 
flocked to see him. Rich merchants drove up bringing him presents, but he kept 
only the barest necessaries for himself, and gave the rest away to the poor.</p><p> 
And so the godson lived: carrying water in his mouth and watering the stumps 
half the day, and resting and receiving people the other half. And he began to 
think that this was the way he had been told to live, in order to destroy evil 
and atone for his sins.</p><p> 
He spent two years in this manner, not omitting for a single day to water the 
stumps. But still not one of them sprouted.</p><p> 
One day, as he sat in his cell, he heard a man ride past, singing as he went. 
The godson came out to see what sort of a man it was. He saw a strong young 
fellow, well dressed, and mounted on a handsome, well-saddled horse.</p>   <pb n="246"/>  <p> 
The godson stopped him, and asked him who he was, and where he was going.</p><p> 
'I am a robber,' the man answered, drawing rein. 'I ride about the highways 
killing people; and the more I kill, the merrier are the songs I sing.'</p><p> 
The godson was horror-struck, and thought:</p><p> 
'How can the evil be destroyed in such a man as this? It is easy to speak to 
those who come to me of their own accord and confess their sins. But this one 
boasts of the evil he does.'</p><p> 
So he said nothing, and turned away, thinking: 'What am I to do now? This 
robber may take to riding about here, and he will frighten away the people. 
They will leave off coming to me. It will be a loss to them, and I shall not 
know how to live.'</p><p> 
So the godson turned back, and said to the robber:</p><p> 
'People come to me here, not to boast of their sins, but to repent, and to pray 
for forgiveness. Repent of your sins, if you fear God; but if there is no 
repentance in your heart, then go away and never come here again. Do not 
trouble me, and do not frighten people away from me. If you do not hearken, God 
will punish you.'</p><p> 
The robber laughed:</p><p> 
'I am not afraid of God, and I will not listen to you. You are not my master,' 
said he. 'You live by your piety, and I by my robbery. We all must live. You 
may teach the old women who come to you, but you have nothing to teach me. And 
because you have reminded me of God, I will kill two more men tomorrow. I would 
kill you, but I do not want to soil my hands just now. See that in future you 
keep out of my way!'</p><p> 
Having uttered this threat, the robber rode away. He did not come again, and 
the godson lived in peace, as before, for eight more years.</p> 
</div3>   <pb n="247"/>  <div3 type="section" n="11" id="d88"><p> 
XI</p><p> 
One night the godson watered his stumps, and, after returning to his cell, he 
sat down to rest, and watched the footpath, wondering if some one would soon 
come. But no one came at all that day. He sat alone till evening, feeling 
lonely and dull, and he thought about his past life. Ho remembered how the 
robber had reproached him for living by his piety; and he reflected on his way 
of life. 'I am not living as the hermit commanded me to,' thought he. 'The 
hermit laid a penance upon me, and I have made both a living and fame out of 
it; and have been so tempted by it, that now I feel dull when people do not 
come to me; and when they do come, I only rejoice because they praise my 
holiness. That is not how one should live. I have been led astray by love of 
praise. I have not atoned for my past sins, but have added fresh ones. I will 
go to another part of the forest where people will not find me; and I will live 
so as to atone for my old sins and commit no fresh ones.'</p><p> 
Having come to this conclusion the godson filled a bag with dried bread and, 
taking a spade, left the cell and started for a ravine he knew of in a lonely 
spot, where he could dig himself a cave and hide from the people.</p><p> 
As he was going along with his bag and his spade he saw the robber riding 
towards him. The godson was frightened, and started to run away, but the robber 
overtook him.</p><p> 
'Where are you going?' asked the robber.</p><p> 
The godson told him he wished to get away from the people and live somewhere 
where no one would come to him. This surprised the robber.</p><p> 
'What will you live on, if people do not come to see you?' asked he.</p>   <pb n="248"/>  <p> 
The godson had not even thought of this, but the robber's question reminded him 
that food would be necessary.</p><p> 
'On what God pleases to give me,' he replied.</p><p> 
The robber said nothing, and rode away.</p><p> 
'Why did I not say anything to him about his way of life?' thought the godson. 
'He might repent now. To-day he seems in a gentler mood, and has not threatened 
to kill me.' And he shouted to the robber:</p><p> 
'You have still to repent of your sins. You cannot escape from God.'</p><p> 
The robber turned his horse, and drawing a knife from his girdle threatened the 
hermit with it. The latter was alarmed, and ran away further into the forest.</p><p> 
The robber did not follow him, but only shouted:</p><p> 
'Twice I have let you off, old man, but next time you come in my way I will 
kill you!'</p><p> 
Having said this, he rode away. In the evening when the godson went to water 
his stumps &mdash; one of them was sprouting! A little apple tree was growing out of 
it.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="12" id="d89"><p> 
XII</p><p> 
After hiding himself from everybody, the godson lived all alone. When his 
supply of bread was exhausted, he thought: 'Now I must go and look for some 
roots to eat.' He had not gone far, however, before he saw a bag of dried bread 
hanging on a branch. He took it down, and as long as it lasted he lived upon 
that.</p><p> 
When he had eaten it all, he found another bagful on the same branch. So he 
lived on, his only trouble being his fear of the robber. Whenever he heard the 
robber passing he hid thinking:</p><p> 
'He may kill me before I have had time to atone for my sins.'</p>   <pb n="249"/>  <p> 
In this way he lived for ten more years. The one apple-tree continued to grow, 
but the other two stumps remained exactly as they were.</p><p> 
One morning the godson rose early and went to his work. By the time he had 
thoroughly moistened the ground round the stumps, he was tired out and sat down 
to rest. As he sat there he thought to himself:</p><p> 
'I have sinned, and have become afraid of death. It may be God's will that I 
should redeem my sins by death.'</p><p> 
Hardly had this thought crossed his mind when he heard the robber riding up, 
swearing at something. When the godson heard this, he thought:</p><p> 
'No evil and no good can befall me from any one but from God.'</p><p> 
And he went to meet the robber. He saw the robber was not alone, but behind him 
on the saddle sat another man, gagged, and bound hand and foot. The man was 
doing nothing, but the robber was abusing him violently. The godson went up and 
stood in front of the horse.</p><p> 
'Where are you taking this man?' he asked.</p><p> 
'Into the forest,' replied the robber. 'He is a merchant's son, and will not 
tell me where his father's money is hidden. I am going to flog him till he 
tells me.'</p><p> 
And the robber spurred on his horse, but the godson caught hold of his bridle, 
and would not let him pass.</p><p> 
'Let this man go!' he said.</p><p> 
The robber grew angry, and raised his arm to strike.</p><p> 
'Would you like a taste of what I am going to give this man? Have I not 
promised to kill you? Let go!'</p><p> 
The godson was not afraid.</p>   <pb n="250"/>  <p> 
'You shall not go,' said he. 'I do not fear you. I fear no one but God, and He 
wills that I should not let you pass. Set this man free!'</p><p> 
The robber frowned, and snatching out his knife, cut the ropes with which the 
merchant's son was bound, and set him free.</p><p> 
'Get away both of you,' he said, 'and beware hour you cross my path again.'</p><p> 
The merchant's son jumped down and ran away. The robber was about to ride on, 
but the godson stopped him again, and again spoke to him about giving up his 
evil life. The robber heard him to the end in silence, and then rode away 
without a word.</p><p> 
The next morning the godson went to water his stumps and lo! the second stump 
was sprouting. A second young apple-tree had begun to grow.</p> 
</div3><div3 type="section" n="13" id="d90"><p> 
XIII</p><p> 
Another ten years had gone by. The godson was sitting quietly one day, desiring 
nothing, fearing nothing, and with a heart full of joy.</p><p> 
'What blessings God showers on men!' thought he. 'Yet how needlessly they 
torment themselves. What prevents them from living happily?'</p><p> 
And remembering all the evil in men, and the troubles they bring upon 
themselves, his heart filled with pity.</p><p> 
'It is wrong of me to live as I do,' he said to himself. 'I must go and teach 
others what I have myself learnt.'</p><p> 
Hardly had he thought this, when he heard the robber approaching. He let him 
pass, thinking:</p><p> 
'It is no good talking to him, he will not understand.'</p><p> 
That was his first thought, but ho changed his mind and went out into the road. 
He saw that the   <pb n="251"/>   robber was gloomy, and was riding with downcast eyes. The 
godson looked at him, pitied him, and running up to him laid his hand upon his 
knee.</p><p> 
'Brother, dear,' said he, 'have some pity on your own soul! In you lives the 
spirit of God. You suffer, and torment others, and lay up more and more 
suffering for the future. Yet God loves you, and has prepared such blessings 
for you. Do not ruin yourself utterly. Change your life!'</p><p> 
The robber frowned and turned away.</p><p> 
'Leave me alone!' said he.</p><p> 
But the godson held the robber still faster, and began to weep.</p><p> 
Then the robber lifted his eyes and looked at the godson. He looked at him for 
a long time, and alighting from his horse, fell on his knees at the godson's 
feet.</p><p> 
'You have overcome me, old man,' said he. 'For twenty years I have resisted 
you, but now you have conquered me. Do what you will with me, for I have no 
more power over myself. When you first tried to persuade me, it only angered me 
more. Only when you hid yourself from men did I begin to consider your words: 
for I saw then that you asked nothing of them for yourself. Since that day I 
have brought food for you, hanging it upon the tree.'</p><p> 
Then the godson remembered that the woman got her table clean only after she 
had rinsed her cloth. In the same way, it was only when he ceased caring about 
himself, and cleansed his own heart, that he was able to cleanse the hearts of 
others.</p><p> 
The robber went on.</p><p> 
'When I saw that you did not fear death, my heart turned.'</p><p> 
Then the godson remembered that the wheel-wrights could not bend the rims until 
they had   <pb n="252"/>   fixed their block. So, not till he had cast away the fear of death and 
made his life fast in God, could he subdue this man's unruly heart.</p><p> 
'But my heart did not quite melt,' continued the robber, 'until you pitied me 
and wept for me.'</p><p> 
The godson, full of joy, led the robber to the place where the stumps were. And 
when they got there, they saw that from the third stump an apple-tree had begun 
to sprout. And the godson remembered that the drovers had not been able to 
light the damp wood until the fire had burnt up well. So it was only when his 
own heart burnt warmly, that another's heart had been kindled by it.</p><p> 
And the godson was full of joy that he had at last atoned for his sins.</p><p> 
He told all this to the robber, and died. The robber buried him, and lived as 
the godson had commanded him, teaching to others what the godson had taught 
him.</p><p>

<head>THE REPENTANT SINNER</head> 
<p><q>'And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdom. 
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in 
paradise.' &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Luke</hi> xxiii. 42, 43.</q></p> 
<p>THERE was once a man who lived for seventy years in the world, and lived in sin 
all that time. He fell ill but even then did not repent. Only at the last 
moment, as he was dying, he wept and said:</p><p> 
'Lord! forgive me, as Thou forgavest the thief upon the cross.'</p><p> 
And as he said these words, his soul left his body. And the soul of the sinner, 
feeling love towards God and faith in His mercy, went to the gates of heaven 
and knocked, praying to be let into the heavenly kingdom.</p><p> 
Then a voice spoke from within the gate:</p><p> 
'What man is it that knocks at the gates of Paradise and what deeds did he do 
during his life?'</p><p> 
And the voice of the Accuser replied, recounting all the man's evil deeds, and 
not a single good one.</p><p> 
And the voice from within the gates answered:</p><p> 
'Sinners cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven. Go hence!'</p><p> 
Then the man said:</p><p> 
'Lord, I hear thy voice, but cannot see thy face, nor do I know thy name.'</p><p> 
The voice answered:</p><p> 
'I am Peter, the Apostle.'</p><p> 
And the sinner replied:</p><p> 
'Have pity on me, Apostle Peter! Remember man's weakness, and God's mercy. Wert 
not thou a disciple of Christ? Didst not thou hear his teaching   <pb n="254"/>   from his own 
lips, and hadst thou not his example before thee? Remember then how, when he 
sorrowed and was grieved in spirit, and three times asked thee to keep awake 
and pray, thou didst sleep, because thine eyes were heavy, and three times he 
found thee sleeping. So it was with me. Remember, also, how thou didst promise 
to be faithful unto death, and yet didst thrice deny him, when he was taken 
before Caiaphas. So it was with me. And remember, too, how when the cock crowed 
thou didst go out and didst weep bitterly. So it is with me. Thou canst not 
refuse to let me in.'</p><p> 
And the voice behind the gates was silent.</p><p> 
Then the sinner stood a little while, and again began to knock, and to ask to 
be let into the kingdom of heaven.</p><p> 
And he heard another voice behind the gates, which said:</p><p> 
'Who is this man, and how did he live on earth?'</p><p> 
And the voice of the Accuser again repeated all the sinner's evil deeds, and 
not a single good one.</p><p> 
And the voice from behind the gates replied:</p><p> 
'Go hence! Such sinners cannot live with us in Paradise.' Then the sinner 
said:</p><p> 
'Lord, I hear thy voice, but I see thee not, nor do I know thy name.'</p><p> 
And the voice answered:</p><p> 
'I am David; king and prophet.'</p><p> 
The sinner did not despair, nor did he leave the gates of Paradise, but said:</p><p> 
Have pity on me, King David! Remember man's weakness, and God's mercy. God 
loved thee and exalted thee among men. Thou hadst all: a kingdom, and honour, 
and riches, and wives, and children; but thou sawest from thy house-top the 
wife of a poor man, and sin entered into thee, and   <pb n="255"/>   thou tookest the wife of 
Uriah, and didst slay him with the sword of the Ammonites. Thou, a rich man, 
didst take from the poor man his one ewe lamb, and didst kill him. I have done 
likewise. Remember, then, how thou didst repent, and how thou saidst, "I 
acknowledge my transgressions: my sin is ever before me?" I have done the same. 
Thou canst not refuse to let me in.'</p><p> 
And the voice from within the gates was silent.</p><p> 
The sinner having stood a little while, began knocking again, and asking to be 
let into the kingdom of heaven. And a third voice was heard within the gates, 
saying:</p><p> 
'Who is this man, and how has he spent his life on earth?'</p><p> 
And the voice of the Accuser replied for the third time, recounting the 
sinner's evil deeds, and not mentioning one good deed.</p><p> 
And the voice within the gates said:</p><p> 
'Depart hence! Sinners cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.'</p><p> 
And the sinner said:</p><p> 
'Thy voice I hear, but thy face I see not, neither do I know thy name.'</p><p> 
Then the voice replied:</p><p> 
'I am John the Divine, the beloved disciple of Christ.'</p><p> 
And the sinner rejoiced and said:</p><p> 
'Now surely I shall be allowed to enter. Peter and David must let me in, 
because they know man's weakness and God's mercy; and thou wilt let me in, 
because thou lovest much. Was it not thou, John the Divine who wrote that God 
is Love, and that he who loves not, knows not God? And in thine old age didst 
thou not say unto men: "Brethren, love one another." How, then, canst thou look 
on me with hatred, and drive me away?   <pb n="256"/>   Either thou must renounce what thou hast 
said, or loving me, must let me enter the kingdom of heaven.'</p><p> 
And the gates of Paradise opened, and John embraced the repentant sinner and 
took him into the kingdom of heaven.</p><p>

<head>THE EMPTY DRUM<lb/> 
(A FOLK-TALE LONG CURRENT IN THE REGION OF THE VOLGA)</head> 
<p>EMELY&Aacute;N was a labourer and worked for a master. Crossing the meadows one 
day on his way to work, he nearly trod on a frog that jumped right in front of 
him, but he just managed to avoid it. Suddenly he heard some one calling to him 
from behind.</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n looked round and saw a lovely lassie, who said to him: 'Why 
don't you get married, Emely&aacute;n?'</p><p> 
'How can I marry, my lass?' said he. 'I have but the clothes I stand up in, 
nothing more, and no one would have me for a husband.'</p><p> 
'Take me for a wife,' said she.</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n liked the maid. 'I should be glad to,' said he, 'but where and 
how could we live?'</p><p> 
'Why trouble about that?' said the girl. 'One only has to work more and sleep 
less, and one can clothe and feed oneself anywhere.'</p><p> 
'Very well then, let us marry,' said Emely&aacute;n. 'Where shall we go to?'</p><p> 
'Let us go to town.'</p><p> 
So Emely&aacute;n and the lass went to town, and she took him to a small hut on 
the very edge of the town, and they married and began housekeeping.</p><p> 
One day the King, driving through the town, passed by Emely&aacute;n's hut. 
Emely&aacute;n's wife came out to see the King. The King noticed her and was 
quite surprised.</p><p> 
'Where did such a beauty come from?' said he;   <pb n="258"/>   and stopping his carriage he 
called Emely&aacute;n's wife and asked her: 'Who are you?'</p><p> 
'The peasant Emely&aacute;n's wife,' said she.</p><p> 
'Why did you, who are such a beauty, marry a peasant?' said the King. 'You 
ought to be a queen!'</p><p> 
'Thank you for your kind words,' said she, 'but a peasant husband is good 
enough for me.'</p><p> 
The King talked to her awhile and then drove on. He returned to the palace, but 
could not get Emely&aacute;n's wife out of his head. All night he did not 
sleep, but kept thinking how to get her for himself. He could think of no way 
of doing it, so he called his servants and told them they must find a way.</p><p> 
The King's servants said: 'Command Emely&aacute;n to come to the palace to 
work, and we will work him so hard that he will die. His wife will be left a 
widow, and then you can take her for yourself.'</p><p> 
The King followed their advice. He sent an order that Emely&aacute;n should 
come to the palace as a workman and that he should live at the palace, and his 
wife with him.</p><p> 
The messengers came to Emely&aacute;n and gave him the King's message. His wife 
said, 'Go, Emely&aacute;n; work all day, but come back home at night.'</p><p> 
So Emely&aacute;n went, and when he got to the palace the King's steward asked 
him, 'Why have you come alone, without your wife?'</p><p> 
'Why should I drag her about?' said Emely&aacute;n. 'She has a house to live 
in.'</p><p> 
At the King's palace they gave Emely&aacute;n work enough for two. He began the 
job not hoping to finish it; but when evening came, lo and behold! it was all 
done. The steward saw that it was finished, and set him four times as much for 
next day.</p>   <pb n="259"/>  <p> 
Emely&aacute;n went home. Everything there was swept and tidy; the oven was 
heated, his supper was cooked and ready, and his wife sat by the table sewing 
and waiting for his return. She greeted him, laid the table, gave him to eat 
and drink, and then began to ask him about his work.</p><p> 
'Ah!' said he, 'it's a bad business: they give me tasks beyond my strength, and 
want to kill me with work.'</p><p> 
'Don't fret about the work,' said she, 'don't look either before or behind to 
see how much you have done or how much there is left to do; only keep on 
working and all will be right.'</p><p> 
So Emely&aacute;n lay down and slept. Next morning he went to work again and 
worked without once looking round. And, lo and behold! by the evening it was 
all done, and before dark he came home for the night.</p><p> 
Again and again they increased Emely&aacute;n's work, but he always got through 
it in good time and went back to his hut to sleep. A week passed, and the 
King's servants saw they could not crush him with rough work so they tried 
giving him work that required skill. But this, also, was of no avail. 
Carpentering, and masonry, and roofing, whatever they set him to do, 
Emely&aacute;n had it ready in time, and went home to his wife at night. So a 
second week passed.</p><p> 
Then the King called his servants and said: 'Do I feed you for nothing? Two 
weeks have gone, and I don't see that you have done anything. You were going to 
tire Emely&aacute;n out with work, but I see from my windows how he goes home 
every evening &mdash;  singing cheerfully! Do you mean to make a fool of me?'</p><p> 
The King's servants began to excuse themselves. 'We tried our best to wear him 
out with rough   <pb n="260"/>   work,' they said, 'but nothing was too hard for him; he cleared 
it all off as though he had swept it away with a broom. There was no tiring him 
out. Then we set him to tasks needing skill, which we did not think he was 
clever enough to do, but he managed them all. No matter what one sets him, he 
does it all, no one knows how. Either he or his wife must know some spell that 
helps them. We ourselves are sick of him, and wish to find a task he cannot 
master. We have now thought of setting him to build a cathedral in a single 
day. Send for Emely&aacute;n, and order him to build a cathedral in front of 
the palace in a single day. Then, if he does not do it, let his head be cut off 
for disobedience.'</p><p> 
The King sent for Emely&aacute;n. 'Listen to my command,' said he: 'build me a 
new cathedral on the square in front of my palace, and have it ready by 
to-morrow evening. If you have it ready I will reward you, but if not I will 
have your head cut off.'</p><p> 
When Emely&aacute;n heard the King's command he turned away and went home. 'My 
end is near,' thought he. And coming to his wife, he said: 'Get ready, wife we 
must fly from here, or I shall be lost by no fault of my own.'</p><p> 
'What has frightened you so?' said she, 'and why should we run away?'</p><p> 
'How can I help being frightened? The King has ordered me, to-morrow, in a 
single day, to build him a cathedral. If I fail he will cut my head off. There 
is only one thing to be done: we must fly while there is yet time.'</p><p> 
But his wife would not hear of it. 'The King has many soldiers,' said she. 
'They would catch us anywhere. We cannot escape from him, but must obey him as 
long as strength holds out.'</p><p> 
'How can I obey him when the task is beyond my strength?'</p>   <pb n="261"/>  <p> 
'Eh, goodman, don't be downhearted. Eat your supper now, and go to sleep. Rise 
early in the morning and all will get done.'</p><p> 
So Emely&aacute;n lay down and slept. His wife roused him early next day. 'Go 
quickly,' said she, 'and finish the cathedral. Here are nails and a hammer; 
there is still enough work there for a day.'</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n went into the town, reached the palace square, and there stood a 
large cathedral not quite finished. Emely&aacute;n set to work to do what was 
needed, and by the evening all was ready.</p><p> 
When the King awoke he looked out from his palace, and saw the cathedral, and 
Emely&aacute;n going about driving in nails here and there. And the King was 
not pleased to have the cathedral &mdash; he was annoyed at not being able to 
condemn Emely&aacute;n and take his wife. Again he called his servants. 
'Emely&aacute;n has done this task also,' said the King, 'and there is no 
excuse for putting him to death. Even this work was not too hard for him. You 
must find a more cunning plan, or I will cut off your heads as well as his.'</p><p> 
So his servants planned that Emely&aacute;n should be ordered to make a river 
round the palace, with ships sailing on it. And the King sent for 
Emely&aacute;n and set him this new task.</p><p> 
'If,' said he, 'you could build a cathedral in one night, you can also do this. 
To-morrow all must be ready. If not, I will have your head off.'</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n was more downcast than before, and returned to his wife sad at 
heart.</p><p> 
'Why are you so sad?' said his wife. 'Has the King set you a fresh task?'</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n told her about it. 'We must fly,' said he.</p><p> 
But his wife replied: 'There is no escaping the soldiers; they will catch us 
wherever we go. There is nothing for it but to obey.'</p>   <pb n="262"/>  <p> 
'How can I do it?' groaned Emely&aacute;n.</p><p> 
'Eh! eh! goodman,' said she, 'don't be downhearted. Eat your supper now, and go 
to sleep. Rise early, and all will get done in good time.'</p><p> 
So Emely&aacute;n lay down and slept. In the morning his wife woke him. 'Go,' 
said she 'to the palace &mdash; all is ready. Only, near the wharf in front of the 
palace, there is a mound left; take a spade and level it.</p><p> 
When the King awoke he saw a river where there had not been one; ships were 
sailing up and down, and Emely&aacute;n was levelling a mound with a spade. The 
King wondered, but was pleased neither with the river nor with the ships, so 
vexed was he at not being able to condemn Emely&aacute;n. 'There is no task,' 
thought he, 'that he cannot manage. What is to be done?' And he called his 
servants and again asked their advice.</p><p> 
'Find some task,' said he, 'which Emely&aacute;n cannot compass. For whatever 
we plan he fulfils, and I cannot take his wife from him.'</p><p> 
The King's servants thought and thought, and at last devised a plan. They came 
to the King and said: 'Send for Emely&aacute;n and say to him: "Go to there, 
don't know where," and bring back "that, don't know what." Then he will not be 
able to escape you. No matter where he goes, you can say that he has not gone 
to the right place, and no matter what he brings, you can say it is not the 
right thing. Then you can have him beheaded and can take his wife.'</p><p> 
The King was pleased. 'That is well thought of,' said he. So the King sent for 
Emely&aacute;n and said to him: 'Go to "there, don't know where," and bring 
back "that, don't know what." If you fail to bring it, I will have you 
beheaded.'</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n returned to his wife and told her what the King had said. His 
wife became thoughtful.</p>   <pb n="263"/>  <p> 
'Well,' said she, 'they have taught the King how to catch you. Now we must act 
warily.' So she sat and thought, and at last said to her husband: 'You must go 
far, to our Grandam &mdash; the old peasant woman, the mother of soldiers &mdash; and you 
must ask her aid. If she helps you to anything, go straight to the palace with 
it, I shall be there: I cannot escape them now. They will take me by force, but 
it will not be for long. If you do everything as Grandam directs, you will soon 
save me.'</p><p> 
So the wife got her husband ready for the journey. She gave him a wallet, and 
also a spindle. 'Give her this,' said she. 'By this token she will know that 
you are my husband.' And his wife showed him his road.</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n set off. He left the town behind, and came to where some 
soldiers were being drilled. Emely&aacute;n stood and watched them. After drill 
the soldiers sat down to rest. Then Emely&aacute;n went up to them and asked: 
'Do you know, brothers, the way to "there, don't know where?" and how I can get 
"that, don't know what?"'</p><p> 
The soldiers listened to him with surprise. 'Who sent you on this errand?' said 
they</p><p> 
'The King,' said he.</p><p> 
'We ourselves,' said they, 'from the day we became soldiers, go we "don't know 
where," and never yet have we got there; and we seek we "don't know what," and 
cannot find it. We cannot help you.'</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n sat a while with the soldiers and then went on again. He trudged 
many a mile, and at last came to a wood. In the wood was a hut, and in the hut 
sat an old, old woman, the mother of peasant soldiers, spinning flax and 
weeping. And as she spun she did not put her fingers to her mouth to wet them 
with spittle, but to her eyes to wet them with tears. When the old woman saw   <pb n="264"/>   
Emely&aacute;n she cried out at him: 'Why have you come here?' Then 
Emely&aacute;n gave her the spindle, and said his wife had sent it.</p><p> 
The old woman softened at once, and began to question him. And Emely&aacute;n 
told her his whole life: how he married the lass; how they went to live in the 
town; how he had worked, and what he had done at the palace; how he built the 
cathedral, and made a river with ships on it, and how the King had now told him 
to go to 'there, don't know where, and bring back 'that, don't know what.'</p><p> 
The Grandam listened to the end, and ceased weeping. She muttered to herself: 
'The time has surely come,' and said to him: 'All right, my lad. Sit down now, 
and I will give you something to eat.'</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n ate, and then the Grandam told him what to do. 'Here,' said she, 
'is a ball of thread; roll it before you, and follow where it goes. You must go 
far till you come right to the sea. When you get there you will see a great 
city. Enter the city and ask for a night's lodging at the furthest house. There 
look out for what you are seeking.'</p><p> 
'How shall I know it when I see it, Granny?' said he.</p><p> 
'When you see something men obey more than father or mother, that is it. Seize 
that, and take it to the King. When you bring it to the King, he will say it is 
not right, and you must answer: "If it is not the right thing it must be 
smashed," and you must beat it, and carry it to the river, break it in pieces, 
and throw it into the water. Then you will get your wife back and my tears will 
be dried.'</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n bade farewell to the Grandam and began rolling his ball before 
him. It rolled and rolled until at last it reached the sea. By the sea stood a 
great city, and at the further end of the city was a big house. There 
Emely&aacute;n begged for a night's lodging, and was granted it. He lay down   <pb n="265"/>   to 
sleep, and in the morning awoke and heard a father rousing his son to go and 
cut wood for the fire. But the son did not obey. 'It is too early,' said he, 
'there is time enough.' Then Emely&aacute;n heard the mother say, 'Go, my son, 
your father's bones ache; would you have him go himself? It is time to be 
up!'</p><p> 
But the son only murmured some words and fell asleep again. Hardly was he 
asleep when something thundered and rattled in the street. Up jumped the son 
and quickly putting on his clothes ran out into the street. Up jumped 
Emely&aacute;n, too, and ran after him to see what it was that a son obeys more 
than father or mother. What he saw was a man walking along the street carrying, 
tied to his stomach, a thing which he beat with sticks, and that it was that 
rattled and thundered so, and that the son had obeyed. Emely&aacute;n ran up 
and had a look at it. He saw it was round, like a small tub, with a skin 
stretched over both ends, and he asked what it was called.</p><p> 
He was told, 'A drum.'</p><p> 
'And is it empty?'</p><p> 
'Yes, it is empty.'</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n was surprised. He asked them to give the thing to him, but they 
would not. So Emely&aacute;n left off asking, and followed the drummer. All day 
he followed, and when the drummer at last lay down to sleep, Emely&aacute;n 
snatched the drum from him and ran away with it.</p><p> 
He ran and ran, till at last he got back to his own town. He went to see his 
wife, but she was not at home. The day after he went away, the King had taken 
her. So Emely&aacute;n went to the palace, and sent in a message to the King: 
'He has returned who went to "there, don't know where," and he has brought with 
him "that, don't know what."'</p>   <pb n="266"/>  <p> 
They told the King, and the King said he was to come again next day.</p><p> 
But Emely&aacute;n said, 'Tell the King I am here to-day, and have brought what 
the King wanted. Let him come out to me, or I will go in to him!'</p><p> 
The King came out. 'Where have you been?' said he.</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n told him.</p><p> 
'That's not the right place,' said the King. 'What have you brought?'</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n pointed to the drum, but the King did not look at it.</p><p> 
'That is not it.'</p><p> 
'If it is not the right thing,' said Emely&aacute;n, 'it must be smashed, and 
may the devil take it!'</p><p> 
And Emely&aacute;n left the palace, carrying the drum and beating it. And as he 
beat it all the King's army ran out to follow Emely&aacute;n, and they saluted 
him and waited his commands.</p><p> 
The King, from his window, began to shout at his army telling them not to 
follow Emely&aacute;n. They did not listen to what he said, but all followed 
Emely&aacute;n.</p><p> 
When the King saw that, he gave orders that Emely&aacute;n's wife should be 
taken back to him, and he sent to ask Emely&aacute;n to give him the drum.</p><p> 
'It can't be done,' said Emely&aacute;n. 'I was told to smash it and to throw 
the splinters into the river.'</p><p> 
So Emely&aacute;n went down to the river carrying the drum, and the soldiers 
followed him. When he reached the river bank Emely&aacute;n smashed the drum to 
splinters, and threw the splinters into the stream. And then all the soldiers 
ran away.</p><p> 
Emely&aacute;n took his wife and went home with her. And after that the King 
ceased to trouble him; and so they lived happily ever after.</p><p>

<div2 type="story" n="19" id="d94"> 
<head>THE COFFEE-HOUSE OF SURAT<lb/> 
(AFTER BERNARDIN DE SENT-PIERRE.)</head> 
<p>IN the town of Surat, in India, was a coffee-house where many travellers and 
foreigners from all parts of the world met and conversed.</p><p> 
One day a learned Persian theologian visited this coffee-house. He was a man 
who had spent his life studying the nature of the Deity, and reading and 
writing books upon the subject. He had thought, read, and written so much about 
God, that eventually he lost his wits became quite confused, and ceased even to 
believe in the existence of a God. The Shah, hearing of this, had banished him 
from Persia.</p><p> 
After having argued all his life about the First Cause, this unfortunate 
theologian had ended by quite perplexing himself, and instead of understanding 
that he had lost his own reason, he began to think that there was no higher 
Reason controlling the universe.</p><p> 
This man had an African slave who followed him everywhere. When the theologian 
entered the coffeehouse, the slave remained outside, near the door sitting on a 
stone in the glare of the sun, and driving away the flies that buzzed around 
him. The Persian having settled down on a divan in the coffee-house, ordered 
himself a cup of opium. When he had drunk it and the opium had begun to quicken 
the workings of his brain, he addressed his slave through the open door:</p>   <pb n="268"/>  <p> 
'Tell me, wretched slave,' said he, 'do you think there is a God, or not?'</p><p> 
'Of course there is,' said the slave, and immediately drew from under his 
girdle a small idol of wood.</p><p> 
'There,' said he, 'that is the God who has guarded me from the day of my birth. 
Every one in our country worships the fetish tree, from the wood of which this 
God was made.'</p><p> 
This conversation between the theologian and his slave was listened to with 
surprise by the other guests in the coffee-house. They were astonished at the 
master's question, and yet more so at the slave's reply.</p><p> 
One of them, a Brahmin, on hearing the words spoken by the slave, turned to him 
and said:</p><p> 
'Miserable fool! Is it possible you believe that God can be carried under a 
man's girdle? There is one God &mdash; Brahma, and he is greater than the whole 
world, for he created it. Brahma is the One, the mighty God, and in His honour 
are built the temples on the Ganges' banks, where his true priests, the 
Brahmins, worship him. They know the true God, and none but they. A thousand 
score of years have passed, and yet through revolution after revolution these 
priests have held their sway, because Brahma, the one true God, has protected 
them.'</p><p> 
So spoke the Brahmin, thinking to convince every one; but a Jewish broker who 
was present replied to him, and said:</p><p> 
'No! the temple of the true God is not in India. Neither does God protect the 
Brahmin caste. The true God is not the God of the Brahmins, but of Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob. None does He protect but His chosen people, the Israelites. 
From the commencement of the world, our nation has been   <pb n="269"/>   beloved of Him, and 
ours alone. If we are now scattered over the whole earth it is but to try us; 
for God has promised that He will one day gather His people together in 
Jerusalem. Then, with the Temple of Jerusalem &mdash; the wonder of the ancient 
world &mdash; restored to its splendour, shall Israel be established a ruler over 
all nations.'</p><p> 
So spoke the Jew, and burst into tears. He wished to say more, but an Italian 
missionary who was there interrupted him.</p><p> 
'What you are saying is untrue,' said he to the Jew. 'You attribute injustice 
to God. He cannot love your nation above the rest. Nay rather, even if it be 
true that of old He favoured the Israelites, it is now nineteen hundred years 
since they angered Him, and caused Him to destroy their nation and scatter them 
over the earth, so that their faith makes no converts and has died out except 
here and there. God shows preference to no nation, but calls all who wish to be 
saved to the bosom of the Catholic Church of Rome, the one outside whose 
borders no salvation can be found.'</p><p> 
So spoke the Italian. But a Protestant minister who happened to be present, 
growing pale, turned to the Catholic missionary and exclaimed:</p><p> 
'How can you say that salvation belongs to your religion? Those only will be 
saved, who serve God according to the Gospel, in spirit and in truth, as bidden 
by the word of Christ.'</p><p> 
Then a Turk, an office-holder in the custom-house at Surat, who was sitting in 
the coffee-house smoking a pipe, turned with an air of superiority to both the 
Christians.</p><p> 
'Your belief in your Roman religion is vain,' said he. 'It was superseded 
twelve hundred years ago by the true faith: that of Mohammed! You cannot but 
observe how the true Mohammedan   <pb n="270"/>   faith continues to spread both in Europe and 
Asia, and even in the enlightened country of China. You say yourselves that God 
has rejected the Jews; and, as a proof, you quote the fact that the Jews are 
humiliated and their faith does not spread. Confess then the truth of 
Mohammedanism, for it is triumphant and spreads far and wide. None will be 
saved but the followers of Mohammed, God's latest prophet; and of them, only 
the followers of Omar, and not of Ali, for the latter are false to the 
faith.'</p><p> 
To this the Persian theologian, who was of the sect of Ali, wished to reply; 
but by this time a great dispute had arisen among all the strangers of 
different faiths and creeds present. There were Abyssinian Christians, Llamas 
from Thibet, Ismailians and Fire-worshippers. They all argued about the nature 
of God, and how He should be worshipped. Each of them asserted that in his 
country alone was the true God known and rightly worshipped.</p><p> 
Every one argued and shouted, except a Chinaman, a student of Confucius, who 
sat quietly in one corner of the coffee-house, not joining in the dispute. He 
sat there drinking tea and listening to what the others said, but did not speak 
himself.</p><p> 
The Turk noticed him sitting there, and appealed to him, saying:</p><p> 
'You can confirm what I say, my good Chinaman. You hold your peace, but if you 
spoke I know you would uphold my opinion. Traders from your country, who come 
to me for assistance, tell me that though many religions have been introduced 
into China, you Chinese consider Mohammedanism the best of all, and adopt it 
willingly. Confirm, then, my words, and tell us your opinion of the true God 
and of His prophet.'</p>   <pb n="271"/>  <p> 
'Yes, yes,' said the rest, turning to the Chinaman, 'let us hear what you think 
on the subject.'</p><p> 
The Chinaman, the student of Confucius, closed his eyes, and thought a while. 
Then he opened them again, and drawing his hands out of the wide sleeves of his 
garment, and folding them on his breast, he spoke as follows, in a calm and 
quiet voice.</p><p> 
Sirs, it seems to me that it is chiefly pride that prevents men agreeing with 
one another on matters of faith. If you care to listen to me, I will tell you a 
story which will explain this by an example.</p><p> 
I came here from China on an English steamer which had been round the world. We 
stopped for fresh water, and landed on the east coast of the island of Sumatra. 
It was mid-day, and some of us, having landed, sat in the shade of some coconut 
palms by the seashore, not far from a native village. We were a party of men of 
different nationalities.</p><p> 
As we sat there, a blind man approached us. We learnt afterwards that he had 
gone blind from gazing too long and too persistently at the sun, trying to find 
out what it is, in order to seize its light.</p><p> 
He strove a long time to accomplish this, constantly looking at the sun; but 
the only result was that his eyes were injured by its brightness, and he became 
blind.</p><p> 
Then he said to himself:</p><p> 
'The light of the sun is not a liquid; for if it were a liquid it would be 
possible to pour it from one vessel into another, and it would be moved, like 
water, by the wind. Neither is it fire; for if it were fire, water would 
extinguish it. Neither is light a spirit, for it is seen by the eye, nor is it 
matter, for it cannot be moved. Therefore, as the light of the   <pb n="272"/>  sun is neither 
liquid, nor fire, nor spirit, nor matter, it is &mdash;  nothing!'</p><p> 
So he argued, and, as a result of always looking at the sun and always thinking 
about it, he lost both his sight and his reason. And when he went quite blind, 
he became fully convinced that the sun did not exist.</p><p> 
With this blind man came a slave, who after placing his master in the shade of 
a coconut tree, picked up a coconut from the ground, and began making it into a 
night-light. He twisted a wick from the fibre of the coconut: squeezed oil from 
the nut into the shell, and soaked the wick in it.</p><p> 
As the slave sat doing this, the blind man sighed and said to him:</p><p> 
'Well, slave, was I not right when I told you there is no sun? Do you not see 
how dark it is? Yet people say there is a sun. . . . But if so, what is it?'</p><p> 
'I do not know what the sun is,' said the slave 'That is no business of mine. 
But I know what light is. Here, I have made a night-light, by the help of which 
I can serve you and find anything I want in the hut.'</p><p> 
And the slave picked up the coconut shell, saying:</p><p> 
'This is my sun.'</p><p> 
A lame man with crutches, who was sitting near by heard these words, and 
laughed:</p><p> 
'You have evidently been blind all your life,' said he to the blind man, 'not 
to know what the sun is, I will tell you what it is. The sun is a ball of fire, 
which rises every morning out of the sea and goes down again among the 
mountains of our island each evening. We have all seen this, and if you had had 
your eyesight you too would have seen it.'</p>   <pb n="273"/>  <p> 
A fisherman, who had been listening to the conversation, said:</p><p> 
'It is plain enough that you have never been beyond your own island. If you 
were not lame, and if you had been out as I have in a fishing-boat, you would 
know that the sun does not set among the mountains of our island, but as it 
rises from the ocean every morning so it sets again in the sea every night. 
What I am telling you is true, for I see it every day with my own eyes.'</p><p> 
Then an Indian who was of our party, interrupted him by saying:</p><p> 
'I am astonished that a reasonable man should talk such nonsense. How can a 
ball of fire possibly descend into the water and not be extinguished? The sun 
is not a ball of fire at all, it is the Deity named Deva who rides for ever in 
a chariot round the golden mountain, Meru. Sometimes the evil serpents Ragu and 
Ketu attack Deva and swallow him: and then the earth is dark. But our priests 
pray that the Deity may be released, and then he is set free. Only such 
ignorant men as you, who have never been beyond their own island, can imagine 
that the sun shines for their country alone.'</p><p> 
Then the master of an Egyptian vessel, who was present, spoke in his turn.</p><p> 
'No,' said he, 'you also are wrong. The sun is not a Deity, and does not move 
only round India and its golden mountain. I have sailed much on the Black Sea, 
and along the coasts of Arabia, and have been to Madagascar and to the 
Philippines. The sun lights the whole earth, and not India alone. It does not 
circle round one mountain, but rises far in the east, beyond the Isles of 
Japan, and sets far, far away in the west, beyond the islands of England. That 
is why the Japanese call their country "Nippon," that is "the birth of the 
sun."   <pb n="274"/>  I know this well, for I have myself seen much, and heard more from my 
grandfather, who sailed to the very ends of the sea.'</p><p> 
He would have gone on, but an English sailor from our ship interrupted him.</p><p> 
'There is no country,' he said, 'where people know so much about the sun's 
movements as in England. The sun, as every one in England knows, rises nowhere 
and sets nowhere. It is always moving round the earth. We can be sure of this 
for we have just been round the world ourselves, and nowhere knocked up against 
the sun. Wherever we went, the sun showed itself in the morning and hid itself 
at night, just as it does here.'</p><p> 
And the Englishman took a stick and, drawing circles on the sand, tried to 
explain how the sun moves in the heavens and goes round the world. But he was 
unable to explain it clearly, and pointing to the ship's pilot said:</p><p> 
'This man knows more about it than I do. He can explain it properly.'</p><p> 
The pilot, who was an intelligent man, had listened in silence to the talk till 
he was asked to speak. Now every one turned to him, and he said:</p><p> 
'You are all misleading one another, and are yourselves deceived. The sun does 
not go round the earth, but the earth goes round the sun, revolving as it goes 
and turning towards the sun in the course of each twenty-four hours, not only 
Japan, and the Philippines and Sumatra where we now are, but Africa, and Europe 
and America, and many lands besides. The sun does not shine for some one 
mountain, or for some one island, or for some one sea, nor even for one earth 
alone, but for other planets as well as our earth. If you would only look up at 
the heavens, instead of at the ground beneath your own feet, you might all 
understand   <pb n="275"/>  this, and would then no longer suppose that the sun shines for you, 
or for your country alone.'</p><p> 
Thus spoke the wise pilot, who had voyaged much about the world, and had gazed 
much upon the heavens above.</p><p> 
'So on matters of faith,' continued the Chinaman the student of Confucius, 'it 
is pride that causes error and discord among men. As with the sun, so it is 
with God. Each man wants to have a special God of his own, or at least a 
special God for his native land. Each nation wishes to confine in its own 
temples Him, whom the world cannot contain.</p><p> 
'Can any temple compare with that which God Himself has built to unite all men 
in one faith and one religion?</p><p> 
'All human temples are built on the model of this temple, which is God's own 
world. Every temple has its fonts, its vaulted roof, its lamps, its pictures or 
sculptures, its inscriptions, its books of the law, its offerings, its altars 
and its priests. But in what temple is there such a font as the ocean; such a 
vault as that of the heavens; such lamps as the sun, moon, and stars; or any 
figures to be compared with living, loving, mutually-helpful men? Where are 
there any records of God's goodness so easy to understand as the blessings 
which God has strewn abroad for man's happiness? Where is there any book of the 
law so clear to each man as that written in his heart? What sacrifices equal 
the self-denials which loving men and women make for one another? And what 
altar can be compared with the heart of a good man, on which God Himself 
accepts the sacrifice?</p><p> 
'The higher a man's conception of God, the better will he know Him. And the 
better he knows God   <pb n="276"/>  the nearer will he draw to Him, imitating His goodness, 
His mercy, and His love of man.</p><p> 
'Therefore, let him who sees the sun's whole light filling the world, refrain 
from blaming or despising the superstitious man, who in his own idol sees one 
ray of that same light. Let him not despise even the unbeliever who is blind 
and cannot see the sun at all.'</p><p> 
So spoke the Chinaman, the student of Confucius; and all who were present in 
the coffee-house were silent, and disputed no more as to whose faith was the 
best.</p><p>

<head>TOO DEAR!<lb/> 
(TOLSTOY'S ADAPTATION OF A STORY BY GUY DE MAUPASSANT. )</head>  
<p>NEAR the borders of France and Italy, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea, 
lies a tiny little kingdom called Monaco. Many a small country town can boast 
more inhabitants than this kingdom, for there are only about seven thousand of 
them all told, and if all the land in the kingdom were divided there would not 
be an acre for each inhabitant. But in this toy kingdom there is a real 
kinglet; and he has a palace, and courtiers, and ministers, and a bishop, and 
generals, and an army.</p><p> 
It is not a large army, only sixty men in all, but still it is an army. There 
were also taxes in this kingdom as elsewhere: a tax on tobacco, and on wine and 
spirits and a poll-tax. But though the people there drink and smoke as people 
do in other countries, there are so few of them that the King would have been 
hard put to it to feed his courtiers and officials and to keep himself, if he 
had not found a new and special source of revenue. This special revenue comes 
from a gaming house, where people play roulette. People play, and whether they 
win or lose the keeper always gets a percentage on the turnover; and out of his 
profits he pays a large sum to the King. The reason he pays so much is that it 
is the only such gambling establishment left in Europe. Some of the little 
German Sovereigns used to keep gaming houses of the same kind, but some years 
ago they were forbidden to do so. The reason they were stopped was because   <pb n="278"/>   
these gaming houses did so much harm. A man would come and try his luck, then 
he would risk all he had and lose it, then he would even risk money that did 
not belong to him and lose that too, and then, in despair, he would drown or 
shoot himself. So the Germans forbade their rulers to make money in this way; 
but there was no one to stop the King of Monaco, and he remained with a 
monopoly of the business.</p><p> 
So now every one who wants to gamble goes to Monaco. Whether they win or lose, 
the King gains by it. 'You can't earn stone palaces by honest labour,' as the 
proverb says; and the Kinglet of Monaco knows it is a dirty business, but what 
is he to do? He has to live; and to draw a revenue from drink and from tobacco 
is also not a nice thing. So he lives and reigns, and rakes in the money, and 
holds his court with all the ceremony of a real king.</p><p> 
He has his coronation, his levees; he rewards, sentences, and pardons, and he 
also has his reviews, councils, laws, and courts of justice: just like other 
kings, only all on a smaller scale.</p><p> 
Now it happened a few years ago that a murder was committed in this toy King's 
domains. The people of that kingdom are peaceable, and such a thing had not 
happened before. The judges assembled with much ceremony and tried the case in 
the most judicial manner. There were judges, and prosecutors, and jurymen, and 
barristers. They argued and judged, and at last they condemned the criminal to 
have his head cut off as the law directs. So far so good. Next they submitted 
the sentence to the King. The King read the sentence and confirmed it. 'If the 
fellow must be executed, execute him.'</p><p> 
There was only one hitch in the matter; and that was that they had neither a 
guillotine for   <pb n="279"/>  cutting heads off, nor an executioner. The Ministers considered 
the matter, and decided to address an inquiry to the French Government, asking 
whether the French could not lend them a machine and an expert to cut off the 
criminal's head; and if so, would the French kindly inform them what the cost 
would be. The letter was sent. A week later the reply came: a machine and an 
expert could be supplied, and the cost would be 16,000 francs. This was laid 
before the King. He thought it over. Sixteen thousand francs! 'The wretch is 
not worth the money,' said he. 'Can't it be done, somehow, cheaper? Why 16,000 
francs is more than two francs a head on the whole population. The people won't 
stand it, and it may cause a riot!'</p><p> 
So a Council was called to consider what could be done; and it was decided to 
send a similar inquiry to the King of Italy. The French Government is 
republican, and has no proper respect for kings; but the King of Italy was a 
brother monarch, and might be induced to do the thing cheaper. So the letter 
was written, and a prompt reply was received.</p><p> 
The Italian Government wrote that they would have pleasure in supplying both a 
machine and an expert; and the whole cost would be 12,000 francs, including 
travelling expenses. This was cheaper, but still it seemed too much. The rascal 
was really not worth the money. It would still mean nearly two francs more per 
head on the taxes. Another Council was called. They discussed and considered 
how it could be done with less expense. Could not one of the soldiers perhaps 
be got to do it in a rough and homely fashion? The General was called and was 
asked: 'Can't you find us a soldier who would cut the man's head off? In war 
they   <pb n="280"/>  don't mind killing people. In fact, that is what they are trained for.' So 
the General talked it over with the soldiers to see whether one of them would 
not undertake the job. But none of the soldiers would do it. 'No,' they said, 
'we don't know how to do it; it is not a thing we have been taught.'</p><p> 
What was to be done? Again the Ministers considered and reconsidered. They 
assembled a Commission, and a Committee, and a Sub-Committee, and at last they 
decided that the best thing would be to alter the death sentence to one of 
imprisonment for life. This would enable the King to show his mercy, and it 
would come cheaper.</p><p> 
The King agreed to this, and so the matter was arranged. The only hitch now was 
that there was no suitable prison for a man sentenced for life. There was a 
small lock-up where people were sometimes kept temporarily, but there was no 
strong prison fit for permanent use. However, they managed to find a place that 
would do, and they put the young fellow there and placed a guard over him. The 
guard had to watch the criminal, and had also to fetch his food from the palace 
kitchen.</p><p> 
The prisoner remained there month after month till a year had passed. But when 
a year had passed, the Kinglet, looking over the account of his income and 
expenditure one day, noticed a new item of expenditure. This was for the keep 
of the criminal; nor was it a small item either. There was a special guard, and 
there was also the man's food. It came to more than 600 francs a year. And the 
worst of it was that the fellow was still young and healthy, and might live for 
fifty years. When one came to reckon it up, the matter was serious. It would 
never do. So the King summoned his Ministers and said to them:</p>   <pb n="281"/>  <p> 
'You must find some cheaper way of dealing with this rascal. The present plan 
is too expensive.' And the Ministers met and considered and reconsidered, till 
one of them said: 'Gentlemen, in my opinion we must dismiss the guard.' 'But 
then,' rejoined another Minister, 'the fellow will run away.' 'Well,' said the 
first speaker, 'let him run away, and be hanged to him!' So they reported the 
result of their deliberations to the Kinglet, and he agreed with them. The 
guard was dismissed, and they waited to see what would happen. All that 
happened was that at dinner-time the criminal came out, and, not finding his 
guard, he went to the King's kitchen to fetch his own dinner. He took what was 
given him, returned to the prison, shut the door on himself, and stayed inside. 
Next day the same thing occurred. He went for his food at the proper time; but 
as for running away, he did not show the least sign of it! What was to be done? 
They considered the matter again.</p><p> 
'We shall have to tell him straight out,' said they 'that we do not want to 
keep him.' So the Minister of Justice had him brought before him.</p><p> 
'Why do you not run away?' said the Minister. 'There is no guard to keep you. 
You can go where you like, and the King will not mind.'</p><p> 
'I daresay the King would not mind,' replied the man, 'but I have nowhere to 
go. What can I do? You have ruined my character by your sentence, and people 
will turn their backs on me. Besides, I have got out of the way of working. You 
have treated me badly. It is not fair. In the first place, when once you 
sentenced me to death you ought to have executed me; but you did not do it. 
That is one thing. I did not complain about that. Then you sentenced me to 
imprisonment for life and put a guard to bring me my food; but   <pb n="282"/>  after a time you 
took him away again and I had to fetch my own food. Again I did not complain. 
But now you actually want me to go away! I can't agree to that. You may do as 
you like, but I won't go away!'</p><p> 
What was to be done? Once more the Council was summoned. What course could they 
adopt? The man would not go. They reflected and considered. The only way to get 
rid of him was to offer him a pension. And so they reported to the King. 'There 
is nothing else for it,' said they; 'we must get rid of him somehow.' The sum 
fixed was 600 francs, and this was announced to the prisoner.</p><p> 
'Well,' said he, 'I don't mind, so long as you undertake to pay it regularly. 
On that condition I am willing to go.'</p><p> 
So the matter was settled. He received one-third of his annuity in advance, and 
left the King's dominions. It was only a quarter of an hour by rail; and he 
emigrated, and settled just across the frontier, where he bought a bit of land, 
started market-gardening, and now lives comfortably. He always goes at the 
proper time to draw his pension. Having received it, he goes to the gaming 
tables, stakes two or three francs, sometimes wins and sometimes loses, and 
then returns home. He lives peaceably and well.</p><p> 
It is a good thing that he did not commit his crime in a country where they do 
not grudge expense to cut a man's head off, or to keeping him in prison for 
life.</p><p>

<div2 type="story" n="21" id="d97"> 
<head>ESARHADDON, KING OF ASSYRIA</head> 
<p>THE Assyrian King, Esarhaddon, had conquered the kingdom of King Lailie, had 
destroyed and burnt the towns, taken all the inhabitants captive to his own 
country, slaughtered the warriors, beheaded some chieftains and impaled or 
flayed others, and had confined King Lailie himself in a cage.</p><p> 
As he lay on his bed one night, King Esarhaddon was thinking how he should 
execute Lailie, when suddenly he heard a rustling near his bed, and opening his 
eyes saw an old man with a long grey bead and mild eyes.</p><p> 
'You wish to execute Lailie?' asked the old man.</p><p> 
'Yes,' answered the King. 'But I cannot make up my mind how to do it.'</p>   <pb n="284"/>  <p> 
'But you are Lailie,' said the old man.</p><p> 
'That's not true,' replied the King. 'Lailie is Lailie, and I am I.'</p><p> 
'You and Lailie are one,' said the old man. 'You only imagine you are not 
Lailie, and that Lailie is not you.'</p><p> 
'What do you mean by that?' said the King. 'Here am I, lying on a soft bed; 
around me are obedient men-slaves and women-slaves, and to-morrow I shall feast 
with my friends as I did to-day; whereas Lailie is sitting like a bird in a 
cage, and to-morrow he will be impaled, and with his tongue hanging out will 
struggle till he dies, and his body will be torn in pieces by dogs.'</p><p> 
'You cannot destroy his life,' said the old man.</p><p> 
'And how about the fourteen thousand warriors I killed, with whose bodies I 
built a mound?' said the King. 'I am alive, but they no longer exist. Does not 
that prove that I can destroy life?'</p><p> 
'How do you know they no longer exist?'</p><p> 
'Because I no longer see them. And, above all, they were tormented, but I was 
not. It was ill for them, but well for me.'</p><p> 
'That, also, only seems so to you. You tortured yourself, but not them.'</p><p> 
'I do not understand,' said the King.</p><p> 
'Do you wish to understand?'</p><p> 
'Yes, I do.'</p><p> 
'Then come here,' said the old man, pointing to a large font full of water.</p><p> 
The King rose and approached the font.</p><p> 
'Strip, and enter the font.'</p><p> 
Esarhaddon did as the old man bade him.</p><p> 
'As soon as I begin to pour this water over you,' said the old man, filling a 
pitcher with the water, 'dip down your head.'</p><p> 
The old man tilted the pitcher over the King's   <pb n="285"/>  head and the King bent his head 
till it was under water.</p><p> 
And as soon as King Esarhaddon was under the water he felt that he was no 
longer Esarhaddon, but some one else. And, feeling himself to be that other 
man, he saw himself lying on a rich bed, beside a beautiful woman. He had never 
seen her before, but he knew she was his wife. The woman raised herself and 
said to him:</p><p> 
'Dear husband, Lailie! You were wearied by yesterday's work and have slept 
longer than usual, and I have guarded your rest, and have not roused you. But 
now the Princes await you in the Great Hall. Dress and go out to them.'</p><p> 
And Esarhaddon &mdash; understanding from these words that he was Lailie, and not 
feeling at all surprised at this, but only wondering that he did not know it 
before  &mdash; rose, dressed, and went into the Great Hall where the Princes 
awaited him.</p><p> 
The Princes greeted Lailie, their King, bowing to the ground, and then they 
rose, and at his word sat down before him; and the eldest of the Princes began 
to speak, saying that it was impossible longer to endure the insults of the 
wicked King Esarhaddon, and that they must make war on him. But Lailie 
disagreed, and gave orders that envoys shall be sent to remonstrate with King 
Esarhaddon; and he dismissed the Princes from the audience. Afterwards he 
appointed men of note to act as ambassadors, and impressed on them what they 
were to say to King Esarhaddon. Having finished this business, Esarhaddon &mdash; 
feeling himself to be Lailie &mdash; rode out to hunt wild asses. The hunt was 
successful. He killed two wild asses himself, and having returned home, feasted 
with his friends, and witnessed a dance of slave girls. The next day he went to 
the Court, where he was awaited by petitioners suitors, and   <pb n="286"/>  prisoners brought 
for trial; and there as usual he decided the cases submitted to him. Having 
finished this business, he again rode out to his favourite amusement: the hunt. 
And again he was successful: this time killing with his own hand an old 
lioness, and capturing her two cubs. After the hunt he again feasted with his 
friends, and was entertained with music and dances, and the night he spent with 
the wife whom he loved.</p><p> 
So, dividing his time between kingly duties and pleasures, he lived for days 
and weeks, awaiting the return of the ambassadors he had sent to that King 
Esarhaddon who used to be himself. Not till a month had passed did the 
ambassadors return, and they returned with their noses and ears cut off.</p><p> 
King Esarhaddon had ordered them to tell Lailie that what had been done to them 
&mdash; the ambassadors &mdash; would be done to King Lailie himself also, unless he sent 
immediately a tribute of silver, gold, and cypress-wood, and came himself to 
pay homage to King Esarhaddon.</p><p> 
Lailie, formerly Esarhaddon, again assembled the Princes, and took counsel with 
them as to what he should do. They all with one accord said that war must be 
made against Esarhaddon, without waiting for him to attack them. The King 
agreed; and taking his place at the head of the army, started on the campaign. 
The campaign lasts seven days. Each day the King rode round the army to rouse 
the courage of his warriors. On the eighth day his army met that of Esarhaddon 
in a broad valley through which a river flowed. Lailie's army fought bravely, 
but Lailie, formerly Esarhaddon, saw the enemy swarming down from the mountains 
like ants, over-running the valley and overwhelming his army; and, in his 
chariot, he flung himself into the midst of the battle, hewing and felling the   <pb n="287"/>   
enemy. But the warriors of Lailie were but as hundreds, while those of 
Esarhaddon were as thousands; and Lailie felt himself wounded and taken 
prisoner. Nine days he journeyed with other captives, bound, and guarded by the 
warriors of Esarhaddon. On the tenth day he reached Nineveh, and was placed in 
a cage. Lailie suffered not so much from hunger and from his wound as from 
shame and impotent rage. He felt how powerless he was to avenge himself on his 
enemy for all he was suffering. All he could do was to deprive his enemies of 
the pleasure of seeing his sufferings; and he firmly resolved to endure 
courageously without a murmur, all they could do to him. For twenty days he sat 
in his cage, awaiting execution. He saw his relatives and friends led out to 
death; he heard the groans of those who were executed: some had their hands and 
feet cut off, others were flayed alive, but he showed neither disquietude, nor 
pity, nor fear. He saw the wife he loved, bound, and led by two black eunuchs. 
He knew she was being taken as a slave to Esarhaddon. That, too, he bore 
without a murmur. But one of the guards placed to watch him said, 'I pity you, 
Lailie; you were a king, but what are you now?' And hearing these words, Lailie 
remembered all he had lost. He clutched the bars of his cage, and, wishing to 
kill himself, beat his head against them. But he had not the strength to do so 
and, groaning in despair, he fell upon the floor of his cage.</p><p> 
At last two executioners opened his cage door, and having strapped his arms 
tight behind him, led him to the place of execution, which was soaked with 
blood. Lailie saw a sharp stake dripping with blood, from which the corpse of 
one of his friends had just been torn, and he understood that this had been 
done that the stake might serve for   <pb n="288"/>  his own execution. They stripped Lailie of 
his clothes. He was startled at the leanness of his once strong, handsome body. 
The two executioners seized that body by its lean thighs; they lifted him up 
and were about to let him fall upon the stake.</p><p> 
'This is death, destruction!' thought Lailie, and, forgetful of his resolve to 
remain bravely calm to the end, he sobbed and prayed for mercy. But no one 
listened to him.</p><p> 
'But this cannot be,' thought he. 'Surely I am asleep. It is a dream.' And he 
made an effort to rouse himself, and did indeed awake, to find himself neither 
Esarhaddon nor Lailie &mdash; but some kind of an animal. He was astonished that he 
was an animal, and astonished, also, at not having known this before.</p><p> 
He was grazing in a valley, tearing the tender grass with his teeth, and 
brushing away flies with his long tail. Around him was frolicking a 
long-legged, dark-gray ass-colt, striped down its back. Kicking up its hind 
legs, the colt galloped full speed to Esarhaddon, and poking him under the 
stomach with its smooth little muzzle, searched for the teat, and, finding it, 
quieted down, swallowing regularly. Esarhaddon understood that he was a 
she-ass, the colt's mother, and this neither surprised nor grieved him, but 
rather gave him pleasure. He experienced a glad feeling of simultaneous life in 
himself and in his offspring.</p><p> 
But suddenly something flew near with a whistling sound and hit him in the 
side, and with its sharp point entered his skin and flesh. Feeling a burning 
pain, Esarhaddon &mdash; who was at the same time the ass &mdash; tore the udder from the 
colt's teeth, and laying back his ears galloped to the herd from which he had 
strayed. The colt kept up with him, galloping by his side. They had already 
nearly   <pb n="289"/>  reached the herd, which had started off, when another arrow in full 
flight struck the colt's neck. It pierced the skin and quivered in its flesh. 
The colt sobbed piteously and fell upon its knees. Esarhaddon could not abandon 
it, and remained standing over it. The colt rose, tottered on its long, thin 
legs, and again fell. A fearful two-legged being &mdash; a man  &mdash; ran up and cut 
its throat.</p><p> 
'This cannot be; it is still a dream! thought Esarhaddon, and made a last 
effort to awake. 'Surely I am not Lailie, nor the ass, but Esarhaddon!'</p><p> 
He cried out, and at the same instant lifted his head out of the font. . . . 
The old man was standing by him, pouring over his head the last drops from the 
pitcher.</p><p> 
'Oh, how terribly I have suffered! And for how long!' said Esarhaddon.</p><p> 
'Long?' replied the old man, 'you have only dipped your head under water and 
lifted it again; see, the water is not yet all out of the pitcher. Do you now 
understand?'</p><p> 
Esarhaddon did not reply, but only looked at the old man with terror.</p><p> 
'Do you now understand,' continued the old man, 'that Lailie is you, and the 
warriors you put to death were you also? And not the warriors only, but the 
animals which you slew when hunting and ate at your feasts were also you. You 
thought life dwelt in you alone but I have drawn aside the veil of delusion, 
and have let you see that by doing evil to others you have done it to yourself 
also. Life is one in them all, and yours is but a portion of this same common 
life. And only in that one part of life that is yours, can you make life better 
or worse &mdash; increasing or decreasing it. You can only improve life in yourself 
by destroying the barriers that divide your life from that of others, and by 
considering   <pb n="290"/>  others as yourself, and loving them. By so doing you increase your 
share of life. You injure your life when you think of it as the only life, and 
try to add to its welfare at the expense of other lives. By so doing you only 
lessen it. To destroy the life that dwells in others is beyond your power. The 
life of those you have slain has vanished from your eyes, but is not destroyed. 
You thought to lengthen your own life and to shorten theirs, but you cannot do 
this. Life knows neither time nor space. The life of a moment, and the life of 
a thousand years: your life and the life of all the visible and invisible 
beings in the world, are equal. To destroy life, or to alter it, is impossible; 
for life is the one thing that exists. All else, but seems to us to be.'</p><p> 
Having said this the old man vanished.</p><p> 
Next morning King Esarhaddon gave orders that Lailie and all the prisoners 
should be set at liberty and that the executions should cease.</p><p> 
On the third day he called his son Assur-bani-pal, and gave the kingdom over 
into his hands; and he himself went into the desert to think over all he had 
learnt. Afterwards he went about as a wanderer through the towns and villages, 
preaching to the people that all life is one, and that when men wish to harm 
others, they really do evil to themselves.</p><p>

<head>WORK, DEATH AND SICKNESS<lb/>  
A LEGEND.</head> 
<p>THIS is a legend current among the South American Indians.</p><p> 
God, say they, at first made men so that they had no need to work: they needed 
neither houses, nor clothes, nor food, and they all lived till they were a 
hundred, and did not know what illness was.</p><p> 
When, after some time, God looked to see how people were living, he saw that 
instead of being happy in their life, they had quarrelled with one another, 
and, each caring for himself, had brought matters to such a pass that far from 
enjoying life, they cursed it.</p><p> 
Then God said to himself: 'This comes of their living separately, each for 
himself.' And to change this state of things, God so arranged matters that it 
became impossible for people to live without working. To avoid suffering from 
cold and hunger, they were now obliged to build dwellings, and to dig the 
ground, and to grow and gather fruits and grain.</p><p> 
'Work will bring them together,' thought God.</p><p> 
'They cannot make their tools, prepare and transport their timber, build their 
houses, sow and gather their harvests, spin and weave, and make their clothes, 
each one alone by himself.'</p><p> 
'It will make them understand that the more heartily they work together, the 
more they will have and the better they will live; and this will unite them.'</p><p> 
Time passed on, and again God came to see how men were living, and whether they 
were now happy.</p><p> 
But he found them living worse than before. They worked together (that they 
could not help doing), but not all together, being broken up into little 
groups. And each group tried to snatch work   <pb n="292"/>  from other groups, and they 
hindered one another, wasting time and strength in their struggles, so that 
things went ill with them all.</p><p> 
Having seen that this, too, was not well, God decided so as to arrange things 
that man should not know the time of his death, but might die at any moment; 
and he announced this to them.</p><p> 
'Knowing that each of them may die at any moment,' thought God, 'they will not, 
by grasping at gains that may last so short a time, spoil the hours of life 
allotted to them.'</p><p> 
But it turned out otherwise. When God returned to see how people were living, 
he saw that their life was as bad as ever.</p><p> 
Those who were strongest, availing themselves of the fact that men might die at 
any time, subdued those who were weaker, killing some and threatening others 
with death. And it came about that the strongest and their descendants did no 
work, and suffered from the weariness of idleness, while those who were weaker 
had to work beyond their strength, and suffered from lack of rest. Each set of 
men feared and hated the other. And the life of man became yet more unhappy.</p><p> 
Having seen all this, God, to mend matters, decided to make use of one last 
means; he sent all kinds of sickness among men. God thought that when all men 
were exposed to sickness they would understand that those who are well should 
have pity on those who are sick, and should help them, that when they 
themselves fall ill those who are well might in turn help them.</p><p> 
And again God went away, but when He came back to see how men lived now that 
they were subject to sicknesses, he saw that their life was worse even than 
before. The very sickness that in God's purpose should have united men, had 
divided them   <pb n="293"/>  more than ever. Those men who were strong enough to make others 
work, forced them also to wait on them in times of sickness; but they did not, 
in their turn, look after others who were ill. And those who were forced to 
work for others and to look after them when sick, were so worn with work that 
they had no time to look after their own sick, but left them without 
attendance. That the sight of sick folk might not disturb the pleasures of the 
wealthy, houses were arranged in which these poor people suffered and died, far 
from those whose sympathy might have cheered them, and in the arms of hired 
people who nursed them without compassion, or even with disgust. Moreover, 
people considered many of the illnesses infectious, and, fearing to catch them, 
not only avoided the sick, but even separated themselves from those who 
attended the sick.</p><p> 
Then God said to Himself: 'If even this means will not bring men to understand 
wherein their happiness lies, let them be taught by suffering.' And God left 
men to themselves.</p><p> 
And, left to themselves, men lived long before they understood that they all 
ought to, and might be, happy. Only in the very latest times have a few of them 
begun to understand that work ought not to be a bugbear to some and like 
galley-slavery for others, but should be a common and happy occupation, uniting 
all men. They have begun to understand that with death constantly threatening 
each of us, the only reasonable business of every man is to spend the years, 
months, hours, and minutes, allotted him &mdash; in unity and love. They have begun 
to understand that sickness, far from dividing men, should, on the contrary, 
give opportunity for loving union with one another.</p><p>

  <pb n="294"/>   
</div2> 
<div2 type="story" n="23" id="d99"> 
<head>THREE QUESTIONS</head> 
<p>IT once occurred to a certain king, that if he always knew the right time to 
begin everything; if he knew who were the right people to listen to, and whom 
to avoid, and, above all, if he always knew what was the most important thing 
to do, he would never fail in anything he might undertake.</p><p> 
And this thought having occurred to him, he had it proclaimed throughout his 
kingdom that he would give a great reward to any one who would teach him what 
was the right time for every action, and who were the most necessary people, 
and how he might know what was the most important thing to do.</p><p> 
And learned men came to the King, but they all answered his questions 
differently.</p><p> 
In reply to the first question, some said that to know the right time for every 
action, one must draw up in advance, a table of days, months and years, and 
must live strictly according to it. Only thus, said they, could everything be 
done at its proper time. Others declared that it was impossible to decide 
beforehand the right time for every action; but that, not letting oneself be 
absorbed in idle pastimes, one should always attend to all that was going on, 
and then do what was most needful. Others, again, said that however attentive 
the King might be to what was going on, it was impossible for one man to decide 
correctly the right time for every action, but that he should have a Council of 
wise men, who would help him to fix the proper time for everything.</p><p> 
But then again others said there were some things which could not wait to be 
laid before a Council,   <pb n="295"/>  but about which one had at once to decide whether to 
undertake them or not. But in order to decide that one must know beforehand 
what was going to happen. It is only magicians who know that; and, therefore in 
order to know the right time for every action, one must consult magicians.</p><p> 
Equally various were the answers to the second question. Some said, the people 
the King most needed were his councillors; others, the priests; others, the 
doctors; while some said the warriors were the most necessary.</p><p> 
To the third question, as to what was the most important occupation: some 
replied that the most important thing in the world was science. Others said it 
was skill in warfare; and others, again, that it was religious worship.</p><p> 
All the answers being different, the King agreed with none of them, and gave 
the reward to none. But still wishing to find the right answers to his 
questions, he decided to consult a hermit, widely renowned for his wisdom.</p><p> 
The hermit lived in a wood which he never quitted and he received none but 
common folk. So the King put on simple clothes, and before reaching the 
hermit's cell dismounted from his horse, and, leaving his bodyguard behind, 
went on alone.</p><p> 
When the King approached, the hermit was digging the ground in front of his 
hut. Seeing the King, he greeted him and went on digging. The hermit was frail 
and weak, and each time he stuck his spade into the ground and turned a little 
earth, he breathed heavily.</p><p> 
The King went up to him and said: 'I have come to you, wise hermit, to ask you 
to answer three questions: How can I learn to do the right thing at the right 
time? Who are the people I most need, and to whom should I, therefore, pay more 
attention   <pb n="296"/>  than to the rest? And, what affairs are the most important and need 
my first attention?'</p><p> 
The hermit listened to the King, but answered nothing. He just spat on his hand 
and recommenced digging.</p><p> 
'You are tired,' said the King, 'let me take the spade and work awhile for 
you.'</p><p> 
'Thanks!' said the hermit, and, giving the spade to the King, he sat down on 
the ground.</p><p> 
When he had dug two beds, the King stopped and repeated his questions. The 
hermit again gave no answer, but rose, stretched out his hand for the spade, 
and said:</p><p> 
'Now rest awhile &mdash; and let me work a bit.'</p><p> 
But the King did not give him the spade, and continued to dig. One hour passed, 
and another. The sun began to sink behind the trees, and the King at last stuck 
the spade into the ground, and said:</p><p> 
'I came to you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If you can give me 
none, tell me so, and I will return home.'</p><p> 
'Here comes some one running,' said the hermit, 'let us see who it is.'</p><p> 
The King turned round, and saw a bearded man come running out of the wood. The 
man held his hands pressed against his stomach, and blood was flowing from 
under them. When he reached the King, he fell fainting on the ground moaning 
feebly. The King and the hermit unfastened the man's clothing. There was a 
large wound in his stomach. The King washed it as best he could, and bandaged 
it with his handkerchief and with a towel the hermit had. But the blood would 
not stop flowing, and the King again and again removed the bandage soaked with 
warm blood, and washed and rebandaged the wound. When at last the blood ceased 
flowing, the man revived and asked for something to drink.   <pb n="297"/>  The King brought 
fresh water and gave it to him. Meanwhile the sun had set, and it had become 
cool. So the King, with the hermit's help, carried the wounded man into the hut 
and laid him on the bed. Lying on the bed the man closed his eyes and was 
quiet; but the King was so tired with his walk and with the work he had done, 
that he crouched down on the threshold, and also fell asleep &mdash;  so soundly 
that he slept all through the short summer night. When he awoke in the morning, 
it was long before he could remember where he was, or who was the strange 
bearded man lying on the bed and gazing intently at him with shining eyes.</p><p> 
'Forgive me!' said the bearded man in a weak voice, when he saw that the King 
was awake and was looking at him.</p><p> 
'I do not know you, and have nothing to forgive you for,' said the King.</p><p> 
'You do not know me, but I know you. I am that enemy of yours who swore to 
revenge himself on you, because you executed his brother and seized his 
property. I knew you had gone alone to see the hermit, and I resolved to kill 
you on your way back. But the day passed and you did not return. So I came out 
from my ambush to find you, and I came upon your bodyguard, and they recognized 
me, and wounded me. I escaped from them, but should have bled to death had you 
not dressed my wound. I wished to kill you, and you have saved my life. Now, if 
I live, and if you wish it, I will serve you as your most faithful slave, and 
will bid my sons do the same. Forgive me!'</p><p> 
The King was very glad to have made peace with his enemy so easily, and to have 
gained him for a friend, and he not only forgave him, but said he would send 
his servants and his own physician to attend him, and promised to restore his 
property.</p>   <pb n="298"/>  <p> 
Having taken leave of the wounded man, the King went out into the porch and 
looked around for the hermit. Before going away he wished once more to beg an 
answer to the questions he had put. The hermit was outside, on his knees, 
sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the day before.</p><p> 
The King approached him, and said:</p><p> 
'For the last time, I pray you to answer my questions, wise man.'</p><p> 
'You have already been answered!' said the hermit still crouching on his thin 
legs, and looking up at the King, who stood before him.</p><p> 
'How answered? What do you mean?' asked the King.</p><p> 
'Do you not see,' replied the hermit. 'If you had not pitied my weakness 
yesterday, and had not dug these beds for me, but had gone your way, that man 
would have attacked you, and you would have repented of not having stayed with 
me. So the most important time was when you were digging the beds; and I was 
the most important man; and to do me good was your most important business. 
Afterwards, when that man ran to us, the most important time was when you were 
attending to him, for if you had not bound up his wounds he would have died 
without having made peace with you. So he was the most important man, and what 
you did for him was your most important business. Remember then: there is only 
one time that is important &mdash; Now! It is the most important time because it is 
the only time when we have any power. The most necessary man is he with whom 
you are, for no man knows whether he will ever have dealings with any one else: 
and the most important affair is, to do him good, because for that purpose 
alone was man sent into this life!'</p><p>
