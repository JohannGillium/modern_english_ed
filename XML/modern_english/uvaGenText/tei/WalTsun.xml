<p> 
I am Gyo&commacr;kei, priest of the imperial temple Ninnaji. You must know 
that there was a certain prince of the House of Taira named Tsunemasa, 
Lord of Tajima, who since his boyhood has enjoyed beyond all precedent the 
favour of our master the Emperor. But now he has been killed at the Battle 
of the Western Seas. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
It was to this Tsunemasa in his lifetime that the Emperor had given the 
lute called Green Hill. And now my master bids me take it and dedicate it 
to Buddha, performing a liturgy of flutes and strings for the salvation of 
Tsunemasa's soul. And that was my purpose in gathering these musicians 
together. 
</p>

Truly it is said that strangers who shelter under the same tree or draw

How strange! When the form of Tsunemasa had vanished, his voice lingered

the dead. Oh! marvellous potency of the Law!

It was long ago that I came to the Palace. I was but a boy then, but all 
the world knew me; for I was marked with the love of our Lord, with the 
favour of an Emperor. And, among many gifts, he gave to me once while I 
was in the World this lute which you have dedicated. My fingers were ever 
on its strings.
