<head>PREFACE.</head>

<p>To the readers of the present generation much of this book will,
doubtless, seem incredible.  Still it is a book of facts&mdash;a section of our
social history, which is, I think, worth writing, and deserving of
meditation.
</p>
<p>Forty or fifty years ago &mdash; that is, within the memory of many a
living man &mdash; gambling was `the rage' in England, especially in the
metropolis.  Streets now meaningless and dull &mdash; such as Oxendon Street,
and streets and squares now inhabited by the most respectable in the land
&mdash; for instance, St James's Square, <hi rend="italic">*then</hi> opened doors to
countless votaries of the fickle and capricious goddess of Fortune; in the
rooms of which many a nobleman, many a gentleman, many an officer
of the Army and Navy, clergymen, tradesmen, clerks, and apprentices,
were `cleaned out' &mdash; ruined, and driven to self-murder, or to crimes that
led to the gallows.  `I have myself,' says a writer of the time, `seen
hanging in chains a man whom a short time before I saw at a Hazard
table!'
</p>
<p>History, as it is commonly written, does not sufficiently take
cognizance of the social pursuits and practices that sap the vitality of a
nation; and yet these are the leading influences in its destiny &mdash; making it
what it is and will be, at least through many generations, by example and
the inexorable laws that preside over what is called `hereditary
transmission.'


<pb n="viii"/>
</p>
<p>Have not the gambling propensities of our forefathers influenced
the present generation? . . . .
</p>
<p>No doubt gambling, in the sense treated of in this book, has ceased
in England.  If there be here and there a <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi> or
<hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi> table in operation, its existence is now known
only to a few `sworn-brethren;' if gambling at cards `prevails' in certain
quarters, it is `kept quiet.'  The vice is not barefaced.  It slinks and
skulks away into corners and holes, like a poisoned rat.  Therefore,
public morality has triumphed, or, to use the card-phrase, `trumped' over
this dreadful abuse; and the law has done its duty, or has reason to
expect congratulation for its success, in `putting down' gaming houses.
</p>
<p>But we gamble still.  The gambling on the <hi rend="italic">Turf</hi> (now
the most uncertain of all `games of chance') was, lately, something that
rang through and startled the entire nation.  We gamble in the funds.
We gamble in endless companies (limited) &mdash; all resulting from the same
passion of our nature, which led to the gambling of former times with
cards, with dice, at Piquet, Basset, Faro, Hazard, E O,
<hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi>.  At a recent
memorable trial, the Lord Chief Justice of England exclaimed &mdash; `There
can be no doubt &mdash; any one who looks around him cannot fail to perceive
&mdash; that a spirit of speculation and gambling has taken hold of the minds
of large classes of the population.  Men who were wont to be satisfied
with moderate gain and safe investments seem now to be animated by a
spirit of greed after gain, which makes them ready to embark their
fortunes, however hardly gained, in the vain hope of realizing immense
returns by premiums upon shares, and of making more than safe and
reasonable gains.  We see that continually.'  In fact, we may not be a jot
better morally than our forefathers.  But that is no reason why we should
not frown over the story

<pb n="ix"/>
of their horrid sins, and, `having a good conscience,' think what sad
dogs they were in their generation &mdash; knowing, as we do, that none of us
at the present day lose <hi rend="italic">*fifty or a hundred thousand pounds</hi>
at play, at a sitting, in one single night &mdash; as was certainly no very
uncommon `event' in those palmy days of gaming; and that we could not
&mdash; as was done in 1820 &mdash; produce a list of <hi rend="italic">*five hundred</hi>
names (in London alone) of noblemen, gentlemen, officers of the Army
and Navy, and clergymen, who were veteran or indefatigable gamesters,
besides `clerks, grocers, horse-dealers, linen-drapers, silk-mercers,
masons, builders, timber-merchants, booksellers, &amp;c., &amp;c., and men of
the very lowest walks of life,' who frequented the numerous gaming
houses throughout the metropolis &mdash; to their ruin and that of their families
more or less (as deploringly lamented by Captain Gronow), and not a
few of them, no doubt, finding themselves in that position in which they
could exclaim, at <hi rend="italic">*our</hi> remonstrance, as feelingly as did King
Richard &mdash;
</p>
<l>`Slave! I have set my life upon a <hi rend="italic">cast</hi>,
</l>
<l>And I will stand the <hi rend="italic">hazard of the die!</hi>'</l>

<p>Nor is gaming as yet extinct among us.  Every now and then a
batch of youngsters is brought before the magistrates charged with vulgar
`tossing' in the streets; and every now and then we hear of some victim
of genteel gambling, as recently &mdash; in the month of February, 1868 &mdash;
when `a young member of the aristocracy lost &pound;10,000 at Whist.'
</p>
<p>Nay, at the commencement of the present year there appeared in a
daily paper the following startling announcement to the editor: &mdash;

</p>
<p>`Sir, &mdash; Allow me, through the columns of your paper, to call the
attention of the parents and friends of the young officers in the Channel-fleet to the great extent gambling is

<pb n="x"/>
carried on at Lisbon.  Since the fleet has been there another gambling
house has been opened, and is filled every evening with young officers,
many of whom are under 18 years of age.  On the 1st of January it is
computed that upwards of &pound;800 was lost by officers of the fleet in
the gambling houses, and if the fleet is to stay there three months there
will soon be a great number of the officers involved in debt.  I will
relate one incident that came under my personal notice.  A young
midshipman, who had lately joined the Channel fleet from the Bristol,
drew a half-year's pay in December, besides his quarterly allowance, and
I met him on shore the next evening without money enough to pay a boat
to go off to his ship, having lost all at a gambling house.
</p>
<p>Hoping that this may be of some use in stopping the gambling
among the younger officers, I remain, yours respectfully,
</p>
<p>
AN OFFICER.'[1]</p>
<note place="foot" n="1"><p>[1] Standard, Jan. 12, 1870.</p></note>
<p>In conclusion, I have contemplated the passion of gaming in all its
bearings, as will be evident from the range of subjects indicated by the
table of contents and index.  I have ransacked (and sacked) hundreds of
volumes for entertaining, amusing, curious, or instructive matter.
</p>
<p>Without deprecating criticism on my labours, perhaps I may state
that these researches have probably terminated my career as an author.
Immediately after the completion of this work I was afflicted with a
degree of blindness rendering it impossible for me to read any print
whatever, and compelling me to write only by dictation.

THE GAMING TABLE.<lb/>
CHAPTER I.<lb/>
<lb/>
THE UNIVERSAL PASSION OF GAMING; OR, GAMING ALL THE
WORLD OVER.</head>

<p>A VERY apt allegory has been imagined as the origin of Gaming.
It is said that the Goddess of Fortune, once sporting near the shady pool
of Olympus, was met by the gay and captivating God of War, who soon
allured her to his arms.  They were united; but the matrimony was not
holy, and the result of the union was a misfeatured child named Gaming.
From the moment of her birth this wayward thing could only be pleased
by cards, dice, or counters.
</p>
<p>She was not without fascinations, and many were her admirers.
As she grew up she was courted by all the gay and extravagant of both
sexes, for she

<pb n="2"/>
was of neither sex, and yet combining the attractions of each.  At length,
however, being mostly beset by men of the sword, she formed an
unnatural union with one of them, and gave birth to twins &mdash; one called
DUELLING, and the other a grim and hideous monster named
SUICIDE.  These became their mother's darlings, nursed by her with
constant care and tenderness, and her perpetual companions.
</p>
<p>The Goddess Fortune ever had an eye on her promising daughter &mdash;
Gaming; and endowed her with splendid residences, in the most
conspicuous streets, near the palaces of kings.  They were magnificently
designed and elegantly furnished.  Lamps, always burning at the portals,
were a sign and a perpetual invitation unto all to enter; and, like the
gates of the Inferno, they were ever open to daily and nightly visitants;
but, unlike the latter, they permitted <hi rend="italic">exit</hi> to all who entered --some exulting with golden spoil, &mdash; others with their hands in empty
pockets, &mdash; some led by her half-witted son Duelling, &mdash; others escorted
by her malignant monster Suicide, and his mate, the demon Despair.
</p>

<lg type="poem">
<l>`Religion, morals, virtue, all give way, </l>
<l>And conscience dies, the prostitute of play.</l>

<pb n="3"/>

 <l>Eternity ne'er steals one thought between, </l>
<l>Till suicide completes the fatal scene.'</l>
</lg>
<p>Such is the <hi rend="italic">allegory</hi>;[2] and it may serve well enough
to represent the thing in accordance with the usages of civilized or
modern life; but Gaming is a <hi rend="italic">*universal</hi> thing &mdash; the
characteristic of the human biped all the world over.
</p><p>
<note place="foot" n="2"><p>[2] It appeared originally, I think, in the
Harleian Miscellany.  I have taken the liberty to re-touch it here and
there, with the view to improvement.</p></note>

</p>
<p>The determination of events by `lot' was a practice frequently
resorted to by the Israelites; as, by lot it was determined which of the
goats should be offered by Aaron; by lot the land of Canaan was
divided; by lot Saul was marked out for the Hebrew kingdom; by lot
Jonah was discovered to be the cause of the storm.  It was considered an
appeal to Heaven to determine the points, and was thought not to depend
on blind chance, or that imaginary being called Fortune, who,
 </p>

<lg type="poem"><l>`&mdash;With malicious joy, </l>
<l> Promotes, degrades, delights in strife, </l>
<l> And makes a <hi rend="italic">lottery</hi> of life.'</l>
</lg>
<p>The Hindoo Code &mdash; a promulgation of very

<pb n="4"/>
high antiquity &mdash; denounces gambling, which proves that there were
desperate gamesters among the Hindoos in the earliest times.  Men
gamed, too, it would appear, after the example set them by the gods,
who had gamesters among them.  The priests of Egypt assured
Herodotus that one of their kings visited alive the lower regions called
infernal, and that he there joined a gaming party, at which he both lost
and won.[3]  Plutarch tells a pretty Egyptian story to the effect, that
Mercury having fallen in love with Rhea, or the Earth, and wishing to
do her a favour, gambled with the Moon, and won from her every
seventieth part of the time she illumined the horizon &mdash; all which parts he
united together, making up <hi rend="italic">*five days</hi>, and added them to the
Earth's year, which had previously consisted of only 360 days.[4]
</p>

<note place="foot" n="4"><p>[4] Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">De Isid. et
Osirid.</hi></p></note>
</p>
<p>But not only did the gods play among themselves on Olympus, but
they gambled with mortals.  According to Plutarch, the priest of the
temple of Hercules amused himself with playing at dice with the god, the
stake or conditions being that if he won he should obtain some signal
favour, but if he

<pb n="5"/>
lost he would procure a beautiful courtesan for Hercules.[5]
</p>
<p>
<note place="foot" n="5"><p>[5] <hi rend="italic">In Vit&acirc; Romuli</hi>.</p></note>
</p>
<p>By the numerous nations of the East dice, and that pugnacious little
bird the cock, have been and are the chief instruments employed to
produce a sensation &mdash; to agitate their minds and to ruin their fortunes.
The Chinese have in all times, we suppose, had cards &mdash; hence the
absurdity of the notion that they were `invented' for the amusement of
Charles VI. of France, in his `lucid intervals,' as is constantly asserted
in every collection of historic facts.  The Chinese invented cards, as they
invented almost everything else that administers to our social and
domestic comfort.[6]
</p>
<p>
<note place="foot" n="6"><p>[6] Observations on Cards, by Mr Gough, in
<hi rend="italic">Arch&aelig;ologia</hi>, vol. viii. 1787.</p></note>
</p>

<p>The Asiatic gambler is desperate.  When all other property is
played away, he scruples not to stake his wife, his child, on the cast of a
die or on the courage of the martial bird before mentioned.  Nay more,
if still unsuccessful, the last venture he makes is that of his limbs &mdash; his
personal liberty &mdash; his life &mdash; which he hazards on the caprice of chance,
and agrees to be at the mercy, or to become the

<pb n="6"/>
slave, of his fortunate antagonist.
</p>
<p>The Malayan, however, does not always tamely submit to this last
stroke of fortune.  When reduced to a state of desperation by repeated
ill-luck, he loosens a certain lock of hair on his head, which, when
flowing down, is a sign of war and destruction.  He swallows opium or
some intoxicating liquor, till he works himself up into a fit of frenzy,
and begins to bite and kill everything that comes in his way; whereupon,
as the aforesaid lock of hair is seen flowing, it is lawful to fire at and
destroy him as quickly as possible &mdash; he being considered no better than a
mad dog.  A very rational conclusion.
</p>
<p>Of course the Chinese are most eager gamesters, or they would not
have been capable of inventing those dear, precious killers of time &mdash;
cards, the <hi rend="italic">*evening</hi> solace of so many a household in the
most respectable and `proper' walks of life.  Indeed, they play night and
day &mdash; until they have lost all they are worth, and then they usually go &mdash;
and hang themselves.
</p>
<p>If we turn our course northward, and penetrate the regions of ice
perpetual, we find that the driven snow cannot effectually quench the
flames of

<pb n="7"/>
gambling.  They glow amid the regions of the frozen pole.  The
Greenlanders gamble with a board, which has a finger-piece upon it,
turning round on an axle; and the person to whom the finger points on
the stopping of the board, which is whirled round, `sweeps' all the
`stakes' that have been deposited.
</p>
<p>If we descend thence into the Western hemisphere, we find that the
passion for gambling forms a distinguishing feature in the character of all
the rude natives of the American continent.  Just as in the East, these
savages will lose their aims (on which subsistence depends), their
apparel, and at length their personal liberty, on games of chance.  There
is one thing, however, which must be recorded to their credit &mdash; and to
our shame.  When they have lost their `all,' they do not follow the
example of our refined gamesters.  They neither murmur nor repine.
Not a fretful word escapes them.  They bear the frowns of fortune with a
philosophic composure.[7]
</p>
<p>
<note place="foot" n="7"><p>[7] Carver, <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi>.</p></note>
</p>
<p>If we cross the Atlantic and land on the African shore, we find that
the `everlasting Negro' is a gambler &mdash; using shells as dice &mdash; and
following the

<pb n="8"/>
practice of his `betters' in every way.  He stakes not only his `fortune,'
but also his children and liberty, which he cares very little about, every-where, until we incite him to do so &mdash; as, of course, we ought to do, for
every motive `human and divine.'
</p>
<p>There is no doubt, then, that this propensity is part and parcel of
`the unsophisticated savage.'  Let us turn to the eminently civilized races
of antiquity &mdash; the men whose example we have more or less followed in
every possible matter, sociality, politics, religion &mdash; they were all
gamblers, more or less.  Take the grand prototypes of Britons, the
Romans of old.  That gamesters they were!  And how gambling recruited
the ranks of the desperadoes who gave them insurrectionary trouble!
Catiline's `army of scoundrels,' for instance.  `Every man dishonoured
by dissipation,' says Sallust, `who by his follies or losses at the gaming
table had consumed the inheritance of his fathers, and all those who were
sufferers by such misery, were the friends of this perverse man.'
Horace, Juvenal, Persius, Cicero, and other writers, attest the fact of
Roman gambling most eloquently, most indignantly.


<pb n="9"/>

</p>
<p>The Romans had `lotteries,' or games of chance, and some of their
prizes were of great value, as a good estate and slaves, or rich vases;
others of little value, as vases of common earth, but of this more in the
sequel.
</p>
<p>Among the Gothic kings who, in the fulness of time and
accomplishments, `succeeded' to that empire, we read of a Theodoric, `a
wise and valiant prince,' who was `great lover of dice;' his solicitude in
play was only for victory; and his companions knew how to seize the
moment of his success, as consummate courtiers, to put forward their
petitions and to make their requests.  `When I have a petition to prefer,'
says one of them, `I am easily beaten in the game that I may win my
cause.'[8]  What a clever contrivance!  But scarcely equal to that of the
<hi rend="italic">*great</hi> (in politeness) Lord Chesterfield, who, to gain a vote
for a parliamentary friend, actually submitted to be <hi rend="italic">bled!</hi>  It
appears that the voter was deemed very difficult, but Chesterfield found
out that the man was a doctor, who was a perfect Sangrado,
recommending bleeding for every ailment.  He went to him, as in

consultation, agreed with the man's arguments, and at once bared his
arm for the operation.  On the point of departure his lordship `edged' in
the question about the vote for his friend, which was, of course,
gushingly promised and given.

<p>Although there may not be much Gothic blood among us, it is
quite certain that there is plenty of German mixture in our nation &mdash;
taking the term in its very wide and comprehensive ethnology.  Now,
Tacitus describes the ancient stout and valiant Germans as `making
gaming with a die a very serious occupation of their sober hours.'  Like
the `everlasting Negro,' they, too, made their last throw for personal
liberty, the loser going into voluntary slavery, and the winner selling
such slaves as soon as possible to strangers, in order not to have to blush
for such a victory!  If the `nigger' could blush, he might certainly do so
for the white man in such a conjuncture.

<p>At Naples and other places in Italy, at least in former times, the
boatmen used thus to stake their liberty for a certain number of years.
According to Hyde,[9] the Indians stake their fingers and cut them off
themselves to pay the debt of honour.

<pb n="11"/>
Englishmen have cut off their ears, both as a `security' for a gambling
loan, and as a stake; others have staked their lives by hanging, in like
manner!  Instances will be given in the sequel.

</p>
<p>But leaving these savages and the semi-savages of the very olden
time, let us turn to those nearer to our times, with just as much religious
truth and principle among them as among ourselves.
</p>
<p>The warmth with which `dice-playing' is condemned in the
writings of the <hi rend="italic">Fathers</hi>, the venerable expounders of
Christianity, as well as by `edicts' and `canons' of the Church, is
unquestionably a sufficient proof of its general and excessive prevalence
throughout the nations of Europe.  When cards were introduced, in the
fourteenth century, they only added fuel to the infernal flame of
gambling; and it soon became as necessary to restrain their use as it had
been that of dice.  The two held a joint empire of ruin and desolation
over their devoted victims.  A king of France set the ruinous example &mdash;
Henry IV., the rou&eacute;, the libertine, the duellist, the gambler, &mdash;
and yet (historically) the <hi rend="italic">Bon Henri</hi>, the `good king,' who
wished to order things so that every Frenchman

<pb n="12"/>
might have a <hi rend="italic">pot-au-feu</hi>, or dish of flesh savoury, every
Sunday for dinner.  The money that Henry IV. lost at play would have
covered great public expenses.
</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the spirit of gaming went on acquiring
new strength and development throughout every subsequent reign in
France; and we shall see that under the Empire the thing was a great
national institution, and made to put a great deal of money as `revenue'
into the hands of Fouch&eacute;.
</p>
<p>But the Spaniards have always been, of all nations, the most
addicted to gambling.  A traveller says: &mdash; `I have wandered through all
parts of Spain, and though in many places I have scarcely been able to
procure a glass of wine, or a bit of bread, or any of the first
conveniences of life, yet I never went through a village so mean and out
of the way, in which I could not have purchased a pack of cards.'  This
was in the middle of the seventeenth century, but I have no doubt it is
true at the present moment.
</p>
<p>If we can believe Voltaire, the Spaniards were formerly very
generous in their gaming.  `The grandees of Spain,' he says, `had a
generous osten

<pb n="13"/>
tation; this was to divide the money won at play among all the
bystanders, of whatever condition.
</p>
<p>Montrefor relates that when the Duke of Lerma, the Spanish
minister, entertained Gaston, brother of Louis XIII., with all his retinue
in the Netherlands, he displayed a magnificence of an extraordinary
kind.  The prime minister, with whom Gaston spent several days, used
to put two thousand louis d'ors on a large gaming-table after dinner.
With this money Gaston's attendants and even the prince himself sat
down to play.  It is probable, however, that Voltaire extended a single
instance or two into a general habit or custom.  That writer always
preferred to deal with the splendid and the marvellous rather than with
plain matter of fact.
</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that the Spaniards pursued gaming in the
vulgar fashion, just as other people.  At any rate the following anecdote
gives us no very favourable idea of Spanish generosity to strangers in the
matter of gambling in modern times; and the worst of it is the
suitableness of its application to more capitals than one among the
kingdoms of Europe.  `After the bull-feast I was invited to pass the
evening at the hotel of a

<pb n="14"/>
lady, who had a public card-assembly. . . .  This vile method of
subsisting on the folly of mankind is confined in Spain to the nobility.
None but women of quality are permitted to hold banks, and there are
many whose faro-banks bring them in a clear income of a thousand
guineas a year.  The lady to whom I was introduced is an old countess,
who has lived nearly thirty years on the profits of the card-tables in her
house.  They are frequented every day, and though both natives and
foreigners are duped of large sums by her, and her cabinet-junto, yet it
is the greatest house of resort in all Madrid.  She goes to court, visits
people of the first fashion, and is received with as much respect and
veneration as if she exercised the most sacred functions of a divine
profession.  Many widows of great men keep gaming-houses and live
splendidly on the vices of mankind.  If you be not disposed to play, be
either a sharper or a dupe, you cannot be admitted a second time to their
assemblies.  I was no sooner presented to the lady than she offered me
cards; and on my excusing myself, because I really could not play, she
made a very wry face, turned from me, and said to another lady in my
hearing, that she wondered how

<pb n="15"/>
any foreigner could have the impertinence to come to her house for no
other purpose than to make an apology for not playing.  My Spanish
conductor, unfortunately for himself, had not the same apology.  He
played and lost his money &mdash; two circumstances which constantly follow
in these houses.  While my friend was thus playing <hi rend="italic">the fool</hi>,
I attentively watched the countenance and motions of the lady of the
house.  Her anxiety, address, and assiduity were equal to that of some
skilful shopkeeper, who has a certain attraction to engage all to buy, and
diligence to take care that none shall escape the net.  I found out all her
privy-counsellors, by her arrangement of her parties at the different
tables; and whenever she showed an extraordinary eagerness to fix one
particular person with a stranger, the game was always decided the same
way, and her good friend was sure to win the money.
</p>
<p>`In short, it is hardly possible to see good company at Madrid
unless you resolve to leave a purse of gold at the card-assemblies of their
nobility.'[10]

<p>We are assured that this state of things is by no means `obsolete'

time.  At the time in question, however, the beginning of the present
century, there was no European nation among which gaming did not
constitute one of its polite and fashionable amusements &mdash; with the
exception of the <hi rend="italic">Turks</hi>, who, to the shame of Christians,
strictly obeyed the precepts of Mahomet, and scrupulously avoided the
`gambling itch' of our nature.
</p>
<p>In England gambling prevailed during the reign of Henry VIII.;
indeed, it seems that the king was himself a gamester of the most
unscrupulous sort; and there is ample evidence that the practice
flourished during the reign of Elizabeth, James I., and subsequently,
especially in the times of Charles II.  Writing on the day when James II.
was proclaimed king, Evelyn says, `I can never forget the inexpressible
luxury and profaneness, gaming and all dissoluteness, and as it were
total forgetfulness of God (it being Sunday evening) which this day
se'nnight I was witness of, the king sitting and toying with his
concubines, Portsmouth, Cleaveland, and Mazarine, &amp;c., a French boy
singing love-songs, in that glorious gallery, whilst about twenty of the
great courtiers and other dissolute persons were at Basset round a large
table; a bank of at

<pb n="17"/>
least &pound;2000 in gold before them, upon which two gentlemen who
were with me made reflections with astonishment.  Six days after all was
in the dust!'
</p>
<p>The following curious observations on the gaming in vogue during
the year 1668 are from the Harleian Miscellany:
</p>
<p>`One propounded this question, &ldquo;Whether men in ships at
sea were to be accounted amongst the living or the dead &mdash; because there
were but few inches betwixt them and drowning?&amp;&rdquo;  The same
query may be made of gamesters, though their estates be never so
considerable &mdash; whether they are to be esteemed rich or poor, since there
are but a few casts at dice betwixt a person of fortune (in that
circumstance) and a beggar.
</p>
<p>`Betwixt twelve and one of the clock a good dinner is prepared by
way of ordinary, and some gentlemen of civility and condition oftentimes
eat there, and play a while for recreation after dinner, both moderately
and most commonly without deserving reproof.  Towards night, when
ravenous beasts usually seek their prey, there come in shoals of hectors,
trepanners, gilts, pads, biters, prigs, divers, lifters, kidnappers,
vouchers, mill kens, piemen, decoys, shop-lifters, foilers, bulkers,

<pb n="18"/>
droppers, gamblers, donnakers, crossbiters, &amp;c., under the general
appellation of &ldquo;rooks;&amp;&rdquo; and in this particular it serves as a
nursery for Tyburn, for every year some of this gang march thither.
</p>
<p>`Would you imagine it to be true &mdash; that a grave gentleman, well
stricken in years, insomuch as he cannot see the pips of the dice, is so
infatuated with this witchery as to play here with others' eyes, &mdash; of
whom this quibble was raised, &ldquo;Mr Such a one plays at dice by
the ear.&amp;&rdquo;  Another gentleman, stark blind, I have seen play at
Hazard, and surely that must be by the ear too.
</p>
<p>`Late at night, when the company grows thin, and your eyes dim
with watching, false dice are often put upon the ignorant, or they are
otherwise cozened, with topping or slurring, &amp;c.; and, if you be not
vigilant, the box-keeper shall score you up double or treble boxes, and,
though you have lost your money, dun you as severely for it as if it were
the justest debt in the world.
</p>
<p>`There are yet some genteeler and more subtle rooks, whom you
shall not distinguish by their outward demeanour from persons of
condition; and who will sit by a whole evening, and observe who wins;
and then, if the winner be &ldquo;bubbleable,&amp;&rdquo;

<pb n="19"/>
they will insinuate themselves into his acquaintance, and civilly invite
him to drink a glass of wine, &mdash; wheedle him into play, and win all his
money, either by false dice, as high fulhams,[11] low fulhams, or by
palming, topping, &amp;c.<hi rend="super">* * *</hi>  Note by the way, that
when they have you at the tavern and think you a sure
&ldquo;bubble,&amp;&rdquo; they will many times purposely lose some small
sum to you the first time, to engage you more freely to <hi rend="italic">bleed</hi>
(as they call it) at the second meeting, to which they will be sure to
invite you.
</p>


<note place="foot" n="11"><p>[11] It appears that false dice were originally
made at <hi rend="italic">Fulham;</hi> hence so called, high and low fulhams; the

<p>`A gentleman whom ill-fortune had hurried into passion, took a
box and dice to a side-table, and then fell to throwing by himself; at
length he swears with an emphasis, &ldquo;D &mdash; e, now I throw for
nothin;, I can win a thousand pounds; but when I lay for money I lose
my all.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>

be treated below with suppers at night, and caudle in the morning, and
have the honour to be styled, &ldquo;a lover of the house,&amp;&rdquo;

<pb n="20"/>
whilst your money lasts, which certainly will not be
long.<hi rend="super">* * * *</hi>
</p>
<p>`Most gamesters begin at small games, and by degrees, if their
money or estates hold out, they rise to great sums; some have played
first all their money, then their rings, coach and horses, even their
wearing clothes and <hi rend="italic">perukes;</hi> and then, such a farm; and at
last, perhaps a lordship.
</p>
<p>`You may read in our histories, how Sir Miles Partridge played at
dice with King Henry the Eighth, for Jesus Bells (so called), which were
the greatest in England, and hung in a tower of St Paul's church, and
won them; whereby he brought them to ring in his pocket; but the ropes
afterwards catched about his neck; for, in Edward the Sixth's days, he
was hanged for some criminal offences.[12]
</p><note place="foot" n="12"><p>
[12] The clochier in Paul's Churchyard &mdash; a bell-house, four square,
builded of stone, with four bells; these were called <hi rend="italic">Jesus</hi>
Bells.  The same had a great spire of timber, covered with lead, with the
image of St Paul on the top, but was pulled down by Sir Miles Partridge,
Kt, in the reign of Henry VIII.  The common speech then was that he
did set &pound;100 upon a cast at dice against it, and so won the said
clochier and bells of the king.  And then causing the bells to be broken
as they hung, the rest was pulled down, and broken also.  This man was
afterwards executed on Tower Hill, for matters concerning the Duke of
Somerset, in the year 1551, the 5th of Edward VI. &mdash; Stowe, B. iii.
148.</p></note>


<pb n="21"/>
<p>`Sir Arthur Smithhouse is yet fresh in memory.  He had a fair
estate, which in a few years he so lost at play, that he died in great want
and penury.  Since that Mr Ba &mdash; , who was a clerk in the Six-Clerks
Office, and well cliented, fell to play, and won by extraordinary fortune
two thousand pieces in ready gold; was not content with that, played on,
lost all he had won, and almost all his own estate; sold his place in the
office, and at last marched off to a foreign plantation, to begin a new
world with the sweat of his brow; for that is commonly the destiny of a
decayed gamester &mdash; either to go to some foreign plantation, or to be
preferred to the dignity of a <hi rend="italic">box-keeper</hi>.
</p>
<p>`It is not denied but most gamesters have, at one time or other, a
considerable run of winning, but such is the infatuation of play, I could
never hear of a man that gave over a winner &mdash; I mean, to give over so
as never to play again.  I am sure it is <hi rend="italic">rara avis</hi>, for if you
once &ldquo;break bulk,&amp;&rdquo; as they phrase it, you are in again for
all.  Sir Humphry Foster had lost the greatest part of his estate, and then
playing, as it is said, <hi rend="italic">for a dead horse</hi>, did, by happy
fortune, recover it again; then gave over, nd {sic/`and'} wisely too.'[13]

<pb n="22"/>

<p>The sequel will show the increase of gambling in our country
during the subsequent reigns, up to a recent period.
</p>
<p>Thus, then, the passion of gaming is, and has ever been, universal.
It is said that two Frenchmen could not exist even in a desert without -<hi rend="italic">*quarrelling;</hi> and it is quite certain that no two human beings
can be anywhere without ere long offering to `bet' upon something.
Indolence and want of employment &mdash; `vacuity,' as Dr Johnson would
call it &mdash; is the cause of the passion.  It arises from a want of habitual
employment in some material and regular line of conduct.  Your very
innocent card-parties at home &mdash; merely to kill <hi rend="italic">*time</hi> (what a
murder!) explains all the apparent mystery!  Something must be
substituted to call forth the natural activity of the mind; and this is in no
way more effectually accomplished, in all indolent pursuits, than by
those <hi rend="italic">*emotions and agitations</hi> which gambling produces.
</p>
<p>Such is the source of the thing in our <hi rend="italic">*nature;</hi> but then
comes the furious hankering after wealth &mdash; the desire to have it without
<hi rend="italic">*working</hi> for it &mdash; which is the wish of so many of us; and
<hi rend="italic">*this</hi> is the source of that hideous gambling which has pro

<pb n="23"/>
duced the contemptible characters and criminal acts which are the
burthen of this volume.
</p>
<p>We love play because it satisfies our avarice, &mdash; that is to say, our
desire of having more; it flatters our vanity by the idea of preference that
fortune gives us, and of the attention that others pay to our success; it
satisfies our curiosity, giving us a spectacle; in short, it gives us the
different pleasures of surprise.
</p>
<p>Certain it is that the passion for gambling easily gets deeply
rooted, and that it cannot be easily eradicated.  The most exquisite
melody, if compared with the music of dice, is then but discord; and the
finest prospect in nature only a miserable blank when put in competition
with the attractions of the `honours' at a rubber of Whist.
</p>
<p>Wealth is the general centre of inclination.  Whatever is the
ultimate design, the immediate care is to be rich.  No desire can be
formed which riches do not assist to gratify.  They may be considered as
the elementary principles of pleasure, which may be combined with
endless diversity.  There are nearer ways to profit than up the steeps of
labour.  The prospect of gaining speedily what is ardently desired, has so
far prevailed upon the

<pb n="24"/>
passions of mankind, that the peace of life is destroyed by a general and
incessant struggle for riches.  It is observed of gold by an old epigram-matist, that to have is to be in fear; and to want it is to be in sorrow.
There is no condition which is not disquieted either with the care of
gaining or keeping money.
</p>
<p>No nation has exceeded ours in the pursuit of gaming.  In former
times &mdash; and yet not more than 30 or 40 years ago &mdash; the passion for play
was predominant among the highest classes.
</p>
<p>Genius and abilities of the highest order became its votaries; and
the very framers of the laws against gambling were the first to fall under
the temptation of their breach!  The spirit of gambling pervaded every
inferior order of society.  The gentleman was a slave to its indulgence;
the merchant and the mechanic were the dupes of its imaginary
prospects; it engrossed the citizen and occupied the rustic.  Town and
country became a prey to its despotism.  There was scarcely an obscure
village to be found wherein this bewitching basilisk did not exercise its
powers of fascination and destruction.
</p>
<p>Gaming in England became rather a science

<pb n="25"/>
than an amusement of social intercourse.  The `doctrine of chances' was
studied with an assiduity that would have done honour to better subjects;
and calculations were made on arithmetical and geometrical principles, to
determine the degrees of probability attendant on games of mixed skill
and chance, or even on the fortuitous throws of dice.  Of course, in spite
of all calculations, there were miserable failures &mdash; frightful losses.  The
polite gamester, like the savage, did not scruple to hazard the dearest
interests of his family, or to bring his wife and children to poverty,
misery, and ruin.  He could not give these over in liquidation of a
gambling debt; indeed, nobody would, probably, have them at a gift; and
yet there were instances in which the honour of a wife was the stake of
the infernal game! . . . .  Well might the Emperor Justinian exclaim, &mdash;
`Can we call <hi rend="italic">*play</hi> that which causes crime?'[14]

GAMBLING AMONG THE ANCIENT HINDOOS. &mdash; A HINDOO
LEGEND AND ITS MODERN PARALLEL.</head>


<p>THE recent great contribution to the history of India, published by
Mr Wheeler,[15] gives a complete insight into this interesting topic; and
this passage of the ancient Sanskrit epic forms one of the most wonderful
and thrilling scenes in that most acceptable publication.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="15"><p>[15] The History of India from the Earliest
Ages.  By J. Talboys Wheeler.  Vol. I. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">The Vedic Period and
the Maha Bharata.</hi></p></note>

<p>As Mr Wheeler observes, the specialties of Hindoo gambling are
worthy of some attention.  The passion for play, which has ever been the
vice of warriors in times of peace, becomes a madness amidst the
lassitude of a tropical climate; and more than one Hindoo legend has
been preserved of Rajas playing together for days, until the wretched

<pb n="27"/>
loser has been deprived of everything he possessed and reduced to the
condition of an exile or a slave.
</p>
<p>But gambling amongst the Hindoos does not appear to have been
altogether dependent upon chance.  The ancient Hindoo dice, known by
the name of coupun, are almost precisely similar to the modern dice,
being thrown out of a box; but the practice of loading is plainly alluded
to, and some skill seems to have been occasionally exercised in the
rattling of the dice-box.  In the more modern game, known by the name
of pasha, the dice are not cubic, but oblong; and they are thrown from
the hand either direct upon the ground, or against a post or board, which
will break the fall, and render the result more a matter of chance.
</p>
<p>The great gambling match of the Hindoo epic was the result of a
conspiracy to ruin Yudhishthira, a successful warrior, the representative
of a mighty family &mdash; the Pandavas, who were incessantly pursued by the
envy of the Kauravas, their rivals.  The fortunes of the Pandavas were at
the height of human prosperity; and at this point the universal conception
of an avenging Nemesis that humbles the proud and casts down the
mighty, finds full expression in the Hindoo epic.  The grandeur of the

<pb n="28"/>
Pandavas excited the jealousy of Duryodhana, and revived the old feud
between the Kauravas and the former.  Duryodhana plotted with his
brother Duhsasana and his uncle Sakuni, how they might dispossess the
Pandavas of their newly-acquired territory; and at length they determined
to invite their kinsmen to a gambling match, and seek by underhand
means to deprive Yudhishthira of his Raj, or kingdom.[16]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="16"><p>[16] The old Sanskrit words <hi rend="italic">Raj</hi>,
`kingdom,' and Raja, `king,' are evidently the origin of the Latin
<hi rend="italic">reg-num, reg-o, rex, regula</hi>, `rule,' &amp;c, reproduced in the
words of that ancient language, and continued in the derivative
vernaculars of modern names &mdash; <hi rend="italic">re, rey, roy, roi, regal, royal,
rule</hi>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p></note>

<p>It appears from the poem that Yudhishthira was invited to a game
at coupun; and the legend of the great gambling match, which took place
at Hastinapur, is related as follows:
</p>
<p>`And it came to pass that Duryodhana was very jealous of the
<hi rend="italic">Rajasuya</hi> or triumph that his cousin Yudhishthira had
performed, and he desired in his heart to destroy the Pandavas, and gain
possession of their Raj.  Now Sakuni was the brother of Gandhari, who
was the mother of the Kauravas; and he was very skilful in throwing
dice, and in playing with dice that were loaded; insomuch that

<pb n="29"/>
whenever he played he always won the game.  So Duryodhana plotted
with his uncle, that Yudhishthira should be invited to a match at
gambling, and that Sakuni should challenge him to a game, and win all
his wealth and lands.
</p>
<p>`After this the wicked Duryodhana proposed to his father the
Maharaja, that they should have a great gambling match at Hastinapur,
and that Yudhishthira and his brethren should be invited to the festival.
And the Maharaja was glad in his heart that his sons should be friendly
with the sons of his deceased brother, Pandu; and he sent his younger
brother, Vidura, to the city of Indra-prastha to invite the Pandavas to the
game.  And Vidura went his way to the city of the Pandavas, and was
received by them with every sign of attention and respect.  And
Yudhishthira inquired whether his kinsfolk and friends at Hastinapur
were all well in health, and Vidura replied, &ldquo;They are all
well.&amp;&rdquo;  Then Vidura said to the Pandavas: &mdash; &ldquo;Your uncle,
the Maharaja, is about to give a great feast, and he has sent me to invite
you and your mother, and your joint wife, to come to his city, and there
will be a great match at dice-playing.&amp;&rdquo;  When Yudhishthira heard
these words he

<pb n="30"/>
was troubled in mind, for he knew that gaming was a frequent cause of
strife, and that he was in no way skilful in throwing the dice; and he
likewise knew that Sakuni was dwelling at Hastinapur, and that he was a
famous gambler.  But Yudhishthira remembered that the invitation of the
Maharaja was equal to the command of a father, and that no true
Kshatriya could refuse a challenge either to war or play.  So
Yudhishthira accepted the invitation, and gave commandment that on the
appointed day his brethren, and their mother, and their joint wife should
accompany him to the city of Hastinapur.
</p>
<p>`When the day arrived for the departure of the Pandavas they took
their mother Kunti, and their joint wife Draupadi, and journeyed from
Indra-prastha to the city of Hastinapur.  And when they entered the city
they first paid a visit of respect to the Maharaja, and they found him
sitting amongst his Chieftains; and the ancient Bhishma, and the
preceptor Drona, and Karna, who was the friend of Duryodhana, and
many others, were sitting there also.
</p>
<p>`And when the Pandavas had done reverence to the Maharaja, and
respectfully saluted all present,

<pb n="31"/>
they paid a visit to their aunt Gandhari, and did her reverence likewise.
</p>
<p>`And after they had done this, their mother and joint wife entered
the presence of Gandhari, and respectfully saluted her; and the wives of
the Kauravas came in and were made known to Kunti and Draupadi.
And the wives of the Kauravas were much surprised when they beheld
the beauty and fine raiment of Draupadi; and they were very jealous of
their kinswoman.  And when all their visits had been paid, the Pandavas
retired with their wife and mother to the quarters which had been
prepared for them, and when it was evening they received the visits of
all their friends who were dwelling at Hastinapur.
</p>
<p>`Now, on the morrow the gambling match was to be played; so
when the morning had come, the Pandavas bathed and dressed, and left
Draupadi in the lodging which had been prepared for her, and went their
way to the palace.  And the Pandavas again paid their respects to their
uncle the Maharaja, and were then conducted to the pavilion where the
play was to be; and Duryodhana went with them, together with all his
brethren, and all the chieftains of the royal house.  And when the as

<pb n="32"/>
sembly had all taken their seats, Sakuni said to Yudhishthira: &mdash;
&ldquo;The ground here has all been prepared, and the dice are all
ready:  Come now, I pray you, and play a game.&amp;&rdquo;  But
Yudhishthira was disinclined, and replied: &mdash; &ldquo;I will not play ex-cepting upon fair terms; but if you will pledge yourself to throw without
artifice or deceit, I will accept your challenge.&amp;&rdquo;  Sakuni said, &mdash;
&ldquo;If you are so fearful of losing, you had better not play at
all.&amp;&rdquo;  At these words Yudhishthira was wroth, and replied: &mdash;
&ldquo;I have no fear either in play or war; but let me know with
whom I am to play, and who is to pay me if I win.&amp;&rdquo;  So
Duryodhana came forward and said: &mdash; &ldquo;I am the man with whom
you are to play, and I shall lay any stakes against your stakes; but my
uncle Sakuni will throw the dice for me.&amp;&rdquo;  Then Yudhishthira
said, &mdash; &ldquo;What manner of game is this, where one man throws
and another lays the stakes?&amp;&rdquo;  Nevertheless he accepted the
challenge, and he and Sakuni began to play.
</p>
<p>`At this point in the narrative it may be desirable to pause, and
endeavour to obtain a picture of the scene.  The so-called pavilion was
probably a temporary booth constructed of bamboos and interlaced with
basket-work; and very likely it was

<pb n="33"/>
decorated with flowers and leaves after the Hindoo fashion, and hung
with fruits, such as cocoa-nuts, mangoes, plantains, and maize.  The
Chieftains present seem to have sat upon the ground, and watched the
game.  The stakes may have been pieces of gold or silver, or cattle, or
lands; although, according to the legendary account which follows, they
included articles of a far more extravagant and imaginative character.
With these passing remarks, the tradition of the memorable game may be
resumed as follows: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`So Yudhishthira and Sakuni sat down to play, and whatever
Yudhishthira laid as stakes, Duryodhana laid something of equal value;
but Yudhishthira lost every game.  He first lost a very beautiful pearl;
next a thousand bags, each containing a thousand pieces of gold; next a
piece of gold so pure that it was as soft as wax; next a chariot set with
jewels and hung all round with golden bells; next a thousand war
elephants with golden howdahs set with diamonds; next a lakh of slaves
all dressed in good garments; next a lakh of beautiful slave girls,
adorned from head to foot with golden ornaments; next all the remainder
of his goods; next all his cattle; and

<pb n="34"/>
then the whole of his Raj, excepting only the lands which had been
granted to the Brahmans.[17]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="17"><p>[17]`A lakh is a hundred thousand, and a crore
is a hundred lakhs, or ten millions.  The Hindoo term might therefore
have been converted into English numerals, only that it does not seem
certain that the bards meant precisely a hundred thousand slaves, but
only a very large number.  The exceptional clause in favour of the
Brahmans is very significant.  When the little settlement at Indra-prastha
had been swelled by the imagination of the later bards into an extensive
Raj, the thought may have entered the minds of the Brahmanical com-pilers that in losing the Raj, the Brahmans might have lost those free
lands, known as inams or jagheers, which are frequently granted by
pious Rajas for the subsistence of Brahmans.  Hence the insertion of the
clause.'</p></note>

<p>`Now when Yudhishthira had lost his Raj, the Chieftains present in
the pavilion were of opinion that he should cease to play, but he would
not listen to their words, but persisted in the game.  And he staked all
the jewels belonging to his brothers, and he lost them; and he staked his
two younger brothers, one after the other, and he lost them; and he then
staked Arjuna, and Bhima, and finally himself; and he lost every game.
Then Sakuni said to him: &mdash; &ldquo;You have done a bad act,
Yudhishthira, in gaming away yourself and becoming a slave.  But now,
stake your wife, Draupadi, and if you win the game you will again be
free.&amp;&rdquo;  And Yudhishthira answered and said: &mdash; &ldquo;I will

<pb n="35"/>
stake Draupadi!&amp;&rdquo;  And all assembled were greatly troubled and
thought evil of Yudhishthira; and his uncle Vidura put his hand to his
head and fainted away, whilst Bhishma and Drona turned deadly pale,
and many of the company were very sorrowful; but Duryodhana and his
brother Duhsasana, and some others of the Kauravas, were glad in their
hearts, and plainly manifested their joy.  Then Sakuni threw the dice,
and won Draupadi for Duryodhana.
</p>
<p>`Then all in that assembly were in great consternation, and the
Chieftains gazed upon one another without speaking a word.  And
Duryodhana said to his uncle Vidura: &mdash; &ldquo;Go now and bring
Draupadi hither, and bid her sweep the rooms.&amp;&rdquo;  But Vidura
cried out against him with a loud voice, and said: &mdash; &ldquo;What
wickedness is this?  Will you order a woman who is of noble birth, and
the wife of your own kinsman, to become a household slave?  How can
you vex your brethren thus?  But Draupadi has not become your slave;
for Yudhishthira lost himself before he staked his wife, and having first
become a slave, he could no longer have power to stake
Draupadi.&amp;&rdquo;  Vidura then turned to the assembly and said: &mdash;
&ldquo;Take no heed to the words of

<pb n="36"/>
Duryodhana, for he has lost his senses this day.&amp;&rdquo;  Duryodhana
then said: &mdash; &ldquo;A curse be upon this Vidura, who will do nothing
that I desire him.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`After this Duryodhana called one of his servants, and desired him
to go to the lodgings of the Pandavas, and bring Draupadi into the
pavilion.  And the man departed out, and went to the lodgings of the
Pandavas, and entered the presence of Draupadi, and said to her: &mdash;
&ldquo;Raja Yudhishthira has played you away, and you have become
the slave of Raja Duryodhana:  So come now and do your duty like his
other slave girls.&amp;&rdquo;  And Draupadi was astonished at these words,
and exceedingly wroth, and she replied: &mdash; &ldquo;Whose slave was I
that I could be gambled away?  And who is such a senseless fool as to
gamble away his own wife?&amp;&rdquo;  The servant said: &mdash; &ldquo;Raja
Yudhishthira has lost himself, and his four brothers, and you also, to
Raja Duryodhana, and you cannot make any objection:  Arise, therefore,
and go to the house of the Raja!&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`Then Draupadi cried out: &mdash; &ldquo;Go you now and inquire
whether Raja Yudhishthira lost me first or himself first; for if he played
away himself first, he could not stake me.&amp;&rdquo;  So the man returned
to

<pb n="37"/>
the assembly, and put the question to Yudhishthira; but Yudhishthira
hung down his head with shame, and answered not a word.
</p>
<p>`Then Duryodhana was filled with wrath, and he cried out to his
servant: &mdash; &ldquo;What waste of words is this?  Go you and bring
Draupadi hither, that if she has aught to say, she may say it in the
presence of us all.&amp;&rdquo;  And the man essayed to go, but he beheld
the wrathful countenance of Bhima and he was sore afraid, and he
refused to go, and remained where he was.  Then Duryodhana sent his
brother Duhsasana; and Duhsasana went his way to the lodgings of
Draupadi and said: &mdash; &ldquo;Raja Yudhishthira has lost you in play to
Raja Duryodhana, and he has sent for you:  So arise now, and wait upon
him according to his commands; and if you have anything to say, you
can say it in the presence of the assembly.&amp;&rdquo;  Draupadi replied: &mdash;
&ldquo;The death of the Kauravas is not far distant, since they can do
such deeds as these.&amp;&rdquo;  And she rose up in great trepidation and
set out, but when she came near to the palace of the Maharaja, she
turned aside from the pavilion where the Chieftains were assembled, and
ran away with all speed towards the apartments of the women.  And
Duhsasana hast

<pb n="38"/>
ened after her, and seized her by her hair, which was very dark and
long, and dragged her by main force into the pavilion before all the
Chieftains.
</p>
<p>`And she cried out: &mdash; &ldquo;Take your hands from of
me!&amp;&rdquo;  But Duhsasana heeded not her words, and said: &mdash;
&ldquo;You are now a slave girl, and slave girls cannot complain of
being touched by the hands of men.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`When the Chieftains thus beheld Draupadi, they hung down their
heads from shame; and Draupadi called upon the elders amongst them,
such as Bhishma and Drona, to acquaint her whether or no Raja
Yudhishthira had gamed away himself before he had staked her; but they
likewise held down their heads and answered not a word.
</p>
<p>`Then she cast her eye upon the Pandavas, and her glance was like
the stabbing of a thousand daggers, but they moved not hand or foot to
help her; for when Bhima would have stepped forward to deliver her
from the hands of Duhsasana, Yudhishthira commanded him to forbear,
and both he and the younger Pandavas were obliged to obey the
command of their elder brother.
</p>
<p>`And when Duhsasana saw that Draupadi looked

<pb n="39"/>
towards the Pandavas, he took her by the hand, and drew her another
way, saying: &mdash; &ldquo;Why, O slave, are you turning your eyes about
you?&amp;&rdquo;  And when Karna and Sakuni heard Duhsasana calling her
a slave, they cried out: &mdash; &ldquo;Well said! well said!&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`Then Draupadi wept very bitterly, and appealed to all the
assembly, saying: &mdash; &ldquo;All of you have wives and children of your
own, and will you permit me to be treated thus?  I ask you one question,
and I pray you to answer it.'  Duhsasana then broke in and spoke foul
language to her, and used her rudely, so that her veil came off in his
hands.  And Bhima could restrain his wrath no longer, and spoke
vehemently to Yudhishthira; and Arjuna reproved him for his anger
against hiss elder brother, but Bhima answered: &mdash; &ldquo;I will thrust
my hands into the fire before these wretches shall treat my wife in this
manner before my eyes.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`Then Duryodhana said to Draupadi: &mdash; &ldquo;Come now, I pray
you, and sit upon my thigh!&amp;&rdquo;  And Bhima gnashed his teeth, and
cried out with a loud voice: &mdash; &ldquo;Hear my vow this day!  If for
this deed I do not break the thigh of Duryodhana, and drink the blood of
Duhsasana, I am not the son of Kunti!&amp;&rdquo;


<pb n="40"/>

</p>
<p>`Meanwhile the Chieftain Vidura had left the assembly, and told
the blind Maharaja Dhritarashtra all that had taken place that day; and
the Maharaja ordered his servants to lead him into the pavilion where all
the Chieftains were gathered together.  And all present were silent when
they saw the Maharaja, and the Maharaja said to Draupadi: &mdash; &ldquo;O
daughter, my sons have done evil to you this day:  But go now, you and
your husbands, to your own Raj, and remember not what has occurred,
and let the memory of this day be blotted out for ever.&amp;&rdquo;  So the
Pandavas made haste with their wife Draupadi, and departed out of the
city of Hastinapur.
</p>
<p>`Then Duryodhana was exceedingly wroth, and he said to his
father, &ldquo;O Maharaja, is it not a saying that when your enemy
hath fallen down, he should be annihilated without a war?  And now that
we had thrown the Pandavas to the earth, and had taken possession of all
their wealth, you have restored them all their strength, and permitted
them to depart with anger in their hearts; and now they will prepare to
make war that they may revenge themselves upon us for all that has been
done, and they will return within a short while and slay us

<pb n="41"/>
all:  Give us leave then, I pray you, to play another game with these
Pandavas, and let the side which loses go into exile for twelve years; for
thus and thus only can a war be prevented between ourselves and the
Pandavas.&amp;&rdquo;  And the Maharaja granted the request of his son, and
messengers were sent to bring back the brethren; and the Pandavas
obeyed the commands of their uncle, and returned to his presence; and it
was agreed upon that Yudhishthira should play one game more with
Sakuni, and that if Yudhishthira won the Kauravas were to go into exile,
and that if Sakuni won, the Pandavas were to go into exile; and the exile
was to be for twelve years, and one year more; and during that thirteenth
year those who were in exile were to dwell in any city they pleased, but
to keep themselves so concealed that the others should never discover
them; and if the others did discover them before the thirteenth year was
over, then those who were in exile were to continue so for another
thirteen years.  So they sat down again to play, and Sakuni had a set of
cheating dice as before, and with them he won the game.
</p>
<p>`When Duhsasana saw that Sakuni had won the

<pb n="42"/>
game, he danced about for joy; and he cried out: &mdash; &ldquo;Now is
established the Raj of Duryodhana.&amp;&rdquo;  But Bhima said, &ldquo;Be
not elated with joy, but remember my words:  The day will come when I
will drink your blood, or I am not the son of Kunti.&amp;&rdquo;  And the
Pandavas, seeing that they had lost, threw off their garments and put on
deer-skins, and prepared to depart into the forest with their wife and
mother, and their priest Dhaumya; but Vidura said to Yudhishthira: &mdash;
&ldquo;Your mother is old and unfitted to travel, so leave her under my
care;&amp;&rdquo; and the Pandavas did so.  And the brethren went out from
the assembly hanging down their heads with shame, and covering their
faces with their garments; but Bhima threw out his long arms and looked
at the Kauravas furiously, and Draupadi spread her long black hair over
her face and wept bitterly.  And Draupadi vowed a vow, saying: &mdash;
</p>
<p>` &ldquo;My hair shall remain dishevelled from this day, until
Bhima shall have slain Duhsasana and drank his blood; and then he shall
tie up my hair again whilst his hands are dripping with the blood of
Duhsasana.&amp;&rdquo; '
</p>
<p>Such was the great gambling match at Hastinapur in the heroic age
of India.  It appears

<pb n="43"/>
there can be little doubt of the truth of the incident, although the
verisimilitude would have been more complete without the perpetual
winning of the cheat Sakuni &mdash; which would be calculated to arouse the
suspicion of Yudhishthira, and which could scarcely be indulged in by a
professional cheat, mindful of the suspicion it would excite.
</p>
<p>Throughout the narrative, however, there is a truthfulness to
human nature, and a truthfulness to that particular phase of human nature
which is pre-eminently manifested by a high-minded race in its primitive
stage of civilization.
</p>
<p>To our modern minds the main interest of the story begins from
the moment that Draupadi was lost; but it must be remembered that
among that ancient people, where women were chiefly prized on sensual
grounds, such stakes were evidently recognized.
</p>
<p>The conduct of Draupadi herself on the occasion shows that she
was by no means unfamiliar with the idea: she protested &mdash; not on the
ground of sentiment or matrimonial obligation &mdash; but solely on what may
be called a technical point of law, namely, `Had Yudhishthira become a
slave before he staked his wife upon the last game?'  For, of

<pb n="44"/>
course, having ceased to be a freeman, he had no right to stake her
liberty.
</p>
<p>The concluding scene of the drama forms an impressive figure in
the mind of the Hindoo.  The terrible figure of Draupadi, as she
dishevels her long black hair, is the very impersonation of revenge; and
a Hindoo audience never fails to shudder at her fearful vow &mdash; that the
straggling tresses shall never again be tied up until the day when Bhima
shall have fulfilled his vow, and shall then bind them up whilst his
fingers are still dripping with the blood of Duhsasana.
</p>
<p>The avenging battle subsequently ensued.  Bhima struck down
Duhsasana with a terrible blow of his mace, saying, &mdash; `This day I fulfil
my vow against the man who insulted Draupadi!'  Then setting his foot
on the breast of Duhsasana, he drew his sword, and cut off the head of
his enemy; and holding his two hands to catch the blood, he drank it off,
crying out, `Ho! ho!  Never did I taste anything in this world so sweet as
this blood.'
</p>
<p>This staking of wives by gamblers is a curious subject.  The
practice may be said to have been universal, having furnished cases
among civilized as well as barbarous nations.  Of course the Negroes

<pb n="45"/>
of Africa stake their wives and children; according to Schouten, a
Chinese staked his wife and childen {sic}, and lost them; Paschasius
Justus states that a Venetian staked his wife; and not a hundred years ago
certain debauchees at Paris played at dice for the possession of a
celebrated courtesan.  But this is an old thing.  Hegesilochus, and other
rulers of Rhodes, were accustomed to play at dice for the honour of the
most distinguished ladies of that island &mdash; the agreement being that the
party who lost had to bring to the arms of the winner the lady designated
by lot to that indignity.[18]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="18"><p>[18] Athen. lib.  XI. cap. xii.</p></note>
<p>There are traditions of such stakes having been laid and lost by
husbands in <hi rend="italic">England;</hi> and a remarkable case of the kind will
be found related in Ainsworth's `Old Saint Paul's,' as having occurred
during the Plague of London, in the year 1665.  There can be little doubt
that it is founded on fact; and the conduct of the English wife, curiously
enough, bears a striking resemblance to that of Draupadi in the Indian
narrative.
</p>
<p>A Captain Disbrowe of the king's body-guard lost a large sum of
money to a notorious debauchee, a gambler and bully, named Sir Paul
Parravicin.

<pb n="46"/>
The latter had made an offensive allusion to the wife of Captain
Disbrowe, after winning his money; and then, picking up the dice-box,
and spreading a large heap of gold on the table, he said to the officer
who anxiously watched his movements: &mdash; `I mentioned your wife,
Captain Disbrowe, not with any intention of giving you offence, but to
show you that, although you have lost your money, you have still a
valuable stake left.'
</p>
<p>`I do not understand you, Sir Paul,' returned Disbrowe, with a
look of indignant surprise.
</p>
<p>`To be plain, then,' replied Parravicin, `I have won from you two
hundred pounds &mdash; all you possess.  You are a ruined man, and as such,
will run any hazard to retrieve your losses.  I give you a last chance.  I
will stake all my winnings &mdash; nay, double the amount &mdash; against your
wife.  You have a key of the house you inhabit, by which you admit
yourself at all hours; so at least I am informed.  If I win, that key shall
be mine.  I will take my chance of the rest.  Do you understand me
now?'
</p>
<p>`I do,' replied the young man, with concentrated fury.  `I
understand that you are a villain.  You have robbed me of my money,
and would rob me of my honour.'


<pb n="47"/>

</p>
<p>`These are harsh words, sir,' replied the knight calmly; `but let
them pass.  We will play first, and fight afterwards.  But you refuse my
challenge?'
</p>
<p>`It is false!' replied Disbrowe, fiercely, `I accept it.' And
producing a key, he threw it on the table.  `My life is, in truth, set on
the die,' he added, with a desperate look; `for if I lose, I will not survive
my shame.'
</p>
<p>`You will not forget our terms,' observed Parravicin.  `I am to be
your representative to-night.  You can return home to-morrow.'
</p>
<p>`Throw, sir, &mdash; throw,' cried the young man, fiercely.
</p>
<p>`Pardon me,' replied the knight; `the first cast is with you.  A
single main decides it.'
</p>
<p>`Be it so,' returned Disbrowe, seizing the bow.  And as he shook
the dice with a frenzied air, the bystanders drew near the table to watch
the result.
</p>
<p>`Twelve!' cried Disbrowe, as he removed the box.  `My honour is
saved!  My fortune retrieved &mdash; Huzza!'
</p>
<p>`Not so fast,' returned Parravicin, shaking the box in his turn.
`You were a little hasty,' he

<pb n="48"/>
added, uncovering the dice.  `I am twelve too.  We must throw again.'
</p>
<p>`This is to decide,' cried the young officer, rattling the dice, &mdash;
`Six!'
</p>
<p>Parravicin smiled, took the box, and threw <hi rend="italic">*ten</hi>.
</p>
<p>`Perdition!' ejaculated Disbrowe, striking his brow with his
clenched hand.  `What devil tempted me to my undoing? . . .  My wife
trusted to this profligate! . . .  Horror!  It must not be!'
</p>
<p>`It is too late to retract,' replied Parravicin, taking up the key, and
turning with a triumphant look to his friends.
</p>
<p>Disbrowe noticed the smile, and, stung beyond endurance, drew
his sword, and called to the knight to defend himself.  In an instant
passes were exchanged.  But the conflict was brief.  Fortune, as before,
declared herself in favour of Parravicin.  He disarmed his assailant, who
rushed out of the room, uttering the wildest ejaculations of rage and
despair.

 </p>

<p>*</p>

</p>
<p>The winner of the key proceeded at once to use.  He gained
admittance to the captain's house, and found his way to the chamber of
his wife, who was then in bed.  At first mistaken for her husband

<pb n="49"/>
Parravicin heard words of tender reproach for his lateness; and then,
declaring himself, he belied her husband, stating that he was false to her,
and had surrendered her to him.  At this announcement Mrs Disbrowe
uttered a loud scream, and fell back in the bed.  Parravicin waited for a
moment; but not hearing her move, brought the lamp to see what was
the matter.  She had fainted, and was lying across the pillow, with her
night-dress partly open, so as to expose her neck and shoulders.  The
knight was at first ravished with her beauty; but his countenance
suddenly fell, and an expression of horror and alarm took possession of
it.  He appeared rooted to the spot, and instead of attempting to render
her any assistance, remained with his gaze fixed upon her neck.
Rousing himself at length, he rushed out of the room, hurried down-stairs, and without pausing for a moment, threw open the street door.
As he issued from it his throat was forcibly griped, and the point of a
sword was placed at his breast.
</p>
<p>It was the desperate husband, who was waiting to avenge his
wife's honour.
</p>
<p>`You are in my power, villain,' cried Disbrowe, `and shall not
escape my vengeance.'


<pb n="50"/>

</p>
<p>`You are already avenged,' replied Parravicin, shaking off his
assailant &mdash; `<hi rend="italic">*Your wife has the plague</hi>.'
</p>
<p>The profligate had been scared away by the sight of the `plague
spot' on the neck of the unfortunate lady.
</p>
<p>The husband entered and found his way to his wife's chamber.
Instantaneous explanations ensued.  `He told me you were false &mdash; that
you loved another &mdash; and had abandoned me,' exclaimed the frantic wife.
</p>
<p>`He lied!' shouted Disbrowe, in a voice of uncontrollable fury.  `It
is true that, in a moment of frenzy, I was tempted to set you &mdash; yes,
<hi rend="italic">*you</hi>, Margaret &mdash; against all I had lost at play, and was
compelled to yield up the key of my house to the winner.  But I have
never been faithless to you &mdash; never.'
</p>
<p>`Faithless or not,' replied his wife bitterly, `it is plain you value
me less than play, or you would not have acted thus.'
</p>
<p>`Reproach me not, Margaret,' replied Disbrowe.  `I would give
worlds to undo what I have done.'
</p>
<p>`Who shall guard me against the recurrence of such conduct?' said
Mrs Disbrowe, coldly.  `But you have not yet informed me how I was
saved!'


<pb n="51"/>

</p>
<p>Disbrowe averted his head.
</p>
<p>`What mean you?' she cried, seizing his arm.  `What has
happened?  Do not keep me in suspense?  Were you my preserver?'
</p>
<p>`Your preserver was the plague,' rejoined Disbrowe, mournfully.
</p>
<p>The unfortunate lady then, for the first time, perceived that she
was attacked by the pestilence, and a long and dreadful pause ensued,
broken only by exclamations of anguish from both.
</p>
<p>`Disbrowe!' cried Margaret at length, raising herself in bed, `you
have deeply, irrecoverably injured me.  But promise me one thing.'
</p>
<p>`I swear to do whatever you may desire,' he replied.
</p>
<p>`I know not, after what I have heard, whether you have courage
for the deed,' she continued.  `But I would have you kill this man.'
</p>
<p>`I will do it,' replied Disbrowe.
</p>
<p>`Nothing but his blood can wipe out the wrong he has done me,'
she rejoined.  `Challenge him to a duel &mdash; a mortal duel.  If he survives,
by my soul, I will give myself to him.'
</p>
<p>`Margaret!' exclaimed Disbrowe.
</p>
<p>`I swear it,' she rejoined,' and you know my

<pb n="52"/>
passionate nature too well to doubt I will keep my word.'
</p>
<p>`But you have the plague!'
</p>
<p>`What does that matter?  I may recover.'
</p>
<p>`Not so,' muttered Disbrowe.  `If I fall, I will take care you do not
recover. . . .  I will fight him to-morrow,' he added aloud.
</p>
<p>About noon on the following day Disbrowe proceeded to the
Smyrna Coffee-house, where, as he expected, he found Parravicin and
his companions.  The knight instantly advanced towards him, and laying
aside for the moment his reckless air, inquired, with a look of
commiseration, after his wife.
</p>
<p>`She is better,' replied Disbrowe, fiercely.  `I am come to settle
accounts with you.'
</p>
<p>`I thought they were settled long ago,' returned Parravicin,
instantly resuming his wonted manner.  `But I am glad to find you
consider the debt unpaid.'
</p>
<p>Disbrowe lifted the cane he held in his hand, and struck the knight
with it forcibly on the shoulder.  `Be that my answer,' he said.
</p>
<p>`I will have your life first, and your wife afterwards,' replied
Parravicin fiercely.
</p>
<p>`You shall have her if you slay me, but not

<pb n="53"/>
otherwise,' retorted Disbrowe.  `It must be a mortal duel.'
</p>
<p>`It must,' replied Parravicin.  `I will not spare you this time.  I
shall instantly proceed to the west side of Hyde Park, beneath the trees.
I shall expect you there.  On my return I shall call on your wife.'
</p>
<p>`I pray you do so, sir,' replied Disbrowe, disdainfully.
</p>
<p>Both then quitted the Coffee-house, Parravicin attended by his
companions, and Disbrowe accompanied by a military friend, whom he
accidentally encountered.  Each party taking a coach, they soon reached
the ground, a retired spot completely screened from observation by trees.
The preliminaries were soon arranged, for neither would admit of delay.
The conflict then commenced with great fury on both sides; but
Parravicin, in spite of his passion, observed far more caution than his
antagonist; and taking advantage of an unguarded movement, occasioned
by the other's impetuosity, passed his sword through his body.
Disbrowe fell.
</p>
<p>`You are again successful,' he groaned, `but save my wife &mdash; save
her!'


<pb n="54"/>

</p>
<p>`What mean you?' cried Parravicin, leaning over him, as he wiped
his sword.
</p>
<p>But Disbrowe could make no answer.  His utterance was choked
by a sudden effusion of blood on the lungs, and he instantly expired.
</p>
<p>Leaving the body in care of the second, Parravicin and his friends
returned to the coach, his friends congratulating him on the issue of the
conflict; but the knight looked grave, and pondered upon the words of
the dying man.  After a time, however, he recovered his spirits, and
dined with his friends at the Smyrna; but they observed that he drank
more deeply than usual.  His excesses did not, however, prevent him
from playing with his usual skill, and he won a large sum from one of
his companions at Hazard.
</p>
<p>Flushed with success, and heated with wine, he walked up to
Disbrowe's residence about an hour after midnight.  As he approached
the house, he observed a strangely-shaped cart at the door, and, halting
for a moment, saw a body, wrapped in a shroud, brought out.  Could it
be Mrs Disbrowe?  Rushing forward to one of the assistants in black
cloaks, he asked whom he was about to inter.
</p>
<p>`It is a Mrs Disbrowe,' replied the coffinmaker.

<pb n="55"/>
`She died of grief, because her husband was killed this morning in a
duel; but as she had the plague, it must be put down to that.  We are not
particular in such matters, and shall bury her and her husband together;
and as there is no money left to pay for coffins, they must go to the
grave without them.'
</p>
<p>And as the body of his victim also was brought forth, Parravicin
fell against the wall in a state of stupefaction.  At this moment, Solomon
Eagle, the weird plague-prophet, with his burning brazier on his head,
suddenly turned the corner of the street, and, stationing himself before
the dead-cart, cried in a voice of thunder &mdash; `Woe to the libertine!  Woe
to the homicide! for he shall perish in everlasting fire!  Woe! woe!'
</p>
<p>Such is this English legend, as related by Ainsworth, but which I
have condensed into its main elements.  I think it bids fair to equal in
interest that of the Hindoo epic; and if it be not true in every particular,
so much the better for the sake of human nature.</p>

GAMBLING AMONG THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS, PERSIANS,
AND GREEKS.</head>


<p>CONCERNING the ancient Egyptians we have no particular facts
to detail in the matter of gambling; but it is sufficient to determine the
existence of any special vice in a nation to find that there are severe laws
prohibiting and punishing its practice.  Now, this testimony not only
exists, but the penalty is of the utmost severity, from which may be
inferred both the horror conceived of the practice by the rulers of the
Egyptians, and the strong propensity which required that severity to
suppress or hold it in check.  In Egypt, `every man was easily admitted
to the accusation of a gamester or dice-player; and if the person was
convicted, he was sent to work in the quarries.'[19]  Gambling was,

<pb n="57"/>
 therefore, prevalent in Egypt in the earliest times.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="19"><p>[19] Taylor, <hi rend="italic">Ductor Dubitantium</hi>,
B. iv. c. 1.</p></note>
<p>That gaming with dice was a usual and fashionable species of
diversion at the Persian court in the times of the younger Cyrus (about
400 years before the Christian era), to go no higher, is evident from the
anecdote related by some historians of those days concerning Queen
Parysatis, the mother of Cyrus, who used all her art and skill in
gambling to satiate her revenge, and to accomplish her bloodthirsty
projects against the murderers of her favourite son.  She played for the
life or death of an unfortunate slave, who had only executed the com-mands of his master.  The anecdote is as follows, as related by Plutarch,
in the Life of Artaxerxes.
</p>
<p>`There only remained for the final execution of Queen Parysatis's
projects, and fully to satiate her vengeance, the punishment of the king's
slave Mesabetes, who by his master's order had cut off the head and
hand of the young Cyrus, who was beloved by Parysatis (their common
mother) above Artaxerxes, his elder brother and the reigning monarch.
But as there was nothing to take hold of in his conduct, the queen laid
this snare for him.  She was a woman of good address, had abundance of
wit, and <hi rend="italic">*excelled at playing a certain game with dice</hi>.

<pb n="58"/>
She had been apparently reconciled to the king after the death of Cyrus,
and was present at all his parties of pleasure and gambling.  One day,
seeing the king totally unemployed, she proposed playing with him for a
thousand <hi rend="italic">darics</hi> (about &pound;500), to which he readily
consented.  She suffered him to win, and paid down the money.  But,
affecting regret and vexation, she pressed him to begin again, and to
play with her &mdash; <hi rend="italic">*for a slave</hi>.  The king, who suspected
nothing, complied, and the stipulation was that the winner was to choose
the slave.
</p>
<p>`The queen was now all attention to the game, and made use of her
utmost skill and address, which as easily procured her victory, as her
studied neglect before had caused her defeat.  She won &mdash; and chose
Mesabetes &mdash; the slayer of her son &mdash; who, being delivered into her
hands, was put to the most cruel tortures and to death by her command.
</p>
<p>`When the king would have interfered, she only replied with a
smile of contempt &mdash; &ldquo;Surely you must be a great loser, to be so
much out of temper for giving up a decrepit old slave, when I, who lost
a thousand good <hi rend="italic">darics</hi>, and paid them down on the spot, do
not say a word, and am satisfied.&amp;&rdquo; '
</p>
<p>Thus early were dice made subservient to the

<pb n="59"/>
purposes of cruelty and murder.  The modern Persians, being
Mohammedans, are restrained from the open practice of gambling.  Yet
evasions are contrived in favour of games in the tables, which, as they
are only liable to chance on the `throw of the dice,' but totally dependent
on the `skill' in `the management of the game,' cannot (they argue) be
meant to be prohibited by their prophet any more than chess, which is
universally allowed to his followers; and, moreover, to evade the
difficulty of being forbidden to play for money, they make an alms of
their winnings, distributing them to the poor.  This may be done by the
more scrupulous; but no doubt there are numbers whose consciences do
not prevent the disposal of their gambling profits nearer home.  All
excess of gaming, however, is absolutely prohibited in Persia; and any
place wherein it is much exercised is called `a habitation of corrupted
carcases or carrion house.'[20]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="20"><p>[20] Hyde, <hi rend="italic">De Ludis

<p>In ancient Greece gambling prevailed to a vast extent.  Of this
there can be no doubt whatever; and it is equally certain that it had an
influence, together with other modes of dissipation and corrup

<pb n="60"/>
tion, towards subjugating its civil liberties to the power of Macedon.
</p>
<p>So shamelessly were the Athenians addicted to this vice, that they
forgot all public spirit in their continued habits of gaming, and entered
into convivial associations, or formed `clubs,' for the purposes of dicing,
at the very time when Philip of Macedon was making one grand `throw'
for their liberties at the Battle of Ch&aelig;ronea.
</p>
<p>This politic monarch well knew the power of depravity in
enervating and enslaving the human mind; he therefore encouraged
profusion, dissipation, and gambling, as being sure of meeting with little
opposition from those who possessed such characters, in his projects of
ambition &mdash; as Demosthenes declared in one of his orations.[21]  Indeed,
gambling had arrived at such a height in Greece, that Aristotle scruples
not to rank gamblers `with thieves and plunderers, who for the sake of
gain do not scruple to despoil their best friends;'[22] and his pupil
Alexander set a fine upon some of his courtiers because he did not
perceive they made a

<pb n="61"/>
sport or pastime of dice, but seemed to be employed as in a most serious
business.[23]

<p>The Greeks gambled not only with dice, and at their equivalent for
<hi rend="italic">Cross and Pile</hi>, but also at cock-fighting, as will appear in
the sequel.
</p>
<p>From a remark made by the Athenian orator Callistratus, it is
evident that desperate gambling was in vogue; he says that the games in
which the losers go on doubling their stakes resemble ever-recurring
wars, which terminate only with the extinction of the combatants.[24]

GAMING AMONG THE ANCIENT ROMAN EMPERORS.</head>


<p>IN spite of the laws enacted against gaming, the court of the
Emperor Augustus was greatly addicted to that vice, and gave it
additional stimulus among the nation.  Although, however, he was
passionately fond of gambling, and made light of the imputation on his
character,[25] it appears that in frequenting the gambling table he had
other motives besides mere cupidity.  Writing to his daughter he said, `I
send you a sum with which I should have gratified my companions, if
they had wished to play at dice or <hi rend="italic">odds and evens</hi>.'  On
another occasion he wrote to Tiberius: &mdash; `If I had exacted my winnings
during the festival of Minerva; if I had not lavished my money on all
sides; instead

<pb n="63"/>
of losing twenty thousand sestercii [about &pound;1000], I should have
gained one hundred and fifty thousand [&pound;7500].  I prefer it thus,
however; for my bounty should win me immense glory.'[26]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="25"><p>[25] Ale&aelig; rumorem nullo modo expavit.

<note place="foot" n="26"><p>[26] Sed hoc malo: benignitas enim mea me ad
c&oelig;lestem gloriam efferet.  <hi rend="italic">Ubi supr&agrave;</hi>.</p></note>
<p>This gambling propensity subjected Augustus to the lash of popular
epigrams; among the rest, the following:
 </p>
<lg type="poem"><l>Postquam bis classe victus naves perdidit,
 </l>
<l>Aliquando ut vincat, ludit assidud aleam.
 </l></lg>
<lg type="poem">
<l>`He lost at sea; was beaten twice,
 </l>
<l> And tries to win at least with dice.'
</l></lg>
<p>But although a satirist by profession, the sleek courtier Horace
spared the emperor's vice, contenting himself with only declaring that
play was forbidden.[27]  The two following verses of his, usually applied
to the effects of gaming, really refer only to <hi rend="italic">*raillery.</hi>
</p>
<note place="foot" n="27"><p>[27] Carm. lib. III. Od. xxiv.</p></note>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Ludus enim genuit trepidum certamen et iram;
 </l>
<l>Ira truces inimicitias et funebre bellum.[28]
</l></lg>
<note place="foot" n="28"><p>[28] Epist. lib. I. xix.</p></note>
<p>He, however, has recorded the curious fact of an old Roman
gambler, who was always attended

<pb n="64"/>
by a slave, to pick up his dice for him and put them in the box.[29]
Doubtless, Horace would have lashed the vice of gambling had it not
been the `habitual sin' of his courtly patrons.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="29"><p>[29] Lib. II. Sat. vii. v. 15.</p></note>
<p>It seems that Augustus not only gambled to excess, but that he
gloried in the character of a gamester.  Of himself he says, `Between
meals we played like old crones both yesterday and today.'[30]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="30"><p>[30] Inter c&oelig;enam lusimus
<foreign lang="grk">ger&oacute;ntikws </foreign> et heri et
hodi&eacute;.</p></note>
<p>When he had no regular players near him, he would play with
children at dice, at nuts, or bones.  It has been suggested that this
emperor gave in to the indulgence of gambling in order to stifle his
remorse.  If his object in encouraging this vice was to make people
forget his proscriptions and to create a diversion in his favour, the
artifice may be considered equal to any of the political ruses of this
astute ruler, whose false virtues were for a long time vaunted only
through ignorance, or in order to flatter his imitators.
</p>
<p>The passion of gambling was transmitted, with the empire, to the
family of the C&aelig;sars.  At the gaming table Caligula stooped even
to falsehood

<pb n="65"/>
and perjury.  It was whilst gambling that he conceived his most
diabolical projects; when the game was against him he would quit the
table abruptly, and then, monster as he was, satiated with rapine, would
roam about his palace venting his displeasure.
</p>
<p>One day, in such a humour, he caught a glimpse of two Roman
knights; he had them arrested and confiscated their property.  Then
returning to the gaming table, he exultingly exclaimed that he had never
made a better throw![31]  On another occasion, after having condemned
to death several Gauls of great opulence, he immediately went back to
his gambling companions and said: &mdash; `I pity you when I see you lose a
few sestertii, whilst, with a stroke of the pen, I have just won six
hundred millions.'[32]

<p>The Emperor Claudius played like an imbecile, and Nero like a
madman.  The former would send for the persons whom he had executed
the day before, to play with him; and the latter, lavishing the treasures
of the public exchequer, would stake four hundred thousand sestertii
(&pound;20,000) on a single throw of the dice.


<pb n="66"/>

</p>
<p>Claudius played at dice on his journeys, having the interior of his
carriage so arranged as to prevent the motion from interfering with the
game.
</p>
<p>From that period the title of courtier and gambler became
synonymous.  Gaming was the means of securing preferment; it was by
gambling that Vitellius opened to himself so grand a career; gaming
made him indispensable to Claudius.[33]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="33"><p>[33] Claudio per ale&aelig; studium familiaris.
Suet. <hi rend="italic">in Vit&acirc; Vitell</hi>.</p></note>
<p>Seneca, in his Play on the death of Claudius, represents him as in
the lower regions condemned to pick up dice for ever, putting them into
a box without a bottom![34]

<hi rend="italic">Lusus de Morte Claud.  C&aelig;sar</hi>.</p></note>

<p>Caligula was reproached for having played at dice on the day of
his sister's funeral; and Domitian was blamed for gaming from morning
to night, and without excepting the festivals of the Roman calendar; but
it seems ridiculous to note such improprieties in comparison with their
habitual and atrocious crimes.
</p>
<p>The terrible and inexorable satirist Juvenal was the contemporary
of Domitian and ten other

<pb n="67"/>
emperors; and the following is his description of the vice in the gaming
days of Rome:
</p>
<p>`When was the madness of games of chance more furious?  Now-a-days, not content with carrying his purse to the gaming table, the
gamester conveys his iron chest to the play-room.  It is there that, as
soon as the gaming instruments are distributed, you witness the most
terrible contests.  Is it not mere madness to lose one hundred thousand
sestertii and refuse a garment to a slave perishing with cold?'[35]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="35"><p>[35] Sat. I. 87.</p></note>
<p>It seems that the Romans played for ready money, and had not
invented that multitude of signs by the aid of which, without being
retarded by the weight of gold and silver, modern gamblers can ruin
themselves secretly and without display.
</p>
<p>The rage for gambling spread over the Roman provinces, and
among barbarous nations who had never been so much addicted to the
vice as after they had the misfortune to mingle with the Romans.
</p>
<p>The evil continued to increase, stimulated by imperial example.
The day on which Didius Julianus was proclaimed Emperor, he walked
over

<pb n="68"/>
the dead and bloody body of Pertinax, and began to play at dice in the
next room.[36]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="36"><p>[36] Dion Cass. <hi rend="italic">Hist. Rom</hi>. l.
lxxiii.</p></note>
<p>At the end of the fourth century, the following state of things at
Rome is described by Gibbon, quoting from Ammianus Marcellinus:
</p>
<p>`Another method of introduction into the houses and society of the
&ldquo;great,&amp;&rdquo; is derived from the profession of gaming; or, as
it is more politely styled, of play.  The confederates are united by a
strict and indissoluble bond of friendship, or rather of conspiracy; a
superior degree of skill in the &ldquo;tessarian&amp;&rdquo; art, is a sure
road to wealth and reputation.  A master of that sublime science who, in
a supper or assembly, is placed below a magistrate, displays in his
countenance the surprise and indignation which Cato might be supposed
to feel when he was refused the pr&aelig;torship by the votes of a
capricious people.'[37]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="37"><p>[37] Amm. Marcellin. lib. XIV. c.
vi.</p></note>
<p>Finally, at the epoch when Constantine abandoned Rome never to
return, every inhabitant of that city, down to the populace, was addicted
to gambling.</p>

CHAPTER V.
<lb/>
GAMBLING IN FRANCE IN ALL TIMES.</head>


<p>CHARLES VI. and CHARLES VII. &mdash; THE early French annals
record the deeds of haughty and idle lords, whose chief occupations were
tormenting their vassals, drinking, fighting, and gaming; for most of
them were desperate gamblers, setting at defiance all the laws enacted
against the practice, and outraging all the decencies of society.  The
brother of Saint Louis played at dice in spite of the repeated prohibitions
of that virtuous prince.  Even the great Duguesclin gamed away all his
property in prison.[38]  The Duc de Touraine, brother of Charles VI.,
`set to work eagerly to win the king's money,' says Froissart; and
transported with joy one day at having won five thousand
<note place="foot" n="38"><p>[38] Hist. de Duguesclin, par
Menard.</p></note>


<pb n="70"/>
livres, his first cry was &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Monseigneur, faites-moi payer</hi>,
`Please to pay, Sire.'</p>
<p>Gaming went on in the camp, and even in the presence of the
enemy.  Generals, after having ruined their own fortunes, compromised
the safety of the country.  Among the rest, Philibert de Chalon, Prince
d'Orange, who was in command at the siege of Florence, under the
Emperor Charles the Fifth, gambled away the money which had been
confided to him for the pay of the soldiers, and was compelled, after a
struggle of eleven months, to capitulate with those whom he might have
forced to surrender.[39]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="39"><p>[39] Paul. Jov.  <hi rend="italic">Hist</hi>. lib.
xxix.</p></note>
<p>In the reign of Charles VI. we read of an H&ocirc;tel de Nesle
which was famous for terrible gaming catastrophes.  More than one of
its frequenters lost their lives there, and some their honour, dearer than
life.  This h&ocirc;tel was not accessible to everybody, like more
modern gaming <hi rend="italic">salons</hi>, called <hi rend="italic">Gesvres</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">Soissons;</hi> its gate was open only to the nobility, or the most
opulent gentlemen of the day.
</p>
<p>There exists an old poem which describes the

<pb n="71"/>
doings at this celebrated H&ocirc;tel de Nesle.[40]  The author, after
describing the convulsions of the players and recording their
blasphemies, says: &mdash;
</p>
<note place="foot" n="40"><p>[40] The title of this curious old poem is as
follows: &mdash; `C'est le dit du Gieu des Dez fait par Eustace, et la
mani&egrave;re et contenance des Joueurs qui etoient &agrave;
N&eacute;ele, o&ugrave; etoient Messeigneurs de Berry, de Bourgogne,
et plusieurs autres.'</p></note>
<lg type="poem">

 </l>
<l>Y ont perdu armes et chevaux,
 </l>
<l>Argent, honour, et Seignourie,
 </l>
<l>Dont c'etoit horrible folie.
</l></lg>
<p>`How many very eminent gentlemen have there lost their arms and
horses, their money and lordship &mdash; a horrible folly.'
</p>
<p>In another part of the poem he says: &mdash;

 </p><lg type="poem">
<l>Li jeune enfant deviennent Rufien,
 </l>
<l>Joueurs de Dez, gourmands et plains d'yvresse,
 </l>
<l>Hautains de cuer, et ne leur chant en rien
 </l>
<l>D'onneur, &amp;c.
</l></lg>
<p>`There young men become ruffians, dice-players, gluttons, and
drunkards, haughty of heart, and bereft of honour.'
</p>
<p>Still it seems that gaming had not then confounded all conditions,
as at a later period.  It is evident, from the history and memoirs of the
times, that the people were more given to games of skill

<pb n="72"/>
and exercise than games of chance.  Before the introduction of the
arquebus and gunpowder, they applied themselves to the practice of
archery, and in all times they played at quoits, ninepins, bowls, and
other similar games of skill.[41]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="41"><p>[41] Sauval, <hi rend="italic">Antiquit&eacute;s de
Paris</hi>, ii.</p></note>
<p>The invention of cards brought about some change in the mode of
amusement.  The various games of this kind, however, cost more time
than money; but still the thing attracted the attention of the magistrates
and the clergy.  An Augustinian friar, in the reign of Charles VII.,
effected a wonderful reformation in the matter by his preaching.  At his
voice the people lit fires in several quarters of the city, and eagerly flung
into them their cards and billiard-balls.[42]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="42"><p>[42] Pasquier, <hi rend="italic">Recherche cles
Recherches</hi>.</p></note>
<p>With the exception of a few transient follies, nothing like a rage
for gambling can be detected at that period among the lower ranks and
the middle classes.  The vice, however, continued to prevail without
abatement in the palaces of kings and the mansions of the great.
</p>
<p>It is impossible not to remark, in the history of nations, that
delicacy and good faith decline in

<pb n="73"/>
proportion to the spread of gambling.  However select may be the
society of gamesters, it is seldom that it is exempt from all baseness.
We have seen a proof of the practice of cheating among the Hindoos.  It
existed also among the Romans, as proved by the `cogged' or loaded
dice dug up at Herculaneum.  The fact is that cheating is a natural, if not
a necessary, incident of gambling.  It may be inferred from a passage in
the old French poet before quoted, that cheats, during the reign of
Charles VI., were punished with `bonnetting,'[43] but no instance of the
kind is on record; on the contrary, it is certain that many of the French
kings patronized and applauded well-known cheats at the gaming table.

<p>LOUIS XI. &mdash; Brant&ocirc;me says that Louis XI., who seems not
to have had a special secretary, being one day desirous of getting
something written, perceived an ecclesiastic who had an inkstand hanging
at his side; and the latter having opened it at the king's request, a set of
dice fell out.  `What kind of <hi rend="italic">sugar-plums</hi> are these?' asked
his

<pb n="74"/>
Majesty.  `Sire,' replied the priest, `they are a remedy for the Plague.'
`Well said,' exclaimed the king, `you are a fine <hi rend="italic">Paillard</hi> (a
word he often used); `<hi rend="italic">*You are the man for me</hi>,' and took
him into his service; for this king was fond of bon-mots and sharp wits,
and did not even object to thieves, provided they were original and
provocative of humour, as the following very funny anecdote will show.
`A certain French baron who had lost everything at play, even to his
clothes, happening to be in the king's chamber, quietly laid hands on a
small clock, ornamented with massive gold, and concealed it in his
sleeve.  Very soon after, whilst he was among the troop of lords and
gentlemen, the clock began to strike the hour.  We can well imagine the
consternation of the baron at this contretemps.  Of course he blushed
red-hot, and tightened his arm to try and stifle the implacable sound of
detection manifest &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">flagrans delictum</hi> &mdash; still the clock
went on striking the long hour, so that at each stroke the bystanders
looked at each other from head to foot in utter bewilderment.
</p>
<p>`The king, who, as it chanced, had detected the theft, burst out
laughing, not only at the astonishment of the gentlemen present, who
were at a loss

<pb n="75"/>
to account for the sound, but also at the originality of the stunning event.
At length Monsieur le Baron, by his own blushes half-convicted of lar-ceny, fell on his knees before the king, humbly saying: &mdash; &ldquo;Sire,
the pricks of gaming are so powerful that they have driven me to commit
a dishonest action, for which I beg your mercy.&amp;&rdquo;  And as he was
going on in this strain, the king cut short his words, exclaiming: &mdash;
&ldquo;The <hi rend="italic">*pastime</hi> which you have contrived for us so far
surpasses the injury you have done me that the clock is yours:  I give it
you with all my heart.&amp;&rdquo; '[44]

<p>HENRY III. &mdash; In the latter part of the sixteenth century Paris was
inundated with brigands of every description.  A band of Italian
gamesters, having been informed by their correspondents that Henry III.
had established card-rooms and dice-rooms in the Louvre, got admission
at court, and won thirty thousand crowns from the king.[45]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="45"><p>[45] Journal de Henri III.</p></note>
<p>If all the kings of France had imitated the disinterestedness of
Henry III., the vice of gaming would not have made such progress as
became everywhere evident.


<pb n="76"/>

</p>
<p>Brant&ocirc;me gives a very high idea of this king's generosity,
whilst he lashes his contemporaries.  Henry III. played at tennis and was
very fond of the game &mdash; not, however, through cupidity or avarice, for
he distributed all his winnings among his companions.  When he lost he
paid the wager, nay, he even paid the losses of all engaged in the game.
The bets were not higher than two, three, or four hundred crowns &mdash;
never, as subsequently, four thousand, six thousand, or twelve
thousand &mdash; when, however, payment was not as readily made, but rather
frequently compounded for.[46]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="46"><p>[46] Henry III. was also passionately fond of
the childish toy <hi rend="italic">Bilboquet</hi>, or `Cup and Ball,' which he used
to play even whilst walking in the street.  Journal de Henri III., i.
</p></note>
<p>There was, indeed, at that time a French captain named La Roue,
who played high stakes, up to six thousand crowns, which was then
deemed exorbitant.  This intrepid gamester proposed a bet of twenty
thousand crowns against one of Andrew Doria's war-galleys.
</p>
<p>Doria took the bet, but he immediately declared it off, in
apprehension of the ridiculous position in which he would be placed if he
lost, saying, &mdash; `I don't wish that this young adventurer, who has

<pb n="77"/>
nothing worth naming to lose, should win my galley to go and triumph
in France over my fortune and my honour.'
</p>
<p>Soon, however, high stakes became in vogue, and to such an
extent that the natural son of the Duc de Bellegarde was enabled to pay,
out of his winnings, the large sum of fifty thousand crowns to get
himself legitimated.  Curiously enough, it is said that the greater part of
this sum had been won in England.[47]
</p>

<p>HENRY IV. &mdash; Henry IV. early evinced his passion for gaming.
When very young and stinted in fortune, he contrived the means of
satisfying this growing propensity.  When in want of money he used to
send a promissory note, written and signed by himself, to his friends,
requesting them to return the note or cash it &mdash; an expedient which could
not but succeed, as every man was only too glad to have the prince's
note of hand.[48]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="48"><p>[48] Mem. de Nevers. ii.</p></note>
<p>There can be no doubt that the example of Henry IV. was, in the
matter of gaming, as in other vices, most pernicious.  `Henry IV.,' says
P&eacute;r&eacute;fixe, `was not a skilful player, but greedy of

<pb n="78"/>
gain, timid in high stakes, and ill-tempered when he lost.'  He adds
rather naively, `This great king was not without spots any more than the
sun.'[49]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="49"><p>[49] Hist. de Henri le Grand.</p></note>
<p>Under him gambling became the rage.  Many distinguished
families were utterly ruined by it.  The Duc de Biron lost in a single
year more than five hundred thousand crowns (about &pound;250,000).
`My son Constant,' says D'Aubign&eacute;, `lost twenty times more
than he was worth; so that, finding himself without resources, he abjured
his religion.'
</p>
<p>It was at the court of Henry IV. that was invented the method of
speedy ruin by means of written vouchers for loss and gain &mdash; which
simplified the thing in all subsequent times.  It was then also that certain
Italian masters of the gaming art displayed their talents, their suppleness,
and dexterity.  One of them, named Pimentello, having, in the presence
of the Duc de Sully, appealed to the honour which he enjoyed in having
often played with Henry IV., the duke exclaimed, &mdash; `By heavens!  So
you are the Italian blood-sucker who is every day winning the king's
money!  You have fallen into the wrong box, for I neither like nor wish
to have anything to do with such fellows.'

<pb n="79"/>
Pimentello got warm.  `Go about your business,' said Sully, giving him
a shove; `your infernal gibberish will not alter my resolve.  Go!'[50]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="50"><p>[50] Mem. de Sully.</p></note>
<p>The French nation, for a long time agitated by civil war, settled
down at last in peace and abundance &mdash; the fruits of which prosperity are
often poisoned.  They were so by the gambling propensity of the people
at large, now first manifested.  The warrior, the lawyer, the artisan, in a
word, almost all professions and trades, were carried away by the fury
of gaming.  Magistrates sold for a price the permission to gamble &mdash; in
the face of the enacted laws against the practice.
</p>
<p>We can scarcely form an idea of the extent of the gaming at this
period.  Bassompi&egrave;rre declares, in his Memoirs, that he won
more than five hundred thousand livres (&pound;25,000) in the course of
a year.  `I won them,' he says, `although I was led away by a thousand
follies of youth; and my friend Pimentello won more than two hundred
thousand crowns (&pound;100,000).  Evidently this Pimentello might
well be called a <hi rend="italic">blood-sucker</hi> by Sully.[51]   He

<pb n="80"/>
is even said to have got all the dice-sellers in Paris to substitute loaded
dice instead of fair ones, in order to aid his operations.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="51"><p>[51] In the original, however, the word is
<hi rend="italic">piffre</hi>, (vulg&ograve;) `greedy-guts.'</p></note>
<p>Nothing more forcibly shows the danger of consorting with such
bad characters than the calumny circulated respecting the connection be-tween Henry IV. and this infamous Italian: &mdash; it was said that Henry was
well aware of Pimentello's man&oelig;uvres, and that he encouraged
them with the view of impoverishing his courtiers, hoping thereby to
render them more submissive!  Nero himself would have blushed at such
a connivance.  Doubtless the calumny was as false as it was stupid.
</p>
<p>The winnings of the courtier Bassompi&eacute;rre were enormous.
He won at the Duc d'Epernon's sufficient to pay his debts, to dress
magnificently, to purchase all sorts of extravagant finery, a sword
ornamented with diamonds &mdash; `and after all these expenses,' he says, `I
had still five or six thousand crowns (two to three thousand pounds) left,
<hi rend="italic">*to kill time with</hi>, pour tuer le temps.'
</p>
<p>On another occasion, and at a more advanced age, he won one
hundred thousand crowns (&pound;50,000) at a single sitting, from M.
De Guise, Joinville, and the Mar&eacute;chal d'Ancre.


<pb n="81"/>

</p>
<p>In reading his Memoirs we are apt to get indignant at the fellow's
successes; but at last we are tempted to laugh at his misery.  He died so
poor that he did not leave enough to pay the twentieth part of his debts!
Such, doubtless, is the end of most gamblers.
</p>
<p>But to return to Henry IV., the great gambling exemplar of the
nation.  The account given of him at the gaming table is most afflicting,
when we remember his royal greatness, his sublime qualities.  His only
object was to <hi rend="italic">*win</hi>, and those who played with him were
thus always placed in a dreadful dilemma &mdash; either to lose their money or
offend the king by beating him!  The Duke of Savoy once played with
him, and in order to suit his humour, dissimulated his game &mdash; thus
sacrificing or giving up forty thousand pistoles (about &pound;28,000).
</p>
<p>When the king lost he was most exacting for his `revanche,' or
revenge, as it is termed at play.  After winning considerably from the
king, on one occasion, Bassompi&eacute;rre, under the pretext of his
official engagements, furtively decamped: the king immediately sent after
him; he was stopped, brought back, and allowed to depart only after
giving the `revanche' to his Majesty.  This `good

<pb n="82"/>
Henri,' who was incapable of the least dissimulation either in good or in
evil, often betrayed a degree of cupidity which made his minister, Sully,
ashamed of him; &mdash; in order to pay his gaming debts, the king one day
deducted seventy-two thousand livres from the proceeds of a confiscation
on which he had no claim whatever.
</p>
<p>On another occasion he was wonderfully struck with some gold-pieces which Bassompi&eacute;rre brought to Fontainebleau, called
<hi rend="italic">Portugalloises</hi>.  He could not rest without having them.  Play
was necessary to win them, but the king was also anxious to be in time
for a hunt.  In order to conciliate the two passions, he ordered a gaming
party at the Palace, left a representative of his game during his absence,
and returned sooner than usual, to try and win the so much coveted
<hi rend="italic">Portugalloises</hi>.
</p>
<p>Even love &mdash; if that name can be applied to the grovelling passion
of Henry IV., intensely violent as it was &mdash; could not, with its sensuous
enticements, drag the king from the gaming table or stifle his despicable
covetousness.  On one occasion, whilst at play, it was whispered to him
that a certain princess whom he loved was likely to fall into other
arms: &mdash; `Take care of my money,' said he to

<pb n="83"/>
Bassompi&eacute;rre, `and keep up the game whilst I am absent on
particular business.'
</p>
<p>During this reign gamesters were in high favour, as may well be
imagined.  One of them received an honour never conceded even to
princes and dukes.  `The latter,' says Amelot de la Houssaie, `did not
enter the court-yard of the royal mansions in a carriage before the year
1607, and they are indebted for the privilege to the first Duc d'Epernon,
the favourite of the late king, Henry III., who being wont to go every
day to play with the queen, Marie de Medicis, took it into his head to
have his carriage driven into the court-yard of the Louvre, and had
himself carried bodily by his footmen into the very chamber of the queen
&mdash; under the pretext of being dreadfully tormented with the gout, so as
not to be able to stand on his legs.'[52]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="52"><p>[52] Mem. Hist. iii.</p></note>
<p>It is said, however, that Henry IV. was finally cured of gambling.
<hi rend="italic">Credat Jud&aelig;us!</hi>  But the anecdote is as follows.  The
king lost an immense sum at play, and requested Sully to let him have
the money to pay it.  The latter demurred, so that the king had to send to
him

<pb n="84"/>
several times.  At last, however, Sully took him the money, and spread
it out before him on the table, exclaiming &mdash; `There's the sum.'  Henry
fixed his eyes on the vast amount.  It is said to have been enough to
purchase Amiens from the Spaniards, who then held it.  The king
thereupon exclaimed: &mdash; `I am corrected.  I will never again lose my
money at gaming.'
</p>
<p>During this reign Paris swarmed with gamesters.  Then for the
first time were established <hi rend="italic">Academies de Jeu</hi>, `Gaming
Academies,' for thus were termed the gaming houses to which all classes
of society beneath the nobility and gentility, down to the lowest, rushed
in crowds and incessantly.  Not a day passed without the ruin of
somebody.  The son of a merchant, who possessed twenty thousand
crowns, lost sixty thousand.  It seemed, says a contemporary, that a
thousand pistoles at that time were valued less than a <hi rend="italic">sou</hi> in
the time of Francis I.
</p>
<p>The result of this state of things was incalculable social affliction.
Usury and law-suits completed the ruin of gamblers.
</p>
<p>The profits of the keepers of gaming houses must have been
enormous, to judge from the rents

<pb n="85"/>
they paid.  A house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain was secured at the
rental of about &pound;70 for a fortnight, for the purpose of gambling
during the time of the fair.  Small rooms and even closets were hired at
the rate of many pistoles or half-sovereigns per hour; to get paid,
however, generally entailed a fight or a law-suit.
</p>
<p>All this took place in the very teeth of the most stringent laws
enacted against gaming and gamesters.  The fact was, that among the
magistrates some closed their eyes, and others held out their hands to
receive the bribe of their connivance.
</p>
<p>LOUIS XIII. &mdash; At the commencement of the reign of Louis XIII.
the laws against gaming were revived, and severer penalties were
enacted.  Forty-seven gaming houses at Paris, which had been licensed,
and from which several magistrates drew a perquisite of a pistole or half
a sovereign a day, were shut up and suppressed.
</p>
<p>These stringent measures checked the gambling of the `people,' but
not that of `the great,' who went on merrily as before.
</p>
<p>Of course they `kept the thing quiet' &mdash; gambled in secret &mdash; but
more desperately than

<pb n="86"/>
ever.  The Mar&eacute;chal d'Ancre commonly staked twenty thousand
pistoles (&pound;10,000).
</p>
<p>Louis XIII. was not a gambler, and so, during this reign, the court
did not set so bad an example.  The king was averse to all games of
chance.  He only liked chess, but perhaps rather too much, to judge
from the fact that, in order to enable him to play chess on his journeys,
a chessboard was fitted in his carriage, the pieces being furnished with
pins at the bottom so as not to be deranged or knocked down by the
motion.  The reader will remember that, as already stated, a similar
gaming accommodation was provided for the Roman Emperor Claudius.
</p>
<p>The cup and ball of Henry III. and the chessboard of Louis XIII.
are merely ridiculous.  We must excuse well-intentioned monarchs when
they only indulge themselves with frivolous and childish trifles.  It is
something to be thankful for if we have not to apply to them the adage &mdash;
Quic-quid delirant reges plectuntur Achivi &mdash; `When kings go mad their
people get their blows.'
</p>
<p>LOUIS XIV. &mdash; The reign of Louis XIV. was a great development
in every point of view, gaming included.


<pb n="87"/>

</p>
<p>The revolutions effected in the government and in public morals by
Cardinal Richelieu, who played a game still more serious than those we
are considering, had very considerably checked the latter; but these
resumed their vigour, with interest, under another Cardinal, profoundly
imbued with the Italian spirit &mdash; the celebrated Mazarin.  This minister,
independently of his particular taste that way, knew how to ally gaming
with his political designs.  By means of gaming he contrived to protract
the minority of the king under whom he governed the nation.
</p>
<p>`Mazarin,' says St Pierre, `introduced gaming at the court of Louis
XIV. in the year 1648.  He induced the king and the queen regent to
play; and preference was given to games of chance.  The year 1648 was
the era of card-playing at court.  Cardinal Mazarin played deep and with
finesse, and easily drew in the king and queen to countenance this new
entertainment, so that every one who had any expectation at court
learned to play at cards.  Soon after the humour changed, and games of
chance came into vogue &mdash; to the ruin of many considerable families: this
was likewise very destructive to health, for besides the various

<pb n="88"/>
violent passions it excited, whole nights were spent at this execrable
amusement.  The worst of all was that card-playing, which the court had
taken from the army, soon spread from the court into the city, and from
the city pervaded the country towns.
</p>
<p>`Before this there was something done for improving conversation;
every one was ambitious of qualifying himself for it by reading ancient
and modern books; memory and reflection were much more exercised.
But on the introduction of gaming men likewise left of tennis, billiards,
and other games of skill, and consequently became weaker and more
sickly, more ignorant, less polished, and more dissipated.
</p>
<p>`The women, who till then had commanded respect, accustomed
men to treat them familiarly, by spending the whole night with them at
play.  They were often under the necessity of borrowing either to play,
or to pay their losings; and how very ductile and complying they were to
those of whom they had to borrow was well known.'
</p>
<p>From that time gamesters swarmed all over France; they multiplied
rapidly in every profession, even among the magistracy.  The Cardinal

<pb n="89"/>
de Retz tells us, in his Memoirs, that in 1650 the oldest magistrate in the
parliament of Bordeaus, and one who passed for the wisest, was not
ashamed to stake all his property one night at play, and that too, he
adds, without risking his reputation &mdash; so general was the fury of
gambling.  It became very soon mixed up with the most momentous cir-cumstances of life and affairs of the gravest importance.  The States-general, or parliamentary assemblies, consisted altogether of gamblers.
`It is a game,' says Madame de Sevign&eacute;, `it is an entertainment,
a liberty-hall day and night, attracting all the world.  I never before
beheld the States-general of Bretagne.  The States-general are decidedly a
very fine thing.'
</p>
<p>The same delightful correspondent relates that one of her
amusements when she went to the court was to admire Dangeau at the
card-table; and the following is the account of a gaming party at which
she was present: &mdash;

 </p>









<p>`29th July, 1676.
</p>
<p>`I went on Saturday with Villars to Versailles.  I need not tell you
of the queen's toilette, the mass, the dinner &mdash; you know it all; but at
three o'clock the king rose from table, and he, the queen,

<pb n="90"/>
Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle, all the princes and princesses,
Madame de Montespan, all her suite, all the courtiers, all the ladies, in
short, what we call the court of France, were assembled in that beautiful
apartment which you know.  It is divinely furnished, everything is
magnificent; one does not know what it is to be too hot; we walk about
here and there, and are not incommoded anywhere: &mdash; at last a table of
reversi[53] gives a form to the crowd, and a place to every one.
<hi rend="italic">*The king is next to Madame de Montespan</hi>, who deals; the
Duke of Orleans, the queen, and Madame de Soubise; Dangeau and Co.;
Lang&eacute;e and Co.; a thousand louis are poured out on the cloth &mdash;
there are no other counters.  I saw Dangeau play! &mdash; what fools we all
are compared to him &mdash; he minds nothing but his business, and wins
when every one else loses: he neglects nothing, takes advantage of
everything, is never absent; in a word, his skill defies fortune, and
accordingly 200,000 francs in ten days, 100,000 crowns in a fortnight,
all go to his receipt book.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="53"><p>[53] A kind of game long since out of fashion,
and now almost forgotten; it seems to have been a compound of Loo and
Commerce &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">Quinola</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pam</hi> was the knave
of hearts.</p></note>


<pb n="91"/>

<p>`He was so good as to say I was a partner in his play, by which I
got a very convenient and agreeable place.  I saluted the king in the way
you taught me, which he returned as if I had been young and handsome --I received a thousand compliments &mdash; you know what it is to have a
word from everybody!  This agreeable confusion without confusion lasts
from three o'clock till six.  If a courtier arrives, the king retires for a
moment to read his letters, and returns immediately.  There is always
some music going on, which has a very good effect; the king listens to
the music and chats to the ladies about him.  At last, at six o'clock, they
stop playing &mdash; they have no trouble in settling their reckonings &mdash; there
are no counters &mdash; the lowest pools are five, six, seven hundred louis, the
great ones a thousand, or twelve hundred; they put in five each at first,
that makes one hundred, and the dealer puts in ten more &mdash; then they
give four louis each to whoever has Quinola &mdash; some pass, others play,
but when you play without winning the pool, you must put in sixteen to
teach you how to play rashly: they talk all together, and for ever, and of
everything.  &ldquo;How many hearts?&amp;&rdquo;  &ldquo;Two!&amp;&rdquo;
&ldquo;I have three!&amp;&rdquo;  &ldquo;I have one!&amp;&rdquo;  &ldquo;I
have

<pb n="92"/>
four!&amp;&rdquo;  &ldquo;He has only three!&amp;&rdquo; and Dangeau,
delighted with all this prattle, turns up the trump, makes his calculations,
sees whom he has against him, in short &mdash; in short, I was glad to see
such an excess of skill.  He it is who really knows &ldquo;le dessous
des cartes.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`At ten o'clock they get into their carriages: <hi rend="italic">*the king,
Madame de Montespan</hi>, the Duke of Orleans, and Madame de
Thianges, and the good Hendicourt on the dickey, that is as if one were
in the upper gallery.  You know how these calashes are made.
</p>
<p>`The queen was in another with the princesses; and then everybody
else, grouped as they liked.  Then they go on the water in gondolas, with
music; they return at ten; the play is ready, it is over; twelve strikes,
supper is brought in, and so passes Saturday.'
</p>
<p>This lively picture of such frightful gambling, of the adulterous
triumph of Madame de Montespan, and of the humiliating part to which
the queen was condemned, will induce our readers to concur with
Madame de Sevign&eacute;, who, amused as she had been by the scene
she has described, calls it nevertheless, with her usual pure taste and
good

<pb n="93"/>
judgment, <hi rend="italic">l'iniqua corte</hi>, `the iniquitous court.'
</p>
<p>Indeed, Madame de Sevign&eacute; had ample reason to denounce
this source of her domestic misery.  Writing to her son and daughter,
she says: &mdash; `You lose all you play for.  You have paid five or six
thousand francs for your amusement, and to be abused by fortune.'  If
she had at first been fascinated by the spectacle which she so glowingly
describes, the interest of her children soon opened her eyes to the
yawning gulf at the brink of the flowery surface.
</p>
<p>Sometimes she explains herself plainly: &mdash; `You believe that
everybody plays as honestly as yourself?  Call to mind what took place
lately at the H&ocirc;tel de la Vieuville.  Do you remember that
<hi rend="italic">robbery?</hi>'
</p>
<p>The favour of that court, so much coveted, seemed to her to be
purchased at too high a price if it was to be gained by ruinous
complaisances.  She trembled every time her son left her to go to
Versailles.  She says: &mdash; `He tells me he is going to play with his young
master;[54] I shudder at the thought.  Four hundred pistoles are very
easily lost: <hi rend="italic">ce n'est rien pour Adm&eacute;te et c'est beaucoup
pour

<pb n="94"/>
 lui</hi>.[55]  If Dangeau is in the game he will win all the pools: he is
an eagle.  Then will come to pass, my daughter, all that God may
vouchsafe &mdash; <hi rend="italic">il en arivera, ma fille, tout ce qu'il plaira  &agrave;
Dieu</hi>.' </p>
<note place="foot" n="54"><p>[54] The Dauphin.</p></note>
<note place="foot" n="55"><p>[55] `It is nothing for Admetus, but 'tis much
for him.'</p></note>
<p>And again, `The game of <hi rend="italic">Hoca</hi> is prohibited at Paris
<hi rend="italic">*under the penalty of death</hi>, and yet it is played at court.
Five thousand pistoles before dinner is nothing.  That game is a regular
cut-throat.'
</p>
<p>Hoca was prodigiously unfavourable to the players; the latter had
only twenty-eight chances against thirty.  In the seventeenth century this
game caused such disorder at Rome that the Pope prohibited it and
expelled the bankers.
</p>
<p>The Italians whom Mazarin brought into France obtained from the
king permission to set up <hi rend="italic">Hoca</hi> tables in Paris.  The
parliament launched two edicts against them, and threatened to punish
them severely.  The king's edicts were equally severe.  Every of
offender was to be fined 1000 livres, and the person in whose house
Faro, Basset, or any such game was suffered, incurred the penalty of
6000 livres for each offence.  The persons who played were to be
imprisoned.  Gaming was forbidden the French cavalry under the penalty
of

<pb n="95"/>
death, and every commanding officer who should presume to set up a
Hazard table was to be cashiered, and all concerned to be rigorously im-prisoned.  These penalties might show great horror of gaming, but they
were too severe to be steadily inflicted, and therefore failed to repress
the crime against which they were directed.  The severer the law the less
the likelihood of its application, and consequently its power of
repression.
</p>
<p>Madame de Sevign&eacute; had beheld the gamesters only in the
presence of their master the king, or in the circles which were regulated
with inviolable propriety; but what would she have said if she could have
seen the gamblers at the secret suppers and in the country-houses of the
Superintendent Fouquet, where twenty `qualified' players, such as the
Marshals de Richelieu, de Clairembaut, &amp;c., assembled together, with a
dash of bad company, to play for lands, houses, jewels, even for point-lace and neckties?  There she would have seen something more than gold
staked, since the players debased themselves so low as to circumvent
certain opulent dupes, who were the first invited.  To leave one hundred
pistoles, ostensibly for `the cards,' but really as the perquisite of the
master of

<pb n="96"/>
the lordly house; to recoup him when he lost; and, when they had to deal
with some unimportant but wealthy individual, to undo him completely,
compelling him to sign his ruin on the gaming table &mdash;  such was the
conduct which rendered a man <hi rend="italic">recherch&eacute;</hi>, and
secured the title of a fine player!
</p>
<p>It was precisely thus that the famous (or infamous) Gourville,
successively valet-de-chambre to the Duc de la Rochefoucault, hanged in
effigy at Paris, king's envoy in Germany, and afterwards proposed to
replace Colbert &mdash; it was thus precisely, I say, that Gourville secured
favour, `consideration,' fortune; for he declares, in his Memoirs, that his
gains in a few years amounted to more than a million.  And fortune
seems to have cherished and blessed him throughout his detestable
career.  After having made his fortune, he retired to write the scandalous
Memoirs from which I have been quoting, and died out of debt![56]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="56"><p>[56] Mem. de Gourville, i.</p></note>
<p>France became too narrow a theatre for the chevaliers d'industrie
and all who were a prey to the fury of gambling.  The Count de
Grammont, a very suspicious player, turned his talents to account in
England, Italy, and Spain.


<pb n="97"/>

</p>
<p>This same Count de Grammont figured well at court on one
occasion when Louis XIV. seemed inclined to cheat or otherwise play
unfairly.  Playing at backgammon, and having a doubtful throw, a
dispute arose, and the surrounding courtiers remained silent.  The Count
de Grammont happening to come in, the king desired him to decide it.
He instantly answered &mdash; `Sire, your Majesty is in the wrong.'  `How,'
said the king, `can you decide before you know the question?'
`Because,' replied the count, `had there been any doubt, all these
gentlemen would have given it in favour of your Majesty.'  The plain
inference is that this (at the time) great world's idol and Voltaire's god,
was `up to a little cheating.'  It was, however, as much to the king's
credit that he submitted to the decision, as it was to that of the courtier
who gave him such a lesson.
</p>
<p>The magnanimity of Louis XIV. was still more strikingly shown
on another gambling occasion.  Very high play was going on at the
cardinal's, and the Chevalier de Rohan lost a vast sum to the king.  The
agreement was to pay only in <hi rend="italic">louis d'ors;</hi> and the chevalier,
after counting out seven or eight hundred, proposed to continue

<pb n="98"/>
the payment in Spanish pistoles.  `You promised me <hi rend="italic">louis
d'ors</hi>, and not pistoles,' said the king.  `Since your Majesty
refuses them,' replied the chevalier, `I don't want them either;' and
thereupon he flung them out of the window.  The king got angry, and
complained to Mazarin, who replied: &mdash; `The Chevalier de Rohan has
played the king, and you the Chevalier de Rohan.'  The king
acquiesced.[57]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="57"><p>[57] Mem. et Reflex., &amp;e., par M. L. M. L.
F. (the Marquis de la Fare).</p></note>
<p>As before stated, the court of the Roman Emperor Augustus, in
spite of the many laws enacted against gambling, diffused the frenzy
through Rome; in like manner the court of Louis XIV., almost in the
same circumstances, infected Paris and the entire kingdom with the vice.
</p>
<p>There is this difference between the French monarch and the
Roman emperor, that the latter did not teach his successors to play
against the people, whereas Louis, after having denounced gaming, and
become almost disgusted with it, finished with established lotteries.
High play was always the etiquette at court, but the sittings became less
frequent and were abridged.  `The

<pb n="99"/>
king,' says Madame de Sevign&eacute;, `has not given over playing, but
the sittings are not so long.'
</p>
<p>LOUIS XV. &mdash; At the death of Louis XIV. three-fourths of the
nation thought of nothing but gambling.  Gambling, indeed, became
itself an object of speculation, in consequence of the establishment and
development of lotteries &mdash; the first having been designed to celebrate the
restoration of peace and the marriage of Louis XIV.  The nation seemed
all mad with the excitement of play.  During the minority of Louis XV.
a foreign gamester, the celebrated Scotchman, John Law, having become
Controller-General of France, undertook to restore the finances of the
nation by making every man a player or gamester.  He propounded a
<hi rend="italic">system;</hi> he established a bank, which nearly upset the state;
and seduced even those who had escaped the epidemic of games of
chance.  He was finally expelled like a foul fog; but they ought to have
hanged him as a deliberate corrupter.  And yet this is the man of whom
Voltaire wrote as follows:  `We are far from evincing the gratitude
which is due to John Law.[58]  Vol

<pb n="100"/>
taire's praise was always as suspicious as his blame.  Just let us consider
the tendency of John Law's `system.'  However general may be the fury
of gambling, <hi rend="italic">*everybody</hi> does not gamble; certain pro-fessions impose a certain restraint, and their members would blush to
resort to games the turpitude of which would subject them to unanimous
condemnation.  But only change the <hi rend="italic">*names</hi> of these games --only change their <hi rend="italic">*form</hi>, and let the bait be presented under
the sanction of the legislature: then, although the <hi rend="italic">*thing</hi> be
not less vicious, nor less repugnant to true principle, then we witness the
gambling ardour of savages, such as we have described it, manifesting
itself with more risk, and communicated to the entire nation &mdash; the
ministers of the altar, the magistracy, the members of every profession,
fathers, mothers of families, without distinction of rank, means, or
duties. . . .  Let this short generalization be well pondered, and the
conclusion must be reached that this Scotch adventurer, John Law, was
guilty of the crime of treason against humanity.

<p>John Law, whom the French called <hi rend="italic">Jean Lass</hi>, opened
a gulf into which half the nation eagerly poured its money.  Fortunes
were made in a few

<pb n="101"/>
days &mdash; in a few <hi rend="italic">*hours</hi>.  Many were enriched by merely
lending their signatures.  A sudden and horrible revolution amazed the
entire people &mdash; like the bursting of a bomb-shell or an incendiary ex-plosion.  Six hundred thousand of the best families, who had taken
<hi rend="italic">*paper</hi> on the faith of the government, lost, together with
their fortunes, their offices and appointments, and were almost
annihilated.  Some of the stock-jobbers escaped; others were compelled
to disgorge their gains &mdash; although they stoutly and, it must be admitted,
consistently appealed to the sanction of the court.
</p>
<p>Oddly enough, whilst the government made all France play at this
John Law game &mdash; the most seductive and voracious that ever existed &mdash;
some thirty or forty persons were imprisoned for having broken the laws
enacted against games of chance!
</p>
<p>It may be somewhat consolatory to know that the author of so
much calamity did not long enjoy his share of the infernal success &mdash; the
partition of a people's ruin.  After extorting so many millions, this
famous gambler was reduced to the necessity of selling his last diamond
in order to raise money to gamble on.
</p>
<p>This great catastrophe, the commotion of which

<pb n="102"/>
was felt even in Holland and in England, was the last sigh of true honour
among the French.  Probity received a blow.  Public morality was
abashed.  More gaming houses than ever were opened, and then it was
that they received the name of <hi rend="italic">Enfers</hi>, or `Hells,' by which
they were designated in England.  `The greater number of those who go
to the watering-places,' writes a contemporary, `under the pretext of
health, only go after gamesters.  In the States-general it is less the
interest of the people than the attraction of terrible gambling, that brings
together a portion of the nobility.  The nature of the play may be
inferred from the name of the place at which it takes place in one of the
provinces &mdash; namely, <hi rend="italic">Enfer</hi>.  This salon, so appropriately
called, was in the Hotel of the king's commissioners in Bretagne.  I have
been told that a gentleman, to the great disgust of the noblemen present,
and even of the bankers, actually offered to stake his sword.
</p>
<p>`This name of <hi rend="italic">Enfers</hi> has been given to several gaming
houses, some them situated in the interior of Paris, others in the
environs.
</p>
<p>`People no longer blush, as did Caligula, at gambling on their
return from the funeral of their

<pb n="103"/>
relatives or friends.  A gamester, returning from the burial of his
brother, where he had exhibited the signs of profound grief, played and
won a considerable sum of money.  &ldquo;How do you feel
now?&amp;&rdquo; he was asked.  &ldquo;A little better,&amp;&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;this consoles me.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`All is excitement whilst I write.  Without mentioning the base
deeds that have been committed, I have counted four suicides and a great
crime.
</p>
<p>`Besides the licensed gaming houses, new ones are furtively
established in the privileged mansions of the ambassadors and
representatives of foreign courts.  Certain chevaliers d'industrie recently
proposed to a gentleman of quality, who had just been appointed
plenipotentiary, to hire an hotel for him, and to pay the expenses, on
condition that he would give up to them an apartment and permit them to
have valets wearing his livery!  This base proposal was rejected with
contempt, because the Baron de &mdash;  &mdash;  is one of the most honourable and
enlightened men of the age.
</p>
<p>`The most difficult bargains are often amicably settled by a game.
I have seen persons gaming whilst taking a walk and whilst travelling in
their

<pb n="104"/>
carriages.  People game at the doors of the theatres; of course they
gamble for the price of the ticket.  In every possible manner, and in
every situation, the true gamester strives to turn every instant to profit.
</p>
<p>`If I relate what I have seen in the matter of play during sleep, it
will be difficult to understand me.  A gamester, exhausted by fatigue,
could not give up playing because he was a loser; so he requested his
adversary to play for him with his left hand, whilst he dozed off and
slept!  Strange to say, the left hand of his adversary incessantly won,
whilst he snored to the sound of the dice!
</p>
<p>`I have just read in a newspaper,[59] that two Englishmen, who
left their country to fight a duel in a foreign land, nevertheless played at
the highest stakes on the voyage; and having arrived on the field, one of
them laid a wager that he would kill his adversary.  It is stated that the
spectators of the affair looked upon it as a gaming transaction.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="59"><p>[59] Journal de Politique, Dec. 15,
1776.</p></note>
<p>`In speaking of this affair I was told of a German, who, being
compelled to fight a duel on account of a quarrel at the gaming table,
allowed his adversary to fire at him.  He was missed.

<pb n="105"/>
Thereupon he said to his opponent, &ldquo;I never miss.  I bet you a
hundred ducats that I break your right or left arm, just as you
please.&amp;&rdquo;  The bet was taken, and he won.
</p>
<p>`I have found cards and dice in many places where people were in
want of bread.  I have seen the merchant and the artisan staking gold by
handfuls.  A small farmer has just gamed away his harvest, valued at
3000 francs.'[60]
</p>

<p>Gaming houses in Paris were first licensed in 1775, by the
lieutenant of police, Sartines, who, to diminish the odium of such
establishments, decreed that the profit resulting from them should be
applied to the foundation of hospitals.  Their number soon amounted to
twelve; and women were allowed to resort to them two days in the
week.  Besides the licensed establishments, several illegal ones were
tolerated, and especially styled <hi rend="italic">enfers</hi>, or `hells.'
</p>
<p>Gaming having been found prolific in misfortunes and crimes, was
prohibited in 1778; but it was still practised at the court and in the hotels
of ambassadors, where police-officers could not enter.  By degrees the
public establishments re

<pb n="106"/>
sumed their wonted activity, and extended their pernicious effects.  The
numerous suicides and bankruptcies which they occasioned attracted the
attention of the <hi rend="italic">Parlement</hi>, who drew up regulations for their
observance, and threatened those who violated them with the pillory and
whipping.  The licensed houses, as well as those recognized, however,
still continued their former practices, and breaches of the regulations
were merely visited with trivial punishment.
</p>
<p>At length, the passion for play prevailing in the societies
established in the Palais Royal, under the title of <hi rend="italic">*clubs</hi> or
<hi rend="italic">salons</hi>, a police ordinance was issued in 1785, prohibiting
them from gaming.  In 1786, fresh disorder having arisen in the unli-censed establishments, additional prohibiting measures were enforced.
During the Revolution the gaming-houses were frequently prosecuted,
and licenses withheld; but notwithstanding the rigour of the laws and the
vigilance of the police, they still contrived to exist.
</p>
<p>LOUIS XVI. TILL THE PRESENT TIME. &mdash; In the general
corruption of morals, which rose to its height during the reign of Louis
XVI., gambling kept pace with, if it did not outstrip, every other

<pb n="107"/>
licentiousness of that dismal epoch.[61]  Indeed, the universal excitement
of the nation naturally tended to develope every desperate passion of our
nature; and that the revolutionary troubles and agitation of the empire
helped to increase the gambling propensity of the French, is evident from
the magnitude of the results on record.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="61"><p>[61] It will be seen in the sequel that gambling
was vastly increased in England by the French `emigr&eacute;s' who
sought refuge among us, bringing with them all their vices, unchastened
by misfortune.</p></note>
<p>Fouch&eacute;, the minister of police, derived an income of
&pound;128,000 a year for licensing or `privileging' gaming houses, to
which cards of address were regularly furnished.
</p>
<p>Besides what the `farmers' of the gaming houses paid to
Fouch&eacute;, they were compelled to hire and pay 120,000 persons,
employed in those houses as <hi rend="italic">croupiers</hi> or attendants at the
gaming table, from half-a-crown to half-a-guinea a day; and all these
120,000 persons were <hi rend="italic">spies of Fouch&eacute;!</hi>  A very
clever idea no doubt it was, thus to draw a revenue from the proceeds of
a vice, and use the institution for the purposes of government; but,
perhaps, as Rousseau remarks, `it is a great error in domestic as well as
civil economy to wish to combat one

<pb n="108"/>
vice by another, or to form between them a sort of equilibrium, as if that
which saps the foundations of order can ever serve to establish it.'[62]
A minister of the Emperor Theodosius II., in the year 431, the virtuous
Florentius, in order to teach his master that it was wrong to make the
vices contribute to the State, because such a procedure authorizes them,
gave to the public treasury one of his lands the revenue of which
equalled the product of the annual tax levied on prostitution.[63]

<p>After the restoration of the Bourbons, it became quite evident that
play in the Empire had been quite as Napoleonic in its vigour and
dimensions as any other `idea' of the epoch.

gaming table.

<p>This state of things was, however, altered in the

year 1836, at the proposition of M. B. Delessert, and all the gaming

England, &mdash; utterly prohibited, but carried on in secret.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.
<lb/>
THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF MODERN GAMING IN ENGLAND.
</head>

<p>IT seems that the rise of modern gaming in England may be dated
from the year 1777 or 1778.
</p>
<p>Before this time gaming appears never to have assumed an
alarming aspect.  The methodical system of partnership, enabling men to
embark large capital in gambling establishments, was unknown; though
from that period this system became the special characteristic of the
pursuit among all classes of the community.
</p>
<p>The development of the evil was a subject of great concern to
thoughtful men, and one of these, in the year 1784, put forth a pamphlet,
which seems to give `the very age and body of the time, his form and
pressure.'[64]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="64"><p>[64] The pamphlet (in the Library of the British
Museum) is entitled: &mdash; `Hints for a Reform, particularly of the Gaming
Clubs.  By a Member of Parliament. 1784.'</p></note>

<pb n="113"/>
<p>`About thirty years ago,' says this writer, `there was but one club
in the metropolis.  It was regulated and respectable.  There were few of
the members who betted high.  Such stakes at present would be reckoned
very low indeed.  There were then assemblies once a week in most of
the great houses.  An agreeable society met at seven o'clock; they played
for crowns or half-crowns; and reached their own houses about
eleven.<hi rend="super">* * * *</hi>
</p>
<p>`There was but one lady who gamed deeply, and she was viewed
in the light of a phenomenon.  Were she now to be asked her real
opinion of those friends who were her former <hi rend="italic">*play</hi>-fellows,
there can be no doubt but that they rank very low in her
esteem.<hi rend="super">* * * *</hi>
</p>
<p>`In the present era of vice and dissipation, how many females
attend the card-tables!  What is the consequence?  The effects are too
clearly to be traced to the frequent <hi rend="italic">*divorces</hi> which have
lately disgraced our country, and they are too visible in the shameful
conduct of many ladies of fashion, since gambling became their chief
amusement.<hi rend="super">* * * *</hi>


<pb n="114"/>

</p>
<p>`There is now no society.  The routs begin at midnight.  They are
painful and troublesome to the lady who receives company, and they are
absolutely a nuisance to those who are honoured with a card of
invitation.  It is in vain to attempt conversation.  The social pleasures are
entirely banished, and those who have any relish for them, or who are
fond of early hours, are necessarily excluded.  Such are the companies
of modern times, and modern people of fashion.  Those who are not
invited fly to the <hi rend="italic">Gaming Clubs</hi> &mdash;

 </p>


<p>&ldquo;To kill their idle hours and cure
<hi rend="italic">ennui!</hi>&amp;&rdquo;

 </p>


<p>*</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>*

</p>
<p>`To give an account of the present encumbered situation of many
families, whose property was once large and ample, would fill a volume.
Whence spring the difficulties which every succeeding day increases?
From the <hi rend="italic">Gambling Clubs</hi>.  Why are they continually hunted
by their creditors?  The reply is &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">Gambling Clubs</hi>.
Why are they obliged continually to rack their invention in order to save
appearances?  The answer still is &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">Gambling Clubs!</hi>
</p>
<p>`The father frequently ruins his children; and

<pb n="115"/>
sons, and even grandsons, long before the succession opens to them, are
involved so deeply that during their future lives their circumstances are
rendered narrow; and they have rank or family honours, without being
able to support them.
</p>
<p>`How many infamous villains have amassed immense estates, by
taking advantage of unfortunate young men, who have been first seduced
and then ruined by the Gambling Clubs!<hi rend="super">* * * *</hi>
</p>
<p>`It is well known that the old members of those gambling societies
exert every nerve to enlist young men of fortune; and if we take a view
of the principal estates on this island, we shall find many infamous
<hi rend="italic">*Christian</hi> brokers who are now living luxuriously and in
splendour on the wrecks of such unhappy victims.
</p>
<p>`At present, when a boy has learned a little from his father's
example, he is sent to school, to be <hi rend="italic">*initiated</hi>.  In the course
of a few years he acquires a profound knowledge of the science of
gambling, and before he leaves the University he is perfectly fitted for a
member of the <hi rend="italic">Gaming Clubs</hi>, into which he is elected before
he takes his seat in either House of Parliament.  There is no necessity
for his being of age, as the sooner he is bal

<pb n="116"/>
lotted for, the more advantageous his admission will prove to the
<hi rend="italic">*old</hi> members.
</p>
<p>`Scarcely is the hopeful youth enrolled among these
<hi rend="italic">*honourable</hi> associates, than he is introduced to Jews, to
annuity-brokers, and to the long train of money-lenders.  They take care
to answer his pecuniary calls, and the greater part of the night and
morning is consumed at the <hi rend="italic">Club</hi>.  To his creditors and
tradesmen, instead of paying his bills, he offers a <hi rend="italic">*bond</hi> or
<hi rend="italic">*annuity</hi>.  He rises just time enough to ride to Kensington
Gardens; returns to dress; dines late; and then attends the party of
gamblers, as he had done the night before, unless he allows himself to be
detained for a few moments by the newspaper, or some political
publication.
</p>
<p>`Such do we find the present fashionable style of life, from
&ldquo;his Grace&amp;&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Ensign&amp;&rdquo; in the Guards.
Will this mode of education rear up heroes, to lead forth our armies, or
to conduct our fleets to victory?  Review the conduct of your generals
abroad, and of your statesmen at home, during the late unfortunate war,
and these questions are answered.[65]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="65"><p>[65] Of course this is an allusion to the
American War of Independence and the political events at home, from
1774 to 1784.</p></note>

<pb n="117"/>
<p>`At present, tradesmen must themselves be gamblers before they
give credit to a member of these clubs; but if a reform succeeds they
will be placed in a state of security.  At present they must make
<hi rend="italic">*regular</hi> families pay an enormous price for their goods, to
enable them to run the risk of never receiving a single shilling from their
gambling customers.'
</p>
<p>Such is the picture of the times in question, drawn by a
contemporary; and it may be said that private reckless and unscrupulous
political machinations were the springs and fountains of all the calamities
that subsequently overflowed, as it were, the `opening of the seals' of
doom upon the nation.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the purity of morals enjoined by the court of
George III., the early part of his reign presents a picture of dissolute
manners as well as of furious party spirit.  The most fashionable of our
ladies of rank were immersed in play, or devoted to politics: the same
spirit carried them into both.  The Sabbath was disregarded, spent often
in cards, or desecrated by the meetings of partisans of both factions;
moral duties were neglected and decorum outraged.  The fact was,

<pb n="118"/>
that a minor court had become the centre of all the bad passions and
reprehensible pursuits in vogue.  Carlton House, in Pall Mall, which
even the oldest of us can barely remember, with its elegant open screen,
the pillars in front, its low exterior, its many small rooms, its
decorations in vulgar taste, and, to crown the whole, its associations of a
corrupting revelry, &mdash; Carlton House was, in the days of good King
George, almost as great a scandal to the country as Whitehall in the time
of improper King Charles II.[66]  The influence which the example of a
young prince, of manners eminently popular, produced upon the young
nobility of the realm was most disastrous in every way and ruinous to
public morality.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="66"><p>[66] Wharton, `The Queens of Society.'  Mem.
of <hi rend="italic">Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.</hi></p></note>
<p>After that period, the vast license given to those abominable
engines of fraud, the E.O. tables,[67] and the great length of time which
elapsed before they met with any check from the police, afforded a
number of dissolute and abandoned characters an

<pb n="119"/>
opportunity of acquiring property.  This they afterwards increased in the
low gaming houses, and by following up the same system at Newmarket
and the other fashionable places of resort, and finally by means of the
lottery, that mode of insensate gambling; till at length they acquired a
sum of money nothing short of <hi rend="italic">*One Million Sterling</hi>.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="67"><p>[67] So called from the letters E and O, the
turning up of which decided the bet.  They were otherwise called
<hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Roly Poly</hi>, from the balls used in
them.  They seem to have been introduced in England about the year
1739.  The first was set up at Tunbridge and proved extremely profitable
to the proprietors.</p></note>
<p>This enormous wealth was then used as an efficient capital in
carrying on various illegal establishments, particularly gaming houses,
the expenses of a first-rate house being &pound;7000 per annum, which
were again employed as the means of increasing these ill-gotten riches.
</p>
<p>The system was progressive but steady in its development.  Several
of these conspicuous members of the world of fashion, rolling in their
gaudy carriages and associating with men of high rank and influence,
might be found on the registers of the Old Bailey, or had been formerly
occupied in turning, with their own hands, E.O. tables in the public
streets.
</p>
<p>The following <hi rend="italic">Queries</hi>, which are extracted from the
<hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> of July the 5th, 1797, throw considerable light
upon this curious subject, and show how seriously the matter was
regarded when so

<pb n="120"/>
public a denunciation was deemed necessary and ventured upon: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`Is Mr Ogden (now the Newmarket oracle) the same person who,
five-and-twenty years since, was an annual pedestrian to Ascot, covered

</p>
<p>`Is Mr Phillips (who has now his town and country house, in the
most fashionable style) the same who was originally a linen-draper and
bankrupt at Salisbury, and who made his first <hi rend="italic">family
entr&eacute;</hi> in the metropolis, by his superiority at <hi rend="italic">Bil-liards</hi> (with Captain Wallace, Orrell, &amp;c.) at Cropley's, in Bow

</p>
<p>`Was poor carbuncled P &mdash; e (so many years the favourite decoy
duck of <hi rend="italic">*the family</hi>) the very barber of Oxford, who, in the
midst of the operation upon a gentleman's face, laid down his razor,
swearing that he would never shave another man so long as he lived, and
immediately became the hero of the card table, the <hi rend="italic">bones</hi>, the
<hi rend="italic">box</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Cockpit?</hi>'
</p>
<p>Capital was not the only qualification for admission into the
Confederacy of Gambling.  Some of the members were taken into
partnership on account of their dexterity in `securing' dice or `dealing'
cards.  One is said to have been actually a sharer in every `Hell' at the
West-End of the Town, because he was feared as much as he was
detested by the firms, who had reason to know that he would `peach' if
not kept quiet.  Informers against the illegal and iniquitous associations
were arrested and imprisoned upon writs, obtained by perjury &mdash; to deter
others from similar attacks; witnesses were suborned; officers of justice
bribed; ruffians and bludgeon-men employed, where gratuities failed;
personal violence and even assassination threatened to all who dared to
expose the crying evil &mdash; among others, to Stockdale, the well-known
publisher of the day, in Piccadilly.


<pb n="122"/>

</p>
<p>Then came upon the nation the muddy flood of French emigrants,
poured forth by the Great Revolution &mdash; a set of men, speaking generally,
whose vices contaminated the very atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Before the advent of these worthies the number of gambling houses
in the metropolis, exclusive of those so long established by subscription,
was not more than half-a-dozen; but by the year 1820 they had increased
to nearly fifty.  Besides <hi rend="italic">Faro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hazard</hi>, the
foreign games of <hi rend="italic">Macao, Roulette, Rouge et Noir</hi>, &amp;c., were
introduced, and there was a graduated accommodation for all ranks,
from the Peer of the Realm to the Highwayman, the Burglar, and the
Pick-pocket.
</p>
<p>At one of the watering-places, in 1803, a baronet lost
&pound;20,000 at play, and a bond for &pound;7000.  This will
scarcely surprise us when we consider that at the time above five
hundred notorious characters supported themselves in the metropolis by
this species of robbery, and in the summer spread themselves through the
watering-places for their professional operations.  Some of them kept
bankers, and were possessed of considerable property in the funds and in
land, and went their <hi rend="italic">*circuits</hi> as regularly as the judges.
Most excellent

<pb n="123"/>
judges they were, too, of the condition of a `pigeon.'
</p>
<p>In a great commercial city where, from the extent of its trade,
manufacture, and revenue, there must be an immense circulation of
property, the danger is not to be conceived of the allurements which
were thus held out to young men in business having the command of
money, as well as the clerks of merchants, bankers, and others.  In fact,
too many of this class proved, at the bar of justice, the consequence of
their resort to these complicated scenes of vice, idleness, extravagance,
misfortune, and crime.  Among innumerable instances are the
following: &mdash; In 1796, a shopman to a grocer in the city was seduced into
a gaming party, where he first lost all his own money, and ultimately
what his master had intrusted him with.  He hanged himself in his bed-room a few hours afterwards.
</p>
<p>In the same year, Lord Kenyon in summing up a case of the kind
said: &mdash; `It was extremely to be lamented that the vice of gambling had
descended to the very lowest orders of the people.  It was prevalent
among the highest ranks of society, who had set the example to their
inferiors, and who, it seemed, were too great for the law.  I wish

<pb n="124"/>
they could be punished.  If any prosecutions are fairly brought before
me, and the parties are justly convicted, whatever may be their rank or
station in the country &mdash; though they should be the first ladies in the
land &mdash; they shall certainly exhibit themselves in the pillory.'
</p>
<p>In 1820, James Lloyd, one of the harpies who practised on the
credulity of the lower orders by keeping a <hi rend="italic">Little Go</hi>, or
illegal lottery, was brought up for the twentieth time, to answer for that
offence.  This man was a methodist preacher, and assembled his
neighbours together at his dwelling on a Saturday to preach the gospel to
them, and the remainder of the week he was to be found, with an equally
numerous party, instructing them in the ruinous vice of gambling.  The
charge was clearly proved, and the prisoner was sentenced to three
months' imprisonment with hard labour.
</p>
<p>In the same year numbers of young persons robbed their masters to
play at a certain establishment called Morley's Gambling House, in the
City, and were ruined there.  Some were brought to justice at the Old
Bailey; others, in the madness caused by their losses, destroyed
themselves; and some escaped to other countries, by their own

<pb n="125"/>
activity, or through the influence of their friends.
</p>
<p>A traveller of the coachmakers, Messrs Houlditch of Long Acre,
embezzled or applied to his own use considerable sums of money
belonging to them.  It appeared in evidence that the prisoner was sent by
his employers to the Continent to take orders for carriages; he was
allowed a handsome salary, and was furnished with carriages for sale.
The money he received for them he was to send to his employers, after
deducting his expenses; but instead of so doing, he gambled nearly the
whole of it away.  The following letter to his master was put in by way
of explanation of his career: &mdash; `Sir, &mdash; The errors into which I have
fallen have made me so hate myself that I have adopted the horrible
resolution of destroying myself.  I am sensible of the crime I commit
against God, my family, and society, but have not courage to live
dishonoured.  The generous confidence you placed in me I have basely
violated; I have robbed you, and though not to enrich myself, the
consciousness of it destroys me.  Bankruptcy, poverty, beggary, and
want I could bear &mdash; conscious integrity would support me: but the ill-fated acquaintance I formed led me to those earthly hells &mdash; gambling
houses; and

<pb n="126"/>
then commenced my villainies and deceptions to you.  My losses were
not large at first; and the stories that were told me of gain made me hope
they would soon be recovered.  At this period I received the order to go
to Vienna, and on settling at the hotel I found my debts treble what I had
expected.  I was in consequence compelled to leave the two carriages as
a guarantee for part of the debt, which I had not in my power to
discharge.  I had hoped such success at Vienna as would enable me to
state all to you; but disappointment blasted every hope, and despair, on
my return to Paris, began to generate the fatal resolution which, at the
moment you read this, will have matured itself to consummation.  I feel
that my reputation is blasted; no way left of re-imbursing the money
wasted, your confidence in me totally destroyed, and nothing left to me
but to see my wife and children, and die.  Affection for them holds me
in existence a little longer.  The gaming table again presented itself to
my imagination as the only possible means of extricating myself.  Count
Montoni's 3000 francs, which I received before you came to Paris,
furnished me with the means &mdash; my death speaks the result!  After
robbery so base as mine, I fear it will be of

<pb n="127"/>
no use for me to solicit your kindness for my wretched wife and forlorn
family.  Oh, Sir, if you have pity on them and treat them kindly, and do
not leave them to perish in a foreign land, the consciousness of the act
will cheer you in your last moments, and God will reward you and yours
for it tenfold.  Their sensibilities will not cause them to need human aid.
Thus I shall be threefold the murderer.  I thank you for the kindness you
have rendered me; and I assure your brother that he has, in this dreadful
moment, my ardent wishes for his welfare here and hereafter.  I have so
contrived it that you will see a person at the Prince's tomorrow, who
will interpret for you.  In mentioning my fate to him, you will not much
serve your own interest by blackening my character and memory.  I
subjoin the reward of my villainies and the correct balance of the
account.  Count Edmond's regular bills I have not received; his valet
will give you them; the others are in a pocket-book, which will be found
on my corpse somewhere in the wood of Boulogne.

<p>`Signed,</p>

</p>
<p>It appears, however, that the gentleman changed

<pb n="128"/>
his mind and did not commit suicide, but surrendered at the Insolvent
Debtor's Court to be dealt with according to law, which was a much
wiser resolution.
</p>
<p>To the games of Faro, Hazard, Macao, Doodle-do, and Rouge et
Noir, more even than to horse-racing, many tradesmen, once possessing
good fortunes and great business, owed their destruction.  Thousands
upon thousands have been ruined in the vicinity of St James's.  It was
not confined to youths of fortune only, but the decent and respectable
tradesman, as well as the dashing clerk of the merchant and banker, was
ingulfed in its vortex.
</p>
<p>The proprietors of gaming houses were also concerned in
fraudulent insurances, and employed a number of clerks while the
lotteries were drawing, who conducted the business without risk, in
counting,-houses, where no insurances were taken, but to which books
were carried, as well as from the different offices in every part of the
town, as from the <hi rend="italic">Morocco-men</hi>, who went from door to
door taking insurances and enticing the poor and middling ranks to
adventure.
</p>
<p>It was gambling, and not the burdens of the long war, nor the
revulsion from war to peace, that

<pb n="129"/>
made so many bankruptcies in the few years succeeding the Battle of
Waterloo.  It was the plunderers at gaming tables that filled the gazettes
and made the gaols overflow with so many victims.
</p>
<p>A foreigner has advanced an opinion as to the source of the
gambling propensity of Englishmen.  `The English,' says M.
Dunne,[68] `the most speculative nation on earth, calculate even upon
future contingences.  Nowhere else is the adventurous rage for stock-jobbing carried on to so great an extent.  The fury of gambling, so
common in England, is undoubtedly a daughter of this speculative
genius.  The <hi rend="italic">Greeks</hi> of Great Britain are, however, much in-ferior to those of France in cunning and industry.  A certain Frenchman
who assumed in London the title and manners of a baron, has been
known to surpass all the most dexterous rogues of the three kingdoms in
the art of robbing.  His aide-de-camp was a kind of German captain, or
rather <hi rend="italic">chevalier d'industrie</hi>, a person who had acted the
double character of a French spy and an English officer at the same
time.  Their tactics being at length discovered, the baron was obliged to
quit the country;

<pb n="130"/>
and he is said to have afterwards entered the monastery of La Trappe,'
where doubtless, in the severe and gloomy religious practices of that ter-rible penitentiary, he atoned for his past enormities.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="68"><p>[68] `Refexions sur l'Homme.'</p></note>
<p>`Till near the commencement of the present century the favourite
game was Faro, and as it was a decided advantage to hold the Bank,
masters and mistresses, less scrupulous than Wilberforce, frequently
volunteered to fleece and amuse the company.  But scandal having made
busy with the names of some of them, it became usual to hire a pro-fessed gamester at five or ten guineas a night, to set up a table for the
evening, just as any operatic professional might now-a-days be hired for
a concert, or a band-master for a ball.
</p>
<p>`Faro gradually dropped out of fashion; Macao took its place;
Hazard was never wanting; and Whist began to be played for stakes
which would have satisfied Fox himself, who, though it was calculated
that he might have netted four or five thousand a year by games of skill,
complained that they afforded no excitement.
</p>
<p>`Wattier's Club, in Piccadilly, was the resort of the Macao players.
It was kept by an old <hi rend="italic">ma&icirc;tre

<pb n="131"/>
d'h&ocirc;tel</hi> of George IV., a character in his way, who took a
just pride in the cookery and wines of his establishment.
</p>
<p>`All the brilliant stars of fashion (and fashion was power then)
frequented Wattier's, with Beau Brummell for their sun.  `Poor
Brummell, dead, in misery and idiotcy, at Caen! and I remember him in
all his glory, cutting his jokes after the opera, at White's, in a black
velvet great-coat, and a cocked hat on his well-powdered head.
</p>
<p>`Nearly the same turn of reflection is suggested as we run over the
names of his associates.  Almost all of them were ruined &mdash; three out of
four irretrievably.  Indeed, it was the forced expatriation of its
supporters that caused the club to be broken up.
</p>
<p>`During the same period (from 1810 to 1815 or thereabouts) there
was a great deal of high play at White's and Brookes', particularly at
Whist.  At Brookes' figured some remarkable characters &mdash; as Tippoo
Smith, by common consent the best Whist-player of his day; and an old
gentleman nicknamed Neptune, from his having once flung himself into
the sea in a fit of despair at being, as he thought, ruined.  He was fished
out in time, found he was

<pb n="132"/>
not ruined, and played on during the remainder of his life.
</p>
<p>`The most distinguished player at White's was the nobleman who
was presented at the Salons in Paris as Le Wellington des Joueurs (Lord
Rivers); and he richly merited the name, if skill, temper, and the most
daring courage are titles to it.  The greatest genius, however, is not
infallible.  He once lost three thousand four hundred pounds at Whist by
not remembering that the seven of hearts was in!  He played at Hazard
for the highest stakes that any one could be got to play for with him, and
at one time was supposed to have won nearly a hundred thousand
pounds; but <hi rend="italic">*it all went</hi>, along with a great deal more, at
Crockford's.
</p>
<p>`There was also a great deal of play at Graham's, the Union, the
Cocoa Tree, and other clubs of the second order in point of fashion.
Here large sums were hazarded with equal rashness, and remarkable
characters started up.  Among the most conspicuous was the late Colonel
Aubrey, who literally passed his life at play.  He did nothing else,
morning, noon, and night; and it was computed that he had paid more
than sixty thousand pounds for card-money.  He was a very fine player
at all

<pb n="133"/>
games, and a shrewd, clever man.  He had been twice to India and made
two fortunes.  It was said that he lost the first on his way home, trans-ferred himself from one ship to another without landing, went back, and
made the second.  His life was a continual alternation between poverty
and wealth; and he used to say, the greatest pleasure in life is winning at
cards &mdash; the next greatest, losing!
</p>
<p>`For several years deep play went on at all these clubs, fluctuating
both as to amount and locality, till by degrees it began to flag.  It had
got to a low ebb when Mr Crockford came to London and established the
celebrated club which bore his name.
</p>
<p>`Some good was certainly produced by the system.  In the first
place, private gambling (between gentleman and gentleman), with its
degrading incidents, is at an end.  In the second place, this very
circumstance brings the worst part of the practice within the reach of the
law.  Public gambling, which only existed by and through what were
popularly termed <hi rend="italic">hells</hi>, might be easily suppressed.  There
were, in 1844, more than twenty of these establishments in Pall Mall,
Piccadilly,

<pb n="134"/>
and St James's, called into existence by Crockford's success.'[69]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="69"><p>[69] Private MS. (Edinburgh Review, vol.
LXXX).</p></note>
<p>Whilst such was the state of things among the aristocracy and those
who were able to consort with them, it seems that the lower orders were
pursuing `private gambling,' in their `ungenteel' fashion, to a very sad
extent.  In 1834 a writer in the `Quarterly' speaks as follows: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`Doncaster, Epsom, Ascot, and Warwick, and most of our
numerous race-grounds and race-towns, are scenes of destructive and
universal gambling among the lower orders, which our absurdly lax
police never attempt to suppress; and yet, without the slightest approach
to an improperly harsh interference with the pleasures of the people, the
Roulette and E.O. tables, which plunder the peasantry at these places for
the benefit of travelling sharpers (certainly equally respectable with some
bipeds of prey who drive coroneted cabs near St James's), might be put
down by any watchful magistrate.'[70]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="70"><p>[70] Quarterly Review, vol. LII.</p></note>
<p>I fear that something similar may be suggested at the present day,
as to the same notorious localities.


<pb n="135"/>

</p>
<p>Mr Sala, writing some years ago on gambling in England, said: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`The passion for gambling is, I believe, innate; but there is,
happily, a very small percentage of the population who are born with a
propensity for high play.  We are speculative and eagerly commercial;
but it is rare to discover among us that inveterate love for gambling, as
gambling, which you may find among the Italians, the South American
Spaniards, the Russians, and the Poles.  Moro, Baccara, Tchuka &mdash; these
are games at which continental peasants will wager and lose their little
fields, their standing crops, their harvest in embryo, their very wives
even.  The Americans surpass us in the ardour of their propitiation of the
gambling goddess, and on board the Mississippi steamboats, an
enchanting game, called <hi rend="italic">Poker</hi>, is played with a delirium of
excitement, whose intensity can only be imagined by realizing that
famous bout at &ldquo;catch him who can,&amp;&rdquo; which took place at
the horticultural <hi rend="italic">f&ecirc;te</hi> immortalized by Mr Samuel
Foote, comedian, at which was present the great <hi rend="italic">Panjandrum</hi>
himself, with the little round button at top, the festivities continuing till
the gunpowder ran out at the heels of the company's boots.


<pb n="136"/>

</p>
<p>`When I was a boy, not so very long &mdash; say twenty years &mdash; since,
the West-end of London swarmed with illicit gambling houses, known by
a name I will not offend your ears by repeating.  On every race-course
there was a public gambling booth and an abundance of thimble-riggers'
stalls.  These, I am happy to state, exist no longer; and the fools who
are always ready to be plucked, can only, in gambling, fall victims to the
commonest and coarsest of swindlers; skittle sharps, beer-house rogues
and sharpers, and knaves who travel to entrap the unwary in railway
carriages with loaded dice, marked cards, and little squares of green
baize for tables, and against whom the authorities of the railway
companies very properly warn their passengers.  A notorious gambling
house in St James's Street &mdash; Crockford's, &mdash; where it may be said,
without exaggeration, that millions of pounds sterling have been diced
away by the fools of fashion, is now one of the most sumptuous and best
conducted dining establishments in London &mdash; the
&ldquo;Wellington.&amp;&rdquo;  The semipatrician Hades that were to be
found in the purlieus of St James's, such as the &ldquo;Cocoa
Tree,&amp;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Berkeley,&amp;&rdquo; and the &ldquo;stick-shop,&amp;&rdquo; at the corner of Albemarle Street &mdash; a

<pb n="137"/>
whole Pandemonium of rosewood and plate-glass dens &mdash; never recovered
from a razzia made on them simultaneously one night by the police, who
were organized on a plan of military tactics, and under the command of
Inspector Beresford; and at a concerted signal assailed the portals of the
infamous places with sledge-hammers.  At the time to which I refer, in
Paris, the Palais Royal, and the environs of the Boulevards des Italiens,
abounded with magnificent gambling rooms similar to those still in
existence in Hombourg, which were regularly licensed by the police, and
farmed under the municipality of the Ville de Paris; a handsome per-centage of the iniquitous profits being paid towards the charitable
institutions of the French metropolis.  There are very many notabilities
of the French Imperial Court, who were then <hi rend="italic">fermiers des
jeux</hi>, or gambling house contractors; and only a year or two since
Doctor Louis V&eacute;ron, ex-dealer in quack medicines, ex-manager
of the Grand Opera, and ex-proprietor of the &ldquo;Consti-tutionnel&amp;&rdquo; newspaper, offered an enormous royalty to
Government for the privilege of establishing a gambling house in Paris.
But the Emperor Napoleon &mdash; all ex-member of Crockford's as he is &mdash;

<pb n="138"/>
sensibly declined the tempting bait.  A similarly
&ldquo;generous&amp;&rdquo; offer was made last year to the Belgian
Government by a joint-stock company who wanted to establish public
gaming tables at the watering-places of Ostend, and who offered to
establish an hospital from their profits; but King Leopold, the astute
proprietor of Claremont, was as prudent as his Imperial cousin of
France, and refused to soil his hands with cogged dice.  The lease of the
Paris authorized gaming houses expired in 1836-7; and the municipality,
albeit loath to lose the fat annual revenue, was induced by governmental
pressure not to renew it; and it is asserted that from that moment the
number of annual suicides in Paris very sensibly decreased.  &ldquo;It
is not generally known,&amp;&rdquo; as the penny-a-liners say, &ldquo;that
the Rev. Caleb Colton, a clergyman of the Church of England, and the
author of &ldquo;Lacon,&amp;&rdquo; a book replete with aphoristic
wisdom, blew his brains out in the forest of St Germains, after ruinous
losses at Frascati's, at the corner of the Rue Richelieu and the
Boulevards, one of the most noted of the <hi rend="italic">Maisons des Jeux</hi>,
and which was afterwards turned into a <hi rend="italic">*restaurant</hi>, and is
now a shawl-shop.[71]  Just

<pb n="139"/>
before the revolution of 1848, nearly all the watering-places in the
Prusso-Rhenane provinces, and in Bavaria, and Hesse, Nassau, and
Baden, contained Kursaals, where gambling was openly carried on.
These existed at Aix-la-Chapelle, Baden-Baden, Wiesbaden, Ems,
Kissengen, and at Spa, close to the Prussian frontier, in Belgium.  It is
due to the fierce democrats who revolted against the monarchs of the
defunct Holy Alliance, to say that they utterly swept away the gambling-tables in Rhenish-Prussia, and in the Grand Duchy of Baden.  Herr
Hecker, of the red republican tendencies, and the astounding wide-awake
hat, particularly distinguished himself in the latter place by his
iconoclastic animosity to <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rouge et
Noir</hi>.  When dynastic &ldquo;order&amp;&rdquo; was restored the
Rhine gaming tables were re-established.  The Prussian Government,
much to its honour, has since shut up the gambling houses at that resort
for decayed nobility and ruined livers, Aix-la-Chapelle.  A motion was
made in the Federal Diet, sitting at Frankfort, to constrain the smaller
governments, in the interest of the Germanic good

<pb n="140"/>
name generally, to close their <hi rend="italic">tripots</hi>, and in some measure
the Federal authorities succeeded.  The only existing continental gaming
houses authorized by government are now the two Badens, Spa (of which
the lease is nearly expired, and will not be renewed), Monaco (capital of
the ridiculous little Italian principality, of which the suzerain is a scion
of the house of &ldquo;Grimaldi&amp;&rdquo;), Malm&ouml;e, in Sweden,
too remote to do much harm, and HOMBOURG.  This last still
flourishes greatly, and I am afraid is likely to flourish, though happily in
isolation; for, as I have before remarked, the
&ldquo;concession&amp;&rdquo; or privilege of the place has been guaranteed
for a long period of years to come by the expectant dynasty of Hesse-Darmstadt.  &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">C'est fait</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;It is all
settled,&amp;&rdquo; said the host of the H&ocirc;tel de France to me,
rubbing his hands exultingly when I mentioned the matter.  But,
<hi rend="italic">Quis custodiet custodes?</hi>  Hesse-Darmstadt has guaranteed
the &ldquo;administration of Hesse-Hombourg, but who is to guarantee
Hesse-Darmstadt?  A battalion of French infantry would, it seems to me,
make short work of H. D., lease guarantees, Federal contingent, and all.
I must mention, in conclusion, that within a very few years we had, if
we have not still, a licensed

<pb n="141"/>
gaming house in our exquisitely moral British dominions.  This was in
that remarkably &ldquo;tight little island&amp;&rdquo; at the mouth of the
Elbe, Heligoland, which we so queerly possess &mdash; Puffendorf, Grotius,
and Vattel, or any other writers on the <hi rend="italic">Jus gentium</hi>, would
be puzzled to tell why, or by what right.  I was at Hamburg in the
autumn of 1856, crossed over to Heligoland one day on a pleasure trip,
and lost some money there, at a miniature <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi> table,
much frequented by joyous Israelites from the mainland, and English
&ldquo;soldier officers&amp;&rdquo; in mufti.  I did not lose much of my
temper, however, for the odd, quaint little place pleased me.  Not so
another Roman citizen, or English travelling gent., who losing, perhaps,
seven-and-sixpence, wrote a furious letter to the &ldquo;Times,&amp;&rdquo;
complaining of such horrors existing under the British flag, desecration
of the English name, and so forth.  Next week the lieutenant-governor,
by &ldquo;order,&amp;&rdquo; put an end to <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi> at
Heligoland; but play on a diminutive scale has since, I have been given
to understand, recommenced there without molestation.

<pb n="142"/>
of a chance that prompts us to the <hi rend="italic">enjeu;</hi> there is mixed up
with our eagerness for the stakes the most varied elements of business
and pleasure; cash-books, ledgers, divident-warrants, indignation

bright flags, lobster salads, cold lamb, fortune-telling gipsies, barouches-and-four, and &ldquo;our Aunt Sally.&amp;&rdquo;  High play is still rife in
some aristocratic clubs; there are prosperous gentlemen who wear clean
linen every day, and whose names are still in the Army List, who make
their five or six hundred a year by Whist-playing, and have nothing else
to live upon; in East-end coffee-shops, sallow-faced Jew boys, itinerant
Sclavonic jewellers, and brawny German sugar-bakers, with sticky
hands, may be found glozing and wrangling over their beloved cards and
dominoes, and screaming with excitement at the loss of a few pence.
There are yet some occult nooks and corners, nestling in unsavoury
localities, on passing which the policeman, even in broad daylight,
cannot refrain from turning his head a little backwards &mdash; as though some
bedevilments must necessarily be taking place directly he has passed &mdash;

<pb n="143"/>
where, in musty back parlours, by furtive lamplight, with doors barred,
bolted, and sheeted with iron, some wretched, cheating gambling goes on
at unholy hours.  Chicken-hazard is scotched, not killed; but a poor,
weazened, etiolated biped is that once game-bird now.  And there is
Doncaster, every year &mdash; Doncaster, with its subscription-rooms under
authority, winked at by a pious corporation, patronized by nobles and
gentlemen supporters of the turf, and who are good enough, sometimes,
to make laws for us plebeians in the Houses of Lords and Commons.
There is Doncaster, with policemen to keep order, and admit none but
&ldquo;respectable&amp;&rdquo; people &mdash; subscribers, who fear Heaven and
honour the Queen.  Are you aware, my Lord Chief-Justice, are you

ye Inspectors of Police, that in the teeth of the law, and under its very
eyes, a shameless gaming-house exists in moral Yorkshire, throughout
every Doncaster St Leger race-week?  Of course you haven't; never
dreamed of such a thing &mdash; never could, never would.  Hie you, then,
and prosecute this wretched gang of betting-touts, congregating at the
corner of Bride Lane, Fleet Street; quick, lodge informa

<lb/>
GAMBLING IN BRIGHTON IN 1817.</head>

<p>THE subject of English gambling may be illustrated by a series of
events which happened at Brighton in 1817, when an inquiry respecting
the gaming carried on at the libraries led to many important disclosures.
</p>
<p>It appears that a warrant was granted on the oath of a Mr William
Clarke, against William Wright and James Ford, charged with
feloniously stealing &pound;100.  But the prosecutor did not appear in
court to prove the charge.  It was quite evident, therefore, that the law
had been abused in the transaction, and the magistrate, Sergeant Run-nington, directed warrants to be issued for the immediate appearance of
the prosecutor and Timothy O'Mara, as an evidence; but they absconded,
and

<pb n="146"/>
the learned Sergeant discharged the prisoners.
</p>
<p>The matter then took a different turn.  The same William Wright,
before charged with `stealing' the &pound;100, was now examined as a
witness to give evidence upon an examination against Charles Walker, of
the Marine Library, for keeping an unlawful Gaming House.
</p>
<p>This witness stated that he was engaged, about five weeks before,
to act as <hi rend="italic">punter</hi> or player (that is, in this case, a sham player
or decoy) to a table called <hi rend="italic">Noir, rouge, tout le deux</hi>
(evidently a name invented to evade the statute, if possible), by William
Clarke, the prosecutor, before-mentioned; that the table was first carried
to the back room of Donaldson's Library, where it continued for three or
four days, when Donaldson discharged it from his premises.
</p>
<p>He said he soon got into the confidence of Clarke, who put him up
to the secrets of playing.  The firm consisted of O'Mara, Pollett,
Morley, and Clarke.  There was not much playing at Donaldson's.
Afterwards the table was removed into Broad Street, but the landlady
quickly sent it away.  It was then carried to a room over Walker's
Library, where a rent was paid of <hi rend="italic">twelve guineas</hi>

<pb n="147"/>
per week, showing plainly the profits of the speculation.
</p>
<p>Several gentlemen used to frequent the table, among whom was
one who lost &pound;125.
</p>
<p>Clarke asked the witness if he thought the person who lost his
money was rich?  And being answered in the affirmative, it was
proposed that he, William Wright, should invite the gentleman to dinner,
to let him have what wine he liked, and to spare no expense to get him
drunk.
</p>
<p>The gentleman was induced to play again, and endeavour to
recover his money.  As he had nothing but large bills, to a considerable
amount, he was prevailed on to go to London, in company with the
witness, who was to take care and bring him back.  One of the firm,
Pollett, wrote a letter of recommendation to a Mr Young, to get the bills
discounted at his broker's.  They returned to Brighton, and the witness
apprized the firm of his arrival.  They wanted him to come that evening,
but the witness <hi rend="italic">*told the gentleman of his suspicions</hi> &mdash; that
during their absence a <hi rend="italic">*false table</hi> had been substituted.
</p>
<p>The witness, however, returned to his employers that evening,
when the firm advanced him

<pb n="148"/>
&pound;100, and Ford, another punter of the sort, &pound;100, to back
with the gentleman as a blind &mdash; so that when the signal was given to put
upon black or red, they were to put their stakes &mdash; by which means the
gentleman would follow; and they calculated upon fleecing him of five or
six thousand pounds in the course of an hour.  According to his own
account, the witness told the gentleman of this trick; and the following
morning the latter went with him, to know if this nefarious dealing has
been truly represented.
</p>
<p>On entering the library they met Walker, who wished them better
success, but trembled visibly.  At the door leading into the room porters
were stationed; and, as soon as they entered, Walker ordered it to be
bolted, for the sake of privacy; but as soon as the gentleman ascended
the dark staircase, he became alarmed at the appearance of men in the
room, and returned to the porter, and, by a timely excuse, was allowed
to pass.
</p>
<p>At this table Clarke generally dealt, and O'Mara played.  It was
for not restoring the &pound;100 to the firm that the charge of felony
was laid against the witness &mdash; after the escape of the gentleman; but an
offer of &pound;100 was made to him, after

<pb n="149"/>
his imprisonment, if he would not give his evidence of the above facts
and transactions.
</p>
<p>The evidence of the other witness, Ford, confirmed all the material
facts of the former, and the gentleman himself, the intended victim,
substantiated the evidence of Wright &mdash; as to putting him in possession of
their nefarious designs.
</p>
<p>When the gentleman found that he had been cheated of the
&pound;125, he went to Walker to demand back his money.  Walker, in
the utmost confusion, went into the room, and returned with a proposal
to allow &pound;100.  This he declined to take, and immediately laid the
information before Mr Sergeant Runnington.
</p>
<p>The learned Sergeant forcibly recapitulated the evidence, and
declared that in the whole course of his professional duties he had never
heard such a disclosure of profligacy and villainy, combined with every
species of wickedness.  In a strain of pointed animadversion he declared
it to be an imperative duty, &mdash; however much his private feelings might
be wounded in seeing a reputable tradesman of the town convicted of
such nefarious pursuits, &mdash; to order warrants to be issued against all
parties concerned as rogues and vagrants.


<pb n="150"/>

</p>
<p>At the next hearing of the case the court was crowded to excess;
and the mass of evidence deposed before the magistrates threw such a
light on the system of gambling, that they summarily put a stop to the
Cobourg and Loo tables at the various public establishments.
</p>
<p>At the first examination, the `gentleman' before mentioned, a Mr
Mackenzie, said he had played <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi> at Walker's,
and had lost &pound;125.  He saw O'Mara there, but he appeared as a
player, not a banker; the only reason for considering him as one of the
proprietors of the table, arose from the information of the witnesses
Wright and Ford.
</p>
<p>On this evidence, Mr Sergeant Runnington called on O'Mara and
Walker for their defence, observing that, according to the statements
before him, there appeared sufficient ground for considering O'Mara as
a rogue and vagabond; and for subjecting Mr Walker to penalties for
keeping a house or room wherein he permitted unlawful games to be
played.  O'Mara affirmed that the whole testimony of Wright and Ford
with respect to him was false; that he had been nine years a resident
housekeeper in Brighton, and was known by, and had rendered

<pb n="151"/>
essential services to, many respectable individuals who lived in the town,
and to many noble persons who were occasional visitors.  He seemed
deeply penetrated by the intimation that he could be whipped, or
otherwise treated as a vagabond; and said, that if time were allowed him
to collect evidence, and obtain legal assistance, he could disprove the
charge, or at least invalidate the evidence of the two accusers.
</p>
<p>In consequence of these representations, the case was adjourned to
another day, when, so much was the expectation excited by the rumour
of the affair, that at the opening of the court the hall was crowded almost
to suffocation, and all the avenues were completely beset.
</p>
<p>O'Mara appeared, with his counsel, the celebrated Mr Adolphus &mdash;
the Ballantyne of his day &mdash; of Old Bailey renown and forensic prowess.
</p>
<p>Mr Sergeant Runnington very obligingly stated to Mr Adolphus the
previous proceeding, directed the depositions to be laid before him, and
allowed him time to peruse them.  Mr Adolphus having gone through the
document, requested that the witnesses might be brought into court, that
he might cross-question them separately; which being

<pb n="152"/>
ordered, Wright was first put forward &mdash; the man who had received the
&pound;100, enlightened the Mr Mackenzie, and who was charged with
feloniously stealing the above amount.
</p>
<p>After the usual questions, very immaterial in the present case, but
answered, the witness went on to say that, O'Mara called at his lodgings
and said, if he (Wright) could not persuade Mr Mackenzie to come from
London, he was not to leave him, but write to him (O'Mara), and he
would go to town, and win all his money.  He had, on a former
occasion, told the witness, that he could win all Mackenzie's money at
child's play &mdash; that he could toss up and win ninety times out of one
hundred; he had told both him and Ford, that if they met with any
gentleman who did not like the game of <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi>, and
would bring them to his house, he was always provided with cards, dice,
and backgammon tables, to win their money from them.
</p>
<p>The learned counsel then cross-questioned the witness as to various
matters, in the usual way, but tending, of course, to damage him by the
answers which the questions necessitated &mdash; a horrible, but, perhaps,
necessary ordeal perpetuated in our law-procedure.  In these answers
there was something

<pb n="153"/>
like prevarication; so that the magistrate, Mr Sergeant Runnington, asked
the witness at the close of the examination, whether he had any previous
acquaintance with the gentlemen who had engaged him at half-a-crown a
game, and then so candily communicated to him all their schemes?  He
said, none whatever.  `But,' said the Sergeant, `you were in the daily
habit of playing at this public table for the purpose of deceiving the
persons who might come there?'  The witness answered &mdash; `I was.'
</p>
<p>The witness Ford fared no better in the cross-examination, and Mr
Sergeant Runnington, at its close, asked him the same question that he
had addressed to Wright, respecting his playing at the table, and received
the same answer.
</p>
<p>Mr Mackenzie did not appear, and there was no further evidence.
Mr Adolphus said that if he were called upon to make any defence for
his client upon a charge so supported, he was ready to do it; but, as he
must make many observations, not only on the facts, but on the
<hi rend="italic">*law</hi>, he was anxious if possible to avoid doing so, as he did
not wish to say too much about the law respecting gaming before so
large and mixed an audience.[72]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="72"><p>[72] See Chapter XI. for the views of Mr
Adolphus here alluded to.</p></note>

<pb n="154"/>

<p>Two witnesses were called, who gave evidence which was
damaging to the character of Ford, stating that he told them he was in a
conspiracy against O'Mara and some other moneyed men, from whom
they should get three or four hundred pounds, and if witness would
conceal from O'Mara his (Ford's) real name, he should have his share of
the money, and might go with him and Wright to Brussels.
</p>
<p>After hearing these witnesses, Mr Sergeant Runnington, without
calling on Mr Adolphus for any further defence of his client, pronounced
the judgment of the Bench.
</p>
<p>He reviewed the transaction from its commencement, and stated
the impression, to the disadvantage of O'Mara, which the tale originally
told by the two witnesses was calculated to make.  But, on hearing the
cross-examination of those witnesses, and seeing no evidence against the
defendant but from sources so impure and corrupt &mdash; recollecting the
severe penalties of the Vagrant Acts, and sitting there not merely as a
judge, but also exercising the functions of a jury, he could not bring
himself to convict on such evidence.  The witnesses, impure as they
were, were <hi rend="italic">*not supported by Mr

<pb n="155"/>
Mackenize in any particular</hi>, except the fact of his losing money,
at a time when O'Mara did not appear as a proprietor of the table, but as
a player like himself.  O'Mara must therefore be discharged; but the two
witnesses would not be so fortunate.  From their own mouths it appeared
that they had been using subtle craft to deceive and impose upon his
Majesty's subjects, by playing or betting at unlawful games, and had no
legal or visible means of gaining a livelihood; the court, therefore,
adjudged them to be rogues and vagabonds, and committed them, in
execution, to the gaol at Lewes, there to remain till the next Quarter
Sessions, and then to be further dealt with according to law.  A short
private conference followed between the magistrates and Mr Adolphus,
the result of which was that Mr Walker was not proceeded against, but
entered into a recognizance not to permit any kind of gaming to be
carried on in his house.</p></div1>

CHAPTER VIII.
<lb/>
GAMBLING AT THE GERMAN BATHING-PLACES.</head>

<div2 type="section" n="1" id="d15"><head>
BADEN AND ITS CONVERSATION HOUSE.</head>


<p>BADEN-BADEN in the season is full of the most exciting
contrasts &mdash; gay restaurants and brilliant saloons, gaming-tables,
promenades, and theatres crammed with beauty and rank, in the midst of
lovely natural scenery, and under the shade of the pine-clad heights of
the Hercynian or Black Forest &mdash; the scene of so many weird tales of old
Germany &mdash; as for instance of the charming <hi rend="italic">Undine</hi> of De la
Mothe Fouqu&eacute;.
</p>
<p>But among the seducing attractions of Baden-Baden, and of all
German bathing-places, the Rouge-et-noir and Roulette-table hold a
melancholy pre-eminence, &mdash; being at once a shameful source of revenue
to the prince, &mdash; a rallying point for the gay,

<pb n="157"/>
the beautiful, the professional blackleg, the incognito duke or king, &mdash;
and a vortex in which the student, the merchant, and the subaltern officer
are, in the course of the season, often hopelessly and irrevocably
ingulfed.  Remembering the gaming excitement of the primitive
Germans, we can scarcely be surprised to find that the descendants of
these northern races poison the pure stream of pleasure by the
introduction of this hateful occupation.  It is, however, rather remarkable
that all foreign visitors, whether Dutch, Flemish, Swede, Italian, or even
English, of whatever age or disposition or sex, `catch the frenzy' during
the (falsely so-called) <hi rend="italic">Kurzeit</hi>, that is, <hi rend="italic">Cure-season</hi>, at Baden, Ems, and Aix.
</p>
<p>Princes and their subjects, fathers and sons, and even, horrible to
say, mothers and daughters, are hanging, side by side, for half the night
over the green table; and, with trembling hands and anxious eyes,
watching their chance-cards, or thrusting francs and Napoleons with their
rakes to the red or the black cloth.
</p>
<p>No spot in the whole world draws together a more distinguished
society than may be met at Baden; its attractions are felt and
acknowledged by

<pb n="158"/>
every country in Europe.  Many of the <hi rend="italic">&eacute;lite</hi> of each
nation may yearly be found there during the months of summer, and, as
a natural consequence, many of the worst and vilest follow them, in the
hope of pillage.
</p>
<p>Says Mrs Trollope: &mdash; `I doubt if anything less than the evidence of
the senses can enable any one fully to credit and comprehend the
spectacle that a gaming-table offers.  I saw women distinguished by
rank, elegant in person, modest, and even reserved in manner, sitting at
the Rouge-et-noir table with their r&acirc;teaux, or rakes, and marking-cards in their hands; &mdash; the former to push forth their bets, and draw in
their winnings, the latter to prick down the events of the game.  I saw
such at different hours through the whole of Sunday.  To name these is
impossible; but I grieve to say that two English women were among
them.'
</p>
<p>The Conversationshaus, where the gambling takes place, is let out
by the Government of Baden to a company of speculators, who pay, for
the exclusive privilege of keeping the tables, &pound;11,000 annually,
and agree to spend in addition 250,000 florins (&pound;25,000) on the
walks and buildings, making altogether about &pound;36,000.  Some
idea may

<pb n="159"/>
be formed from this of the vast sums of money which must be yearly
lost by the dupes who frequent it.  The whole is under the direction of
M. Benazet, who formerly farmed the gambling houses of Paris.

<p>`How shall I describe,' says Mr Whitelocke, `to my readers in
language sufficiently graphic, one of the resorts the most celebrated in
Europe; a place, if not competing with Crockford's in gorgeous
magnificence and display, at least surpassing it in renown, and known
over a wider sphere?  The metropolitan pump-room of Europe,
conducted on the principle of gratuitous admittance to all bearing

<pb n="160"/>
the semblance of gentility and conducting themselves with propriety,
opens its Janus doors to all the world with the most laudable hospitality
and with a perfect indifference to exclusiveness, requiring only the hat to
be taken off upon entering, and rejecting only short jackets, cigar, pipe,
and meerschaum.  A room of this description, a temple dedicated to
fashion, fortune, and flirtation, requires a pen more current, a voice
more eloquent, than mine to trace, condense, vivify, and
depict.<hi rend="super">* * *</hi> Taking everything, therefore, for granted,
let us suppose a vast saloon of regular proportions, rather longer than
broad, at either end garnished by a balcony; beneath, doors to the right
and left, and opposite to the main entrance, conduct to other apartments,
dedicated to different purposes.  On entering the eye is at once dazzled
by the blaze of lights from chandeliers of magnificent dimensions, of
lamps, lustres, and sconces.  The ceiling and borders set off into
compartments, showered over with arabesques, the gilded pillars, the
moving mass of promenaders, the endless labyrinth of human beings
assembled from every region in Europe, the costly dresses, repeated by a
host of mirrors, all this combined, which the eye conveys

<pb n="161"/>
to the brain at a single glance, utterly fails in description.  As with the
eye, so it is with the ear; at every step a new language falls upon it, and
every tongue with different intonation, for the high and the low, the
prince, peer, vassal, and tradesman, the proud beauty, the decrepit
crone, some fresh budding into the world, some standing near the grave,
the gentle and the stern, the sombre and the gay, in short, every possible
antithesis that the eye, ear, heart can perceive, hear, or respond to, or
that the mind itself can imagine, is here to be met with in two minutes.
And yet all this is no Babel; for all, though concentrated, is admirably
void of confusion; and evil or strong passions, if they do exist, are
religiously suppressed &mdash; a necessary consequence, indeed, where there
can be no sympathy, and where contempt and ridicule would be the sole
reciprocity.  In case, however, any such display should take place, a
gendarme keeps constant watch at the door, appointed by government, it
is true, but resembling our Bow-street officers in more respects than one.
</p>
<p>`Now that we have taken a survey of the brilliant and moving
throng, let us approach the stationary crowd to the left hand, and see
what it

<pb n="162"/>
is that so fascinates and rivets their attention.  They are looking upon a
long table covered with green cloth, in the centre of which is a large
polished wooden basin with a moveable rim, and around it are small
compartments, numbered to a certain extent, namely 38, alternately red
and black in irregular order, numbered from one to 36, a nought or zero
in a red, and a double zero upon the black, making up the 38, and each
capable of holding a marble.  The moveable rim is set in motion by the
hand, and as it revolves horizontally from east to west round its axis, the
marble is caused by a jerk of the finger and thumb to fly off in a
contrary movement.  The public therefore conclude that no calculation
can foretell where the marble will fall, and I believe they are right, in-asmuch as the bank plays a certain and sure game, however deep, runs
no risk of loss, and consequently has no necessity for superfluously
cheating or deluding the public.  It also plays double, that is, on both
sides of the wheel of fortune at once.
</p>
<p>`When the whirling of both rim and marble cease, the latter falls,
either simultaneously or after some coy uncertainty, into one of the com-partments, and the number and colour, &amp;c., are

<pb n="163"/>
immediately proclaimed, the stakes deposited are dexterously raked up
by the croupier, or increased by payment from the bank, according as
the colour wins or loses.  Now, the two sides or tables are merely
duplicates of one another, and each of them is divided something like a
chess-board into three columns of squares, which amount to 36; the
numbers advance arithmetically from right to left, and consequently there
are 12 lines down, so as to complete the rectangle; as one, therefore,
stands at the head, four stands immediately under it, and so on.  At the
bottom lie three squares, with the French marks 12 p &mdash; 12 m &mdash; 12 d,
that is, first, middle, third dozen.  The three large meadows on either
side are for red and black, pair and odd, miss and pass &mdash; which last
signify the division of the numbers into the first and second half, from 1
to 18, and from 19 to 36, inclusive.  If a number be staked upon and
wins, the stake is increased to six times its amount, and so on, always
less as the stake is placed in different positions, which may be effected
in the following ways &mdash; by placing the piece of gold or silver on the line
(<hi rend="italic">&agrave; cheval</hi>, as it is called), partly on one and partly on
its neighbour, two numbers are represented, and should one win,

<pb n="164"/>
the piece is augmented to eighteen times the sum; three numbers are
signified upon the stroke at the end or beginning of the numbers that go
across; six, by placing the coin on the border of a perpendicular and a
horizontal line between two strokes; four, where the lines cross within;
twelve numbers are signified in a two-fold manner, either upon the
column where the figures follow in the order of one, four, seven, and so
on, or on the side-fields mentioned above; these receive the stake
trebled; and those who stake solely upon the colour, the two halves, or
equal and odd, have their stake doubled when they win.  Now, the two
zeros, that is, the simple and compound, stand apart and may be
separately staked upon; should either turn up, the stake is increased in a
far larger proportion.
</p>
<p>`To render the game equal, without counting in the zeros and other
trifles, the winner ought to receive the square of 36, instead of 36.
</p>
<p>`It is a melancholy amusement to any rational being not infatuated
by the blind rage of gold, to witness the incredible excitement so
repeatedly made to take the bank by storm, sometimes by surprise, anon
by stealth, and not rarely by digging a mine, laying intrenchments and
opening a fire of

<pb n="165"/>
field-pieces, heavy ordnance, and flying artillery; but the fortress, proud
and conscious of its superior strength, built on a rock of adamant, laughs
at the fiery attacks of its foes, nay, itself invites the storm.
</p>
<p>`For those classes of mankind who possess a little more prudence,
the game called <hi rend="italic">Trente-et-un</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Quarante</hi>, or
<hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi> are substituted.
</p>
<p>`The lord of the temple or establishment pays, I believe, to
government a yearly sum of 35,000 florins (about &pound;3000) for
permission to keep up the establishment.  He has gone to immense ex-pense in decorating the building; he pays a crowd of croupiers at
different salaries, and officers of his own, who superintend and direct
matters; he lights up the building, and he presides over the festivities of
the town &mdash; in short, he is the patron of it all.  With all this liberality he
himself derives an enormous revenue, an income as sure and determined
as that of my Lord Mayor himself.'[73]

<p>The Baden season begins in May; the official opening takes place
towards the close of the spring quarter, and then the fashionable world
begins to arrive at the rendezvous.


<pb n="166"/>

</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that everything is right well regulated, and
apart from the terrible dangers of gambling, the place does very great
credit to the authorities who thrive on the nefarious traffic.  Perfect
order and decency of deportment, with all the necessary civilities of life,
are rigorously insisted on, and summary expulsion is the consequence of
any intolerable conduct.  If it so happens that any person becomes
obnoxious in any way, whatever may be his or her rank, the first
intimation will be &mdash; `Sir, you are not in your place here;' or, `Madame,
the air of Baden does not suit you.'  If these words are disregarded,
there follows a summary order &mdash; `You must leave Baden this very day,
and cross the frontiers of the Grand Duchy within twenty-four hours.'
</p>
<p>Mr Sala, in his novel `Make your Game,'[74] has given a spirited
description of the gambling scenes at Baden.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="74"><p>[74] Originally published in the `Welcome
Guest.'</p></note>
<p>Whilst I write there is exhibited at the Egyptian Hall, London,
Dor&eacute;'s magnificent picture of the <hi rend="italic">Tapis Vert</hi>, or Life
in Baden-Baden, of which the following is an accurate description: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`The <hi rend="italic">Tapis Vert</hi> is a moral, and at the same

<pb n="167"/>
time an exceedingly clever, satire.  It is illustrative of the life, manners,
and predilections and pursuits of a class of society left hereafter to enjoy
the manifold attractions of fashionable watering-places, without the
scourge that for so many years held its immoral and degrading sway in
their sumptuous halls.
</p>
<p>`In one of these splendid salons the fashionable crowd is eagerly
pressing round an oblong table covered with green cloth (<hi rend="italic">le tapis
vert</hi>), upon which piles of gold and bank-notes tell the tale of
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">noir perd et la couleur gagne</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; and vice
versa.  The principal group, upon which Dor&eacute; has thrown one of
his powerful effects of light, is lifelike, and several of the actors are at
once recognized.  Both croupiers are well-known characters.  There is
much life and movement in the silent scene, in which thousands of
pounds change hands in a few seconds.  To the left of the croupier
(dealer), who turns up the winning card, sits a finely-dressed woman,
who cares for little else but gold.  There is a remarkable expression of
eagerness and curiosity upon the countenance of the lady who comes
next, and who endeavours, with the assistance of her eye-glass, to find
out the state of affairs.  The gentleman next

<pb n="168"/>
to her is an inveterate <hi rend="italic">blas&eacute;</hi>.  The countenance of the
old man reckoning up needs no description.  Near by stands a lady with
a red feather in her hat, and whose lace shawl alone is worth several
hundred pounds &mdash; for Dor&eacute; made it.  The two female figures to
the left are splendidly painted.  The one who causes the other croupier to
turn round seems somewhat extravagantly dressed; but these costumes
have been frequently worn within the last two years both at Baden and
Hombourg.  The old lady at the end of the table, to the left, is a well-known habitu&eacute;e at both places.  The bustling and shuffling
eagerness of the figures in the background is exceedingly well rendered.
</p>
<p>`As a whole, the <hi rend="italic">Tapis Vert</hi> is a very fine illustration
of real life, as met with in most of the leading German watering-places.'[75]

<p>`At the present moment,' says another authority, writing more than
a year ago, `there are three very bold female gamblers at Baden.  One is
the Russian Princess  &mdash;  &mdash; , who plays several hours every day at
<hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi>, and sometimes makes what in our money
would be many hundreds, and at others goes empty away.  She wins
calmly

<pb n="169"/>
enough, but when luck is against her looks anxious.  The second is the
wife of an Italian ex-minister, who is well known both as an authoress
and politician.  She patronizes <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi>, and at every turn of
the wheel her money passes on the board.  She is a good gambler &mdash;
smirking when she wins, and smirking when she loses.  She dresses as
splendidly as any of the dames of Paris.  The other night she excited a
flutter among the ladies assembled in the salons of the
&ldquo;Conversation&amp;&rdquo; by appearing in a robe flaming red with
an exaggerated train which dragged its slow length along the floor.  But
the greatest of the feminine players is the Leonie Leblanc.  When she is
at the <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi> table a larger crowd than usual is
collected to witness her operation.  The stake she generally risks is 6000
francs (&pound;240), which is the maximum allowed.  Her chance is
changing: a few days back she won &pound;4000 in one sitting; some
days later she lost about &pound;2000, and was then reduced to the, for
her, indignity of playing for paltry sums &mdash; &pound;20 or thereabouts.'
</p>
<p>Among the more recent chronicles, the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi> gives
the following account of the close of the campaign of a gaming hero, M.
Edgar de la Charme,

<pb n="170"/>
who, for a number of days together, never left the gaming-room without
carrying off the sum of 24,000 francs.
</p>
<p>`The day before yesterday, M. de la Charme, reflecting that there
must be an end even to the greatest run of luck, locked his portmanteau,
paid his bill, and took the road to the railway station, accompanied by
some of his friends.  On reaching the wicket he found it closed; there
were still three-quarters of an hour to pass before the departure of the
train.  &ldquo;I will go and play my parting game,&amp;&rdquo; he
exclaimed, and, turning to the coachman, bade him drive to the Kursaal.
His friends surrounded him, and held him back; he should not go, he
would lose all his winnings.  But he was resolute, and soon reached the
Casino, where his travelling dress caused a stir of satisfaction among the
croupiers.  He sat down at the <hi rend="italic">Trente-et-quarante</hi>, broke the
bank in 20 minutes, got into his cab again, and seeing the inspector of
the tables walking to and fro under the arcades, he said to him, in a tone
of exquisite politeness, &ldquo;I could not think of going away without
leaving, you my P.P.C.&amp;&rdquo; '</p>

<head>SPA.</head>


<p>`The gambling houses of Spa are in the Redoute, where
<hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi> are carried on nearly
from morning to night.  The profits of these establishments exceed
&pound;40,000 a year.  In former times they belonged to the Bishop of
Liege, who was a partner in the concern, and derived a considerable
revenue from his share of the ill-gotten gains of the manager of the
establishment, and no gambling tables could be set up without his
permission.'[76]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="76"><p>[76] Murray's Handbook for Travellers on the
Continent.</p></note>
<p>`The gambling in Spa is in a lower style than elsewhere.  The
croupiers seem to be always on the look-out for cheating.  You never see
here a pile of gold or bank notes on the table, as at Hombourg or
Wiesbaden, with the player saying, &ldquo;Cinquante louis aux
billet,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;Cent-vingt louis &agrave; la masse,&amp;&rdquo; and
the winnings scrupulously paid, or the losings raked carefully away from
the heap.  They do not allow that at Spa; there is an order against it on
the wall.  They could not trust the people that play, I suppose, and it is
doubtful if the people could trust the croupiers.  The ball spins more

<pb n="172"/>
slowly at <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi> &mdash; the cards are dealt more gingerly at
<hi rend="italic">Trente-et-quarante</hi> here than elsewhere.  Nothing must be
done quickly, lest somebody on one side or other should try to do
somebody else.  Altogether Spa is not a pleasant place to play in, and as,
moreover, the odds are as great against you as at Ems, it is better to
stick to the promenade <hi rend="italic">de sept heures</hi> and the ball-room, and
leave the two tables alone.  Outside it is cheery and full of life.  The
Queen of the Belgians is here, the Duke of Aumale, and other nice
people.  The breeze from the hills is always delicious; the Promenade
Meyerbeer as refreshing on a hot day as a draught of iced water.  But
the denizens, male and female, of the <hi rend="italic">salons de jeu</hi> are often
obnoxious, and one wishes that the old Baden law could be enforced
against some of the gentler sex.
</p>
<p>`By way of warning to any of your readers who propose to visit
the tables this summer, will you let me tell a little anecdote, from
personal experience, of one of these places &mdash; which one I had perhaps
better not say.  I took a place at the Roulette table, and had not staked
more than once or twice, when two handsomely dressed ladies placed
themselves one on either side of me, and commenced

<pb n="173"/>
playing with the smallest coins allowed, wedging me in rather
unpleasantly close between them.  At my third or fourth stake I won on
both the colour and a number, and my neighbour on the right quietly
swept up my coins from the colour the instant they were paid.  I
remonstrated, and she very politely argued the point, ending by restoring
my money.  But during our discussion my far larger stake, paid in the
mean while, on the winning number, had disappeared into the pocket of
my neighbour on the left, who was not so polite, and was very indignant
at my suggestion that the stake was mine.  An appeal to the croupier
only produced a shrug of the shoulders and regret that he had not seen
who staked the money, an offer to stop the play, and a suggestion that I
should find it very difficult to prove it was my stake.  The
&ldquo;plant&amp;&rdquo; between the two women was evident.  The whole
thing was a systematically-planned robbery, and very possibly the
croupier was a confederate.  I detected the two women in communica-tion, and I told them that I should change my place to the other side of
the table where I would trouble them not to come.  They took the hint
very mildly, and could afford to do so, for they had got

<pb n="174"/>
my money.  The affair was very neatly managed, and would succeed in
nearly every case, especially if the croupier is, as is most probable,
always on the side of the ladies.'

HOMBOURG.</head>


<p>`In 1842 Hombourg was an obscure village, consisting of the castle
of the Landgraf, and of a few hundred houses which in the course of
ages had clustered around it.  Few would have known of its existence
except from the fact of its being the capital of the smallest of European
countries.  Its inhabitants lived poor and contented &mdash; the world
forgetting, by the world forgot.  It boasted only of one inn &mdash; the
&ldquo;Aigle&amp;&rdquo; &mdash; which in summer was frequented by a few
German families, who came to live cheaply and to drink the waters of a
neighbouring mineral spring.  That same year two French brothers of the
name of Blanc arrived at Frankfort.  They were men of a speculative
turn, and a recent and somewhat daring speculation in France, connected
with the old semaphore telegraph, had rendered it necessary for them to
withdraw for a time from their native land.  Their stock-in-trade
consisted in a Roulette wheel,

<pb n="175"/>
a few thousand francs, and an old and skilful croupier of Frascati, who
knew a great deal about the properties of cards.  The authorities of the
town of Frankfort, being dull traders, declined to allow them to initiate
their townsmen into the mysteries of cards and Roulette, so hearing that
there were some strangers living at Hombourg, they put themselves into
an old diligence, and the same evening disembarked at the
&ldquo;Aigle.&amp;&rdquo;  The next day the elder brother called upon the
prime minister, an ancient gentleman, who, with a couple of clerks, for
some &pound;60 a year governed the Landgrafate of Hombourg to his
own and the general satisfaction.  After a private interview with this
statesman the elder Blanc returned poorer in money, but with a
permission in his pocket to put up his Roulette wheel in one of the rooms
of the inn.  In a few months the money of the innocent water-drinkers
passed from their pockets into those of the brothers Blanc.  The ancient
man of Frascati turned the wheel, and no matter on what number the
water-drinkers risked their money, that number did not turn up.  At the
close of the summer season a second visit was made to the prime
minister, and the Blancs returned to

<pb n="176"/>
Frankfort with an exclusive concession to establish games of hazard
within the wide spreading dominions of the Landgraf.  For this they had
agreed to build a kursaal, to lay out a public garden, and to pay into the
national exchequer 40,000 florins (a florin is worth one shilling and
eight-pence) per annum.  Having obtained this concession, the next step
was to found a company.  Frankfort abounds in Hebrew speculators,
who are not particular how they make money, and as the speculation
appeared a good one, the money was soon forthcoming.  It was decided
that the nominal capital was to be 400,000 florins, divided into shares of
100 florins each.  Half the shares were subscribed for by the Hebrew
financialists, and the other half was credited to the Blancs as the price of
their concession.  During the winter a small kursaal was built and a
small garden planted; the mineral well was deepened, and flaming
advertisements appeared in all the German newspapers announcing to the
world that the famous waters of Hombourg were able to cure every
disease to which flesh is heir, and that to enable visitors to while away
their evenings agreeably a salon had been opened, in which they would
have an opportunity to win

<pb n="177"/>
fabulous sums by risking their money either at the game of <hi rend="italic">Trente
et Quarante</hi> or at <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi>.  From these small
beginnings arose the &ldquo;company&amp;&rdquo; whose career has been so
notorious.  It has enjoyed uninterrupted good fortune.  During the
twenty-six years that have elapsed since its foundation, a vast palace
dedicated to gambling has been built, the village has become a town,
well paved, and lighted with gas; the neighbouring hills are covered with
villas; about eighty acres have been laid out in pleasure-grounds; roads
have been made in all directions through the surrounding woods; the
visitors are numbered by tens of thousands; there are above twenty hotels
and many hundred excellent lodging-houses.'[77]

<p>`Let those who are disposed to risk their money inquire what is the
character of the managers, and be on their guard.  The expenses of such
an enormous and splendid establishment amount to &pound;10,000, and
the shares have for some years paid a handsome dividend &mdash; the whole of
which must be paid out of the pockets of travellers and visitors.'[78]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="78"><p>[78] Murray, <hi rend="italic">ubi
supr&agrave;</hi>.</p></note>
<p>Mr Sala in his interesting work, already quoted, furnishes the
completest account of Hom

<pb n="178"/>
bourg, its Kursaal, and gambling, which I have condensed as follows: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`In Hombourg the Kursaal is everything, and the town nothing.
The extortionate hotel-keepers, the &ldquo;snub-nosed rogues of counter
and till,&amp;&rdquo; who overcharge you in the shops, make their egregious
profits from the Kursaal.  The major part of the Landgrave's revenue is
derived from the Kursaal; he draws &pound;5000 a year from it.  He
and his house are sold to the Kursaal; and the Board of Directors of the
Kursaal are the real sovereigns and land-graves of Hesse Hombourg.
They have metamorphosed a miserable mid-German townlet into a city
of palaces.  Their stuccoed and frescoed palace is five hundred times
handsomer than the mouldy old Schloss, built by William with the silver
leg.  They have planted the gardens; they have imported the orange-trees; they have laid out the park, and enclosed the hunting-grounds;
they board, lodge, wash, and tax the inhabitants; and I may say, without
the slightest attempt at punning, that the citizens are all
<hi rend="italic">Kursed</hi>.
</p>
<p>`In the Kursaal is the ball or concert-room, at either end of which
is a gallery, supported by pillars of composition marble.  The floors are

<pb n="179"/>
inlaid, and immense mirrors in sumptuous frames hang on the walls.
Vice can see her own image all over the establishment.  The ceiling is
superbly decorated with bas-reliefs in <hi rend="italic">carton-pierr&eacute;</hi>,
like those in Mr Barry's new Covent Garden Theatre; and fresco
paintings, executed by Viotti, of Milan, and Conti, of Munich; whilst the
whole is lighted up by enormous and gorgeous chandeliers.  The apart-ment to the right is called the <hi rend="italic">Salle Japanese</hi>, and is used as a
dining-room for a monster <hi rend="italic">table d'h&ocirc;te</hi>, held twice a
day, and served by the famous Chevet of Paris.
</p>
<p>`There is a huge Caf&eacute; Olympique, for smoking and
imbibing purposes, private cabinets for parties, the monster saloon, and
two smaller ones, where <hi rend="italic">*from eleven in the forenoon to eleven at
night, Sundays not excepted, all the year round</hi>, and year after
year &mdash; (the &ldquo;administration&amp;&rdquo; have yet a
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">jouissance</hi>&amp;&rdquo; of eighty-five years to run out,
guaranteed by the incoming dynasty of Hesse Darmstadt), knaves and
fools, from almost every corner of the world, gamble at the ingenious
and amusing games of <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Rouge et
Noir</hi>, otherwise <hi rend="italic">Trente et Quarante</hi>.
</p>
<p>`There is one table covered with green baize,

<pb n="180"/>
tightly stretched as on a billiard-field.  In the midst of the table there is a
circular pit, coved inwards, but not bottomless, and containing the
Roulette wheel, a revolving disc, turning with an accurate momentum on
a brass pillar, and divided at its outer edge into thirty-seven narrow and
shallow pigeon-hole compartments, coloured alternately red and black,
and numbered &mdash; not consecutively &mdash; up to thirty-six.  The last is a
blank, and stands for <hi rend="italic">Zero</hi>, number <hi rend="italic">Nothing</hi>.
Round the upper edge, too, run a series of little brass hoops, or bridges,
to cause the ball to hop and skip, and not at once into the nearest
compartment.  This is the regimen of Roulette.  The banker sits before
the wheel, &mdash; a croupier, or payer-out of winnings to and raker in of
losses from the players, on either side.  Crying in a voice calmly
sonorous, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Faites le Jeu, Messieurs</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; &mdash;
&ldquo;Make your game, gentlemen!&amp;&rdquo; the banker gives the
wheel a dexterous twirl, and ere it has made one revolution, casts into its
Maelstrom of black and red an ivory ball.  The interval between this and
the ball finding a home is one of breathless anxiety.  Stakes are eagerly
laid; but at a certain period of the revolution the banker calls out &mdash;
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Le Jeu est fait.  Rien ne va plus</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; &mdash;

<pb n="181"/>
and after that intimation it is useless to lay down money.  Then the
banker, in the same calm and impassable voice, declares the result.  It
may run thus: &mdash; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Vingt-neuf, Noir, Impair, et
Passe,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;Twenty-nine, Black, Odd, and Pass the
Rubicon</hi>&amp;&rdquo; (No. 18); or, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Huit, Rouge, Pair, et
Manque</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;Eight, Red, Even, and <hi rend="italic">*not</hi>
Pass the Rubicon.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`Now, on either side of the wheel, and extending to the extremity
of the table, run, in duplicate, the schedule of <hi rend="italic">*mises</hi> or
stakes.  The green baize first offers just thirty-six square compartments,
marked out by yellow threads woven in the fabric itself, and bearing
thirty-six consecutive numbers.  If you place a florin (one and eight-pence) &mdash; and no lower stake is permitted &mdash; or ten florins, or a
Napoleon, or an English five-pound note, or any sum of money not
exceeding the maximum, whose multiple is the highest stake which the
bank, if it loses, can be made to pay, in the midst of compartment 29,
and if the banker, in that calm voice of his, has declared that 29 has
become the resting place of the ball, the croupier will push towards you
with his rake exactly thirty-three times the amount of your stake,
whatever it might have been.  You must bear in mind, however, that the
bank's loss

<pb n="182"/>
on a single stake is limited to eight thousand francs.  Moreover, if you
have placed another sum of money in the compartment inscribed, in
legible yellow colours, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Impair</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; or Odd, you
will receive the equivalent to your stake &mdash; twenty-nine being an odd
number.  If you have placed a coin on <hi rend="italic">Passe</hi>, you will also
receive this additional equivalent to your stake, twenty-nine being
&ldquo;Past the Rubicon,&amp;&rdquo; or middle of the table of numbers &mdash;
18.  Again, if you have ventured your money in a compartment bearing
for device a lozenge in outline, which represents black, and twenty-nine
being a black number, you will again pocket a double stake, that is, one
in addition to your original venture.  More, and more still, &mdash; if you have
risked money on the columns &mdash; that is, betted on the number turning up
corresponding with some number in one of the columns of the tabular
schedule, and have selected the right column &mdash; you have your own stake
and two others; &mdash; if you have betted on either of these three
eventualities, <hi rend="italic">douze premier, douze milieu</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">douze
dernier</hi>, otherwise &ldquo;first dozen,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;middle
dozen,&amp;&rdquo; or &ldquo;last dozen,&amp;&rdquo; as one to twelve, thirteen
to twenty-four, twenty-five to thirty-six, all inclusive, and have chanced
to

<pb n="183"/>
select <hi rend="italic">douze dernier</hi>, the division in which No. 29 occurs,
you also obtain a treble stake, namely, your own and two more which
the bank pays you, your florin or your five-pound note &mdash; benign fact! &mdash;
metamorphosed into three.  But, woe to the wight who should have
ventured on the number &ldquo;eight,&amp;&rdquo; on the red colour
(compartment with a crimson lozenge), on &ldquo;even,&amp;&rdquo; and on
&ldquo;not past the Rubicon;&amp;&rdquo; for twenty-nine does not comply
with any one of these conditions.  He loses, and his money is coolly
swept away from him by the croupier's rake.  With reference to the last
chances I enumerated in the last paragraph, I should mention that the
number <hi rend="italic">*eight</hi> would lie in the second column &mdash; there being
three columns, &mdash; and in the first dozen numbers.
</p>
<p>`There are more chances, or rather subdivisions of chances, to
entice the player to back the &ldquo;numbers;&amp;&rdquo; for these the
stations of the ball are as capricious as womankind; and it is, of course,
extremely rare that a player will fix upon the particular number that
happens to turn up.  But he may place a piece of money <hi rend="italic">&agrave;
cheval</hi>, or astride, on the line which divides two numbers, in
which case (either of the numbers turning up) he receives

<pb n="184"/>
sixteen times his stake.  He may place it on the cross lines that divide
four numbers, and, if either of the four wins, he will receive eight times
the amount of his stake.  A word as to <hi rend="italic">Zero</hi>.  Zero is
designated by the compartment close to the wheel's diameter, and zero,
or blank, will turn up, on an average, about once in seventy times.  If
you have placed money in zero, and the ball seeks that haven, you will
receive thirty-three times your stake.'
</p>
<p>The twin or elder brother of <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi>, played at
Hombourg, <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Trente et
Quarante</hi>, is thus described by Mr Sala: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`There is the ordinary green-cloth covered table, with its brilliant
down-coming lights.  In the centre sits the banker, gold and silver in
piles and <hi rend="italic">rouleaux</hi>, and bank-notes before him.  On either
hand, the croupier, as before, now wielding the rakes and plying them to
bring in the money, now balancing them, now shouldering them, as
soldiers do their muskets, half-pay officers their canes, and dandies their
silk umbrellas.  The banker's cards are, as throughout all the Rhenish
gaming-places, of French design; the same that were invented, or, at
least, first used in Europe, for crazy Charles

<pb n="185"/>
the Simple.  These cards are placed on an inclined plane of marble,
called a <hi rend="italic">talon</hi>.
</p>
<p>`The dealer first takes six packs of cards, shuffles them, and
distributes them in various parcels to the various punters or players
round the table, to shuffle and mix.  He then finally shuffles them, and
takes and places the end cards into various parts of the three hundred and
twelve cards, until he meets with a <hi rend="italic">court card</hi>, which he
must place upright at the end.  This done, he presents the pack to one of
the players to cut, who places the pictured card where the
<hi rend="italic">dealer</hi> separates the pack, and that part of the pack beyond
the pictured card he places at the end nearest him, leaving the pictured
card at the bottom of the pack.
</p>
<p>`The dealer then takes a certain number of cards, about as many as
would form a pack, and, looking at the first card, to know its colour,
puts it on the table with its face downwards.  He then takes two cards,
one red and the other black, and sets them back to back.  These cards
are turned, and displayed conspicuously, as often as the colour varies,
for the information of the company.
</p>
<p>`The gamblers having staked their money on either of the colours,
the dealer asks, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Votre jeu

<pb n="186"/>
est-il fait?</hi>&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;Is your game made?&amp;&rdquo; or,
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Votre jeu est-il pi&ecirc;t?</hi>&amp;&rdquo;  &ldquo;Is your
game ready?&amp;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Le jeu est pr&ecirc;t,
Messieurs</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;The game is ready, gentle-men.&amp;&rdquo;  He then deals the first card with its face upwards, saying
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Noir;</hi>' and continues dealing until the cards turned
exceed thirty points or pips in number, which number he must mention,
as &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Trente-et-un</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; or &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Trente-six</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; as the case may be.
</p>
<p>`As the aces reckon but for one, no card after thirty can make up
forty; the dealer, therefore, does not declare the <hi rend="italic">tens</hi> after
<hi rend="italic">thirty-one</hi>, or upwards, but merely the units, as one, two,
three; if the number of points dealt for <hi rend="italic">Noir</hi> are thirty-five he
says &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Cinq</hi>.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`Another parcel is then dealt for <hi rend="italic">rouge</hi>, or
<hi rend="italic">red</hi>, and with equal deliberation and solemnity; and if the
players stake beyond the colour that comes to <hi rend="italic">thirty-one</hi> or
nearest to it, he wins, which happy eventuality is announced by the
dealer crying &mdash; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Rouge gagne</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;Red
wins,&amp;&rdquo; or &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Rouge perd</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;Red
loses.&amp;&rdquo;  These two parcels, one for each colour, make a
<hi rend="italic">coup</hi>.  The same number of parcels being dealt for each
colour, the dealer says, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Apr&egrave;s</hi>,&amp;&rdquo;
&ldquo;After.&amp;&rdquo;  This is a &ldquo;doublet,&amp;&rdquo; called in the
amiable French tongue, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">un refait</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; by which
neither

<pb n="187"/>
party wins, unless both colours come to <hi rend="italic">thirty-one</hi>, which the
dealer announces by saying, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Un refait Trente-et-un</hi>,
and he wins half the stakes posted on both colours.  He, however, does
not take the money, but removes it to the middle line, and the players
may change the <hi rend="italic">venue</hi> of their stakes if they please.  This is
called the first &ldquo;prison,&amp;&rdquo; or <hi rend="italic">la premi&egrave;re
prison</hi>, and, if they win their next event, they draw the entire
stake.  In case of another &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">refait</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; the money
is removed into the third line, which is called the second prison.  So you
see that there are wheels within wheels, and Lord Chancellor King's
dictum, that walls can be built higher, but there should be no prison
within a prison, is sometimes reversed.  When this happens the dealer
wins all.
</p>
<p>`The cards are sometimes cut for which colour shall be dealt first;
but, in general, the first parcel is for <hi rend="italic">black</hi>, and the second
for <hi rend="italic">red</hi>.  The odds against a
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">refait</hi>&amp;&rdquo; turning up are usually reckoned as 63
to 1.  The bankers, however, acknowledge that they expect it twice in
three deals, and there are generally from twenty-nine to thirty-two coups
in each deal.  The odds in favour of winning several times are about the
same as

<pb n="188"/>
in the game of Pharaon, and are as delusive.  `He who goes to
Hombourg and expects to see any melodramatic manifestation of rage,
disappointment, and despair in the losing players, reckons without his
host.  Winners or losers seldom speak above a whisper; and the only
sound that is heard above the suppressed buzz of conversation, the
muffled jingle of the money on the green cloth, the
&ldquo;sweep&amp;&rdquo; of the croupiers' rakes, and the ticking of the
very ornate French clocks on the mantel-pieces, is the impassibly me-tallic voice of the banker, as he proclaims his &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Rouge
perd</hi>,&amp;&rdquo; or &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Couleur gagne</hi>.&amp;&rdquo;
People are too genteel at Hombourg-von-der-H&ouml;he to scream, to
yell, to fall into fainting fits, or go into convulsions, because they have
lost four or five thousand francs or so in a single coup.
</p>
<p>`I have heard of one gentleman, indeed, who, after a ruinous loss,
put a pistol to his head, and discharging it, spattered his brains over the
Roulette wheel.  It was said that the banker, looking up calmly, called
out &mdash; `<hi rend="italic">Triple Zero,' `Treble Nothing</hi>,' &mdash; a case as yet
unheard of in the tactics of Roulette, but signifying annihilation, &mdash; and
that, a cloth being thrown over the ensanguined wheel, the

<pb n="189"/>
bank of that particular table was declared to be closed for the day.  Very
probably the whole story is but a newspaper <hi rend="italic">canard</hi>, devised
by the proprietors of some rival gaming establishment, who would have
been delighted to see the fashionable Hombourg under a cloud.
</p>
<p>`When people want to commit suicide at Hombourg, they do it
genteelly; early in the morning, or late at night, in the solitude of their
own apartments at the hotels.  It would be reckoned a gross breach of
good manners to scandalize the refined and liberal administration of the
Kursaal by undisguised <hi rend="italic">felo-de-se</hi>.  The devil on two
<hi rend="italic">croupes</hi> at Hombourg is the very genteelest of demons
imaginable.  He ties his tail up with cherry-coloured ribbon, and
conceals his cloven foot in a patent-leather boot.  All this gentility and
varnish, and elegant veneering of the sulphurous pit, takes away from
him, if it does not wholly extinguish, the honour and loathing for a
common gaming-house, with which the mind of a well-nurtured English
youth has been sedulously imbued by his parents and guardians.  He has
very probably witnessed the performance of the
&ldquo;Gamester&amp;&rdquo; at the theatre, and been a spectator of the
remorseful

<pb n="190"/>
agonies of Mr Beverly, the virtuous sorrows of Mrs B., and the dark
villanies of Messieurs Dawson and Bates.
</p>
<p>`The first visit of the British youth to the Kursaal is usually paid
with fear and trembling.  He is with difficulty persuaded to enter the
accursed place.  When introduced to the saloons &mdash; delusively called
<hi rend="italic">de conversation</hi>, he begins by staring fixedly at the
chandeliers, the ormolu clocks, and the rich draperies, and resolutely
averts his eyes from the serried ranks of punters or players, and the
Pactolus, whose sands are circulating on the green cloth on the table.
Then he thinks there is no very great harm in looking on, and so peeps
over the shoulder of a moustached gamester, who perhaps whispers to
him in the interval between two coups, that if a man will only play
carefully, and be content with moderate gains, he may win sufficient &mdash;
taking the good days and the evil days in a lump &mdash; to keep him in a
decent kind of affluence all the year round.  Indeed, I once knew a
croupier &mdash; we used to call him Napoleon, from the way he took snuff
from his waistcoat pocket, who was in the way of expressing a grave
conviction that it was possible to make a capital

<pb n="191"/>
living at Roulette, so long as you stuck to the colours, and avoided the
Scylla of the numbers and the Charybdis of the Zero.  By degrees, then,
the shyness of the neophyte wears off.  Perhaps in the course of his
descent of Avernus, a revulsion of feeling takes place, and, horror-struck
and ashamed, he rushes out of the Kursaal, determined to enter its
portals no more.  Then he temporizes; remembers that there is a capital
reading-room, provided with all the newspapers and periodicals of
civilized Europe, attached to the Kursaalian premises.  There can be no
harm, he thinks, in glancing over &ldquo;Galignani&amp;&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;Charivari,&amp;&rdquo; although under the same roof as the abhorred
<hi rend="italic">Trente et Quarante;</hi> but, alas! he finds <hi rend="italic">Galignani</hi>
engaged by an acrid old lady of morose countenance, who has lost all
her money by lunch-time, and is determined to &ldquo;take it out in
reading,&amp;&rdquo; and the <hi rend="italic">Charivari</hi> slightly clenched in one
hand by the deaf old gentleman with the dingy ribbon of the Legion of
Honour, and the curly brown wig pushed up over one ear, who always
goes to sleep on the soft and luxurious velvet couches of the Kursaal
reading-room, from eleven till three, every day, Sundays not excepted.
The disappointed student of home or foreign news wanders

<pb n="192"/>
back to one of the apartments where play is going,
on.<hi rend="super">* * * *</hi>  In fact, he does not know what to do with
himself until table-d'h&ocirc;te time.  You know what the moral bard,
Dr Watts says: &mdash; </p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>&ldquo;Satan finds some mischief still,
 </l>
<l>For idle hands to do.&amp;&rdquo;</l></lg>
<p>The unfledged gamester watches the play more narrowly.  A stout lady
in a maroon velvet mantle, and a man with a bald head, a black patch on
his occiput, and gold spectacles, obligingly makes way for him.  He
finds himself pressed against the very edge of the table.  Perhaps a
chair &mdash; one of those delightfully comfortable Kursaal chairs &mdash; is vacant.
He is tired with doing nothing, and sinks into the emolliently-cushioned
<hi rend="italic">fauteuil</hi>.  He fancies that he has caught the eye of the banker,
or one of the gentlemen of the <hi rend="italic">croupe</hi>, and that they are
meekly inviting him to try his luck.  &ldquo;Well, there can't be much
harm in risking a florin,&amp;&rdquo; he murmurs.  He stakes his silver-piece
on a number or a colour.  He wins, we will say, twice or thrice.
Perhaps he quadruples his stake, nay, perchance, hits on the lucky
number.  It turns up, and he receives thirty-five times the amount of his
<hi rend="italic">mise</hi>.  Thenceforth it

<pb n="193"/>
is all over with that ingenuous British youth.  The Demon of Play has
him for his own, and he may go on playing and playing until he has lost
every florin of his own, or as many of those belonging to other people as
he can beg or borrow.  Far more fortunate for him would it be in the
long run, if he met in the outset with a good swinging loss.  The burnt
child <hi rend="italic">*does</hi> dread the fire as a rule; but there is this caprici-ous, almost preternatural, feature of the physiology of gaming, that the
young and inexperienced generally win in the first instance.  They are
drawn on and on, and in and in.  They begin to lose, and continue to
lose, and by the time they have cut their wise teeth they have neither sou
nor silver to make their dearly-bought wisdom available.
</p>
<p>`At least one-half of the company may be assumed to be arrant
rascals &mdash; rascals male and rascals female &mdash; <hi rend="italic">chevaliers
d'industrie</hi>, the offscourings of all the shut-up gambling-houses in
Europe, demireps and <hi rend="italic">lorettes</hi>, single and married women
innumerable.'
</p>
<p>In the course of the three visits he has paid to Hombourg, Mr Sala
has observed that `nine-tenths of the English visitors to the Kursaal,
play;' and he does not hesitate to say that the moths who

<pb n="194"/>
flutter round the garish lamps at the Kursaal Van der H&ouml;he, and
its kindred Hades, almost invariably singe their wings; and that the
chaseer at <hi rend="italic">Roulette</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rouge</hi>, generally turn out
edged tools, with which those incautious enough to play with them are
apt to cut their fingers, sometimes very dangerously.
</p>
<p>The season of 1869 in Hombourg is thus depicted in a high class
newspaper.
</p>
<p>`Never within the memory of the oldest inhabitant (who in this
instance must undoubtedly be that veteran player Countess Kisselef) has
the town witnessed such an influx of tourists of every class and
description.  Hotels and lodging-houses are filled to overflowing.  Every
day imprudent travellers who have neglected the precaution of securing
rooms before their arrival return disconsolately to Frankfort to await the
vacation of some apartment which a condescending landlord has
promised them after much negotiation for the week after next.  The
morning promenade is a wonderful sight; such a host of bilious faces,
such an endless variety of eccentric costumes, such a Babel of tongues,
among which the shrill twang of our fair American cousins is peculiarly
prominent,

<pb n="195"/>
could be found in no other place in the civilized world.  A moralist
would assuredly find here abundant food for reflection on the wonderful
powers of self-deception possessed by mankind.  We all get up at most
inconvenient hours, swallow a certain quantity of a most nauseous fluid,
and then, having sacrificed so much to appearances, soothe our
consciences with the unfounded belief that a love of early rising and salt
water was our real reason for coming here, and that the gambling tables
had nothing whatever to do with it.  Perhaps, in some few instances, this
view may be the correct one; some few invalids, say one in a hundred,
may have sought Hombourg solely in the interest of an impaired
digestion, but I fear that such cases are few and far between; and, as a
friend afflicted with a mania for misquotation remarked to me the other
day, even &ldquo;those who come to drink remain to play.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`Certainly the demon of Rouge et Noir has never held more
undisputed sway in Hombourg than in the present season; never have the
tables groaned under such a load of notes and rouleaux.  It would seem
as if the gamblers, having only two or more years left in which to
complete their ruin, were

<pb n="196"/>
hurrying on with redoubled speed to that desirable consummation, and
where a stake of 12,000 francs is allowed on a single coup the pace can
be made very rapid indeed.  High play is so common that unless you are
lucky enough to win or rich enough to lose a hundred thousand francs at
least, you need not hope to excite either envy or commiseration.  One
persevering Muscovite, who has been punting steadily for six weeks, has
actually succeeded in getting rid of a million of florins.  As yet there
have been no suicides to record, owing probably to the precautionary
measures adopted by a paternal Administration.  As soon as a gambler is
known to be utterly cleared out he at once receives a visit from one of
M. Blanc's officials, who offers him a small sum on condition he will
leave the town forthwith; which viaticum, however, for fear of accidents,
is only handed to him when fairly seated in the train that bears him
away, to blow out his brains, should he feel so inclined, elsewhere.  One
of the most unpleasant facts connected with the gambling is the ardour
displayed by many ladies in this very unfeminine pursuit: last night out
of twenty-five persons seated at the Roulette table I counted no fewer
than fifteen ladies, in

<pb n="197"/>
cluding an American lady with her two daughters!
</p>
<p>`The King of Prussia has arrived, and, with due deference to the
official editors who have described in glowing paragraphs the popular
demonstrations in his honour, I am bound to assert that he was received
with very modified tokens of delight.  There was not even a repetition of
the triumphal arch of last year; those funereal black and white flags,
whose sole aspect is enough to repress any exuberance of rejoicing, were
certainly flapping against the hotel windows and the official flagstaffs,
but little else testified to the joy of the Hombourgers at beholding their
Sovereign.  They manage these things better in France.  Any French
<hi rend="italic">pr&eacute;fet</hi> would give the German authorities a few useful
hints concerning the cheap and speedy manufacture of loyal enthusiasm.
The foreigners, however, seem determined to atone amply for any lack
of proper feeling on the part of the townspeople.  They crowd round his
Majesty as soon as he appears in the rooms or gardens, and mob the
poor old gentleman with a vigour which taxes all the energies of his
aides-de-camp to save their Royal master from death by suffocation.
Need I

<pb n="198"/>
add that our old friend the irrepressible &ldquo;'Arry&amp;&rdquo; is ever
foremost in these gentlemanlike demonstrations?
</p>
<p>`Of course the town swarms with well-known English faces;
indeed, the Peers and M.P.s here at present would form a very
respectable party in the two Houses.  We are especially well off for
dukes; the <hi rend="italic">Fremdenliste</hi> notifies the presence of no fewer
than five of those exalted personages.  A far less respectable class of
London society is also, I am sorry to say, strongly represented:  I allude
to those gentlemen of the light-fingered persuasion whom the outer world
rudely designate as pickpockets.  This morning two gorgeously arrayed
members of the fraternity were marched down to the station by the
police, each being decorated with a pair of bright steel handcuffs;
seventeen of them were arrested last week in Frankfort at one fell
swoop, and at the tables the row of lookers-on who always surround the
players consists in about equal proportions of these gentry and their
natural enemies &mdash; the detectives.  Their booty since the beginning of the
season must be reckoned by thousands.  Mustapha Fazyl Pasha had his
pocket picked of a purse containing &pound;600, and a Russian

<pb n="199"/>
lady was lately robbed of a splendid diamond brooch valued at 75,000
francs.[79]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="79"><p>[79] Pall Mall Gazette, Aug. 1869.</p></note>
<p>But the days of the Kursaal are numbered, and the glories or
infamies of Hombourg are doomed.
</p>
<p>`The fiat has gone forth.  In five years[80] from this time the
&ldquo;game will be made&amp;&rdquo; no longer &mdash; the great gambling
establishment of Hombourg will be a thing of the past.  The town will be
obliged to contend on equal terms with other watering-places for its
share of the wool on the backs of summer excursionists.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="80"><p>[80] In 1872.</p></note>
<p>`As most of the townspeople are shareholders in this thriving
concern, and as all of them gain either directly or indirectly by the play,
it was amusing to watch the anxiety of these worthies during the war
between Austria and Prussia.  Patriotism they had none; they cared
neither for Austrian nor Prussian, for a great Germany nor for a small
Germany.  The &ldquo;company&amp;&rdquo; was their god and their
country.  All that concerned them was to know whether the play was
likely to be suppressed.  When they were annexed to Prussia, at first
they could not believe that Count Bismarck, whatever he might do with
kings, would venture

<pb n="200"/>
to interfere with the &ldquo;bank.&amp;&rdquo;  It was to them a divine
institution &mdash; something far superior to dynasties and kingdoms. . . .
</p>
<p>`For a year the Hombourgers were allowed to suppose that their
&ldquo;peculiar institution&amp;&rdquo; was indeed superior to fate, to
public opinion, and to Prussia; but at the commencement of the present
year they were rudely awakened from their dreams of security.  The
sword that had been hanging over them fell.  The directors of the
company were ordered to appear before the governor of the town, and
they were told that they and all belonging to them were to cease to exist
in 1872, and that the following arrangement was to be made respecting
the plunder gained until that date.  The shareholders were to receive 10
per cent. on their money; 5000 shares were to be paid off at par each
year, and if this did not absorb all the profits, the surplus was to go
towards a fund for keeping up the gardens after the play had ceased.  By
this means, as there are now 36,000 shares, 25,000 will be paid off at
par, and the remaining 11,000 will be represented by the buildings and
the land belonging to the company, which it will be at liberty to sell to
the highest bidder.  Since this decree has been

<pb n="201"/>
promulgated the Hombourgers are in despair.  The croupiers and the
clerks, the Jews who lend money at high interest, the Christians who let
lodgings, all the rogues and swindlers who one way or another make a
living out of the play, fill the air with their complaints.
</p>
<p>`Although no doubt individuals will suffer by the suppression of
public play here, it is by no means certain that the town itself will not be
a gainer by it.  Holiday seekers must go somewhere.  The air of
Hombourg is excellent; the waters are invigorating; the town is well
situated and easy of access by rail; living is comparatively cheap &mdash; a
room may be had for about 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, an excellent dinner
for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; breakfast costs less than a shilling.  Hombourg is
now a fixed fact, and if the townspeople take heart and grapple with the
new state of things &mdash; if they buy up the Kursaal, and throw open its
salons to visitors; if they keep up the opera, the cricket club, and the
shooting; if they have good music, and balls and concerts for those who
like them, there is no reason why they should not attract as many visitors
to their town as they do now.'[81]

AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.</head>


<p>The gaming at Aix-la-Chapelle is equally desperate and
destructive.  `A Russian officer of my acquaintance,' says a writer in the
Annual Register for 1818, `was subject, like many of his countrymen
whom I have known, to the infatuation of play to a most ridiculous
excess.  His distrust of himself under the assailments which he
anticipated at a place like Aix-la-Chapelle, had induced him to take the
prudent precaution of paying in advance at his hotel for his board and
lodging, and at the bathing-house for his baths, for the time he intended
to stay.  The remaining contents of his purse he thought fairly his own;
and he went of course to the table all the gayer for the license he had
taken of his conscience.  On fortune showing him a few favours, he
came to me in high spirits, with a purse full of Napoleons, and a resolute
determination to keep them by venturing no more; but a gamester can no
more be stationary than the tide of a river, and on the evening he was
put out of suspense by having not a Napoleon left, and nothing to
console but congratulation on his

<pb n="203"/>
foresight, and the excellent supper which was the fruit of it.'
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the last century Aix-la-Chapelle was a great
rendezvous of gamblers.  The chief banker there paid a thousand louis
per annum for his license.  A little Italian adventurer once went to the
place with only a few louis in his pocket, and played crown stakes at
Hazard.  Fortune smiled on him; he increased his stakes progressively;
in twenty-four hours won about &pound;4000.  On the following day he
stripped the bank entirely, pocketing nearly &pound;10,000.  He
continued to play for some days, till he was at last reduced to a single
louis!  He now obtained from a friend the loan of &pound;30, and once
more resumed his station at the gaming table, which he once more
quitted with &pound;10,000 in his pocket, and resolved to leave it for
ever.  The arguments of one of the bankers, however, who followed him
to his inn, soon prevailed over his resolution, and on his return to the
gaming table he was stripped of his last farthing.  He went to his
lodgings, sold his clothes, and by that means again appeared at his old
haunt, for the half-crown stakes, by which he honourably repaid his loan
of &pound;30.  His end was unknown to the

<pb n="204"/>
relater of the anecdote, but `ten to one,' it was ruin.
</p>
<p>At the same place, in the year 1793, the heir-apparent of an Irish
Marquis lost at various times nearly &pound;20,000 at a billiard table,
partly owing to his antagonist being an excellent calculator, as well as a
superior player.
</p>
<p>A French emigrant at Aix-la-Chapelle, who carried a basket of
tarts, liqueurs, &amp;c., for regaling the gamesters, put down twenty-five
louis at <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi>.  He lost.  He then put down fifteen,
and lost again; at the third turn he staked ten; but while the cards were
being shuffled, seeming to recollect himself, he felt all his pockets, and
at length found two large French crowns, and a small one, which he also
ventured.  The deal was determined at the ninth card; and the poor
wretch, who had lost his all, dashed down his basket, started from his
seat, overturning two chairs as he forced the circle, tore off his hair, and
with horrid blasphemies, burst the folding doors, and rushing out like a
madman, was seen no more.
</p>
<p>Another emigrant arrived here penniless, but meeting a friend,
obtained the loan of a few crowns, nearly his all.  With these he went to
the rooms,

<pb n="205"/>
put down his stake, and won.  He then successively doubled his stakes
till he closed the evening with a hundred louis in his pocket.  He went to
his friend, and with mutual congratulations they resolved to venture no
more, and calculated how long their gains would support them from
absolute want, and thus seemed to strengthen their wise resolution.
</p>
<p>The next night, however, the lucky gambler returned to the room --but only to be a spectator, as he firmly said.  Alas! his resolution failed
him, and he quitted the tables indebted to a charitable bystander for a
livre or two, to pay for his petty refreshments.
</p>
<p>It is said that the annual profit to the bankers was 120,000 florins,
or &pound;14,000.
</p>
<p>`The very name of Aix-la-Chapelle,' says a traveller, `makes one
think (at least, makes me think) of cards and dice, &mdash; sharks and pigeons.
It has a &ldquo;professional odour&amp;&rdquo; upon it, which is certainly
not that of sanctity.  I entered the Redoute with my head full of sham
barons, German Catalinas, and the thousand-and-one popular tales of
renowned knights of the green cloth, &mdash; their seducing confederates, and
infatuated dupes.
</p>
<p>`The rooms are well distributed; the saloons

<pb n="206"/>
handsome.  A sparkling of ladies, apparently (and really, as I
understood) of the best water, the <hi rend="italic">&eacute;lite</hi>, in short, of
Aix-la-Chapelle, were lounging on sofas placed round the principal
saloon, or fluttering about amidst a crowd of men, who filled up the
centre of the room, or thronged round the tables that were ranged on one
side of it.
</p>
<p>`The players continued their occupation in death-like silence,
undisturbed by the buzz or the gaze of the lookers-on; not a sound was
heard but the rattle of the heaped-up money, as it was passed from one
side of the table to the other; nor was the smallest anxiety or emotion
visible on any countenance.
</p>
<p>`The scene was unpleasing, though to me curious from its novelty.
Ladies are admitted to play, but there were none occupied this morning.
I was glad of it; indeed, though English travellers are accused of
carrying about with them a portable code of morality, which dissolves or
stiffens like a soap-cake as circumstances may affect its consistency, yet
I sincerely believe that there are few amongst us who would not feel
shocked at seeing one of the gentler sex in so unwomanly a
position.'[82]

WIESBADEN.</head>
<p>
The gambling here in 1868 has been described in a very vivid manner.
</p>
<p>`Since the enforcement of the Prussian Sunday observance
regulations, Monday has become the great day of the week for the banks
of the German gambling establishments.  Anxious to make up for lost
time, the regular contributors to the company's dividends flock early on
Monday forenoon to the play-rooms in order to secure good places at the
tables, which, by the appointed hour for commencing operations (eleven
o'clock), are closely hedged round by persons of both sexes, eagerly
waiting for the first deal of the cards or the initial twist of the brass
wheel, that they may try another fall with Fortune.  Before each seated
player are arranged precious little piles of gold and silver, a card printed
in black and red, and a long pin, wherewith to prick out a system of
infallible gain.  The croupiers take their seats and unpack the strong box;
rouleaux &mdash; long metal sausages composed of double and single florins, &mdash;
wooden bowls brimming over with gold Frederics and Napoleons,

<pb n="208"/>
bank notes of all sizes and colours, are arranged upon the black leather
compartment, ruled over by the company's officers; half-a-dozen packs
of new cards are stripped of their paper cases, and swiftly shuffled
together; and when all these preliminaries, watched with breathless
anxiety by the surrounding speculators, have been gravely and carefully
executed, the chief croupier looks round him &mdash; a signal for the prompt
investment of capital on all parts of the table &mdash; chucks out a handful of
cards from the mass packed together convenient to his hand &mdash; ejaculates
the formula, &ldquo;Faites le jeu!&amp;&rdquo; and, after half a minute's
pause, during which he delicately moistens the ball of his dealing thumb,
exclaims &ldquo;Le jeu est fait, rien ne va plus,&amp;&rdquo; and proceeds
to interpret the decrees of fate according to the approved fashion of
Trente et Quarante.  A similar scene is taking place at the Roulette
table &mdash; a goodly crop of florins, with here and there a speck of gold
shining amongst the silver harvest, is being sown over the field of the
cloth of green, soon to be reaped by the croupier's sickle, and the pith
ball is being dropped into the revolving basin that is partitioned off into
so many tiny black and red niches.  For the next twelve hours the
processes

<pb n="209"/>
in question are carried on swiftly and steadily, without variation or loss
of time; relays of croupiers are laid on, who unobtrusively slip into the
places of their fellows when the hours arrive for relieving guard; the
game is never stopped for more than a couple of minutes at a time, viz.,
when the cards run out and have to be re-shuffled.  This brief
interruption is commonly considered to portend a break in the particular
vein which the game may have happened to assume during the deal &mdash;
say a run upon black or red, an alternation of coups (in threes or fours)
upon either colour, two reds and a black, or <hi rend="italic">vice
vers&acirc;</hi>, all equally frequent eccentricities of the cards; and
the heavier players often change their seats, or leave the table altogether
for an hour or so at such a conjuncture.  Curiously enough, excepting at
the very commencement of the day's play, the
<hi rend="italic">habitu&eacute;s</hi> of the Trente et Quarante tables appear to
entertain a strong antipathy to the first deal or two after the cards have
been &ldquo;re-made.&amp;&rdquo;  I have been told by one or two masters
of the craft that they have a fancy to see how matters are likely to go
before they strike in, as if it were possible to deduce the future of the
game from its past!  That it is possible appears to

<pb n="210"/>
be an article of faith with the old stagers, and, indeed, every now and
then odd coincidences occur which tend to confirm them in their creed.
I witnessed an occurrence which was either attributable (as I believe) to
sheer chance, or (as its hero earnestly assured me) to instinct.  A fair
and frail Magyar was punting on numbers with immense pluck and
uniform ill fortune.  Behind her stood a Viennese gentleman of my
acquaintance, who enjoys a certain renown amongst his friends for the
faculty of prophecy, which, however, he seldom exercises for his own
benefit.  Observing that she hesitated about staking her double florin, he
advised her to set it on the number 3.  Round went the wheel, and in
twenty seconds the ball tumbled into compartment 3 sure enough.  At the
next turn she asked his advice, and was told to try number 24.  No
sooner said than done, and 24 came up in due course, whereby Mdlle L.
C. won 140 odd gulden in two coups, the amount risked by her being
exactly four florins.  Like a wise girl, she walked off with her booty,
and played no more that day at Roulette.  A few minutes later I saw an
Englishman go through the performance of losing four thousand francs
by experimentalizing on single

<pb n="211"/>
numbers.  Twenty times running did he set ten louis-d'ors on a number
(varying the number at each stake), and not one of his selection proved
successful.  At the &ldquo;Thirty and Forty&amp;&rdquo; I saw an eminent
diplomatist win sixty thousand francs with scarcely an intermission of
failure; he played all over the table, pushing his rouleaux backwards and
forwards, from black to red, without any appearance of system that I
could detect, and the cards seemed to follow his inspiration.  It was a
great battle; as usual, three or four smaller fish followed in his wake, till
they lost courage and set against him, much to their discomfiture and the
advantage of the bank; but from first to last &mdash; that is, till the cards ran
out, and he left the table &mdash; he was steadily victorious.  In the evening he
went in again for another heavy bout, at which I chanced to be present;
but fortune had forsaken him; and he not only lost his morning's
winnings, but eight thousand francs to boot.  I do not remember to have
ever seen the tables so crowded &mdash; outside it was thundering, lightening,
and raining as if the world were coming to an end, and the whole
floating population of Wiesbaden was driven into the Kursaal by the
weather.  A roaring time of it

<pb n="212"/>
had the bank; when play was over, about which time the rain ceased,
hundreds of hot and thirsty gamblers streamed out of the reeking rooms
to the glazed-in terrace, and the next hour, always the pleasantest of the
twenty-four here and in Hombourg &mdash; at Ems people go straight from the
tables to bed, &mdash; was devoted to animated chat and unlimited sherry&mdash;
cobbler; all the &ldquo;events&amp;&rdquo; of the day were passed in
review, experiences exchanged, and confessions made.  Nobody had
won; I could not hear of a single great success &mdash; the bank had had it all
its own way, and most of the &ldquo;lions,&amp;&rdquo; worsted in the fray,
had evidently made up their minds to &ldquo;drown it in the
bowl.&amp;&rdquo;  The Russian detachment &mdash; a very strong one this year &mdash;
was especially hard hit; Spain and Italy were both unusually low-spirited;
and there was an extra solemnity about the British Isles that told its own
sad tale.  Englishmen, when they have lost more than they can afford,
generally take it out of themselves in surly, brooding self-reproach.
Frenchmen give vent to their disgust and annoyance by abusing the game
and its myrmidons.  You may hear them, loud and savage, on the
terrace, &ldquo;Ah! le salle jeu! comment peut-on se laisser
&eacute;plucher par des brigands de la sorte!

<pb n="213"/>
Trip&ocirc;t, inf&acirc;me, va! je te donne ma
mal&eacute;diction!&amp;&rdquo;  Italians, again, endeavour to conceal their
discomfiture under a flow of feverish gaiety.  Germans utter one or two
&ldquo;Gotts donnerwetterhimmelsapperment!&amp;&rdquo; light up their
cigars, drink a dozen or so &ldquo;hocks,&amp;&rdquo; and subside into their
usual state of ponderous cheerfulness.  Russians betray no emotion
whatever over their calamities, save, perhaps, that they smoke those
famous little `Laferme' cigarettes a trifle faster and more nervously than
at other times; but they are excellent winners and magnificent losers,
only to be surpassed in either respect by their old enemy the Turk, who
is <hi rend="italic">facile princeps</hi> in the art of hiding his feelings from the
outer world.
</p>
<p>`The great mass of visitors at Wiesbaden this season, as at
Hombourg, belong to the middle and lower middle classes, leavened by a
very few celebrities and persons of genuine distinction.  There are a
dozen or two eminent men here, not to be seen in the play-rooms, who
are taking the waters &mdash; Lord Clarendon, Baron Rothschild, Prince Sou-varof, and a few more &mdash; but the general run of guests is by no means
remarkable for birth, wealth, or respectability; and we are shockingly off
for

<pb n="214"/>
ladies.  As a set-off against this deficiency, it would seem that all the
aged, broken-down courtesans of Paris, Vienna, and Berlin have agreed
to make Wiesbaden their autumn rendezvous.  Arrayed in all the colours
of the rainbow, painted up to the roots of their dyed hair, shamelessly
<hi rend="italic">d&eacute;collet&eacute;es</hi>, prodigal of &ldquo;free&amp;&rdquo;
talk and unseemly gesture, these ghastly creatures, hideous caricatures of
youth and beauty, flaunt about the play-rooms and gardens, levying
black-mail upon those who are imprudent enough to engage them in
&ldquo;chaff&amp;&rdquo; or badinage, and desperately endeavouring to
hook themselves on to the wealthier and younger members of the male
community.  They poison the air round them with sickly perfumes; they
assume titles, and speak of one another as &ldquo;cette ch&egrave;re
comtesse;&amp;&rdquo; their walk is something between a prance and a
wriggle; they prowl about the terrace whilst the music is playing, seeking
whom they may devour, or rather whom they may inveigle into paying
for their devouring: and, <hi rend="italic">bon Dieu!</hi> how they do gorge
themselves with food and drink when some silly lad or aged rou&eacute;
allows himself to be bullied or wheedled into paying their scot!  Their
name is legion; and they constitute the very worst feature of a place

<pb n="215"/>
which, naturally a Paradise, is turned into a seventh hell by the
uncontrolled rioting of human passions.  They have no friends &mdash; no
&ldquo;protectors;&amp;&rdquo; they are dependent upon accident for a meal
or a piece of gold to throw away at the tables; they are plague-spots
upon the face of society; they are, as a rule, crassly ignorant and
horribly cynical; and yet there are many men here who are proud of
their acquaintance, always ready to entertain them in the most expensive
manner, and who speak of them as if they were the only desirable
companions in the world!
</p>
<p>`Amongst our notabilities of the eccentric sort, not the least
singular in her behaviour is the Countess C &mdash;  &mdash; o.  an aged patrician of
immense fortune, who is as constant to Wiesbaden as old Madame de
K &mdash;  &mdash; f is to Hombourg on the Heights.  Like the last-named lady, she
is daily wheeled to her place in the Black and Red temple, and plays
away for eight or nine hours with wonderful spirit and perseverance.
She has with her a <hi rend="italic">suite</hi> of eight domestics; and when she
wins (which is not often), on returning to her hotel at night, she presents
each member of her retinue with &mdash; twopence! &ldquo;not,&amp;&rdquo; as
she na&iuml;vely avows, &ldquo;from a feeling of

<pb n="216"/>
generosity, but to propitiate Fortune.&amp;&rdquo;  When she loses, none of
them, save the man who wheels her home, get anything but hard words
from her; and he, happy fellow, receives a donation of six kreutzers.
She does not curse the croupiers loudly for her bad luck, like her
contemporary, the once lovely Russian Ambassadress; but, being very
far advanced in years, and of a tender disposition, sheds tears over her
misfortunes, resting her chin on the edge of the table.  An edifying sight
is this venerable dame, bearing an exalted title, as she mopes and mouths
over her varying luck, missing her stake twice out of three times, when
she fain would push it with her rake into some particular section of the
table!  She is very intimate with one or two antediluvian diplomatists and
warriors, who are here striving to bolster themselves up for another year
with the waters, and may be heard crowing out lamentations over her
fatal passion for play, interspersed with bits of moss-grown scandal,
disinterred from the social ruins of an age long past: Radetzky,
Wratislaw (le beau sabreur), the two Schwarzenbergs (he of Leipsic, and
the former Prime Minister), Paul Eszterhazy, Wrangel, and
Bl&uuml;cher were friends of her youth; judging from

<pb n="217"/>
her appearance, one would not be surprised to hear that she had received
a &ldquo;poulet&amp;&rdquo; from Baron Trenck, or played whist with
Maria Theresa.  She has outlived all human friendships or affections,
and exists only for the chink of the gold as it jingles on the gaming
table.  I cannot help fancying that her last words will be &ldquo;Rien ne
va plus!&amp;&rdquo;  She is a great and convincing moral, if one but
interpret her rightly.'[83]

<p>The doom of the German gaming houses seems to be settled.
They will all be closed in 1872, as appears by the following
announcement: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`The Prussian government, not having been able to obtain from the
lessees of the gaming tables at Wiesbaden, Ems, and Hombourg their
consent to their cancelling of their contracts, has resolved to terminate
their privileges by a legislative measure.  It has presented a bill to the
Chamber of Deputies at Berlin, fixing the year 1872 as the limit to the
existence of these establishments, and even authorizing the government
to suppress them at an earlier period by a royal ordinance.  No
indemnity is to be allowed to the persons holding concessions.' &mdash;
<hi rend="italic">Feb</hi>. 23, 1868.


<pb n="218"/>

</p>
<p>A London newspaper defends this measure in a very successful
manner.
</p>
<p>`Prussia has declared her purpose to eradicate from the territories
subject to her increased sway, and from others recognizing her influence,
the disgrace of the <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi> and the Roulette table as
public institutions.  Her reasoning is to the effect that they bring scandal
upon Germany; that they associate with the names of its favourite
watering-places the appellation of &ldquo;hells;&amp;&rdquo; that they attract
swindlers and adventurers of every degree; and that they have for many
a year past been held up to the opprobrium of Europe.  For why should
this practice be a lawful practice of Germany and of no other country in
Europe?  Why not in France, in Spain, in Italy, in the Northern States,
in Great Britain itself?  Let us not give to this last proposition more
importance than it is worth.  The German watering-places are places of
leisure, of trifling, of <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi>.  That is why, originally, they
were selected as encampments by the tribes which fatten upon hazards.
But there was another reason: they brought in welcome revenues to
needy princes.  Even now, in view of the contemplated expurgation,
Monaco is named,

<pb n="219"/>
with Geneva, as successor to the perishing glories of Hombourg,
Wiesbaden, and the great Baden itself.  That is to say, the gamblers, or,
rather, the professionals who live upon the gambling propensities of
others, having received from Prussia and her friends notice to quit, are
in search of new lodgings.
</p>
<p>`The question is, they being determined, and the accommodation
being not less certainly ready for them than the sea is for the tribute of a
river, will the reform designed be a really progressive step in the
civilization of Europe?  Prussia says &mdash; decidedly so; because it will
demolish an infamous privilege.  She affirms that an institution which
might have been excusable under a landgrave, with a few thousand acres
of territory, is inconsistent with the dignity and, to quote continental
phraseology, the mission of a first-class state.  Here again the reasoning
is incontrovertible.  Of one other thing, moreover, we may feel perfectly
sure, that Prussia having determined to suppress these centres and
sources of corruption, they will gradually disappear from Europe.
Concede to them a temporary breathing-time at Monaco; the time left for
even a nominally independent exist

<pb n="220"/>
ence to Monaco is short: imagine that they find a fresh outlet at Geneva;
Prussia will have represented the public opinion of the age, against
which not even the Republicanism of Switzerland can long make a
successful stand.  Upon the whole, history can never blame Prussia for
such a use either of her conquests or her influence.  Say what you will,
gambling is an indulgence blushed over in England; abroad, practised as
a little luxury in dissipation, it may be pardoned as venial; habitually,
however, it is a leprosy.  And as it is by habitual gamblers that these
haunts are made to flourish, this alone should reconcile the world of
tourists to a deprivation which for them must be slight; while to the class
they imitate, without equalling, it will be the prohibition of an abomin-able habit.'[84]

CHAPTER IX.
<lb/>
GAMBLING IN THE UNITED STATES.
</head>

<p>IT is not surprising that a people so intensely speculative,
excitable, and eager as the Americans, should be desperately addicted to
gambling.  Indeed, the spirit of gambling has incessantly pervaded all
their operations, political, commercial, and social.[85]  It is but one of
the manifestations of that thorough license arrogated to itself by the
nation, finding its true expression in the American maxim recorded by
Mr Hepworth Dixon, so coarsely worded, but so significant, &mdash; `Every
man

<pb n="222"/>
has a right to do what he <hi rend="italic">damned</hi> pleases.'[86]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="85"><p>[85] In the American correspondence of the
<hi rend="italic">Morning Advertiser</hi>, Feb. 6, 1868, the writer says: &mdash; `It was
only yesterday (Jan. 24) that an eminent American merchant of this city
(New York) said, in referring to the state of affairs &mdash; &ldquo;we are
socially, politically, and commercially demoralized.&amp;&rdquo; '</p></note>
<p><note place="foot" n="86"><p>[86] `Spiritual Wives.' &mdash; A work
the extraordinary disclosures of which tend to show that a similar spirit,
destined, perhaps, to bring about the greatest social changes, is gaining
ground elsewhere than in America.</p></note>

</p>
<p>Although laws similar to those of England are enacted in America
against gambling, it may be said to exist everywhere, but, of course, to
the greatest extent in the vicinity of the fashionable quarters of the large
cities.  In New York there is scarcely a street without its gambling house
&mdash; `private,' of course, but well known to those who indulge in the vice.
The ordinary public game is Faro.
</p>
<p>High and low, rich and poor, are perfectly suited in their
requirements; whilst at some places the stakes are unlimited, at others
they must not exceed one dollar, and a player may wager as low as five
cents, or twopence-halfpenny.  These are for the accommodation of the
very poorest workmen, discharged soldiers, broken-down gamblers, and
street-boys.
</p>
<p>`I think,' says a recent writer,[87] `of all the street-boys in the
world, those of New York are the most precocious.  I have seen a shoe-black, about

<pb n="223"/>
three feet high, walk up to the table or `Bank,' as it is generally called,
and stake his money (five cents) with the air of a young spendthrift to
whom &ldquo;money is no object.&amp;&rdquo; '
</p>
<note place="foot" n="87"><p>[87] `St James's Magazine,' Sept.,
1867.</p></note>
<p>The chief gambling houses of New York were established by men
who are American celebrities, and among these the most prominent have
been Pat Hern and John Morrissey.


PAT HERN.<lb/>


</p><p>Some years ago this celebrated Irishman kept up a splendid
establishment in Broadway, near Hauston Street.  At that time his house
was the centre of attraction towards which `all the world' gravitated, and
did the thing right grandly &mdash; combining the Apicius with the Beau Nash
or Brummell.  He was profusely lavish with his wines and exuberant in
his suppers; and it was generally said that the game in action there,
<hi rend="italic">Faro</hi>, was played in all fairness.  Pat Hern was a man of
jovial disposition and genial wit, and would have adorned a better
position.  During the trout-fishing season he used to visit a well-known
place called Islip in Long Island, much frequented by gentlemen devoted
to angling and fond of good living.


<pb n="224"/>

</p>
<p>At Islip the equally renowned Oby Snedecker kept the tavern
which was the resort of Pat Hern and his companions.  It had attached to
it a stream and lake to which the gentlemen who had the privilege of the
house were admitted.  Mrs Obadiah Snedecker, the buxom wife of `mine
host,' was famous for the exquisite way in which she cooked veal
cutlets.  There were two niggers in the establishment, named Steve and
Dick, who accompanied the gentlemen in their angling excursions,
amusing them with their stolidity and the enormous quantity of gin they
could imbibe without being more than normally fuddled.
</p>
<p>After fishing, the gentlemen used to take to gambling at the usual
French games; but here Pat Hern appeared not in the character of
gambler, but as a private gentleman.  He was always well received by
the visitors, and caused them many a hearty laugh with his overflowing
humour.  He died about nine years ago, I think tolerably well off.


JOHN MORRISSEY.<lb/>

</p><p>John Morrissey was originally a prize-fighter, &mdash; having fought
with Heenan and also with Yankee

<pb n="225"/>
Sullivan, and lived by teaching the young Americans the noble art of
self-defence.  He afterwards set up a `Bar,' or public-house, and over
this he established a small Faro bank, which he enlarged and improved
by degrees until it became well known, and was very much frequented
by the gamblers of New York.  He is now, I believe, a member of
Congress for that city, and immensely wealthy.  Not content with his
successful gambling operations in New York, he has opened a splendid
establishment at the fashionable summer resort of Saratoga, consisting of
an immense hotel, ballrooms, and gambling-rooms, and is said to have a
profit of two millions of dollars (about &pound;400,000) during the
season.[88]  He is mentioned as one of those who pay the most income
tax.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="88"><p>[88] <hi rend="italic">Ubi supr&agrave;</hi>.</p></note>
<p>Morrissey's gambling house is in Union Square, and is said to be
magnificently furnished and distinguished by the most princely
hospitality.  At all hours of the day or night tables are laid out with
every description of refreshment, to which all who visit the place are
welcome.
</p>
<p>This is a remarkable feature in the American system.  At all
`Bars,' or public-houses, you find

<pb n="226"/>
provided, free of charge, supplies of cheese, biscuits, &amp;c., and
sometimes even some savoury soup &mdash; which are often resorted to by
those unfortunates who are `clean broke' or `used up,' with little else to
assuage the pangs of hunger but the everlasting quid of tobacco,
furiously `chawed.'  Another generous feature of the American system is
that the bar-man does not measure out to you, after our stingy fashion,
what drink you may require, but hands you the tumbler and bottle to
help yourself, unless in the case of made drinks, such as `mint-juleps,'
&amp;c.  However, you must drink your liquor at a gulp, after the Yankee
fashion; for if you take a sip and turn your back to the counter, your
glass will disappear &mdash; as it is not customary to have glasses standing
about.  Morrissey's wines are very good, and always supplied in
abundance.
</p>
<p>Almost every game of chance is played at this establishment, and
the stakes are very high and unlimited.  The visitors are the wealthy and
wild young men of New York, and occasionally a Southern-looking man
who, perhaps, has saved some of his property, being still the same
professional gambler; for it may be affirmed that all the Southern
planters were addicted to gambling.


<pb n="227"/>

</p>
<p>`The same flocks of well-dressed and fashionable-looking men of
all ages pass in and out all through the day and night; tens of thousands
of dollars are lost and won; the &ldquo;click&amp;&rdquo; of the markers
never ceases; all speak in a low tone; everything has a serious, quiet
appearance.  The dealers seem to know every one, and nod familiarly to
all who approach their tables.  John Morrissey is occasionally to be seen,
walking through the rooms, apparently a disinterested spectator.  He is a
short, thick-set man, of about 40 years, dark complexion, and wears a
long beard, dresses in a slovenly manner, and walks with a swagger.
Now and then he approaches the table; makes a few bets, and is then lost
in the crowd.'[89]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="89"><p>[89] <hi rend="italic">Ubi
supr&agrave;</hi>.</p></note>
<p>OTHER GAMING-HOUSES.<lb/>

</p><p>The same writer furnishes other very interesting facts.
</p>
<p>`After the opera-house and theatres are closed, Morrissey's
gambling house becomes very full; in fact, the best time to see it to
advantage is about two or three o'clock in the morning.
</p>

<pb n="228"/>

<p>`A little below the New York Hotel, and on the opposite side of
Broadway, there is a gambling house, not quite so
&ldquo;respectable&amp;&rdquo; as the one I have been describing; here the
stakes are not below a dollar, and not more than twenty-five; there are
no refreshments gratis, and the rooms are not so well furnished.  The
men to be seen gaming in this house differ but very little in appearance
from those in Union Square, but there seems to be less discipline
amongst them, and more noise and confusion.  It is a rare thing to see an
intoxicated man in a gambling house; the door-keepers are very
particular as to whom they admit, and any disturbance which might call
for the interference of the police would be ruinous to their business.  The
police are undoubtedly aware of everything going on in these houses,
and do not interfere as long as everything goes on quietly.
</p>
<p>`Now and then a clerk spends his employer's money, and if it is
discovered where he lost it then a <hi rend="italic">*raid</hi> is made by the police
in force, the tables and all the gaming paraphernalia are carried off, and
the proprietors heavily fined.
</p>
<p>`I witnessed a case of this: a young man in the employment of a
commission merchant appropri

<pb n="229"/>
ated a large sum of his employer's money, and lost it at Faro.  He was
arrested, and confessed what he had done with it.  The police at once
proceeded to the house where the Faro bank was kept, and the scene,
when it was known that the police were below, beggars description.  The
tables were upset, and notes and markers were flying about in all
directions.  Men, sprawling and scrambling on the floor, fought with one
another for whatever they could seize; then the police entered and
cleared the house, having arrested the owners of the bank.  This was in
one of the lowest gaming houses, where &ldquo;skin&amp;&rdquo; games
(cheating games) are practised.
</p>
<p>`In the gambling house in Broadway, near the New York Hotel, I
have often noticed a young man, apparently of some 18 or 20 years of
age, fashionably dressed, and of prepossessing appearance.  On some
days he would play very high, and seemed to have most remarkable
luck; but he always played with the air of an old gamester, seeming
careless as to whether he won or lost.  One night he lost so heavily that
he attracted the notice of all the players; every stake of his was swept
away; and he still played on until his last dollar was lost; then he quietly
walked out, whis

<pb n="230"/>
tling a popular Yankee air.  He was there next day <hi rend="italic">*minus</hi>
his great-coat and watch and chain &mdash; he lost again, went out and
returned in his shirt sleeves, having pawned his coat, studs, and
everything he could with decency divest himself of.  He lost everything;
and when I next saw him he was selling newspapers in front of the post-office!
</p>
<p>`The mania for gambling is a most singular one.  I have known a
man to win a thousand dollars in a few hours, and yet he would not s-pend a dollar to get a dinner, but when he felt hungry he went to a
baker's shop and bought a loaf of bread, and that same night lost all his
money at Roulette.
</p>
<p>`There is another house on the corner of Centre and Grand Streets,
open during night and day.  The stakes here are the same as in the one
in Broadway, and the people who play are very much the same &mdash; in fact,
the same faces are constantly to be met with in all the gambling houses,
from the highest to the lowest.  When a gambler has but small capital,
he will go to a small house, where small stakes are admissible.  I saw a
man win 50 or 60 dollars at this place, and then hand in his checks
(markers) to be cashed.  The dealer handed

<pb n="231"/>
him the money, and said &mdash; &ldquo;Now you go off, straight away to
Union Square, and pay away all you have won from here to John
Morrissey.  This is the way with all of them; they never come here until
they are dead broke, and have only a dirty dollar or so to risk.&amp;&rdquo;
There was some truth in what he said, but notwithstanding he managed
to keep the bank going on.  There is a great temptation to a man who
has won a sum of money at a small gambling house to go to a higher
one, as he may then, at a single stake, win as much as he could possibly
win if he had a run of luck in a dozen stakes at the smaller bank.
</p>
<p>`In No. 102, in the Bowery, there is one of the lowest of the
gaming houses I have seen in the Empire city.  The proprietor is an
Irishman; he employs three men as dealers, and they relieve one another
every four hours during the day and night.  The stakes here are of the
lowest, and the people to be seen here of the roughest to be found in the
city.  The game is Faro, as elsewhere.
</p>
<p>`In this place I met an old friend with whom I had served in the
army of Northern Virginia, under General Lee, in his Virginia campaign
of 1865.  He told me he had been in New York

<pb n="232"/>
since the end of the war, and lived a very uncertain sort of life.
Whatever money he could earn he spent at the gaming table.  Sometimes
he had a run of luck, and whilst it lasted he dressed well, and stopped at
the most expensive hotels.  One night he would sleep at the Astor
House; and perhaps the next night he would not be able to pay for his
bed, and would stay all night in the parks.  Strange to say, hundreds live
in this way, which is vulgarly called &ldquo;scratching&amp;&rdquo; in New
York.  I afterwards saw my friend driving an omnibus; and when I could
speak to him, I found that he was still attending the banks with every
cent he earned!
</p>
<p>`It is amusing to watch the proprietor of this place at the Bowery;
he has a joke for every one he sees.  &ldquo;Hallo, old sport!&amp;&rdquo;
he cries, &ldquo;come and try your luck &mdash; you look lucky this evening;
and if you make a good run you may sport a gold watch and chain, and
a velvet vest, like myself.&amp;&rdquo;  Then to another, &ldquo;Young
clear-the-way, you look down at the mouth to-night!  Come along and
have a turn &mdash; and never mind your supper tonight.'  In this way the days
and nights are passed in those gambling houses.'


<pb n="233"/>

</p>
<p>There is also in New York an association for the prevention of
gambling.  The society employs detectives to visit the gambling saloons,
and procure evidence for the suppression of the establishments.
</p>
<p>It is the business of these agents also to ascertain the names and
occupations of those who frequent the gambling rooms, and a list of the
persons thus detected is sent periodically to the subscribers to the
society, that they may know who are the persons wasting their money, or
perhaps the money of their employers, in gambling.  Many large houses
of business subscribe.  In the month of August the society's agents
detected among the gamblers 68 clerks of mercantile houses, and in the
previous six months reported 623 cases.  It is stated that there are in
New York and Brooklyn 1017 policy and lottery offices, and 163 Faro
banks, and that their net annual gains are not less than 36,000,000
dollars.


AMERICAN GAMBLERS.<lb/>


</p><p>At American gambling houses `it is very easy,' says the same
writer, `to distinguish the professional from the ordinary gambler.  The
latter

<pb n="234"/>
has a nervous expression about the mouth, and an intense gaze upon the
cards, and altogether a very serious nervous appearance; while the
professional plays in a very quiet manner, and seems to care but little
how the game goes; and his desire to appear as if the game was new to
him is almost certain to expose him to those who know the
man&oelig;uvre.
</p>
<p>`Previous to the struggle for independence in the South, there were
many hundreds of gamblers scattered through the Southern towns, and
the Mississippi steam-boats used to abound with them.  In the South, a
gambler was regarded as outside the pale of society, and classed with the
slave-trader, who was looked upon with loathing by the very same men
who traded with him; such was the inconsistency of public opinion.
</p>
<p>`The American gambler differs from his European brethren in
many respects.  He is very frequently, in education, appearance, and
manner, a gentleman, and if his private history were known, it would be
found that he was of good birth, and was at one time possessed of
considerable fortune; but having lost all at the gambling table, he
gradually came down to the level of those who

<pb n="235"/>
proved his ruin, and having no profession nor means of livelihood left to
him, he adopted their mode of life.
</p>
<p>`On one occasion I met a brother of a Southern General (very
famous in the late war and still a wealthy man) who, at one time, was
one of the richest planters in the State of Louisiana, and is now acting as
an agent for a set of gamblers to their gaming houses.  After losing
everything he had, he became a croupier to a gambling house in New
Orleans, and afterwards plied his trade on the Mississippi for some
years; then he went into Mexico, and finally to New York, where he
opened a house on his own account.
</p>
<p>`During the war he speculated in &ldquo;greenbacks,&amp;&rdquo; and
lost all his ill-gotten gains, and had to descend to his present
position.'[90]

<p>
AMERICAN GAMES: &mdash; DRAW POKER, OR BLUFF.<lb/>


</p><p>Draw Poker, or Bluff, is a favourite game with the Americans.  It
is played by any number of persons, from four to seven; four, five, or
six players are preferred; seven are only engaged

<pb n="236"/>
where a party of friends consists of that number, and all require to be
equally amused.
</p>
<p>The deal is usually determined by fixing on a card, and dealing
round, face upwards, until such card appears.  The dealer then places in
the pool an <hi rend="italic">Ant&egrave;</hi>, or certain agreed-upon sum, and
proceeds to deal to each person five cards.  The player next to the
dealer, before looking at his cards, has the option of staking a certain
sum.  This is called the `blind,' and makes him the elder hand, or last
player; and when his turn comes round he can, by giving up his first
stake, withdraw from the game, or, if he pleases, by making good any
sum staked by a previous player, raise the stakes to any sum he pleases,
provided, of course, that no limit has been fixed before sitting down.
The privilege of raising or doubling on the <hi rend="italic">blind</hi> may be
exercised by any one round the table, provided he has not looked at his
cards.  If no intervening player has met the original <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>,
that is, staked double the sum, this must be done by all who wish to
play, and, of course, must be made good by the last player.  Each
person then looks at his cards, and decides on his plan of action.  It
should be understood that every one, except the <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>, may

<pb n="237"/>
look at his cards in his turn before deciding if he will meet the
<hi rend="italic">blind</hi>.  Before speaking of the manner of drawing it will be
better to give the relative value of the hands, which will much simplify
the matter, and make it more easily understood.  Thus: four aces are the
best cards that can be held; four kings next, and so on, down to four
twos; four cards of the same value beating anything except four of a
higher denomination.  The next best hand is called a <hi rend="italic">full</hi>, and
is made up thus: &mdash; three aces and a pair of sixes; three nines and pair of
twos; in fact, any three cards of the same value and a pair constitute a
full hand, and can only be beaten by a full hand of a higher
denomination or fours.  The next hand that takes precedence is a
<hi rend="italic">flush</hi>, or five cards of one colour; after this comes
<hi rend="italic">threes</hi>, vis., three cards all of the same value, say, three
aces, kings, queens, and so on, downwards (the two remaining, being
odd ones, are of no value).  The next is a sequence, as five following
cards, for instance, nine.  eight, seven, six, five; it is not necessary they
should all be of one colour, as this, of course, would constitute a
<hi rend="italic">flush</hi>.  Next come two pairs, say, two knaves and two fives;
and, last of all, is a single pair of cards.  Having

<pb n="238"/>
explained the value of the hands, let us show how you endeavour to get
them.  The bets having been made, and the <hi rend="italic">blind</hi> made good
or abandoned, or given up, the dealer proceeds to ask each player in his
turn how many cards he wants; and here begins the first study of the
game &mdash; <hi rend="italic">*to know what to throw away</hi> in order to get in
others to make the hand better if possible.  Your hand may, of course,
be so utterly bad as to make it necessary to throw away the whole five
and draw five new ones; this is not very likely, as few players will put a
stake in the pool unless, on looking first at his cards, he has seen
something, say a pair, to start with.  We will suppose he has this, and,
of course, he throws away three cards, and draws three in place of them.
To describe the proper way to fill up a hand is impossible; we can but
give an instance here and there to show the varying interest which
attaches to the game; &mdash; thus, you may have threes in the original hand
dealt; some players will throw away the two odd cards and draw two
more, to try and make the hand fours, or, at least, a full; while a player
knowing that his is not a very good hand, will endeavour to
<hi rend="italic">*deceive</hi> the rest by standing out, that is, not taking any
fresh cards; of

<pb n="239"/>
course all round the table make remarks as to what he can possibly have.
It is usually taken to be a sequence, as this requires no drawing, if
originally dealt.  The same remark applies to a <hi rend="italic">flush;</hi> two
pairs or four to a flush, of course, require one card to make them into
good hands, a player being only entitled to draw once; and the hands
being made good, the real and exciting part of the game begins.  Each
one endeavours to keep his real position a secret from his neighbours.
Some put on a look of calm indifference, and try to seem self-possessed;
some will grin and talk all sorts of nonsense; some will utter sly bits of
<hi rend="italic">badinage;</hi> while others will study intently their cards, or gaze
at the ceiling &mdash; all which is done merely to distract attention, or to
conceal the feelings, as the chance of success or failure be for or against;
and then begins the betting or gambling part of the game.  The player
next the <hi rend="italic">blind!</hi> is the first to declare his bet; in which, of
course, he is entirely governed by circumstances.  Some, being the first
to bet, and having a very good card indeed, will `bet small,' in hopes
that some one else will see it, and `go better,' that is, bet more, so that
when it comes round to his turn

<pb n="240"/>
again he may see all previous bets, and bet as much higher as he thinks
proper; for it must be borne in mind that a player's first bet does not
preclude him from coming in again if his first bet has been raised upon
by any player round the table in his turn; but if once the original bet
goes round and comes to the <hi rend="italic">blind</hi>, or last player, without
any one going better, the game is closed, and it becomes a <hi rend="italic">show of
hands</hi>, to see who takes the pool and all the bets.  This does not
often happen, as there is usually some one round the table to raise it; but
my informant has seen it occur, and has been highly amused at watching
the countenance of the expectant <hi rend="italic">small better</hi> at having to
show a fine hand for a mere trifle.  Some players will, in order to
conceal their method of play, occasionally throw their cards among the
waste ones and abandon their stakes; this is not often done; but it
sometimes happens where the stakes have been small, or the player has
been <hi rend="italic">trying a bluff</hi>, and has found some one whom he could
not <hi rend="italic">bluff off</hi>.  The foregoing is a concise account of the
game, as played in America, where it is of universal interest, and
exercises great fascination.  It is often played by parties of friends

<pb n="241"/>
who meet regularly for the purpose, and instances can be found where
fortunes have been lost in a night.
</p>
<p>The game of Pokers differs from the one just described, in so far
that the players receive only the original five cards dealt without drawing
fresh ones, and must either play or refuse on them.  In this game, as
there are more cards, as many as ten persons can play.


LANSQUENET.[91]<lb/>


</p><p>Lansquenet is much played by the Americans, and is one of the
most exciting games in vogue.
</p>
<p>The dealer or banker stakes a certain sum, and this must be met by
the nearest to the dealer first, and so on.  When the stake is met, the
dealer turns up two cards, one to the right, &mdash; the latter for himself, the
former for the table or the players.  He then keeps on turning up the
cards until either of the cards is matched, which constitutes the
winning, &mdash; as, for instance, suppose the five of diamonds is his card,
then should the five of any other suit turn up, he wins.  If he loses, then
the next

<pb n="242"/>
player on the left becomes banker and proceeds in the same way.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="91"><p>[91] This name is derived from the German
`<hi rend="italic">landsknecht</hi>' (`valet of the fief'), applied to a mercenary
soldier.</p></note>
<p>When the dealer's card turns up, he may take the stake and pass
the bank; or he may allow the stake to remain, whereat of course it
becomes doubled if met.  He can continue thus as long as the cards turn
up in his favour &mdash; having the option at any moment of giving up the
bank and retiring for that time.  If he does that, the player to whom he
passes the bank has the option of continuing it at the same amount at
which it was left.  The pool may be made up by contributions of all the
players in certain proportions.  The terms used respecting the standing of
the stake are, `I'll see' (<hi rend="italic">&agrave; moi le tout)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Je
tiens</hi>.  When <hi rend="italic">jumelle</hi> (twins), or the turning up of
similar cards on both sides, occurs, then the dealer takes half the stake.
</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a run of several consecutive winnings; but on
one occasion, on board one of the Cunard steamers, a banker at the
game turned up in his own favour I think no less than eighteen times.
The original stake was only six-pence; but had each stake been met as
won, the final doubling would have amounted to the immense sum of

<pb n="243"/>
&pound;3,236 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.!  This will appear by the following

<p>In fair play, as this is represented to have been, such a long
sequence of matches must be considered very remarkable, although six
or seven is not unfrequent.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, there is a very easy means by which card
sharpers manage the thing to perfection.  They prepare beforehand a
series of a dozen cards arranged as follows: &mdash;
<list>
<item>1st Queen</item>
<item>6th  Nine</item>
<item>2nd Queen</item>
<item>7th  Nine</item>
<item>3rd Ten</item>
<item>8th  Ace</item>
<item>4th Seven</item>
<item>9th  Eight</item>
<item>5th Ten</item>
<item>10th Ace</item>
</list>

<pb n="244"/>

</p>
<p>Series thus arranged are placed in side pockets outside the
waistcoat, just under the left breast.  When the sharper becomes banker
he leans negligently over the table, and in this position his fingers are as
close as possible to the prepared cards, termed
<hi rend="italic">port&eacute;es</hi>.  At the proper moment he seizes the cards
and places them on the pack.  The trick is rendered very easy by the fact
that the card-sharper has his coat buttoned at the top, so that the lower
part of it lies open and permits the introduction of the hand, which is
completely masked.
</p>
<p>Some sharpers are skilful enough to take up some of the matches
already dealt, which they place in their <hi rend="italic">costi&egrave;res</hi>, or
side-pockets above described, in readiness for their next operation;
others keep them skilfully hidden in their hand, to lay them, at the
convenient moment, upon the pack of cards.  By this means, the pack is
not augmented.[92]
 </p>
<note place="foot" n="92"><p>[92] Robert Houdin, `<hi rend="italic">Les Tricheries des
Grecs devoil&eacute;es</hi>.'</p></note>
<p>In France the stakes commence at 5 francs; and it may be easily
imagined how soon vast sums of money may change hands if the players
are determined and reckless.




<pb n="245"/>

EUCHRE.<lb/>


</p><p>This is also a game much played in the States.  I suppose it is a
Yankee invention, named by one of their learned professors, from the
Greek <foreign lang="grk">e&uuml;ceis</foreign>
(eucheir), meaning `well in the hand ' or
`strong' &mdash; a very appropriate designation of the game, which is as
follows: &mdash;
</p>
<p>In this game all the cards are excluded up to the sixes, &mdash; seven
being the lowest in the Euchre pack.  Five cards are dealt out, after the
usual shuffling and cutting, with a turn-up, or trump.  The dealer has the
privilege of discarding one of his cards and taking up the trump &mdash; not
showing, however, the one he discards.  The Knave is the best card in
the game &mdash; a peculiar Yankee `notion.'  The Knave of trumps is called
the Right Bower, and the other Knave of the <hi rend="italic">same colour</hi> is
the Left Bower.  Hence it appears that the nautical propensity of this
great people is therein represented &mdash; `bower' being in fact a sheet
anchor.  If both are held, it is evident that the <hi rend="italic">point</hi> of the
deal is decided &mdash; since it results from taking three tricks out of the five;
for, of course, the trump card appropriated by the dealer will, most
probably,

<pb n="246"/>
secure a trick, and the two Knaves must necessarily make two.  The
game may be five or seven points, as agreed upon.  Euchre is rapid and
decisive, and, therefore, eminently American.


FLY LOO.<lb/>


</p><p>Some of the games played by the Americans are peculiar to
themselves.  For instance, vast sums of money change hands over Fly
Loo, or the attraction existing between lumps of sugar and adventurous
flies!  This game is not without its excitement.  The gamblers sit round a
table, each with a lump of sugar before him, and the player upon whose
lump a fly first perches carries off the pool &mdash; which is sometimes
enormous.
</p>
<p>They tell an anecdote of a 'cute Yankee, who won invariably and
immensely at the game.  There seemed to be a sort of magical or
mesmeric attraction for the flies to his lump.  At length it was as-certained that he touched the lump with his finger, after having smeared
it with something that naturally and irresistibly attracts flies whenever
they can get at it.  I am told that this game is also played in England; if
so, the parties must insist upon fresh lumps of sugar, and prevent all
touching.</p>


<pb n="247"/>


<p>The reader will probably ask &mdash; what next will gamblers think of
betting on?  But I can tell of a still more curious source of gambling
infatuation.  In the <hi rend="italic">Oxford Magazine</hi>,[93] is the following
statement: &mdash;
</p>
<note place="foot" n="93"><p>[93] Vol. V.
</p></note>
<p>`A few days ago, as some sprigs of nobility were dining together
at a tavern, they took the following conceit into their heads after dinner.
One of them observing a maggot come from a filbert, which seemed to
be uncommonly large, attempted to get it from his companion, who, not
choosing to let it go, was immediately offered five guineas for it, which
was accepted.  He then proposed to run it against any other two maggots
that could be produced at table.  Matches were accordingly made, and
these poor reptiles were the means of &pound;500 being won and lost in
a few minutes!'


THE CRIMES OF AMERICAN GAMBLERS.<lb/>

</p><p>Suicides, duels, and murders have frequently resulted from
gambling here as elsewhere.  Many of the duels in dark rooms originate
in disputes at the gaming table.  The combatants rush from play to an
upper or adjoining room, and settle their

<pb n="248"/>
difference with revolver-shots, often fatal to both.
</p>
<p>One of these was a serio-comic affair which is perhaps worth
relating.  Two players had a gambling dispute, and resolved to settle it in
a dark room with pistols.  The door was locked and one of them fired,
but missed.  On this the other exclaimed &mdash; `Now, you rascal, I'll finish
you at my leisure.'  He then began to search for his opponent.  Three or
four times he walked stealthily round the room &mdash; but all in vain &mdash; he
could not find his man; he listened; he could not hear him breathe.
What had become of him?  `Oh!' at length he exclaimed &mdash; `Now I've
got you, you  &mdash;  &mdash;  sneak &mdash; here goes!' `Hold!  Hold!' cried a voice
from the chimney, `Don't fire!  I'll pay you anything. &mdash; Do take away
that  &mdash;  &mdash;  pistol.'  In effect his adversary held the muzzle of his pistol
close to the seat of honour as the fellow stood stuffed up the chimney!
</p>
<p>`You'll pay, will you?' said the former; `Very well &mdash; 800 dollars --is 't a bargain?'
</p>
<p>`Yes, yes!' gasped the voice in the chimney.
</p>
<p>`Very well,' rejoined the tormentor, `but just wait a bit; I must
have a voucher.  I'll just cut off the bottom of your breeches by way of
voucher.'

<pb n="249"/>
So saying he pulled out his knife and suited the action to the words.
</p>
<p>`Now get down,' he said, `and out with the money;' which was
paid, when the above-named voucher was returned to the chimney-groper.
</p>
<p>The town of Vicksburg, on the Mississippi, was formerly notorious
as the rendezvous of all sorts of desperadoes.  It was a city of men; you
saw no women, except at night; and never any children.  Vicksburg was
a sink of iniquity; and there gambling raged with unrestricted fury.  It
was always after touching at Vicksburg that the Mississippi boats became
the well-known scene of gambling &mdash; some of the Vicksburghers
invariably getting on board to ply their profession.
</p>
<p>On one occasion, one of these came on board, and soon induced
some of the passengers to proceed to the upper promenade-deck for
gambling.  Soon the stakes increased and a heap of gold was on the
table, when a dispute arose, in the midst of which one of the players
placed his hand on the stake.  Thereupon the Vicksburg gambler drew
his knife and plunged it into the hand of the former, with a terrible
imprecation.
</p>
<p>Throughout the Southern States, as before

<pb n="250"/>
observed, gambling prevailed to a very great extent, and its results were
often deplorable.
</p>
<p>A planter went to a gambling house, accompanied by one of his
negroes, whom he left at the door to wait his return.  Whilst the master
was gambling the slave did the same with another whom he found at the
door.  Meanwhile a Mexican came up and stood by looking at the game
of the negroes.  By-and-by one of them accused the other of cheating,
which was denied, when the Mexican interposed and told the negro that
he saw him cheat.  The latter told the Mexican that he lied &mdash; whereupon
the Mexican stabbed him to the heart, killing him on the spot.
</p>
<p>Soon the negro's master came out, and on being informed of the
affair, turned to the Mexican, saying &mdash; `Now, sir, we must settle the
matter between us &mdash; my negro's quarrel is mine.'  `Agreed,' said the
Mexican; they entered the house, proceeded to a dark room, fired at
each other, and both were killed.
</p>
<p>About six and twenty years ago there lived in New York a well-to-do merchant, of the name of Osborne, who had an only son, who was a
partner in the concern.  The young man fell in love with

<pb n="251"/>
the daughter of a Southern planter, then on a visit at New York, to
whom he engaged himself to be married, with the perfect consent of all
parties concerned.
</p>
<p>On the return of the planter and his daughter, young Osborne
accompanied them to Mobile.  On the very night of their arrival, the
planter proposed to his intended son-in-law to visit the gaming table.
They went; Osborne was unlucky; and after some hours' play lost an
immense amount to the father of his sweetheart.  He gave bills, drawn
on his house, in payment of the debt of honour.
</p>
<p>On the following morning the planter referred to the subject,
hinting that Osborne must be ruined.
</p>
<p>`Indeed, I am!' said the young man; `but the possession of your
daughter will console me for the calamity, which, I doubt not, I shall be
able to make up for by industry and exertion.'
</p>
<p>`The possession of <hi rend="italic">*my</hi> daughter?' exclaimed the
planter; `do you think I would marry my daughter to a beggar?  No, no,
sir, the affair is ended between you &mdash; and I insist upon its being utterly
broken off.'  Such was the action of the heartless gambler, rendered
callous to all sentiments of real honour by his debasing pursuit.


<pb n="252"/>

</p>
<p>Young Osborne was equal to the occasion.  Summoning all his
powers to manfully bear this additional shock of fate, he calmly
replied: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`So be it, sir, as you wish it.  Depend upon it, however, that my
bills will be duly honoured' &mdash; and so saying he bowed and departed,
without even wishing to take leave of his betrothed.
</p>
<p>On returning to New York Osborne immediately disclosed the
transaction to his father, who, in spite of the utter ruin which impended,
and the brutality of the cause of the ruin, resolved to meet the bills when
due, and maintain the honour of his son &mdash; whatever might be the
consequences to himself.
</p>
<p>The bills were paid; the concern was broken up; old Mr Osborne
soon died broken-hearted; and young Osborne went as clerk to some
house of business in Wall Street.
</p>
<p>A year or so passed away, and one day a lady presented herself at
the old house of Osborne &mdash; now no longer theirs &mdash; inquiring for young
Osborne.  She was directed to his new place of business; being no other
than his betrothed, who loved him as passionately as ever, and to whom
her father had accounted for the non-fulfilment of the

<pb n="253"/>
engagement in a very unsatisfactory manner.  Of course Osborne could
not fail to be delighted at this proof of her devotedness; the meeting was
most affectionate on both sides; and, with the view of coming to a
decision respecting their future proceedings, they adjourned to an hotel
in the vicinity.  Here, whilst seated at a table and in earnest con-versation, the young lady's father rushed in, and instantly shot down
Osborne, who expired at his feet.  With a frantic shriek the poor girl fell
on the body of her betrothed, and finding a poniard or a knife concealed
in his breast, she seized it, instantly plunged it into her heart, and was
soon a corpse beside her lover.</p>

CHAPTER X.
<lb/>
LADY GAMESTRESSES.
</head>

<p>THE passions of the two sexes are similar in the main; the
distinctions between them result less from nature than from education.
Often we meet with women, especially the literary sort, who seem
veritable men, if not so, as the lawyers say, `to all intents and purposes;'
and often we meet with men, especially town-dandies, who can only be
compared to very ordinary women.
</p>
<p>Almost all the ancients had the bad taste to speak ill of women;
among the rest even that delightful old Father `of the golden mouth,' St
Chrysostom.[94]  So that, evidently, Dr Johnson's fierce dictum cannot
apply universally &mdash; `Only scoundrels speak ill of women.'
</p>
<note place="foot" n="94"><p>[94] Hom. II.</p></note>
<p>Seneca took the part of women, exclaiming: &mdash;

<pb n="255"/>
`By no means believe that their souls are inferior to ours, or that they
are less endowed with the virtues.  As for honour, it is equally great and
energetic among them.'
</p>
<p>A foreign lady was surprised at beholding the equality established
between the men and women at Sparta; whereupon the wife of Leonidas,
the King of Sparta, said to her: &mdash; `Do you not know that it is we who
bring forth the men?  It is not the fathers, but the mothers, that
effectually form the heart.'
</p>
<p>Napoleon seems to have formed what may be called a professional
estimate of women.  When the demonstrative Madame de Sta&euml;l
asked him &mdash; evidently expecting him to pay her a compliment &mdash; `Whom
do you think the greatest woman dead or alive?'  Napoleon replied,
`Her, Madame, <hi rend="italic">*who has borne most sons</hi>.'  Nettled by this
sarcastic reply, she returned to the charge, observing, `It is said you are
not friendly to the sex.'  Napoleon was her match again; `Madame,' he
exclaimed, `I am passionately fond of my wife;' and off he walked.
Assuredly it would not mend matters in this world (or the next) if all
men were Napoleons and all women de Sta&euml;ls.


<pb n="256"/>

</p>
<p>If we consider the question in other points of view, have there
been, proportionally, fewer celebrated women than illustrious men?
fewer great queens than truly great kings?  Compare, on all sides, the
means and the circumstances; count the reigns, and decide.
</p>
<p>The fact is that this question has been argued only by tyrannical or
very silly men, who found it difficult to get rid of the absurd prejudices
which retain the finest half of human nature in slavery, and condemn it
to obscurity under the pretext that it is essentially corrupted.  Towards
the end of the 15th century a certain demented writer attempted to prove
that women do not even deserve the title of reasonable creatures, which
in the original sounds oddly enough, namely, <hi rend="italic">probare nititur
mulieres non homines esse</hi>.  Another, a very learned Jesuit,
endeavoured to demonstrate that women have no souls!  Some say that
women surpass us in wickedness; others, that they are both worse and
better than men.
</p>
<p>That morbid wretch, Alexander Pope, said, `Every woman is at
heart a rake;' and a recent writer in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> puts more
venom in the dictum by saying, `Every woman is (or likes) at heart a

<pb n="257"/>
rake.'  Both these opinions may be set down as mere claptrap, witty, but
vile.
</p>
<p>But a truce to such insults against those who beautify the earth;
<hi rend="italic">*their</hi> vices cannot excuse ours.  It is we who have depraved
them by associating them with excesses which are repugnant to their
delicacy.  The contagion, however, has not affected all of them.  Among
our `plebeians,' and even among nobility, many women remind us of the
modesty and courage of those ancient republican matrons, who, so to
speak, founded, the manners and morals of their country; and among all
classes of the community there are thousands who inspire their husbands
with generous impulses in the battle of life, either by cheering words of
comfort, or by that mute eloquence of duties well fulfilled, which
nothing can resist if we are worthy of the name of men.  How many a
gambler has been reformed by the tender appeals of a good and devoted
wife.  `Venerable women!' one of them exclaims, `in whatever rank
Heaven has placed you, receive my homage.'  The gentleness of your
souls smooths down the roughness of ours and checks its violence.
Without your virtues what would we be?  Without

<pb n="258"/>
<hi rend="italic">*you</hi>, my dear wife, what would have become of me?  You
beheld the beginning and the end of the gaming fury in me, which I now
detest; and it is not to me, but to you alone, that the victory must be
ascribed.'[95]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="95"><p>[95] Dusaulx, <hi rend="italic">De la Passion du
Jeu</hi>.</p></note>
<p>A very pretty anecdote is told of such a wife and a gaming
husband.
</p>
<p>In order to simplify the signs of loss and gain, so as not to be
overburdened with the weight of gold and silver, the French players used
to carry the representation of their fortunes in small boxes, more or less
elegant.  A lady (who else could have thought of such a device?),
trembling for the fate of her husband, made him a present of one of
these dread boxes.  This little master-piece of conjugal and maternal
affection represented a wife in the attitude of supplication, and weeping
children, seeming to say to their father &mdash; <hi rend="italic">*Think of

</p>
<p>It is, therefore, only with the view of avenging good and
honourable women, that I now proceed to speak of those who have
disgraced their sex.
</p>
<p>I have already described a remarkable gamestress &mdash; the Persian
Queen Parysatis.[96]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="96"><p>[96] Chapter III.</p></note>

<p>There were no gamestresses among the Greeks; and the Roman
women were always too much occupied with their domestic affairs to
find time for play.  What will our modern ladies think, when I state that
the Emperor Augustus scarcely wore a garment which had not been
woven by his wife, his sister, or grand-daughters.[97]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="97"><p>[97] Veste non temer&egrave; ali&acirc;
qu&agrave;m domestic&acirc; usus est, ab uxore et fili&acirc;
nepotibusque confect&acirc;.  Suet. <hi rend="italic">in Vit&acirc;

<p>Although deeply corrupted under Nero and the sovereigns that
resembled him, the Roman women never gambled among themselves
except during the celebration of the festival of the Bona Dea.  This
ceremonial, so often profaned with licentiousness, was not attended by
desperate gambling.  The most depraved women abstained from it, even
when that mania was at its height, not only around the Capitol, but even
in the remainder of the Empire.  Contemporary authors, who have not
spared the Roman ladies, never reproached them with this vice, which,
in modern times, has been desperately practised by women who in
licentiousness vied with Messalina.
</p>
<p>In France, women who wished to gamble were, at first, obliged to
keep the thing secret; for if it

<pb n="260"/>
became known they lost caste.  In the reign of Louis XIV., and still
more in that of Louis XV., they became bolder, and the wives of the
great engaged in the deepest play in their mansions; but still a gamestress
was always denounced with horror.  `Such women,' says La
Bruyi&egrave;re, `make us chaste; they have nothing of the sex but its
garments.'
</p>
<p>By the end of the 18th century, gamestresses became so numerous
that they excited no surprise, especially among the higher classes; and
the majority of them were notorious for unfair play or downright
cheating.  A stranger once betted on the game of a lady at a gaming-table, who claimed a stake although on a losing card.  Out of con-sideration for the distinguished trickstress, the banker wished to pay the
stranger as well; but the latter with a blush, exclaimed &mdash; `Possibly
madame won, but as for myself, I am quite sure that I lost.'
</p>
<p>But if women cheated at play, they also frequently lost; and were
often reduced to beggary, or to what is far viler, to sacrifice, not only
their own honour, but that of their daughters.
</p>
<p>Gaming sometimes led to other crimes.  The

<pb n="261"/>
Countess of Schwiechelt, a young and beautiful lady from Hanover, was
much given to gambling, and lost 50,000 livres at Paris.  In order to
repair this great loss, she planned and executed the robbery of a fine
coronet of emeralds, the property of Madame Demidoff.  She had made
herself acquainted with the place where it was kept, and at a ball given
by its owner the Hanoverian lady contrived to purloin it.  Her youth and
rank in life induced many persons to solicit her pardon; but Buonaparte
left her to the punishment to which she was condemned.  This occurred
in 1804.
</p>
<p>In England, too, the practice of gambling was fraught with the
worst consequences to the finest feelings and best qualities of the sex.
The chief danger is very plainly hinted at in the comedy of <hi rend="italic">The
Provoked Husband</hi>.

</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Lord Townley</hi>. &mdash; 'Tis not your ill hours that always
distract me, but, as often, the ill company that occasions those hours.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Lady Townley</hi>. &mdash; Sure I don't understand you now,
my lord.  What ill company do I keep?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Lord Townley</hi>. &mdash; Why, at best, women that lose their
money, and men that win it; <hi rend="italic">or, perhaps, men that are voluntary
bubbles at one game, in hopes a lady will give them fair play at
another.</hi>

</p>
<p>`The facts,' says Mr Massey,[98] `confirm the

<pb n="262"/>
theory.  Walpole's Letters and Mr Jesse's volumes on George Selwyn
and his Contemporaries, teem with allusions to proved or understood
cases of matrimonial infidelity; and the manner in which notorious
irregularities were brazened out, shows that the offenders did not always
encounter the universal reprobation of society.
</p>
<note place="foot" n="98"><p>[98] History of England, ii.</p></note>
<p>`Whist was not much in vogue until a later period, and was far too
abstruse and slow to suit the depraved taste which required unadulterated
stimulants.'
</p>
<p>The ordinary stakes at these mixed assemblies would, at the
present day, be considered high, even at the clubs where a rubber is still
allowed.
</p>
<p>`The consequences of such gaming were often still more
lamentable than those which usually attended such practices.  It would
happen that a lady lost more than she could venture to confess to her
husband or father.  Her creditor was probably a fine gentleman, or she
became indebted to some rich admirer for the means of discharging her
liabilities.  In either event, the result may be guessed.  In the one case,
the debt of honour was liquidated on the old principle of the law-mer-chant, according to which there was but one alter

<pb n="263"/>
native to payment in purse.  In the other, there was likewise but one
mode in which the acknowledgment of obligation by a fine woman would
be acceptable to a man of the world.'
</p>
<p>`The pernicious consequences of gambling to the nation at large,'
says another writer, `would have been intolerable enough had they been
confined to the stronger sex; but, unfortunately, the women of the day
were equally carried away by this criminal infatuation.  The disgusting
influence of this sordid vice was so disastrous to female minds, that they
lost their fairest distinction and privileges, together with the blushing
honours of modesty.  Their high gaming was necessarily accompanied
with great losses.  If all their resources, regular and irregular, honest
and fraudulent, were dissipated, still, <hi rend="italic">*game-debts must be
paid!</hi>  The cunning winner was no stranger to the necessities of the
case.  He hinted at <hi rend="italic">commutations</hi> &mdash; which were not to be
refused.
 </p>
<lg type="poem"><l>&ldquo;So tender these, &mdash; if debts crowd fast upon her,
 </l>
<l>  She'll pawn her <hi rend="italic">virtue</hi> to preserve her
<hi rend="italic">honour!</hi>&amp;&rdquo;</l></lg>

<p>Thus, the last invaluable jewel of female possession was
unavoidably resigned.  That was indeed the

<pb n="264"/>
forest of all evils, hut an evil to which every deep gamestress was
inevitably exposed.'
</p>
<p>Hogarth strikingly illustrated this phase of womanhood in England,
in his small picture painted for the Earl of Charlemont, and entitled
`<hi rend="italic">Picquet, or Virtue in Danger</hi>.'  It shows a young lady, who,
during a <hi rend="italic">t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</hi>, had just lost all her
money to a handsome officer of her own age.  He is represented in the
act of returning her a handful of bank-bills, with the hope of exchanging
them for another acquisition and more delicate plunder.  On the
chimney-piece are a watch-case and a figure of Time, over it this motto --<hi rend="italic">Nunc</hi>, `Now!'  Hogarth has caught his heroine during this
moment of hesitation &mdash; this struggle with herself &mdash; and has expressed
her feelings with uncommon success.
</p>
<p>But, indeed, the thing was perfectly understood.  In the
<hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> (No. 120) we read: &mdash; `All play-debts must be paid
in specie or by equivalent.  The &ldquo;man&amp;&rdquo; that plays beyond
his income pawns his estate; the &ldquo;woman&amp;&rdquo; must find out
something else to mortgage when her pin-money is gone.  The husband
has his lands to dispose of; the wife her person.  Now when the female
body is once dipped,

<pb n="265"/>
if the creditor be very importunate, I leave my reader to consider the
consequences.' . . . .
</p>
<p>A lady was married when very young to a noble lord, the honour
and ornament of his country, who hoped to preserve her from the
contagion of the times by his own example, and, to say the truth, she
had every good quality that could recommend her to the bosom of a man
of discernment and worth.  But, alas! how frail and short are the joys of
mortals!  One unfortunate hour ruined his darling visionary scheme of
happiness: she was introduced to an infamous woman, was drawn into
play, liked it, and, as the unavoidable consequence, she was ruined, &mdash;
having lost more in one night than would have maintained a hundred
useful families for a twelvemonth; and, dismal to tell, she felt compelled
to sacrifice her virtue to the wretch who had won her money, in order to
recover the loss!  From this moment she might well exclaim &mdash;
</p>
<l>`Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!'</l>
<p>
The affectionate wife, the agreeable companion, the indulgent mistress,
were now no more.  In vain she flattered herself that the injury she had
done her husband would for ever remain one of

<pb n="266"/>
those secrets which can only be disclosed at the last day.  Vengeance
pursued her steps, she was lost; the villain to whom she had sacrificed
herself boasted of the favours he had received.  The fatal report was
conveyed to her injured husband.  He refused to believe what he thought
impossible, but honour obliged him to call the boaster to the field.  The
wretch received the challenge with much more contentment than concern;
as he had resolution enough to murder any man whom he had injured, so
he was certain, if he had the good fortune to conquer his antagonist, he
should be looked upon as the head of all modern bucks and bloods &mdash;
esteemed by the men as a brave fellow, and admired by the ladies as a
fine gentleman and an agreeable rake.  The meeting took place &mdash; the
profligate gambler not content with declaring, actually exulted in his
guilt.  But his triumph was of short date &mdash; a bullet through the head
settled his account with this world.
</p>
<p>The husband, after a long conflict in his bosom, between justice
and mercy, tenderness and rage, resolved &mdash; on what is very seldom
practised by an English husband &mdash; to pardon his wife, conceal her
crime, and preserve her, if possible, from utter de

<pb n="267"/>
struction.  But the gates of mercy were opened in vain &mdash; the offender
refused to receive forgiveness because she had offended.  The lust of
gambling had absorbed all her other desires.  She gave herself up
entirely to the infamous pursuit and its concomitants, whilst her husband
sank by a quick decay, and died the victim of grief and anguish.[99]
</p><note place="foot" n="99"><p>[99] Doings in London.</p></note>
<p>Of other English gamestresses, however, nothing but the ordinary
success or inconveniences of gambling are recorded.  In the year 1776, a
lady at the West End lost one night, at a sitting, 3000 guineas at
Loo.[100]  Again, a lady having won a rubber of 20 guineas from a city
merchant, the latter pulled out his pocket-book, and tendered &pound;21
in bank notes.  The fair gamestress, with a disdainful toss of the head,
observed &mdash; `In the great houses which I frequent, sir, we always use
gold.'  `That may be, madam,' said the gentleman, `but, in the
<hi rend="italic">*little</hi> houses which I frequent, we always use paper.'
</p>
<note place="foot" n="100"><p>[100] Annual Register.</p></note>
<p>Goldsmith mentions an old lady in the country who, having been
given over by her physician, played with the curate of the parish to pass
the

<pb n="268"/>
time away.  Having won all his money, she next proposed playing for
the funeral charges to which she would be liable.  Unfortunately, the
lady expired just as she had taken up the game!
</p>
<p>A lady who was desperately fond of play was confessing herself.
The priest represented, among other arguments against gaming, the great
loss of time it occasioned.  `Ah!' said the lady, `that is what vexes me &mdash;
so much time lost in shuffling the cards!'
</p>
<p>The celebrated Mrs Crewe seems to have been fond of gaming.
Charles James Fox ranked among her admirers.  A gentleman lost a
considerable sum to this lady at play; and being obliged to leave town
suddenly, he gave Fox the money to pay her, begging him to apologize
to the lady for his not having paid the debt of honour in person.  Fox
unfortunately lost every shilling of it before morning.  Mrs Crewe often
met the supposed debtor afterwards, and, surprised that he never noticed
the circumstance, at length delicately hinted the matter to him.  `Bless
me,' said he, `I paid the money to Mr Fox three months ago!'  `Oh, you
did, sir?' said Mrs Crewe good-naturedly, `then probably he paid me and
I forgot it.'


<pb n="269"/>

</p>
<p>This famous Mrs Crewe was the wife of Mr Crewe, who was
created, in 1806, Lord Crewe.  She was as remarkable for her
accomplishments and her worth as for her beauty; nevertheless she
permitted the admiration of the profligate Fox, who was in the rank of
her admirers, and she was a gamestress, as were most of the grand
ladies in those days.  The lines Fox wrote on her were not exaggerated.
They began thus: &mdash; </p>

<lg type="poem">
<l>`Where the loveliest expression to features is join'd,
 </l>
<l> By Nature's most delicate pencil design'd;
 </l>
<l> Where blushes unhidden, and smiles without art,
 </l>
<l> Speak the softness and feeling that dwell in the heart,
 </l>
<l> Where in manners enchanting no blemish we trace,
 </l>
<l> But the soul keeps the promise we had from the face;
 </l>
<l> Sure philosophy, reason, and coldness must prove
 </l>
<l> Defences unequal to shield us from love.'</l>

</lg>
<p>`Nearly eight years after the famous election at Westminster, when
she personally canvassed for Fox, Mrs Crewe was still in perfection,
with a son one-and-twenty, who looked like her brother.  The form of
her face was exquisitely lovely, her complexion radiant.  &ldquo;I know
not,&amp;&rdquo; Miss Burney writes, &ldquo;any female in her first youth
who could bear the comparison.  She <hi rend="italic">*uglifies</hi> every one
near her.&amp;&rdquo;


<pb n="270"/>

</p>
<p>`This charming partisan of Fox had been active in his cause; and
her originality of character, her good-humour, her recklessness of
consequences, made her a capital canvasser.'[101]

THE GAMBLING BARROW-WOMEN.<lb/>

</p><p>In 1776 the barrow-women of London used generally to carry dice
with them, and children were induced to throw for fruit and nuts.  How-ever, the pernicious consequences of the practice beginning to be felt,
the Lord Mayor issued an order to apprehend all such offenders, which
speedily put an end to such street-gambling.  At the present day a sort of
roulette is used for the same purpose by the itinerant caterers to the
sweetmeat and fruit-loving little ones.


GAMESTRESSES AT BADEN-BADEN.<lb/>


</p><p>Mrs Trollope has described two specimens of the modern
gamestresses at the German watering-places, one of whom seems to have
specially attracted her notice: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`There was one of this set,' she says, `whom I watched, day after
day, during the whole period of

<pb n="271"/>
our stay, with more interest than, I believe, was reasonable; for had I
studied any other as attentively I might have found less to lament.
</p>
<p>`She was young &mdash; certainly not more than twenty-five &mdash; and,
though not regularly nor brilliantly handsome, most singularly winning
both in person and demeanour.  Her dress was elegant, but peculiarly
plain and simple, &mdash; a close white silk bonnet and gauze veil; a quiet-coloured silk gown, with less of flourish and frill, by half, than any
other person; a delicate little hand which, when ungloved, displayed
some handsome rings; a jewelled watch, of peculiar splendour; and a
countenance expressive of anxious thoughtfulness &mdash; must be remembered
by many who were at Baden in August, 1833.  They must remember,
too, that, enter the rooms when they would, morning, noon, or night,
still they found her nearly at the same place at the <hi rend="italic">Rouge et
Noir</hi> table.
</p>
<p>`Her husband, who had as unquestionably the air of a gentleman as
she had of a lady, though not always close to her, was never very
distant.  He did not play himself, and I fancied, as he hovered near her,
that his countenance expressed anxiety.  But he returned her sweet smile,
with which she

<pb n="272"/>
always met his eye, with an answering smile; and I saw not the slightest
indication that he wished to withdraw her from the table.
</p>
<p>`There was an expression in the upper part of her face that my
blundering science would have construed into something very foreign to
the propensity she showed; but there she sat, hour after hour, day after
day, not even allowing the blessed sabbath, that gives rest to all, to bring
it to her; &mdash; there she sat, constantly throwing down handfuls of five-franc pieces, and sometimes drawing them back again, till her young
face grew rigid from weariness, and all the lustre of her eye faded into a
glare of vexed inanity.  Alas! alas! is that fair woman a mother?  God
forbid!
</p>
<p>`Another figure at the gaming table, which daily drew our
attention, was a pale, anxious old woman, who seemed no longer to have
strength to conceal her eager agitation under the air of callous
indifference, which all practised players endeavour to assume.  She
trembled, till her shaking hand could hardly grasp the instrument with
which she pushed or withdrew her pieces; the dew of agony stood upon
her wrinkled brow; yet, hour after hour, and day after day, she too sat in
the en

<pb n="273"/>
chanted chair.  I never saw age and station in a position so utterly
beyond the pale of respect.  I was assured she was a person of rank; and
my informant added, but I trust she was mistaken, that she was an
<hi rend="italic">*English</hi> woman.'[102]

GAMING HOUSES KEPT BY LADIES.<lb/>


</p><p>There is no doubt that during the last half of the last century many
titled ladies not only gambled, but kept gaming houses.  There is even
evidence that one of them actually appealed to the House of Lords for
protection against the intrusion of the peace officers into her
establishment in Covent Garden, on the plea of her Peerage!  All this is
proved by a curious record found in the Journals of the House of Lords,
by the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Athen&aelig;um</hi>.  It is as follows: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`Die Lun&aelig;, 29&deg; Aprilis, 1745. &mdash;
<hi rend="italic">Gaming</hi>.  A Bill for preventing the excessive and deceitful
use of it having been brought from the Commons, and proceeded on so
far as to be agreed to in a Committee of the whole House with
amendments, &mdash; information was given to the House that Mr Burdus,
Chairman of the Quarter Sessions for the city and

<pb n="274"/>
liberty of Westminster, Sir Thomas de Veil, and Mr Lane, Chairman of
the Quarter Sessions for the county of Middlesex, were at the door; they
were called in, and at the Bar severally gave an account that claims of
privilege of Peerage were made and insisted on by the Ladies
Mordington and Casselis, in order to intimidate the peace officers from
doing their duty in suppressing the public gaming houses kept by the said
ladies.  And the said Burdus thereupon delivered in an instrument in
writing under the hand of the said Lady Mordington, containing the
claim she made of privilege for her officers and servants employed by
her in her said gaming house.  And then they were directed to withdraw.
And the said instrument was read as follows: &mdash; &ldquo;I, Dame Mary,
Baroness of Mordington, do hold a house in the Great Piazza, Covent
Garden, for and as an Assembly, where all persons of credit are at
liberty to frequent and play at such diversions as are used at other
Assemblys.  And I have hired Joseph Dewberry, William Horsely, Ham
Cropper, and George Sanders as my servants or managers (under me)
thereof.  I have given them orders to direct the management of the other
inferior servants (namely): John Bright, Richard

<pb n="275"/>
Davis, John Hill, John Vandenvoren, as box-keepers, &mdash; Gilbert
Richardson, housekeeper, John Chaplain, regulator, William Stanley and
Henry Huggins, servants that wait on the company at the said Assembly,
William Penny and Joseph Penny as porters thereof.  And all the above-mentioned persons I claim as my domestick servants, and demand all
those privileges that belong to me as a peeress of Great Britain
appertaining to my said Assembly.  M. MORDINGTON.  Dated 8th
Jan., 1744.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`Resolved and declared that no person is entitled to privilege of
Peerage against any prosecution or proceeding for keeping any public or
common gaming house, or any house, room, or place for playing at any
game or games prohibited by any law now in force.'
</p>
<p>That such practice continued in vogue is evident from the police
proceedings subsequently taken against




THE FAMOUS LADY BUCKINGHAMSHIRE.<lb/>

</p>
<p>This notorious gamestress of St James's Square, at the close of the
last century, actually slept with a blunderbuss and a pair of pistols at her
side, to protect her Faro bank.


<pb n="276"/>

</p>
<p>On the 11th of March, 1797, her Ladyship, together with Lady E.
Lutterell and a Mrs Sturt, were convicted at the Marlborough Street
Police-court, in the penalty of &pound;50, for playing at the game of
Faro; and Henry Martindale was convicted in the sum of &pound;200,
for keeping the Faro table at Lady Buckinghamshire's.  The witnesses
had been servants of her Ladyship, recently discharged on account of a
late extraordinary loss of 500 guineas from her Ladyship's house,
belonging to the Faro bank.[103]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="103"><p>[103] The case is reported in the
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of March 13th, 1797.  One cannot help being struck
with the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper at that period &mdash;
70 years ago.  It was printed on one small sheet, about equal to a single
page of the present issue, and contained four pages, two of which were
advertisements, while the others gave only a short summary of news &mdash;
no leader at all.</p></note>
<p>In the same year, the croupier at the Countess of
Buckinghamshire's one night announced the unaccountable disappearance
of the cash-box of the Faro bank.  All eyes were turned towards her
Ladyship.  Mrs Concannon said she once lost a gold snuff-box from the
table, while she went to speak to Lord C &mdash; .  Another lady said she lost
her purse there last winter.  And a story was told that a certain lady had
taken, <hi rend="italic">*by mistake</hi>, a cloak

<pb n="277"/>
which did not belong to her, at a rout given by the Countess of  &mdash;  &mdash; .
Unfortunately a discovery of the cloak was made, and when the servant
knocked at the door to demand it, some very valuable lace which it was
trimmed with had been taken off.  Some surmised that the lady who stole
the cloak might also have stolen the Faro bank cash-box.
</p>
<p>Soon after, the same Martindale, who had kept the Faro bank at
Lady Buckinghamshire's, became a bankrupt, and his debts amounted to
&pound;328,000, besides `debts of honour,' which were struck off to the
amount of &pound;150,000.  His failure is said to have been owing to
misplaced confidence in a subordinate, who robbed him of thousands.
The first suspicion was occasioned by his purchasing an estate of
&pound;500 a year; but other purchases followed to a considerable
extent; and it was soon discovered that the Faro bank had been robbed
sometimes of 2000 guineas a week!  On the 14th of April, 1798, other
arrears, to a large amount, were submitted to, and rejected by, the
Commissioners in Bankruptcy, who declared a first dividend of one
shilling and five-pence in the pound.[104]

CHAPTER XI.
<lb/>
GAMBLING POETS, SAVANTS, PHILOSOPHERS, WITS, AND
STATESMEN.
</head>

<p>PERHAPS the stern moralist who may have turned over these
pages has frowned at the facts of the preceding chapter.  If so, I know
not what he will do at those which I am about to record.
</p>
<p>If it may be said that gamesters must be madmen, or rogues, how
has it come to pass that men of genius, talent, and virtue withal, have
been gamesters?
</p>
<p>Men of genius, `gifted men,' as they are called, are much to be
pitied.  One of them has said &mdash; `Oh! if my pillow could reveal my
sufferings last night!'  His was true grief &mdash; for it had no witness.[105]
The endowments of this nature of ours are so strangely mixed &mdash; the
events of our lives are

<pb n="280"/>
so unexpectedly ruled, that one might almost prefer to have been
fashioned after those imaginary beings who act so
<hi rend="italic">consistently</hi> in the nursery tales and other figments.  Most
men seem to have a double soul; and in your men of genius &mdash; your
celebrities &mdash; the battle between the two seems like the tremendous
conflict so grandly (and horribly) described by Milton.  Who loved his
country more than Cato?  Who cared more for his country's honour?
And yet Cato was not only unable to resist the soft impeachments of
alcohol &mdash;  </p>
<lg type="poem">

<l>Narratur et prisci Catonis </l>
<l>S&aelig;p&egrave; mero caluisse virtus &mdash; </l>
</lg>
<p>but he was also a dice-player, a gambler.[106]</p>
<note place="foot" n="105"><p>[105] Ille dolet ver&eacute; qui sine teste

<note place="foot" n="106"><p>[106] Plutarch, <hi rend="italic">Cato.</hi></p></note>
<p>Julius C&aelig;sar did not drink; but what a profligate he was!
And I have no doubt that he was a gambler: it is certain that he got rid
of millions nobody knew how.
</p>
<p>I believe, however, that the following is an undeniable fact.  You
may find suspicious gamesters in every rank of life, but among men of
genius you will generally, if not always, find only victims resigned to the
caprices of fortune.  The

<pb n="281"/>
professions which imply the greatest enthusiasm naturally furnish the
greater number of gamesters.  Thus, perhaps, we may name ten poet-gamesters to one savant or philosopher who deserved the title or infamy.
</p>
<p>Coquillart, a poet of the 15th century, famous for his satirical
verses against women, died of grief after having ruined himself by
gaming.  The great painter Guido &mdash; and a painter is certainly a poet &mdash;
was another example.  By nature gentle and honourable, he might have
been the most fortunate of men if the demon of gambling had not
poisoned his existence, the end of which was truly wretched.
</p>
<p>Rotrou, the acknowledged master of Corneille, hurried his poetical
effusions in order to raise money for gambling.  This man of genius was
but a spoilt child in the matter of play.  He once received two or three
hundred <hi rend="italic">louis</hi>, and mistrusting himself, went and hid them
under some vine-branches, in order not to gamble all away at once.
Vain precaution!  On the following night his bag was empty.
</p>
<p>The poet Voiture was the delight of his contemporaries,
conspicuous as he was for the most

<pb n="282"/>
exquisite polish and inexhaustible wit; but he was also one of the most
desperate gamesters of his time.  Like Rotrou, he mistrusted his folly,
and sometimes refrained.  `I have discovered,' he once wrote to a friend,
`as well as Aristotle, that there is no beatitude in play; and in fact I have
given over gambling; it is now seven months since I played &mdash; which is
very important news, and which I forgot to tell you.'  He would have
died rich had he always refrained.  His relapses were terrible; one night
he lost fifteen hundred pistoles (about &pound;750).
</p>
<p>The list of foreign poets ruined by gambling might be extended;
whilst, on the other hand, it is impossible, I believe, to quote a single
instance of the kind among the poets of England, &mdash; perhaps because very
few of them had anything to lose.  The reader will probably remember
Dr Johnson's exclamation on hearing of the large debt left unpaid by
poor Goldsmith at his death &mdash; `Was ever poet so trusted before!' . . .
</p>
<p>The great philosophers Montaigne and Descartes, seduced at an
early age by the allurements of gambling, managed at length to
overcome the evil, presenting examples of reformation &mdash; which

<pb n="283"/>
proves that this mania is not absolutely incurable.  Descartes became a
gamester in his seventeenth year; but it is said that the combinations of
cards, or the doctrine of probabilities, interested him more than his
winnings.[107]</p>

<note place="foot" n="107"><p>
[107] Hist.  des Philos. Modernes: <hi rend="italic">Descartes</hi>.</p></note>

<p>The celebrated Cardan, one of the most universal and most
eccentric geniuses of his age, declares in his autobiography, that the rage
for gambling long entailed upon him the loss of reputation and fortune,
and that it retarded his progress in the sciences.  `Nothing,' says he,
`could justify me, unless it was that my love of gaming was less than my
horror of privation.'  A very bad excuse, indeed; but Cardan reformed
and ceased to be a gambler.
</p>
<p>Three of the greatest geniuses of England &mdash; Lords Halifax,
Anglesey, and Shaftesbury &mdash; were gamblers; and Locke tells a very
funny story about one of their gambling bouts.  This philosopher, who
neglected nothing, however eccentric, that had any relation to the
working of the human understanding, happened to be present while my
Lords Halifax, Anglesey, and Shaftesbury were playing, and had the
patience to write down, word

<pb n="284"/>
for word, all their discordant utterances during the phases of the game;
the result being a dialogue of speakers who only used exclamations &mdash; all
talking in chorus, but more to themselves than to each other.  Lord
Anglesey observing Locke's occupation, asked him what he was writing.
`My Lord,' replied Locke, `I am anxious not to lose anything you utter.'
This irony made them all blush, and put an end to the game.
</p>
<p>M. Sallo, Counsellor to the Parliament of Paris, died, says Vigneul
de Marville, of a disease to which the children of the Muses are rarely
subject, and for which we find no remedy in Hippocrates and Galen; &mdash;
he died of a lingering disease after having lost 100,000 crowns at the
gaming table &mdash; all he possessed.  By way of diversion to his cankering
grief, he started the well-known <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savans</hi>, but lived
to write only 13 sheets of it, for he was wounded to the death.[108]

<p>The physician Paschasius Justus was a deplorable instance of an
incorrigible gambler.  This otherwise most excellent and learned man
having passed three-fourths of his life in a continual struggle with vice,
at length resolved to cure him

<pb n="285"/>
self of the disease by occupying his mind with a work which might be
useful to his contemporaries and posterity.[109]  He began his book, but
still he gamed; he finished it, but the evil was still in him.  `I have lost
everything but God!' he exclaimed.  He prayed for delivery from his
soul's disease;[110] but his prayer was not heard; he died like any
gambler &mdash; more wretched than reformed. </p>

<p>M. Dusaulx, author of a work on Gaming, exclaims therein &mdash; `I

<p>What, then, is that mania which can be overcome neither by the
love of glory nor the study of wisdom!
</p>
<p>The literary men of Greece and Rome rarely played any games but
those of skill, such as tennis, backgammon, and chess; and even in these
it was considered `indecent' to appear too skilful.  Cicero stigmatizes
two of his contemporaries for taking too

<pb n="286"/>
great a delight in such games, on account of their skill in playing
them.[112]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="112"><p>[112] Ast alii, qui&agrave;

<p>Quinctilian advised his pupils to avoid all sterile amusements,
which, he said, were only the resource of the ignorant.
</p>
<p>In after-times men of merit, such as John Huss and Cardinal
Cajetan, bewailed both the time lost in the most innocent games, and the
disastrous passions which are thereby excited.  Montaigne calls chess a
stupid and childish game.  `I hate and shun it,' he says, `because it
occupies one too seriously; I am ashamed of giving it the attention which
would be sufficient for some useful purpose.'  King James I., the British
Solomon, forbade chess to his son, in the famous book of royal
instruction which he wrote for him.
</p>
<p>As to the plea of `filling up time,' Addison has made some very
pertinent observations: &mdash; `Whether any kind of gaming has ever thus
much to say for itself, I shall not determine; but I think it is very
wonderful to see persons of the best sense passing away a dozen hours
together in shuffling and dividing a pack of cards, with no other
conversation but

<pb n="287"/>
what is made up of a few game-phrases, and no other ideas but those of
black or red spots ranged together in different figures.  Would not a man
laugh to hear any one of his species complaining that life is short?'
</p>
<p>Men of intellect may rest assured that whether they win or lose at
play, it will always be at the cost of their genius; the soul cannot support
two passions together.  The passion of play, although fatigued, is never
satiated, and therefore it always leaves behind protracted agitation.  The
famous Roman lawyer Sc&aelig;vola suffered from playing at
backgammon; his head was always affected by it, especially when he lost
the game, in fact, it seemed to craze him.  One day he returned
expressly from the country merely to try and convince his opponent in a
game which he had lost, that if he had played otherwise he would have
won!  It seems that on his journey home he mentally went through the
game again, detected his mistake, and could not rest until he went back
and got his adversary to admit the fact &mdash; for the sake of his <hi rend="italic">amour
propre</hi>.[113]</p>
<note place="foot" n="113"><p>[113] Quinctil., <hi rend="italic">Instit. Orat</hi>. lib.

<p>`It is rare,' says Rousseau, `that thinkers take

<pb n="288"/>
much delight in play, which suspends the habit of thinking or diverts it
upon sterile combinations; and so one of the benefits &mdash; perhaps the only
benefit conferred by the taste for the sciences, is that it somewhat
deadens that sordid passion of play.'
</p>
<p>Unfortunately such was not the result among the literary and
scientific men, in France or England, during the last quarter of the last
century.  Many of them bitterly lamented that they ever played, and yet
played on, &mdash; going through all the grades and degradations appointed for
his votaries by the inexorable demon of gambling.


BEAU NASH.<lb/>


</p><p>Nature had by no means formed Nash for <hi rend="italic">beau</hi>.  His
person was clumsy, large, and awkward; his features were harsh, strong,
and peculiarly irregular; yet even with these disadvantages he made love,
became an universal admirer of the sex, and was in his turn universally
admired.  The fact is, he was possessed of, at least, some requisites of a
`lover.'  He had assiduity, flattery, fine clothes &mdash; and as much wit as the
ladies he addressed.  Accordingly he used to say &mdash; `Wit, flattery, and
fine

<pb n="289"/>
clothes are enough to debauch a nunnery!'  This is certainly a fouler
calumny of women than Pope's

 </p>

<p>`Every woman is at heart a rake.'

</p>
<p>Beau Nash was a barrister, and had been a remarkable, a
distinguished one in his day &mdash; although not at the bar.  He had the
honour to organize and direct the last grand `revel and pageant' before a
king, in the Hall of the Middle Temple, of which he was a member.
</p>
<p>It had long been customary for the Inns of Court to entertain our
monarchs upon their accession to the crown with a revel and pageant,
and the last was exhibited in honour of King William, when Nash was
chosen to conduct the whole with proper decorum.  He was then a very
young man, but succeeded so well in giving satisfaction, that the king
offered to give him the honour of knighthood, which, however, Nash
declined, saying: &mdash; `Please your Majesty, if you intend to make me a
knight, I wish it may be one of your poor knights of Windsor; and then I
shall have a fortune at least able to support my title.'
</p>
<p>In the Middle Temple he managed to rise `to the very summit of
second-rate luxury,' and seems

<pb n="290"/>
to have succeeded in becoming a fashionable
<hi rend="italic">recherch&eacute;</hi>, being always one of those who were called
good company &mdash; a professed dandy among the
<hi rend="italic">&eacute;l&eacute;gants</hi>.
</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that we subsequently find him Master of the
Ceremonies at Bath, then the theatre of summer amusements for all
people of fashion.  It was here that he took to gambling, and was at first
classed among the needy adventurers who went to that place; there was,
however, the great difference between him and them, that his heart was
not corrupt; and though by profession a gamester, he was generous,
humane, and honourable.
</p>
<p>When he gave in his accounts to the Masters of the Temple,
among other items he charged was one &mdash; `For making one man happy,
&pound;10.'  Being questioned about the meaning of so strange an item,
he frankly declared that, happening to overhear a poor man declare to
his wife and large family of children that &pound;10 would make him
happy, he could not avoid trying the experiment.  He added, that, if they
did not choose to acquiesce in his charge, he was ready to refund the
money.  The Masters, struck with such an uncommon

<pb n="291"/>
instance of good nature, publicly thanked him for his benevolence, and
desired that the sum might be doubled as a proof of their satisfaction.
</p>
<p>`His laws were so strictly enforced that he was styled
&ldquo;King of Bath:&amp;&rdquo; no rank would protect the offender, nor
dignity of station condone a breach of the laws.  Nash desired the
Duchess of Queensberry, who appeared at a dress ball in an apron of
point-lace, said to be worth 500 guineas, to take it off, which she did, at
the same time desiring his acceptance of it; and when the Princess
Amelia requested to have one dance more after 11 o'clock, Nash replied
that the laws of Bath, like those of Lycurgus, were unalterable.  Gaming
ran high at Bath, and frequently led to disputes and resort to the sword,
then generally worn by well-dressed men.  Swords were, therefore,
prohibited by Nash in the public rooms; still they were worn in the
streets, when Nash, in consequence of a duel fought by torchlight, by
two notorious gamesters, made the law absolute, &ldquo;That no swords
should, on any account, be worn in Bath.&amp;&rdquo; '[114]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="114"><p>[114] The Book of Days, Feb. 3.</p></note>
<p>About the year 1739 the gamblers, in order to evade the laws
against gaming, set up E O tables;

<pb n="292"/>
and as these proved very profitable to the proprietors at Tunbridge, Nash
determined to introduce them at Bath, having been assured by the
lawyers that no law existed against them.  He therefore set up an E O
table, and the speculation flourished for a short time; but the legislature
interfered in 1745, and inflicted severe penalties on the keepers of such
tables.  This was the ruin of Nash's gambling speculation; and for the
remaining sixteen years of his life he depended solely on the precarious
products of the gaming table.  He died at Bath, in 1761, in greatly re-duced circumstances, being represented as `poor, old, and peevish, yet
still incapable of turning from his former manner of life.'
</p>
<p>`He was buried in the Abbey Church with great ceremony: a
solemn hymn was sung by the charity-school children, three clergymen
preceded the coffin, the pall was supported by aldermen, and the Masters
of the Assembly-Rooms followed as chief mourners; while the streets
were filled and the housetops covered with spectators, anxious to witness
the respect paid to the venerable founder of the prosperity of the city of
Bath.'[115]

<pb n="293"/>


<p>The following are the chief anecdotes told of Beau Nash.
</p>
<p>A giddy youth, who had resigned his fellowship at Oxford, brought
his fortune to Bath, and, without the smallest skill, won a considerable
sum; and following it up, in the next October added four thousand
pounds to his former capital.  Nash one night invited him to supper, and
offered to give him fifty guineas to forfeit twenty every time he lost two
hundred at one sitting.  The young man refused, and was at last undone.
</p>
<p>The Duke of B &mdash;  &mdash;  loved play to distraction.  One night,
chagrined at a heavy loss, he pressed Nash to tie him up from deep play
in future.  The beau accordingly gave his Grace one hundred guineas on
condition to receive ten thousand whenever he lost that amount at one
sitting.  The duke soon lost eight thousand at Hazard, and was going to
throw for three thousand more, when Nash caught the dice-box, and
entreated the peer to reflect on the penalty if he lost.  The duke desisted
for that time; but ere long, losing considerably at Newmarket, he
willingly paid the penalty.
</p>
<p>When the Earl of T &mdash;  &mdash;  was a youth he was

<pb n="294"/>
passionately fond of play.  Nash undertook to cure him.  Conscious of
his superior skill, he engaged the earl in single play.  His lordship lost
his estate, equipage, everything!  Our generous gamester returned all,
only stipulating for the payment of &pound;5000 whenever he might
think proper to demand it.  Some time after his lordship's death, Nash's
affairs being on the wane, he demanded it of his heirs, <hi rend="italic">*who paid it
without hesitation</hi>.
</p>
<p>Nash one day complained of his ill luck to the Earl of Chesterfield,
adding that he had lost &pound;500 the last night.  The earl replied, `I
don't wonder at your <hi rend="italic">*losing</hi> money, Nash, but all the world
is surprised where you get it to lose.'
</p>
<p>`The Corporation of Bath so highly respected Nash, that the
Chamber voted a marble statue of him, which was erected in the Pump-room, between the busts of Newton and Pope; this gave rise to a stinging
epigram by Lord Chesterfield, concluding with these lines: </p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>&ldquo;The <hi rend="italic">statue</hi> placed these busts between

<p>
THE EARL OF CHESTERFIELD.<lb/>

</p><p>Walpole tells us that the celebrated Earl of Chesterfield
<hi rend="italic">*lived</hi> at White's Club, gaming, and uttering witticisms
among the boys of quality; `yet he says to his son, that a member of a
gaming club should be a cheat, or he will soon be a beggar;' an
inconsistency which reminds one of old Fuller's saw &mdash; `A father that
whipt his son for swearing, and swore himself whilst he whipt him, did
more harm by his example than good by his correction.'


GEORGE SELWYN.<lb/>


</p><p>The character of Selwyn,' says Mr Jesse, `was in many respects a
remarkable one.  With brilliant wit, a quick perception of the ridiculous,
and a thorough knowledge of the world and human nature, he united
classical knowledge and a taste for the fine arts.  To these qualities may
be added others of a very contradictory nature.  With a thorough
enjoyment of the pleasures of society, an imperturbable good-humour, a
kind heart, and a passionate fondness for children, he united a morbid
interest in the details of human suffering, and,

<pb n="296"/>
more especially, a taste for witnessing criminal executions.  Not only
was he a constant frequenter of such scenes of horror, but all the details
of crime, the private history of the criminal, his demeanour at his trial,
in the dungeon, and on the scaffold, and the state of his feelings in the
hour of death and degradation, were to Selwyn matters of the deepest
and most extraordinary interest.  Even the most frightful particulars
relating to suicide and murder, the investigation of the disfigured corpse,
the sight of an acquaintance lying in his shroud, seem to have afforded
him a painful and unaccountable pleasure.  When the first Lord Holland
was on his death-bed he was told that Selwyn, who had lived on terms of
the closest intimacy with him, had called to inquire after his health.
&ldquo;The next time Mr Selwyn calls,&amp;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;show
him up; if I am alive I shall be delighted to see him, and if I am dead he
will be glad to see me.&amp;&rdquo;  When some ladies bantered him on his
want of feeling in attending to see the terrible Lord Lovat's head cut
off &mdash; &ldquo;Why,&amp;&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I made amends by going
to the undertaker's to see it sewed on again.&amp;&rdquo;  And yet this was
the same individual who delighted in the first words

<pb n="297"/>
and in the sunny looks of childhood; whose friendship seems to have
partaken of all the softness of female affection; and whose heart was
never hardened against the wretched and depressed.  Such was the
&ldquo;original&amp;&rdquo; George Selwyn.'
</p>
<p>This celebrated conversational wit was a devoted frequenter of the
gaming table.  Writing to Selwyn, in 1765, Lord Holland said: &mdash; `All
that I can collect from what you say on the subject of money is, that
fortune has been a little favourable lately; or may be, the last night only.
Till you leave off play entirely you must be &mdash; in earnest, and without
irony &mdash; <hi rend="italic">en verit&eacute; le serviteur tr&egrave;s-humble des
&eacute;v&eacute;nements</hi>, &ldquo;in truth, the very humble
servant of events.&amp;&rdquo; '
</p>
<p>His friend the Lord Carlisle, although himself a great gambler,
also gave him good advice.  `I hope you have left off Hazard,' he wrote
to Selwyn; `if you are still so foolish, and will play, the best thing I can
wish you is, that you may win and never throw crabs.[117]  You do not
put it in the

<pb n="298"/>
power of chance to make you them, as we all know; and till the ninth
miss is born I shall not be convinced to the contrary.'
</p>
<note place="foot" n="117"><p>[117] That is, <hi rend="italic">aces</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">ace
and deuce, twelve</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">seven</hi>.  With false dice, as will
appear in the sequel, it was impossible to throw any of these numbers,
and as the <hi rend="italic">caster</hi> always called the <hi rend="italic">main</hi>, he was
sure to win, as he could call an impossible number: those who were in
the secret of course always took the odds.</p></note>
<p>Again: &mdash; `As you have played I am happy to hear you have won;
but by this time there may be a <hi rend="italic">triste revers de
succ&egrave;s</hi>.'
</p>
<p>Selwyn had taken to gaming before his father's death &mdash; probably
from his first introduction to the clubs.  His stakes were high, though not
extravagantly so, compared with the sums hazarded by his
contemporaries.  In 1765 he lost &pound;1000 to Mr Shafto, who
applied for it in the language of an `embarrassed tradesman.'</p>

<p>`July 1, 1765. </p>
<p>`DEAR SIR, &mdash; I have this moment received the favour of your
letter.  I intended to have gone out of town on Thursday, but as you
shall not receive your money before the end of this week, I must
postpone my journey till Sunday.  A month would have made no
difference to me, had I not had others to pay before I leave town, and
must pay; therefore must beg that you will leave the whole before this
week is out, at White's, as it is to be paid away to others to whom I
have lost, and do not choose to leave town till that is done.  Be sure

<pb n="299"/>
you could not wish an indulgence I should not be happy to grant, if it my
power.'
</p>
<p>Nor was this the only dun of the kind that Selwyn had `to put up
with' on account of the gaming table.  He received the following from
Edward, Earl of Derby.[118]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="118"><p>[118] Edward, twelfth Earl of Derby, was

<p>
<hi rend="italic">The Earl of Derby to George Selwyn</hi>.

<p>`Nothing could equal what I feel at troubling you with this

excuse the liberty I am taking of applying to you for assistance.  If it is
not very inconvenient to you, I should be glad of the money you owe
me.  If it is, I must pay what I can, and desire Brookes to trust me for
the remainder.  I repeat again my apologies, to which I shall beg leave
to add how very sincerely I have the honour to be, my dear sir,
 </p>




<p>`Your most obedient humble servant,

<p>`DERBY.



<pb n="300"/>

</p>
<p>This is the very model of a dun, and proves how handsomely such
ugly things can be done when one has to deal with a noble instead of a
plebeian creditor.
</p>
<p>But Selwyn had not only to endure such indignities, but also to
inflict them, as appears by the following letter to him from the
Honourable General Fitzpatrick, in answer to a dun, which, we are
assured, was `gentle and moderate.'

</p>
<p>`I am very sorry to hear the night ended so ill; but to give you
some idea of the utter impossibility of my being useful on the occasion, I
will inform you of the state of my affairs.  I won &pound;400 last night,
which was immediately appropriated by Mr <hi rend="italic">Martindale</hi>, to
whom I still owe &pound;300, and I am in Brookes' book for thrice that
sum.  Add to all this, that at Christmas I expect an inundation of
clamorous creditors, who, unless I somehow or other scrape together
some money to satisfy them, will overwhelm me entirely.  What can be
done?  If I could coin my heart, or drop my blood into drachms, I would
do it, though by this time I should probably have neither heart nor blood
left.  I am afraid.  you will find Stephen

<pb n="301"/>
in the same state of insolvency.  Adieu!  I am obliged to you for the
gentleness and moderation of your dun, considering how long I have
been your debtor.
 </p>
<p>`Yours most sincerely, </p>
<p>`R. F.'[119] </p>
<note place="foot" n="119"><p>[119] Apud <hi rend="italic">Selwyn and his
Contemporaries</hi> by Jesse.</p></note>
<p>Selwyn is said to have been a loser on the whole, and often
pillaged.  Latterly he appears to have got the better of his propensity for
play, if we may judge from the following wise sentiment: &mdash; `It was too
great a consumer,' he said, `of four things &mdash; time, health, fortune, and
thinking.'  But a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> seems to
doubt Selwyn's reformation; for his initiation of Wilberforce occurred in
1782, when he was 63; and previously, in 1776, he underwent the
process of dunning from Lord Derby, before-mentioned, and in 1779
from Mr Crawford (`Fish Crawford,' as he was called), each of whom,
like Mr Shafto, `had a sum to make up' &mdash; in the infernal style so
horridly provoking, even when we are able and willing to pay.
However, as Selwyn died comparatively rich, it may be presumed that
his fortune suffered to

<pb n="302"/>
no great extent by his indulgence in the vice of gaming.
</p>
<p>The following are some of George Selwyn's jokes relating to
gambling: &mdash;
</p>
<p>One night, at White's, observing the Postmaster-General, Sir
Everard Fawkener, losing a large sum of money at Piquet, Selwyn,
pointing to the successful player, remarked &mdash; `See now, he is robbing
the <hi rend="italic">mail!</hi>'
</p>
<p>On another occasion, in 1756, observing Mr Ponsonby, the
Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, tossing about bank-bills at a
Hazard table at Newmarket &mdash; `Look,' he said, `how easily the Speaker
passes the money-bills!'
</p>
<p>A few months afterwards (when the public journals were daily
containing an account of some fresh town which had conferred the
freedom of its corporation in a gold box on Mr Pitt, afterwards Earl of
Chatham, and the Right Honourable Henry Bilson Legge, his fellow-patriot and colleague), Selwyn, who neither admired their politics nor re-spected their principles, proposed to the old and new club at Arthur's,
that he should be deputed to present to them the freedom of each club in
a <hi rend="italic">dice-box</hi>.


<pb n="303"/>

</p>
<p>On one of the waiters at Arthur's club having been committed to
prison for a felony &mdash; `What a horrid idea,' said Selwyn, `he will give of
us to the people in Newgate!'
</p>
<p>When the affairs of Charles Fox were in a more than usually
embarrassed state, chiefly through his gambling, his friends raised a
subscription among themselves for his relief.  One of them remarking
that it would require some delicacy in breaking the matter to him, and
adding that `he wondered how Fox would take it.'  `Take it?' interrupted
Selwyn, `why, <hi rend="italic">quarterly</hi>, to be sure.'[120]

</p><p>This eminent statesman was regarded by his contemporaries as an
able, an influential, and occasionally a powerful speaker.
</p>
<p>Though married to a lady for whom in his letters he ever expresses
the warmest feelings of admiration and esteem; and surrounded by a
young and increasing family, who were evidently the objects of his
deepest affection, Lord Carlisle, nevertheless, at times appears to have
been unable to extricate himself from the dangerous enticements

<pb n="304"/>
to play to which he was exposed.  His fatal passion for play &mdash; the source
of adventitious excitement at night, and of deep distress in the morning &mdash;
seems to have led to frequent and inconvenient losses, and eventually to
have plunged him into comparative distress.
</p>
<p>`In recording these failings of a man of otherwise strong sense, of
a high sense of honour, and of kindly affections, we have said the worst
that can be adduced to his disadvantage.  Attached, indeed, as Lord
Carlisle may have been to the pleasures of society, and unfortunate as
may have been his passion for the gaming table, it is difficult to peruse
those passages in his letters in which he deeply reproaches himself for
yielding to the fatal fascination of play, and accuses himself of having
diminished the inheritance of his children, without a feeling of
commiseration for the sensations of a man of strong sense and deep
feeling, while reflecting on his moral degradation.  It is sufficient,
however, to observe of Lord Carlisle, that the deep sense which he
entertained of his own folly; the almost maddening moments to which he
refers in his letters of self-condemnation and bitter regret; and
subsequently his noble victory over the siren

<pb n="305"/>
enticements of pleasure, and his thorough emancipation from the
trammels of a domineering passion, make adequate amends for his
previous unhappy career.'[121]

<p>Lady Sarah Bunbury, writing to George Selwyn, in 1767, says: &mdash;
`If you are now at Paris with poor C. [evidently Carlisle], who I dare
say is now swearing at the French people, give my compliments to
him.<hi rend="super">* * *</hi>  I call him poor C. because I hope he is only
miserable at having been such a <hi rend="italic">*pigeon</hi> to Colonel Scott.  I
never can pity him for losing at play, and I think of it as little as I can,
because I cannot bear to be obliged to abate the least of the good opinion
I have always had of him.'
</p>
<p>Oddly enough the writer had no better account to give of her own
husband; she says, in the letter: &mdash; `Sir Charles games from morning till
night, but he has never yet lost &pound;100 in one day.'[122]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="122"><p>[122] This Lady Sarah Bunbury was the wife
of Sir Charles Bunbury, after having had a chance of being Queen of
England, as the wife of George III., who was passionately in love with
her, and would have

council.  This charming and beautiful woman died in 1826, at the age of
82.  She was probably the last surviving great-granddaughter of Charles
II. &mdash; Jesse, <hi rend="italic">Ubi supr&agrave;</hi>.</p></note>

<pb n="306"/>
<p>About the year 1776 Lord Carlisle wrote the following letter to
George Selwyn: &mdash;

 </p>
<p>`MY DEAR GEORGE,
 </p>
<p>`I have undone myself, and it is to no purpose to conceal from you
my abominable madness and folly, though perhaps the particulars may
not be known to the rest of the world.  I never lost so much in five times
as I have done to-night, and am in debt to the house for the whole.  You
may be sure I do not tell you this with an idea that you can be of the
least assistance to me; it is a great deal more than your abilities are equal
to.  Let me see you &mdash; though I shall be ashamed to look at you after
your goodness to me.'

</p>
<p>This letter is endorsed by George Selwyn &mdash; `After the loss of
&pound;10,000.'  He tells Selwyn of a set which, at one point of the
game, stood to win &pound;50,000.
</p>
<p>`Lord Byron, it is almost needless to remark, was nearly related to
Lord Carlisle.  The mother

<pb n="307"/>
of Lord Carlisle was sister to John, fourth Lord Byron, the grandfather
of the poet; Lord Carlisle and Lord Byron were consequently first
cousins once removed.  Had they happened to have been contemporaries,
it would be difficult to form an idea of two individuals who, alike from
tastes, feelings, and habits of life, were more likely to form a lasting and
suitable intimacy.  Both were men of high rank; both united an intimate
knowledge of society and the world with the ardent temperament of a
poet; and both in youth mingled a love of frolic and pleasure with a
graver taste for literary pursuits.'


CHARLES JAMES FOX.<lb/>


</p><p>In the midst of the infatuated votaries of the gaming god in
England, towers the mighty intellectual giant Charles James Fox.  Nature
had fashioned him to be equally an object of admiration and love.  In
addition to powerful eloquence, he was distinguished by the refinement
of his taste in all matters connected with literature and art; he was deeply
read in history; had some claims to be regarded as a poet; and possessed
a thorough knowledge of the classical authors of antiquity, a

<pb n="308"/>
knowledge of which he so often and so happily availed himself in his
seat in the House of Commons.  To these qualities was added a good&mdash;
humour which was seldom ruffled, &mdash; a peculiar fascination of manner
and address, &mdash; the most delightful powers of conversation, &mdash; a heart
perfectly free from vindictiveness, ostentation, and deceit, &mdash; a strong
sense of justice, &mdash; a thorough detestation of tyranny and oppression, &mdash;
and an almost feminine tenderness of feeling for the sufferings of others.
Unfortunately, however, his great talents and delightful qualities in
private life rendered his defects the more glaring and lamentable; indeed,
it is difficult to think or speak with common patience of those injurious
practices and habits &mdash; that abandonment to self-gratification, and that
criminal waste of the most transcendent abilities which exhausted in
social conviviality and the gaming table what were formed to confer
blessings on mankind.
</p>
<p>So much for the character of Fox, as I have gathered from Mr
Jesse;[123] and I continue the extremely interesting subject by quoting
from that

<pb n="309"/>
delightful book, `The Queens of Society.'[124]  `With a father who had
made an enormous fortune, with little principle, out of a public office &mdash;
for Lord Holland owed the bulk of his wealth to his appointment of
paymaster to the forces, &mdash; and who spoiled him, in his boyhood, Charles
James Fox had begun life <hi rend="italic">*as a fop of the first water</hi>, and
squandered &pound;50,000 in debt before he became of age.  After-wards he indulged recklessly and extravagantly in every course of
licentiousness which the profligate society of the day opened to him.  At
Brookes' and the Thatched House Fox ate and drank to excess, threw
thousands upon the Faro table, mingled with blacklegs, and made himself
notorious for his shameless vices.  Newmarket supplied another ex-citement.  His back room was so incessantly filled with Jew money-lenders that he called it his Jerusalem Chamber.  It was impossible that
such a life should not destroy every principle of honour; and there is
nothing improbable in the story that he appropriated to himself money
which belonged to his dear friend Mrs Crewe, as before related.

ii.</p></note>
<note place="foot" n="124"><p>[124] By Grace and Philip Wharton.</p></note>
<p>`Of his talents, which were certainly great, he made an affected
display.  Of his learning he was

<pb n="310"/>
proud &mdash; but rather as adding lustre to his celebrity for universal tastes.
He was not at all ashamed, but rather gloried in being able to describe
himself as a fool, as he does in his verses to Mrs Crewe: &mdash;  </p>
<lg type="poem"> <l>&ldquo;Is't reason?  No; that my whole life will belie;
 </l>
<l>  For, who so at variance as reason and I?
 </l>
<l>  Is't ambition that fills up each chink in my heart,
 </l>
<l>  Nor allows any softer sensation a part?
 </l>
<l>  Oh! no; for in this all the world must agree,
 </l>
<l>  <hi rend="italic">One folly was never sufficient for me</hi>.&amp;&rdquo;
</l></lg>
<p>`Sensual and self-indulgent &mdash; with a grossness that is even patent
on his very portrait [and bust], Fox had nevertheless a manner which
enchanted the sex, and he was the only politician of the day who
thoroughly enlisted the personal sympathies of women of mind and
character, as well as of those who might be captivated by his profusion.
When he visited Paris in later days, even Madame R&eacute;camier,
noted for her refinement, and of whom he himself said, with his usual
coarse ideas of the sphere of woman, that &ldquo;she was the only
woman who united the attractions of pleasure to those of
modesty,&amp;&rdquo; delighted to be seen with him!  At the time of which
we are speaking the most celebrated beauties of England were his most
ardent supporters.


<pb n="311"/>

</p>
<p>`The election of 1784, in which he stood and was returned for
Westminster, was one of the most famous of the old riotous political
demonstrations. . . . .  Loving <hi rend="italic">hazard</hi> of all kinds for its own
sake, Fox had made party hostility a new sphere of gambling, had
adopted the character of a demagogue, and at a time when the whole of
Europe was undergoing, a great revolution in principles, was welcomed
gladly as &ldquo;The Man of the People.&amp;&rdquo;  In the beginning, of
the year he had been convicted of bribery, but in spite of this his
popularity increased. . . .  The election for Westminster, in which Fox
was opposed by Sir Cecil Wray, was the most tempestuous of all.  There
were 20,000 votes to be polled, and the opposing parties resorted to any
means of intimidation, or violence, or persuasion which political
enthusiasm could suggest.  On the eighth day the poll was against the
popular member, and he called upon his friends to make a great effort on
his behalf.  It was then that the &ldquo;ladies' canvass&amp;&rdquo; began.
Lady Duncannon, the Duchess of Devonshire, Mrs Crewe, and Mrs
Damer dressed themselves in blue and buff &mdash; the colours of the
American Independents, which Fox had adopted and wore in the House
of Com

<pb n="312"/>
mons &mdash; and set out to visit the purlieus of Westminster.  Here, in their
enthusiasm, they shook the dirty hands of honest workmen, expressed
the greatest interest in their wives and families, and even, as in the case
of the Duchess of Devonshire and the butcher, submitted their fair
cheeks to be kissed by the possessors of votes!  At the butcher's shop,
the owner, in his apron and sleeves, stoutly refused his vote, except on
one condition &mdash; &ldquo;Would her Grace give him a kiss?&amp;&rdquo;  The
request was granted; and the vote thus purchased went to swell the
majority which finally secured the return of &ldquo;The Man of the
People.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`The colouring of political friends, which concealed his vices, or
rather which gave them a false hue, has long since faded away.  We now
know Fox as he <hi rend="italic">*was</hi>.  In the latest journals of Horace
Walpole his inveterate gambling, his open profligacy, his utter want of
honour, is disclosed by one of his own opinion.  Corrupted ere yet he
had left his home, whilst in age a boy, there is, however, the comfort of
reflecting that he outlived his vices which seem to have &ldquo;cropped
out&amp;&rdquo; by his ancestral connection in the female line with the
reprobate Charles II., whom he was thought to resemble in

<pb n="313"/>
features.  Fox, afterwards, with a green apron tied round his waist,
pruning and nailing up his fruit trees at St Ann's Hill, or amusing
himself innocently with a few friends, is a pleasing object to remember,
even whilst his early career occurs forcibly to the mind.'
</p>
<p>Peace, then, to the shade of Charles James Fox!  The three last
public acts which he performed were worthy of the man, and should
suffice to prove that, in spite of his terrible failings, he was most useful
in his generation.  By one, he laboured to repair the outrages of war &mdash;
to obtain a breathing time for our allies; and, by an extension of our
commerce, to afford, if necessary, to his country all the advantages of a
renovated contest, without the danger of drying up our resources.  By
another, he attempted to remove all legal disabilities arising out of
religion &mdash; to unite more closely <hi rend="italic">*the interests of Ireland with those
of England;</hi> and thus, by an extension of common rights, and a
participation of common benefits, wisely to render that which has always
been considered the weakest and most troublesome portion of our
empire, at least a useful and valuable part of England's greatness among
the nations.  Queen Eliza

<pb n="314"/>
beth's Minister, Lord Burleigh, in the presence of the `Irish difficulty' in
his day, wished Ireland at the bottom of the sea, and doubtless many at
the present time wish the same; but Fox endeavoured to grapple with it
manfully and honestly, and it was not his fault that he did not settle it.
The vices of Fox were those of the age in which he lived; had he been
reserved for the present epoch, what a different biography should we
have to write of him!  What a helmsman he might be at the present time,
when the ship of Old England is at sea and in peril!
</p>
<p>It appears from a letter addressed by Lord Carlisle to Lady
Holland (Fox's mother) in 1773, that he had become security for Fox to
the amount of fifteen or sixteen thousand pounds; and a letter to Selwyn
in 1777, puts the ruinous character of their gaming transactions in the
strongest light.  Lord Ilchester (Fox's cousin) had lost thirteen thousand
pounds at one sitting to Lord Carlisle, who offered to take three
thousand pounds down.  Nothing was paid.  But ten years afterwards,
when Lord Carlisle pressed for his money, he complained that an attempt
was made to construe the offer into a <hi rend="italic">remission</hi> of the ten
thousand pounds: &mdash; `The

<pb n="315"/>
only way, in honour, that Lord Ilchester could have accepted my offer,
would have been by taking some steps to pay the &pound;3000.  I
remained in a state of uncertainty, I think, for nearly three years; but his
taking no notice of it during that time, convinced me that he had no
intention of availing himself of it.  Charles Fox was also at a much
earlier period clear that he never meant to accept it.  There is also great
injustice in the behaviour of the family in passing by the instantaneous
payment of, I believe, five thousand pounds, to Charles, won at the same
sitting, without any observations.  <hi rend="italic">At one period of the play I
remember there was a balance in favour of one of these gentlemen (but
which I protest I do not remember) of about fifty thousand</hi>.'
</p>
<p>At the time in question Fox was hardly eighteen.  The following
letter from Lord Carlisle, written in 1771, contains highly interesting
information respecting the youthful habits and already vast intellectual
pre-eminence of this memorable statesman: &mdash; `It gives me great pain to
hear that Charles begins to be unreasonably impatient at losing.  I fear it
is the prologue to much fretfulness of temper, for disappointment in
raising money, and any

<pb n="316"/>
serious reflections upon his situation, will (in spite of his affected spirits
and dissipation) occasion him many disagreeable moments.'  Lord
Carlisle's fears proved groundless in this respect.  As before stated, Fox
was always remarkable for his sweetness of temper, which remained
with him to the last; but it is most painful to think how much mankind
has lost through his recklessness.
</p>
<p>Gibbon writes to Lord Sheffield in 1773, `You know Lord Holland
is paying Charles Fox's debts.  They amount to &pound;140,000.'[125]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="125"><p>[125] Timbs, <hi rend="italic">Club Life in
London</hi>.</p></note>
<p>His love of play was desperate.  A few evenings before he moved
the repeal of the Marriage Act, in February, 1772, he had been at
Brompton on two errands, &mdash; one to consult Justice Fielding on the penal
laws, the other to borrow &pound;10,000, which he brought to town at
the hazard of being robbed.  He played admirably both at Whist and
Piquet, &mdash; with such skill, indeed, that by the general admission of
Brookes' Club, he might have made four thousand pounds a-year, as
they calculated, at these games, if he could have confined himself to
them.  But his misfortune arose from playing games of chance,
particularly at Faro.


<pb n="317"/>

</p>
<p>After eating and drinking plentifully, he would sit down at the
Faro table, and invariably rose a loser.  Once, indeed, and once only, he
won about eight thousand pounds in the course of a single evening.  Part
of the money he paid to his creditors, and the remainder he lost almost
immediately.
</p>
<p>Before he attained his thirtieth year he had completely dissipated
everything that he could either command or could procure by the most
ruinous expedients.  He had even undergone, at times, many of the
severest privations incidental to the vicissitudes that attend a gamester's
progress; frequently wanting money to defray the common daily wants of
the most pressing nature.  Topham Beauclerc, who lived much in Fox's
society, declared that no man could form an idea of the extremities to
which he had been driven to raise money, often losing his last guinea at
the Faro table.  The very sedan-chairmen, whom he was unable to pay,
used to dun him for arrears.  In 1781, he might be considered as an
extinct volcano, &mdash; for the pecuniary aliment that had fed the flame was
long consumed.  Yet he even then occupied a house or lodgings in St
James's Street, close to

<pb n="318"/>
Brookes', where he passed almost every hour which was not devoted to
the House of Commons.  Brookes' was then the rallying point or
rendezvous of the Opposition, where Faro, Whist, and supper prolonged
the night, the principal members of the minority in both Houses met, in
order to compare their information, or to concert and mature their
parliamentary measures.  Great sums were then borrowed of Jews at
exorbitant premiums.
</p>
<p>His brother Stephen was enormously fat; George Selwyn said he
was in the right to deal with Shylocks, as he could give them pounds of
flesh.
</p>
<p>Walpole, in 1781, walking up St James's Street, saw a cart at
Fox's door, with copper and an old chest of drawers, loading.  His
success at Faro had awakened a host of creditors; but, unless his bank
had swelled to the size of the Bank of England, it could not have yielded
a half-penny apiece for each.  Epsom too had been unpropitious; and one
creditor had actually seized and carried off Fox's goods, which did not
seem worth removing.  Yet, shortly after this, whom should Walpole
find sauntering by his own door but Fox, who came up and talked to him
at the coach window, on the

<pb n="319"/>
Marriage Bill, with as much <hi rend="italic">sang-froid</hi> as if he knew nothing
of what had happened.  Doubtless this indifference was to be attributed
quite as much to the callousness of the reckless gambler as to anything
that might be called `philosophy.'
</p>
<p>It seems clear that the ruling passion of Fox was partly owing to
the lax training of his father, who, by his lavish allowances, not only
fostered his propensity to play, but had also been accustomed to give
him, when a mere boy, money to amuse himself at the gaming table.
According to Chesterfield, the first Lord Holland `had no fixed prin-ciples in religion or morality,' and he censures him to his son for being
`too unwary in ridiculing and exposing them.'  He gave full swing to
Charles in his youth.  `Let nothing be done,' said his lordship, `to break
his spirit, the world will do that for him.'  At his death, in 1774, he left
him &pound;154,000 to pay his debts; it was all `bespoke,' and Fox
soon became as deeply pledged as before.[126]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="126"><p>[126] Timbs, <hi rend="italic">ubi supr&agrave;</hi>.
There is a mistake in the anecdote respecting Fox's duel with Mr Adam
(not Adams), as related by Mr Timbs in his amusing book of the Clubs.
The challenge was in consequence of some words uttered by Fox in
parliament, and not on account of some remark on Government powder,
to which Fox wittily alluded,
after the duel, saying &mdash; `Egad, Adam, you would have killed me if it
had not been Government powder.'  See Gilchrist, <hi rend="italic">Ordeals</hi>,
Millingen, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Duelling</hi>, ii., and Steinmetz,
<hi rend="italic">Romance of Duelling</hi>, ii.</p></note>

<pb n="320"/>


<p>The following are authentic anecdotes of Fox, as a gambler.
</p>
<p>Fox had a gambling debt to pay to Sir John Slade.  Finding
himself in cash, after a lucky run at Faro, he sent a complimentary card
to the knight, desiring to discharge the claim.  Sir John no sooner saw
the money than he called for pen and ink, and began to figure.  `What
now?' cried Fox.  `Only calculating the interest,' replied the other.  `Are
you so?' coolly rejoined Charles James, and pocketed the cash, adding &mdash;
`I thought it was a <hi rend="italic">debt of honour</hi>.  As you seem to consider
it a trading debt, and as I make it an invariable rule to pay my Jew-creditors last, you must wait a little longer for your money.'
</p>
<p>Fox once played cards with Fitzpatrick at Brookes' from ten
o'clock at night till near six o'clock the next morning &mdash; a waiter
standing by to tell them `whose deal it was' &mdash; they being too sleepy to
know.
</p>
<p>On another occasion he won about &pound;8000; and one of his
bond-creditors, who soon heard of his

<pb n="321"/>
good luck, presented himself and asked for payment.  `Impossible, sir,'
replied Fox; `I must first discharge my debts of honour.'  The bond&mdash;
creditor remonstrated, and finding Fox inflexible, tore the bond to pieces
and flung it into the fire, exclaiming &mdash; `Now, sir, your debt to me is a
<hi rend="italic">debt of honour</hi>.'  Struck by the creditor's witty rejoinder,
Fox instantly paid the money. </p>

<note place="foot" n="127"><p>[127]  The above is the version of this
anecdote which I remember as being current in my young days.  Mr
Timbs and others before him relate the anecdote as follows: &mdash; `On
another occasion he won about &pound;8000; and one of his bond-creditors, who soon heard of his good luck, presented himself and asked
for payment.'  `Impossible, sir,' replied Fox `I must first discharge my
debts of honour.'  The bond-creditor remonstrated.  `Well, sir, give me
your bond.'  It was delivered to Fox, who tore it in pieces and threw it
into the fire.  `Now, sir,' said Fox, `my debt to you is a debt of
honour;' and immediately paid him .
</p><p>
Now, it is evident that Fox could not destroy the document without
rendering himself still more `liable' in point of law.  I submit that the
version in the text is the true one, conforming with the legal requirement
of the case and influencing the debtor by the originality of the
performance of the creditor.</p></note>

<p>Amidst the wildest excesses of youth, even while the perpetual
victim of his passion for play, Fox eagerly cultivated his taste for letters,
especially the Greek and Roman historians and poets; and he found
resources in their works under the

<pb n="322"/>
most severe depressions occasioned by ill-successes at the gaming table.
One morning, after Fox had passed the whole night in company with
Topham Beauclerc at Faro, the two friends were about to separate.  Fox
had lost throughout the night, and was in a frame of mind approaching to
desperation.  Beauclerc's anxiety for the consequences which might
ensue led him to be early at Fox's lodgings; and on arriving he inquired,
not without apprehension, whether he had risen.  The servant replied that
Mr Fox was in the drawing-room, when Beauclerc walked up-stairs and
cautiously opened the door, expecting to behold a frantic gamester
stretched on the floor, bewailing his losses, or plunged in moody
despair; but he was astonished to find him reading a Greek Herodotus.
</p>
<p>On perceiving his friend's surprise, Fox exclaimed, `What would
you have me do?  I have lost my last shilling.'
</p>
<p>Upon other occasions, after staking and losing all that he could
raise at Faro, instead of exclaiming against fortune, or manifesting the
agitation natural under such circumstances, he would lay his head on the
table and retain his place, but,

<pb n="323"/>
exhausted by mental and bodily fatigue, almost immediately fall into a
profound sleep.
</p>
<p>Fox's best friends are said to have been half ruined in annuities
given by them as securities for him to the Jews.  &pound;500,000 a-year
of such annuities of Fox and his `society' were advertised to be sold at
one time.  Walpole wondered what Fox would do when he had sold the
estates of his friends.  Walpole further notes that in the debate on the
Thirty-nine Articles, February 6, 1772, Fox did not shine; nor could it
be wondered at.  He had sat up playing at Hazard, at Almack's, from
Tuesday evening, the 4th, till five in the afternoon of Wednesday, the
5th.  An hour before he had recovered &pound;12,000 that he had lost;
and by dinner, which was at five o'clock, he had ended losing
&pound;11,000!  On the Thursday he spoke in the above debate, went to
dinner at past eleven at night; from thence to White's, where he drank
till seven the next morning; thence to Almack's, where he won
&pound;6000; and between three and four in the afternoon he set out for
Newmarket.  His brother Stephen lost &pound;11,000 two nights after,
and Charles &pound;10,000 more on the 13th; so that in

<pb n="324"/>
three nights the two brothers &mdash; the eldest not <hi rend="italic">twenty-five</hi>
years of age &mdash; lost &pound;32,000![128]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="128"><p>[128] Timbs, <hi rend="italic">ubi
supr&agrave;.</hi></p></note>
<p>On one occasion Stephen Fox was dreadfully fleeced at a gaming
house at the West End.  He entered it with &pound;13,000, and left
without a farthing.
</p>
<p>Assuredly these Foxes were misnamed.  <hi rend="italic">Pigeons</hi> &mdash;
dupes of sharpers at play &mdash; would have been a more appropriate
cognomen.


WILBERFORCE AND PITT.<lb/>


</p><p>These eminent statesmen were gamesters at one period of their
lives.  When Wilberforce came to London in 1780, after his return to
Parliament, his great success signalized his entry into public life, and he
was at once elected a member of the leading clubs &mdash; Miles' and Evans',
Brookes', Boodle's, White's, and Goosetree's.  The latter was
Wilberforce's usual resort, where his friendship with Pitt &mdash; who played
with characteristic and intense eagerness, and whom he had slightly
known at Cambridge &mdash; greatly increased.  He once lost &pound;100 at
the Faro table.</p>


<pb n="325"/>


<p>`We played a good deal at Goosetree's,' he states,; and I well
remember the intense earnestness which Pitt displayed when joining in
these games of chance.  He perceived their increasing fascination, and
soon after abandoned them for ever.'
</p>
<p>Wilberforce's own case is thus recorded by his biographers, on the
authority of his private Journal: &mdash; `We can have no play to-night,' com-plained some of the party at the club, `for St Andrew is not here to keep
bank.'  `Wilberforce,' said Mr Bankes, who never joined himself, `if
you will keep it I will give you a guinea.'  The playful challenge was
accepted, but as the game grew deep he rose the winner of &pound;600.
Much of this was lost by those who were only heirs to fortunes, and
therefore could not meet such a call without inconvenience.  The pain he
felt at their annoyance cured him of a taste which seemed but too likely
to become predominant.
</p>
<p>Goosetree's being then almost exclusively composed of incipient
orators and embryo statesmen, the call for a gambling table there may be
regarded as a decisive proof of the universal prevalence of the vice.
</p>

<pb n="326"/>


<p>`The first time I was at Brookes',' says Wilberforce, `scarcely
knowing any one, I joined, from mere shyness, in play at the Faro
tables, where George Selwyn kept bank.  A friend, who knew my
inexperience, and regarded me as a victim decked out for sacrifice,
called to me &mdash; &ldquo;What, Wilberforce, is that you?&amp;&rdquo;  Selwyn
quite resented the interference, and, turning to him, said in his most
expressive tone, &ldquo;Oh, sir, don't interrupt Mr Wilberforce, he
could not be better employed.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>Again:  `The very first time I went to Boodle's I won twenty-five
guineas of the Duke of Norfolk.  I belonged at this time to five clubs &mdash;
Miles' and Evans', Brookes', Boodle's, White's, and Goose-tree's.'


SIR PHILIP FRANCIS.<lb/>


</p><p>Sir Philip Francis, the eminent politician and supposed author of
the celebrated `Letters of Junius,' was a gambler, and the convivial
companion of Fox.  During the short administration of that statesman he
was made a Knight of the Bath.  One evening, Roger Wilbraham came
up to the Whist table, at Brookes', where Sir Philip, who for the first
time wore the ribbon of the Order, was en

<pb n="327"/>
gaged in a rubber, and thus accosted him.  Laying hold of the ribbon,
and examining it for some time, he said: &mdash; `So, this is the way they have
rewarded you at last; they have given you a little bit of red ribbon for
your services, Sir Philip, have they?  A pretty bit of red ribbon to hang
about your neck; and that satisfies you, does it?  Now, I wonder what I
shall have.  What do you think they will give me, Sir Philip?'  The
newly-made knight, who had twenty-five guineas depending on the
rubber, and who was not very well pleased at the interruption, suddenly
turned round, and looking at him fiercely, exclaimed, `A halter, and be,'
&amp;c.


THE REV. CALEB C. COLTON.<lb/>


</p><p>Unquestionably this reverend gentleman was one of the most lucky
of gamesters &mdash; having died in full possession of the gifts vouchsafed to
him by the goddess of fortune.
</p>
<p>He was educated at Eton, graduated at King's College, Cambridge,
as Bachelor of Arts in 1801, and Master of Arts in 1804, and obtained a
fellowship, having also a curacy at Tiverton, held conjointly.  Some six
years after he appeared in print as a denouncer of a `ghost story,' and in
1812, as

<pb n="328"/>
the author of `Hypocrisy,' a satirical poem, and `Napoleon,' a poem.  In
1818 he was presented by his college to the vicarage of Kew with
Petersham, in Surrey.  Two years after he established a literary
reputation &mdash; lasting to the present time &mdash; by the publication of a volume
of aphorisms or maxims, under the title of `LACON; or, Many Things
in Few Words.'  This work is very far from original, being founded
mainly on Lord Bacon's celebrated Essays, and Burdon's `Materials for
Thinking,' La Bruyi&egrave;re, and De la Rochefoucault; still it is
highly creditable to the abilities of the writer.  It has passed through
several editions; and even at the present time its only rival is, `The
Guesses at Truth,' although we have numerous collections of
apothegmatic extracts from authors, a class of works which is not
without its fascination, if readers are inclined to <hi rend="italic">think.</hi>[129]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="129"><p>[129] The first work I published was of this
kind, and entitled, `Gems of Genius; or, Words of the Wise, with
extracts from the Diary of a Young Man,' in 1838.</p></note>
<p>Two years after he returned to his `Napoleon,' which he
republished, with extensive additions, under the new title of `The
Conflagration of Moscow.



<pb n="329"/>

</p>
<p>It would appear that Colton at this period gave in to the
fashionable gaming of the day; at any rate, he dabbled deeply in Spanish
bonds, became involved in pecuniary difficulties, and, without in-vestigating his affairs closely &mdash; which might have been easily arranged &mdash;
he absconded.
</p>
<p>He subsequently made appearance, in order to retain his living; but
in 1828 he lost it, a successor being appointed by his college.  He then
went to the United States of America; what he did there is not on record;
but he subsequently returned to Europe, went to Paris, took up his abode
in the Palais Royal, and &mdash; devoted his talents to the mysteries of the
gaming table, by which he was so successful that in the course of a year
or two he won &pound;25,000!
</p>
<p>Oddly enough, one of his `maxims' in his Lacon runs as follows:
`The gamester, if he die a martyr to his profession, is doubly ruined.
He adds his soul to every other loss, and, by the act of suicide,
renounces earth, to forfeit heaven.'
</p>
<p>It has been suggested that this was writing his own epitaph, and it
would appear so from the notices of the man in most of the biographies;
but nothing could be further from the fact.  Caleb

<pb n="330"/>
Colton managed to <hi rend="italic">*keep</hi> his gambling fortune, and what is
more, devoted it to a worthy purpose.  Part of his wealth he employed in
forming a picture-gallery; and he printed at Paris, for private
distribution, an ode on the death of Lord Byron.  He certainly committed
suicide, but the act was not the gamester's martyrdom.  He was afflicted
by a disease which necessitated some painful surgical operation, and
rather than submit to it, he blew out his brains, at the house of a friend,
at Fontainebleau, in 1832.[130] </p>

BEAU BRUMMELL.<lb/>


</p><p>This singular man was an inveterate gambler, and for some time
very `lucky;' but the reaction came at last; the stakes were too high, and
the purses of his companions too long for him to stand against any
continued run of bad luck; indeed, the play at Wattier's, which was very
deep, eventually ruined the club, as well as Brummell and several other
members of it; a certain baronet now living, according to Captain Jesse,
is asserted to have lost ten thousand pounds there at
<hi rend="italic">Ecart&eacute;</hi> at one sitting.[131]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="131"><p>[131] Life of Beau Brummell.</p></note>

<pb n="331"/>

<p>The season of 1814 saw Brummell a winner, and a loser likewise --and this time he lost not only his winnings, but `an unfortunate ten
thousand pounds,' which, when relating the circumstance to a friend
many years afterwards, he said was all that remained at his banker's.
One night &mdash; the fifth of a most relentless run of ill-luck &mdash; his friend
Pemberton Mills heard him exclaim that he had lost every shilling, and
only wished some one would bind him never to play again: &mdash; `I will,'
said Mills; and taking out a ten-pound note he offered it to Brummell on
condition that he should forfeit a thousand if he played at White's within
a month from that evening.  The Beau took it, and for a few days
discontinued coming to the club; but about a fortnight after Mills,
happening to go in, saw him hard at work.  Of course the thousand
pounds was forfeited; but his friend, instead of claiming it, merely went
up to him and, touching him gently on the shoulder, said &mdash; `Well,
Brummell, you may at least give me back the ten pounds you had the
other night.'
</p>
<p>Among the members who indulged in high play at Brookes' Club
was Alderman Combe, the brewer, who is said to have made as much
money

<pb n="332"/>
in this way as he did by brewing.  One evening whilst he filled the office
of Lord Mayor, he was busy at a full Hazard table at Brookes', where
the wit and the dice-box circulated together with great glee, and where
Beau Brummell was one of the party.  `Come, Mash-tub,' said
Brummell, who was the <hi rend="italic">caster</hi>, `what do you
<hi rend="italic">set?</hi>'  `Twenty-five guineas,' answered the Alderman.  `Well,
then,' returned the Beau, `have at the mare's pony' (a gaming term for
25 guineas).  He continued to throw until he drove home the brewer's
twelve ponies running; and then getting up, and making him a low bow,
whilst pocketing the cash, he said &mdash; `Thank you, Alderman; for the
future I shall never drink any porter but yours.'  `I wish, sir,' replied the
brewer, `that every other blackguard in London would tell me the
same.'[132]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="132"><p>[132] Jesse, <hi rend="italic">ubi
supr&agrave;</hi>.</p></note>
<p>The following occurrence must have caused a `sensation' to poor
Brummell.
</p>
<p>Among the members of Wattier's Club was Bligh, a notorious
madman, of whom Mr Raikes relates: &mdash; `One evening at the Macao
table, when the play was very deep, Brummell, having lost a
considerable stake, affected, in his farcical way, a

<pb n="333"/>
very tragic air, and cried out &mdash; &ldquo;Waiter, bring me a flat
candlestick and a pistol.&amp;&rdquo;  Upon which Bligh, who was sitting
opposite to him, calmly produced two loaded pistols from his coat
pocket, which he placed on the table, and said, &ldquo;Mr Brummell, if
you are really desirous to put a period to your existence, I am extremely
happy to offer you the means without troubling the waiter.&amp;&rdquo;  The
effect upon those present may easily be imagined, at finding themselves
in the company of a known madman who had loaded weapons about
him.'
</p>
<p>Brummell was at last completely beggared, though for some time
he continued to hold on by the help of funds raised on the mutual
security of himself and his friends, some of whom were not in a much
more flourishing condition than himself; their names, however, and still
more, their expectations, lent a charm to their bills, in the eyes of the
usurers, and money was procured, of course at ruinous interest.  It is
said that some unpleasant circumstances, connected with the division of
one of these loans, occasioned the Beau's expatriation, and that a
personal altercation took place between Brummell and a certain Mr M &mdash;
, when that gentleman accused him of taking the lion's share.


<pb n="334"/>

</p>
<p>He died in utter poverty, and an idiot, at Caen, in the year 1840,
aged 62 years.  Brummell had a very odd way of accounting for the sad
change which took place in his affairs.  He said that up to a particular
period of his life everything prospered with him, and that he attributed
good luck to the possession of a certain silver sixpence with a hole in it,
which somebody had given him years before, with an injunction to take
good care of it, as everything would go well with him so long as he did,
and the reverse if he happened to lose it.  The promised prosperity
attended him for many years, whilst he held the sixpence fast; but having
at length, in an evil hour, unfortunately given it by mistake to a hackney-coachman, a complete reverse of his previous good fortune ensued, till
actual ruin overtook him at last, and obliged him to expatriate himself.
`On my asking him,' says the narrator, `why he did not advertise and
offer a reward for the lost treasure; he said, &ldquo;I did, and twenty
people came with sixpences having holes in them to obtain the promised
reward, but mine was not amongst them!&amp;&rdquo;  And you never
afterwards,' said I, `ascertained what became of it?  &ldquo;Oh

<pb n="335"/>
yes,&amp;&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;no doubt that rascal Rothschild, or
some of his set, got hold of it.&amp;&rdquo; '  Whatever poor Brummell's
supernatural tendencies may have generally been, he had unquestionably
a superstitious veneration for his lost sixpence.



TOM DUNCOMBE.<lb/>

</p><p>Tom Duncombe graduated and took honours among the greatest
gamblers of the day.  Like Fox, he was heir to a good fortune &mdash; ten or
twelve thousand a year &mdash; the whole of which he managed to anticipate
before he was thirty.  `Tom Duncombe ran Charles Fox close.  When
Mr Duncombe, sen., of Copgrove, caused his prodigal son's debts to be
estimated with a view to their settlement, they were found to exceed
&pound;135,000;[133] and the hopeful heir went on adding to them till
all possibility of extrication was at an end.  But he spent his money (or
other people's money), so long as he had any, like a gentleman; his heart
was open like his hand; he was generous, cordial, high-spirited; and his
expectations &mdash; till they were known to be

<pb n="336"/>
discounted to the uttermost farthing &mdash; kept up his credit, improved his
social position, and gained friends.  &ldquo;Society&amp;&rdquo; (says his
son) &ldquo;opened its arms to the possessor of a good name and the
inheritor of a good estate.  Paterfamiliases and Materfamiliases rivalled
each other in endeavouring to make things pleasant in their households
for his particular delectation, especially if they had grown-up daughters;
hospitable hosts invited him to dinner, fashionable matrons to balls;
political leaders sought to secure him as a partisan;
<hi rend="italic">debutantes</hi> of the season endeavoured to attract him as an
admirer; <hi rend="italic">tradesmen thronged to his doorsteps for his custom</hi>,
and his table was daily covered with written applications for his
patronage.&amp;&rdquo;  <hi rend="italic">Noblesse oblig&eacute;;</hi> and so does
fashion.  The aspirant had confessedly a hard time of it.  &ldquo;He
must be seen at Tattersall's as well as at Almack's; be more frequent in
attendance in the green-room of the theatre than at a
<hi rend="italic">lev&eacute;e</hi> in the palace; show as much readiness to enter
into a pigeon-match at Battersea Red House, as into a flirtation in May
Fair; distinguish himself in the hunting-field as much as at the dinner-table; and make as effective an appearance in the park as in the senate;
in short, he must be everything &mdash; not by turns, but all

<pb n="337"/>
at once &mdash; sportsman, exquisite, gourmand, rake, senator, and at least a
dozen other variations of the man of fashion, &mdash; his changes of character
being often quicker than those attempted by certain actors who nightly
undertake the performance of an entire <hi rend="italic">dramatis
person&aelig;</hi>.&amp;&rdquo; '
</p>
<note place="foot" n="133"><p>[133] It will be remembered that when Fox's
debts were in like manner estimated they amounted to &pound;140,000:
the coincidence is curious.  See ant&egrave;, p. 316.</p></note>
<p>Tommy Duncombe was not only indefatigable at Crockford's, but
at every other rendezvous of the votaries of fortune; a skilful player
withal, and not unfrequently a winner beyond expectation.  One night at
Crockford's he astonished the house by carrying off sixteen hundred
pounds.  He frequently played at cards with Count D'Orsay, from
whom, it is said, he invariably managed to win &mdash; the Count persisting in
playing with his pleasant companion, although warned by others that he
would never be a match for `Honest Tommy Duncombe.'
</p>
<p>Tom Duncombe died poor, but, says his son, `rich in the memory
of those who esteemed him, as Honest Tom Duncombe.'
</p>
<p>Perhaps the best thing the son could have done was to leave his
father's memory at rest in the estimation of `those who esteemed him;'
but having dragged his name once more, and promin

<pb n="338"/>
ently, before a censorious world, he can scarcely resent the following
estimate of Tom Duncombe, by a well-informed reviewer in the
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.  Alluding to the concluding summary of the father's
character and doings, this keen writer passes a sentence which is worth
preserving: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`Much of this would do for a patriot and philanthropist of the
highest class &mdash; for a Pym, a Hampden, or a Wilberforce; or, we could
fancy, a son of Andrew Marvell, vowing over his grave &ldquo;to
endeavour to imitate the virtues and emulate the self-sacrificing
patriotism of so estimable a parent, and so good a man.&amp;&rdquo;  But we
can hardly fancy, we cannot leave, a son of Duncombe in such a frame
of mind.  We cannot say to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> &mdash;

 </p>

<p>Macte nov&acirc; virtute, puer; sic itur ad astra.
 </p>
<p>&ldquo;In virtue renewed go on; thus to the skies we go.&amp;&rdquo;

We are unfeignedly reluctant to check a filial effusion, or to tell
disagreeable truths; but there are occasions when a sense of public duty
imperatively requires them to be told.
</p>
<p>`Why did this exemplary parent die poor?  When did he abandon
the allurements of a patrician circle?  He died poor because he wasted a

<pb n="339"/>
fine fortune.  If he abandoned a patrician circle, it was because he was
tired of it, or thought he could make a better thing of democracy.  If he
conquered his passions, it was, like St Evremond &mdash; by indulging them.
</p>
<p>` &ldquo;Honest Tom Duncombe!&amp;&rdquo;  We never heard him
so designated before except in pleasantry.  &ldquo;As honest as any
man living, that is an old man, and not honester than I.&amp;&rdquo;  We
cannot go further than Verges; it is a stretch of charity to go so far when
we call to mind the magnificent reversion and the French jobs.  A ruined
spendthrift, although he may have many good qualities, can never,
strictly speaking, be termed honest.  It is absurd to say of him that he is
nobody's enemy but his own &mdash; with family, friends, and tradespeople
paying the penalty for his self-indulgence.  He must be satisfied to be
called honourable &mdash; to be charged with no transgression of the law of
honour; which Paley defines as &ldquo;a system of rules constructed by
people of fashion, and calculated to facilitate their intercourse with one
another, <hi rend="italic">*and for no other purpose</hi>.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`There was one quality of honesty, however, which &ldquo;honest
Tom Duncombe&amp;&rdquo; did possess.

<pb n="340"/>
He was not a hypocrite.  He was not devoid of right feeling.  He had
plenty of good sense; and it would have given him a sickening pang on
his death-bed to think that his frailties were to be perpetuated by his
descendants; that he was to be pointed out as a shining star to guide,
instead of a beacon-fire to warn.  &ldquo;No,&amp;&rdquo; he would have
said, if he could have anticipated this most ill-chosen, however well-intentioned, tribute, &ldquo;spare me this terrible irony.  Do not
provoke the inevitable retort.  Say of me, if you must say anything, that
I was not a bad man, though an erring one; that I was kindly disposed
towards my fellow-creatures; that I did some good in my generation, and
was able and willing to do more, but that I heedlessly wasted time,
money, health, intellect, personal gifts, social advantages and
opportunities; that my career was a failure, and my whole scheme of life
a melancholy mistake.&amp;&rdquo; '[134]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="134"><p>[134] <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, Jan. 7,
1868.</p></note>
<p>This is a terrible rejoinder to a son endeavouring to raise a
monument to his beloved and respected parent.  But, if we will rake up
rottenness from the grave &mdash; rottenness in which we are interested &mdash; we
must take our chance whether we

<pb n="341"/>
shall find a Hamlet who will say, `Alas! poor Yorick!' and say <hi rend="italic">*no
more</hi> than the musing Dane upon the occasion.



WAS THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON A GAMESTER?<lb/>


</p><p>A few years after the battle of Waterloo there appeared a French
work entitled `<hi rend="italic">L'Academie des Jeux</hi>, par Philidor,' which
was soon translated into English, and here published under the title of
`Rouge et Noir; or, the Academies.'  It was a denunciation of gambling
in all its varieties, and was, no doubt, well-intentioned.  There was,
however, in the publication the following astounding statement: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`Not long ago the carriage of the heir-apparent to the
T <hi rend="super">* * * * *</hi> of England, in going to his
B <hi rend="super">* * * *</hi> 's lev&eacute;e, was arrested for debt in the
open street.  That great captain, who gained, if not laurels, an immense
treasure, on the plains of Wa <hi rend="super">* * * *</hi> oo, besides that
fortune transmitted to him by the English people, was impoverished in a
few months by this ignoble passion.'
</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the alleged gambling of the great
warrior and statesman was the public scandal of the day, as appears by
the duke's

<pb n="342"/>
own letters on the subject, published in the last volume of his
<hi rend="italic">Dispatches</hi>.  Even the eminent counsel, Mr Adolphus,
thought proper to allude to the report in one of his speeches at the bar.
This called forth the following letter from the duke to Mr Adolphus: &mdash;

 </p>








<p>`17 Sept., 1823.
 </p>
<p>`The Duke of Wellington presents his compliments to Mr
Adolphus, and encloses him the &ldquo;Morning Chronicle&amp;&rdquo; of
Friday, the 12th instant, to which the duke's attention has just been
called, in which Mr Adolphus will observe that he is stated to have
represented the duke as a person <hi rend="italic">*known sometimes to play at
Hazard, who might be committed as a rogue and vagabond</hi>.
</p>
<p>`The duke concludes that this paper contains a correct statement of
what Mr Adolphus said upon the occasion, and he assures Mr Adolphus
that he would not trouble him upon the subject if circumstances did not
exist which rendered this communication desirable.
</p>
<p>`Some years have elapsed since the public have been informed,
<hi rend="italic">*from the very best authority</hi>, that the duke had totally
ruined himself at play; and Mr Adolphus was present upon one occasion
when a

<pb n="343"/>
witness swore that he had heard the duke was constantly obliged to sell
the offices in the Ordnance himself, instead of allowing them to be sold
by others! !  The duke has suffered some inconvenience from this report
in a variety of ways, and he is anxious that at least it should not be re-peated by a gentleman of such celebrity and authority as Mr Adolphus.
</p>
<p>`He therefore assures Mr Adolphus that in the whole course of his
life he never won or lost &pound;20 at any game, and that he never
played at Hazard, or any game of chance, in any public place or club,
nor been for some years at all at any such place.
</p>
<p>`From these circumstances, Mr Adolphus will see that there is no
ground for making use of the duke's name as an example of a person
<hi rend="italic">*known sometimes to play at Hazard, who might be committed as a
rogue and vagabond</hi>.'

<hi rend="italic">Mr Adolphus to Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington</hi>.

 </p>





<p>`Percy Street, 21st Sept., 1823.
</p>
<p>`Mr Adolphus has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of a note
from his Grace the Duke of Wellington, and would have done so
yesterday,

<pb n="344"/>
but was detained in court till a late hour in the evening.  Mr Adolphus is
extremely sorry that any expression used by him should have occasioned
a moment's uneasiness to the Duke of Wellington.  Mr Adolphus cannot
deny that the report in the &ldquo;Chronicle&amp;&rdquo; is accurate, so far
as it recites his mere words; but the scope of his argument, and the
intended sense of his expression, was, that if the Vagrant Act were to
receive the extensive construction contended for, the most illustrious
subject of the realm might be degraded to the condition of the most
abject and worthless, for an act in itself indifferent &mdash; and which, until
the times had assumed a character of affected rigour, was considered
rather as a proof of good society than as an offence against good order.
Mr Adolphus is, however, perfectly sensible that his illustration in his
Grace's person was in all respects improper, and, considering the matters
to which his Grace has adverted, peculiarly unfortunate Mr Adolphus
feels with regret that any public expression of his sentiments on this
subject in the newspapers would not abate, but much increase, the evil.
Should an opportunity ever present itself of doing it naturally and
without affectation,

<pb n="345"/>
Mr Adolphus would most readily explain, in speaking at the bar, the
error he had committed; but it is very unlikely that there should exist an
occasion of which he can avail himself with a due regard to delicacy.
Mr Adolphus relies, however, on the Duke of Wellington's exalted mind
for credit to his assurance that he never meant to treat his name but with
the respect due to his Grace's exalted rank and infinitely higher renown.'

 </p>



<p><hi rend="italic">To Mr Adolphus</hi>.

 </p>






<p>`Woolford, 23rd Sept., 1823.
</p>
<p>`The Duke of Wellington presents his compliments to Mr
Adolphus, and assures Mr Adolphus that he is convinced that Mr
Adolphus never intended to reflect injuriously upon him.  If the duke had
believed that Mr Adolphus could have entertained such an intention he
would not have addressed him.  The duke troubles Mr Adolphus again
upon this subject, as, in consequence of the editor of the
&ldquo;Morning Chronicle&amp;&rdquo; having thought proper to advert to
this subject in a paragraph published on the 18th instant, the duke has
referred the paper of that date and that of the 12th to

<pb n="346"/>
the Attorney and Solicitor-general, his counsel, to consider whether the
editor ought not to be prosecuted.
</p>
<p>`The duke requests, therefore, that Mr Adolphus will not notice the
subject in the way he proposes until the gentlemen above mentioned will
have decided upon the advice which they will give the duke.'[135]
</p><note place="foot" n="135"><p>[135] `Dispatches,' vol. ii. part
i.</p></note>
<p>The result was, however, that the matter was allowed to drop, as
the duke was advised by his counsel that the paragraph in the
&ldquo;Morning Chronicle,&amp;&rdquo; though vile, was not actionable.
The positive declaration of the duke, `that in the whole course of his life
he never won or lost &pound;20 at any game, and that he never played
at Hazard, or any game of chance, in any public place or club, nor been
for some years at all at any such place,' should set the matter at rest.
Certainly the duke was afterwards an original member of Crockford's
Club, founded in 1827, but, unlike Bl&uuml;cher, who repeatedly lost
everything at play, `The Great Captain,' as Mr Timbs puts it, `was never
known to play deep at any game but war or politics.'[136]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="136"><p>[136] Club Life in London.</p></note>

<pb n="347"/>


<p>This remarkable deference to private character and public opinion,
on the part of the Duke of Wellington, is in wonderful contrast with the
easy morality of the Old Bailey advocate, Mr Adolphus, who did not
hesitate to declare gambling `an act in itself indifferent &mdash; and which,
until the times had assumed a character of <hi rend="italic">*affected</hi> rigour,
was considered rather as a proof of good society than as an offence
against good order.'  This averment of so distinguished a man may,
perhaps, mitigate the horror we now feel of the gambling propensities of
our ancestors; and it is a proof of some sort of advancement in morals,
or good taste, to know that no modern advocate would dare to utter such
a sentiment.

</p>
<p>Other great names have been associated with gambling; thus Mr T.
H. Duncombe says, speaking of Crockford's soon after its foundation: &mdash;
`Sir St Vincent Cotton (Lord Combermere), Lord Fitzroy Somerset
(Raglan), the Marquis of Anglesey, Sir Hussey Vivian, Wilson Croker,
<hi rend="italic">Disraeli</hi>, Horace Twiss, Copley, George Anson, and George
Payne <hi rend="italic">*were pretty sure of being present</hi>, many of them
playing high.'


<pb n="348"/>

</p>
<p>Respecting this statement the <hi rend="italic">Times'</hi>[137] reviewer
observes: &mdash; `We do not know what the Chancellor of the Exchequer will
say to this.  Mr Wilson Croker (who affected great strictness) would
have fainted away.  But the authority of a writer who does not know Sir
St Vincent Cotton (the ex-driver of the Brighton coach) from Sir
<hi rend="italic">Stapleton</hi> Cotton (the Peninsular hero) will go for little in
such matters; and as for Copley, Lord Lyndhurst (just then promoted
from the Rolls to the Woolsack), why not say at once that he attended
the nocturnal sittings at Crockford's in his robes.' </p>

CHAPTER XII.

REMARKABLE GAMESTERS.

MONSIEUR CHEVALIER.</head>


<p>MONSIEUR CHEVALIER, Captain of the Grenadiers in the first
regiment of Foot Guards, in the time of Charles II. of England, was a
native of Normandy.  In his younger days he was page to the Duchess of
Orleans; but growing too big for that service, he came to England to
seek his fortune, and by some good luck and favour became an ensign in
the first regiment of Foot Guards.  His pay, however, being insufficient
to maintain him, he felt compelled to become a gamester, or rather to
resort to a practice in which doubtless he had been early initiated at the
Court of France; and he managed so well that he was soon enabled to
keep up an equipage much above his station.


<pb n="350"/>

</p>
<p>Among the `bubbles' who had the misfortune to fall into
Chevalier's hands, was a certain nobleman, who lost a larger sum to him
than he could conveniently pay down, and asked for time, to which
Chevalier assented, and in terms so courteous and obliging that the
former, a fortnight after, in order to let him see that he remembered his
civility, came one morning and told Chevalier that he had a company of
Foot to dispose of, and if it was worth his while, it should be at his
service.  Nothing could be more acceptable to Chevalier, who at once
closed for the bargain, and got his commission signed the same day.
Besides the fact that it was a time of peace, Chevalier knew well that the
military title of Captain was a very good cloak to shelter under.  He
knew that a man of no employment or any visible income, who appears
and lives like a gentleman, and makes gaming his constant business, is
always suspected of not playing for diversion only; and, in short, of
knowing and practising more than he should do.
</p>
<p>Chevalier once won 20 guineas from mad Ogle, the Life-guardsman, who, understanding that the former had bit him, called him
to account, demanding either his money back, or satisfaction in the

<pb n="351"/>
field.  Chevalier, having always courage enough to maintain what he did,
chose the latter.  Ogle fought him in Hyde Park, and wounded him
through the sword arm, and got back his money.  After this they were
always good friends, playing several comical tricks, one of which is as
follows, strikingly illustrating the manners of the times.
</p>
<p>Chevalier and Ogle meeting one day in Fleet Street jostled for the
wall, which they strove to take of each other, whereupon words arising
between them, they drew swords, and pushed very hard at one another;
but were prevented, by the great crowd which gathered about them, from
doing any mischief.  Ogle, seeming still to resent the affront, cried to
Chevalier, `If you are a gentleman, pray follow me.'  The French hero
accepted the challenge; so going together up Bell Yard and through
Lincoln's Inn, with some hundreds of the mob at their heels, as soon as
the seeming adversaries were got into Lincoln's Inn Fields, they both fell
a running as fast as they could, with their swords drawn, up towards
Lord Powis's house, which was then building, and leaped into a saw-pit.
The rabble presently ran after them, to part them again, and

<pb n="352"/>
feared mischief would be done before they could get up to them, but
when they arrived at the saw-pit, they saw Chevalier at one side of it and
Ogle at the other, sitting together as lovingly as if they had never fallen
out at all.  And then the mob was so incensed at this trick put upon
them, that had not some gentlemen accidentally come by, they would
have knocked them both on the head with brickbats.
</p>
<p>Chevalier had an excellent knack at cogging a die, and such
command in the throwing, that, chalking a circle on a table, with its
circumference no bigger than a shilling, he would, at above the distance
of one foot, throw a die exactly into it, which should be either ace,
deuce, trey, or what he pleased.
</p>
<p>Aubrey de Vere, Earl of Oxford, was a great gambler of the time,
and often practised dice-throwing in his shirt during the morning until he
fancied himself in luck, when he would proceed to try his fortune with
Chevalier; but the dexterity of the latter always convinced the earl that
no certainty lies on the good success which may be fancied as likely to
result from play in jest.  Chevalier won a great deal of money from that
peer, `who lost most

<pb n="353"/>
of his estate at gaming before he died, and which ought to be a warning
to all noblemen.'
</p>
<p>Chevalier was a skilful sharper, and thoroughly up in the art and
mystery of loading dice with quicksilver; but having been sometimes
detected in his sharping tricks, he was obliged `to look on the point of
the sword, with which being often wounded, latterly he declined
fighting, if there were any way of escape.'  Having once `choused,' or
cheated, a Mr Levingstone, page of honour to King James II., out of 50
guineas, the latter gave the captain a challenge to fight him next day
behind Montague House &mdash; a locality long used for the purpose of
duelling.  Chevalier seemingly accepted the challenge, and next morning,
Levingstone going to Chevalier's lodging, whom he found in bed, put
him in mind of what he was come about.  Chevalier, with the greatest
air of courage imaginable, rose, and having dressed himself, said to
Levingstone &mdash; `Me must beg de favour of you to stay a few minutes, sir,
while I step into my closet dere, for as me be going about one desperate
piece of work, it is very requisite for me to say a small prayer or two.'
Accordingly Mr Levingstone consented to wait whilst Chevalier re

<pb n="354"/>
tired to his closet to pray; but hearing the conclusion of his prayer to end
with these words &mdash; `Me verily believe spilling man's blood is one ver'
great sin, wherefore I hope all de saints will interced vid de Virgin for
my once killing Monsieur de Bloti&eacute;res at Rochelle, &mdash; my killing
Chevalier de Cominge at Brest, &mdash; killing Major de Tierceville at
Lyons, &mdash; killing Lieutenant du Marche Falliere at Paris, with half a
dozen other men in France; so, being also sure of killing him I'm now
going to fight, me hope his forcing me to shed his blood will not be laid
to my charge;' &mdash; quoth Levingstone to himself &mdash; `And are you then so
sure of me?  But I'll engage you shan't &mdash; for if you are such a devil at
killing men, you shall go and fight yourself and be  &mdash;  &mdash; .'  Whereupon
he made what haste he could away, and shortly Chevalier coming out of
the closet and finding Levingstone not in the room, was very glad of his
absence.'
</p>
<p>Some time after, Chevalier was called to account by another
gentleman.  They met at the appointed hour in Chelsea Fields, when
Chevalier said to his adversary &mdash; `Pray, sir, for what do we fight?'  The
gentleman replied &mdash; `For honour and reputation.'  Thereupon Chevalier
pulling a halter out of his

<pb n="355"/>
pocket, and throwing it between him and his antagonist, exclaimed &mdash;
`Begar, sir, we only fight for dis one piece of rope &mdash; so e'en <hi rend="italic">*win
it and wear it</hi>.'  The effect of this jest was so great on his
adversary that swords were put up, and they went home together good
friends.
</p>
<p>Chevalier continued his sharping courses for about fourteen years,
running a reckless race, `sometimes with much money, sometimes with
little, but always as lavish in spending as he was covetous in getting it;
until at last King James ascending the throne, the Duke of Monmouth
raised a rebellion in the West of England, where, in a skirmish between
the Royalists and Rebels, he was shot in the back, and the wound
thought to be given by one of his own men, to whom he had always
been a most cruel, harsh officer, whilst a captain of the Grenadiers of
the Foot Guards.  He was sensible himself how he came by this
misfortune; for when he was carried to his tent mortally wounded, and
the Duke of Albemarle came to visit him, he said to his Grace &mdash; `Dis
was none of my foe dat shot me in the back.'  `He was none of your
friend that shot you,' the duke replied.


<pb n="356"/>

</p>
<p>So dying within a few hours after, he was interred in a field near
Philip Norton Lane, as the old chronicler says &mdash; `much
<hi rend="italic">*un</hi>lamented by all who knew him.'[138]

<p>
JOHN HIGDEN.<lb/>


</p><p>This gambler, who flourished towards the end of the 17th century,
was descended from a very good family in the West of England.  In his
younger days he was a member of the Honourable Society of the Middle
Temple, but his inclinations being incompatible with close study of the
law, he soon quitted the inns of court and went into the army.  He
obtained not only a commission in the first regiment of Boot Guards, but
a commission of the peace for the county of Middlesex, in which he
continued for three or four years as Justice Higden.  He was very great
at dice; and one night he and another of his fraternity going to a gaming
house, Higden drew a chair and sat down, but as often as the box came
to him he passed it, and remained only as a spectator; but at last one of
the players said to him pertly, `Sir, if you won't play, what do you sit
there for?'

<pb n="357"/>
Upon which Higden snatched up the dice-box and said, `Set me what you
will and I'll throw at it.'  One of the gentlemen set him two guineas,
which he won, and then set him four, which he `nicked' also.  The rest
of the gentlemen took the part of the loser, and set to Higden, who, by
some art and some good luck, won 120 guineas; and presently, after
throwing out, rose from the table and went to his companion by the
fireside, who asked him how he durst be so audacious as to play,
knowing he had not a shilling in his pocket?  One of the losers
overhearing what was said, exclaimed, `How's that &mdash; you had no money
when you began to play?' `That's no matter,' replied Higden, `I have
enough <hi rend="italic">*now;</hi> and if you had won of me, you must have
been contented to have kicked, buffeted, or pumped me, and you would
have done it as long as you liked.  Besides, sir, I am a soldier, and have
often faced the mouths of thundering cannons for <hi rend="italic">*eight shillings a
day</hi>, and do you think I would not hazard the tossing of a blanket
for the money I have won to-night?'
</p>
<p>`All the parties wondered at his confidence, but he laughed heartily
at their folly and his good fortune, and so marched off with a light

<pb n="358"/>
heart and a heavy purse.'  Afterwards, `to make himself as miserable as
he could, he turned poet, went to Ireland, published a play or two, and
shortly after he died very poor, in 1703.'[139]

MONSIEUR GERMAIN.<lb/>


</p><p>This gambler was of low birth, his parents keeping an ordinary in
Holland, where he was born, as stated by the old chronicler, `in the
happy Revolution of 1688.'
</p>
<p>His career is remarkable on account of his connection with Lady
Mary Mordaunt, wife of `the Duke of Norfolk, who, proving her guilty
of adultery, was divorced from her.  She then lived publicly with
Germain.'
</p>
<p>This Germain was the first to introduce what was called the
<hi rend="italic">Spanish Whist</hi>, stated to be `a mere bite, performed after this
manner: &mdash; Having a pack of cards, the four treys are privately laid on
the top of them, under them an ace, and next to that a deuce; then,
letting your adversary cut the cards, you do not pack them, but deal all
of them that are cut off, one at a time, between you; then, taking up the
other parcel of cards, you deal

<pb n="359"/>
more cards, giving yourself two treys and a deuce, and to the other
persons two treys and an ace, when, laying the remainder of the cards
down &mdash; wherein are allowed no trumps, but only the highest cards win &mdash;
so they are but of the same suit, whilst you are playing, giving your
antagonist all you can, as though it is not in your power to prevent him.
You seem to fret, and cry you have good <hi rend="italic">put-cards;</hi> he,
having two treys and an ace, will be apt to lay a wager with you that you
cannot have better than he; then you binding the wager, he soon sees his
mistake.  But in this trick you must observe to put the other three deuces
under yours when you deal.'
</p>
<p>It seems that this Monsieur Germain is not only remarkable for the
above precious addition to human knowledge, but also on account of his
expertness at the game of <hi rend="italic">Ombre</hi>, celebrated and so elegantly
described by Pope in his `Rape of the Lock.'
</p>
<p>He appears to have lived with the Duchess of Norfolk ever after
the divorce; and he died a little after Lady Mary, in 1712, aged 46
years.</p><note place="foot" n="140"><p>[140] <hi rend="italic">ubi supr&agrave;</hi>.</p></note>

TOM HUGHES.<lb/>

</p><p>This Irishman was born in Dublin, and was the son of a
respectable tradesman.  Falling into dissipated company, he soon left the
city to try his fortune in London, where he played very deep and very
successfully.
</p>
<p>He threw away his gains as fast as he made them, chiefly among
the frail sisterhood, at a notorious house in those days, in the Piazza,
Covent Garden.  He frequented Carlisle House in Soho Square, and was
a proprietor of E O tables kept by a Dr Graham in Pall Mall.
</p>
<p>He had a rencontre, in consequence of a dispute at play, and was
wounded.  The meeting took place under the Piazza, and his antagonist's
sword struck a rib, which counteracted its dangerous effect.
</p>
<p>Soon afterwards he won &pound;3000 from a young man just of
age, who made over to him a landed estate for the amount, and he was
shortly after admitted a member of the Jockey Club.
</p>
<p>His fortune now changed, and falling into the hands of Old Pope,
the money-lender, he was not long before he had to transfer his estate to
him.


<pb n="361"/>

</p>
<p>After many ups and downs he became an inmate of the spunging-house of the infamous Scoldwell, who was afterwards transported.  He
actually used his prison as a gaming house, to which his infatuated
friends resorted; but his means failed, his friends cooled, and he was
removed `over the water,' from which he was only released by the
Insolvent Act, with a broken constitution.  Arrest soon restored him to
his old habitation, a lock-up house, where he died so poor, a victim to
grief, misery, and disease, that he did not leave enough to pay for a
coffin, which was procured by his quondam friend, Mr Thornton, at
whose cost he was buried.  Perhaps more than half a million of money
had `passed through his hands.'



ANDREWS, THE GREAT BILLIARD-PLAYER.<lb/>


</p><p>Andrews was reckoned so theoretically and practically perfect at
the game of Billiards that he had no equal except Abraham Carter, who
kept the tables at the corner of the Piazza, Russell Street, Covent
Garden.
</p>
<p>He one night won of Colonel W &mdash;  &mdash; e about a thousand pounds;
and the Colonel appointed to meet him next day to transact for stock
accord

<pb n="362"/>
ingly.  Going in a hackney-coach to the Bank of England for this
purpose, they tossed up who should pay for the coach.  Andrews lost &mdash;
and positively on this small beginning he was excited to continue betting,
until he lost the whole sum he had won the night before!  When the
coachman stopped he was ordered to drive them back again, as they had
no occasion to get out!
</p>
<p>Thus, in a few years, Hazard and other games of chance stripped
him of his immense winnings at Billiards, and he had nothing left but a
small annuity, fortunately for him so settled that he could not dispose of
it &mdash; though he made every effort to do so!
</p>
<p>He afterwards retired in the county of Kent, and was heard to
declare that he never knew contentment when wallowing in riches; but
that since he was compelled to live on a scanty pittance, he was one of
the happiest men in the world.


WHIG MIDDLETON.<lb/>


</p><p>Whig Middleton was a tall, handsome, fashionable man, with an
adequate fortune.  He one night had a run of ill-luck at Arthur's, and
lost about a thousand guineas.  Lord Montford, in the gaming

<pb n="363"/>
phrase, asked him what he would do or what he would not do, to get
home?  `My lord,' said he, `prescribe your own terms.'
</p>
<p>`Then,' resumed Lord Montford, `dress directly opposite to the
fashion for ten years.  Will you agree to it?'  Middleton said that he
would, and kept his word.  Nay, he died nine years afterwards so
unfashionably that he did not owe a tradesman a farthing &mdash; left some
playing debts unliquidated, and his coat and wig were of the cut of
Queen Anne's reign.
</p>
<p>Lord Montford is said to have died in a very different but quite
fashionable manner.



CAPTAIN CAMPBELL.<lb/>


</p><p>Captain Campbell, of the Guards, was a natural son of the Duke
of  &mdash;  &mdash; .  He lost a thousand guineas to a Shark, which he could not
pay.  Being questioned by the duke one day at dinner as to the cause of
his dejection, he reluctantly confessed the fact.  `Sir,' said his Grace,
`you do not owe a farthing to the blackguard.  My steward settled with
him this morning for <hi rend="italic">*ten</hi> guineas, and he was glad to take
them, only saying &mdash; &ldquo;I was damned far North, and it was well it
was no worse.&amp;&rdquo; '




<pb n="364"/>


WROTHESLY, DUKE OF BEDFORD.<lb/>


</p><p>Wrothesly, Duke of Bedford, was the subject of a conspiracy at
Bath, formed by several first-rate sharpers, among whom were the
manager of a theatre, and Beau Nash, master of the ceremonies.  After
being plundered of above &pound;70,000 at Hazard, his Grace rose in a
passion, put the dice in his pocket, and intimated his resolution to inspect
them.  He then retired into another room, and, flinging himself upon a
sofa, fell asleep.
</p>
<p>The winners, to escape disgrace, and obtain their money, cast lots
who should pick his pockets of the loaded dice, and introduce fair ones
in their place.  The lot fell on the manager of the theatre, who
performed his part without discovery.  The duke inspected the dice when
he awoke, and finding them correct, renewed his party, and lost
&pound;30,000 more.
</p>
<p>The conspirators had received &pound;5000, but disagreed on its
division, and Beau Nash, thinking himself ill-used, divulged the fact to
his Grace, who saved thereby the remainder of the money.  He made
Nash a handsome present, and ever after gave him his countenance,
supposing that the secret had been divulged through pure
friendship.




<pb n="365"/>


THE DUKE OF NORFOLK.<lb/>


</p><p>A similar anecdote is told of another gamester.  `The late Duke of
Norfolk,' says the author of `Rouge et Noir,' writing in 1823, `in one
evening lost the sum of &pound;70,000 in a gaming house on the right
side of St James's Street: suspecting foul play, he put the dice in his
pocket, and, as was his custom when up late, took a bed in the house.
The blacklegs were all dismayed, till one of the worthies, who is
believed to have been a principal in poisoning the horses at Newmarket,
for which Dan Dawson was hanged, offered for &pound;5000 to go to
the duke's room with a brace of pistols and a pair of dice, and, if the
duke was awake, to shoot him, if asleep to change the dice!  Fortunately
for the gang, the duke &ldquo;snored,&amp;&rdquo; as the agent stated,
&ldquo;like a pig;&amp;&rdquo; the dice were changed.  His Grace had them
broken in the morning, when, finding them good, he paid the money,
and left off gambling.'[141]

GENERAL OGLE: A BOLD STROKE.<lb/>
</p><p>
A few weeks before General Ogle was to sail for

<pb n="366"/>
India, he constantly attended Paine's, in Charles Street, St James's
Square.  One evening there were before him two wooden bowls full of
gold, which held &pound;1500 guineas each, and &pound;4000 in rou-leaus, which he had won.
</p>
<p>When the box came to him, he shook the dice and with great
coolness and pleasantry said &mdash; `Come, I'll either win or lose seven
thousand upon this hand.  Will any gentleman set on the whole?
<hi rend="italic">*Seven</hi> is the main.'  Then rattling the dice once more, cast
the box from him and quitted it, the dice remaining uncovered.
</p>
<p>Although the General did not think this too large a sum for one
man to risk at a single throw, the rest of the gentlemen did, and for
some time the bold gamester remained unset.
</p>
<p>He then said &mdash; `Well, gentlemen, will you make it up amongst
you?'
</p>
<p>One set him 500 guineas, another 500.  `Come,' said he, `whilst
you are making up the money I'll tell you a story.'  Here he began &mdash; but
perceiving that he was at last completely set for the cast, stopt short &mdash;
laid his hand on the box, saying &mdash; `I believe I am completely set,
gentlemen?'  `Yes, sir, and Seven is the main,' was the reply.  The
General

<pb n="367"/>
threw out, and lost!  Seven thousand guineas!
</p>
<p>Then with astonishing coolness he took up his snuff-box and
smiling exclaimed &mdash; `Now, gentlemen, if you please, I'll finish my
story.'



HORACE WALPOLE.<lb/>


</p><p>There can be no doubt that Horace Walpole was an inveterate
gambler, although he managed to keep always afloat and merrily
sailing &mdash; for he says himself: &mdash; `A good lady last year was delighted at
my becoming peer, and said &mdash; &ldquo;I hope you will get an Act of
Parliament for putting down Faro.&amp;&rdquo;  As if I could make Acts of
Parliament! and could I, it would be very consistent too in me, who for
some years played more at Faro than anybody.'[142]

<p>
THE EARL OF MARCH.<lb/>


</p><p>This extraordinary and still famous personage, better known as the
Duke of Queensberry, was the `observed of all observers' almost from
his boyhood to extreme old age.  His passions were for women and the
turf; and the sensual devotedness with which he pursued the one, and the
eccentricity which he displayed in the enjoyment of

<pb n="368"/>
both, added to the observation which he attracted from his position as a
man of high rank and princely fortune, rendered him an object of
unceasing curiosity.  He was deeply versed in the mysteries of the turf,
and in all practical and theoretical knowledge connected with the race-course was acknowledged to be the most accomplished adept of his own
time.  He seems also to have been a skilful gamester and player of
billiards.  Writing to George Selwyn from Paris in 1763, he says: &mdash; `I
won the first day about &pound;2000, of which I brought off about
&pound;1500.  All things are exaggerated, I am supposed to have won at
least twice as much.'  In 1765 he is said to have won two thousand louis
of a German at billiards.  Writing to Selwyn, Gilly Williams says of
him:  `I did not know he was more an adept at that game than you are at
any other, but I think you are both said to be losers on the whole, at
least Betty says that her letters mention you as pillaged.'
</p>
<p>Among the numerous occasions on which the name of the Duke of
Queensberry came before the public in connection with sporting matters,
may be mentioned the circumstance of the following curious trial, which
took place before Lord Mans

<pb n="369"/>
field in the Court of King's Bench, in 1771.  The Duke of Queensberry,
then Lord March, was the plaintiff, and a Mr Pigot the defendant.  The
object of this trial was to recover the sum of five hundred guineas, being
the amount of a wager laid by the duke With Mr Pigot &mdash; whether Sir
William Codrington or <hi rend="italic">*old</hi> Mr Pigot should die first.  It had
singularly happened that Mr Pigot died suddenly the <hi rend="italic">*same
morning</hi>, of the gout in his head, but before either of the parties
interested in the result of the wager could by any possibility have been
made acquainted with the fact.  In the contemporary accounts of the
trial, the Duke of Queensberry is mentioned as having been accom-modated with a seat on the bench; while Lord Ossory, and several other
noblemen, were examined on the merits of the case.  By the counsel for
the defendant it was argued that (as in the case of a horse dying before
the day on which he was to be run) the wager was invalid and annulled.
Lord Mansfield, however, was of a different opinion; and after a brief
charge from that great lawyer, the jury brought in a verdict for the
plaintiff for five hundred guineas, and he sentenced the defendant to
defray the costs of the suit.[143] </p>

<pb n="370"/>

<p>This prince of debauchees seems to have surpassed every model of
the kind, ancient or modern.  In his prime he reproduced in his own
drawing-room the scene of Paris and the Goddesses, exactly as we see it
in classic pictures, three of the most beautiful women of London
representing the divinities as they appeared to Paris on Mount Ida, while
he himself, dressed as the Dardan shepherd holding a <hi rend="italic">*gilded</hi>
apple (it should have been really golden) in his hand, conferred the prize
on her whom he deemed the fairest.  In his decrepit old age it was his
custom, in fine sunny weather, to seat himself in his balcony in
Piccadilly, where his figure was familiar to every person who was in the
habit of passing through that great thoroughfare.  Here (his emaciated
figure rendered the more conspicuous from his custom of holding a
parasol over his head) he was in the habit of watching every attractive
female form, and ogling every pretty face that met his eye.  He is said,
indeed, to have kept a pony and a servant in constant readiness, in order
to follow and ascertain the residence of any fair girl whose attractions
particularly caught his fancy!  At this period the old man was deaf with
one ear, blind with one eye,

<pb n="371"/>
nearly toothless, and labouring under multiplied infirmities.  But the
hideous propensities of his prime still pursued him when all enjoyment
was impossible.  Can there be a greater penalty for unbridled
licentiousness?



MR LUMSDEN.<lb/>


</p><p>Mr Lumsden, whose inveterate love of gambling eventually caused
his ruin, was to be seen every day at Frascati's, the celebrated gambling
house kept by Mme Dunan, where some of the most celebrated women
of the <hi rend="italic">demi-monde</hi> usually congregated.  He was a martyr to
the gout, and his hands and knuckles were a mass of chalk-stones.  He
stuck to the <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi> table until everybody had left; and
while playing would take from his pocket a small slate, upon which he
would rub his chalk-stones until blood flowed.  `Having on one occasion
been placed near him at the <hi rend="italic">Rouge et Noir</hi> table, I ventured,'
says Captain Gronow, `to expostulate with him for rubbing his knuckles
against his slate.  He coolly answered, &ldquo;I feel relieved when I see
the blood ooze out.&amp;&rdquo; '
</p>
<p>Mr Lumsden was remarkable for his courtly manners; but his
absence of mind was astonish

<pb n="372"/>
ing, for he would frequently ask his neighbour <hi rend="italic">*where he
was</hi>!  Crowds of men and women would congregate behind his
chair, to look at `the mad Englishman,' as he was called; and his eccen-tricities used to amuse even the croupiers.  After losing a large fortune at
this den of iniquity, Mr Lumsden encountered every evil of poverty, and
died in a wretched lodging in the Rue St Marc.[144]

GENERAL SCOTT, THE HONEST WINNER OF &pound;200,000.<lb/>


</p><p>General Scott, the father-in-law of George Canning and the Duke
of Portland, was known to have won at White's &pound;200,000, thanks
to his notorious sobriety and knowledge of the game of Whist.  The
general possessed a great advantage over his companions by avoiding
those indulgences at the table which used to muddle other men's brains.
He confined himself to dining off something like a boiled chicken, with
toast and water; by such a regimen he came to the Whist table with a
clear head; and possessing as he did a remarkable memory, with great
coolness of judgment, he was able honestly to win the enormous sum of
&pound;200,000.

RICHARD BENNET.<lb/>

</p><p>Richard Bennet had gone through every walk of a blackleg, from
being a billiard sharper at a table in Bell Alley until he became a keeper
or partner in all the `hells' in St James's.  In each stage of his journey he
had contrived to have so much the better of his competitors, that he was
enabled to live well, to bring up and educate a large legitimate family,
and to gratify all his passions and sensuality.  But besides all this, he
accumulated an ample fortune, which this inveterate gamester did
actually possess when the terriers of justice overtook and hunted him into
the custody of the Marshal of the Court of Queen's Bench.  Here he was
sentenced to be imprisoned a certain time, on distinct indictments, for
keeping different gaming houses, and was ordered to be kept in custody
until he had also paid fines to the amount, we believe, of &pound;4000.
Bennet, however, after undergoing the imprisonment, managed to get
himself discharged without paying the fines.

<pb n="374"/>
and the gaming table.  Ascot was his elysium.  His horses occupied him
by day and the Hazard table by night.  At the latter one night he was
seen repeatedly turning over a <hi rend="italic">*quire of bank notes</hi>, and a
gentleman asked him what he was looking for, when he replied, `I am
looking for a <hi rend="italic">*little one</hi>.'  The inquirer said he could
accommodate him, and desired to know for what sum.  Dennis O'Kelly
answered, `I want a FIFTY, or something of <hi rend="italic">*that sort</hi>, just
to set the <hi rend="italic">*caster</hi>.  At this moment it was supposed he had
seven or eight <hi rend="italic">*thousand</hi> pounds in notes in his hand, but not
one for less than a <hi rend="italic">*hundred!</hi>
</p>
<p>Dennis O'Kelly always threw with great success; and when he held
the box he was seldom known to refuse throwing for <hi rend="italic">*any
sum</hi> that the company chose to set him.  He was always liberal in
<hi rend="italic">*setting the caster</hi>, and preventing a stagnation of trade at the
<hi rend="italic">*table</hi>, which, from the great property always about him, it
was his good fortune very frequently to deprive of its last floating
guinea, when the box of course became dormant for want of a single
adventurer.
</p>
<p>It was his custom to carry a great number of bank notes in his
waistcoat pocket, twisted up

<pb n="375"/>
together, with the greatest indifference; and on one occasion, in his
attendance at a Hazard table at Windsor, during the races, being a
<hi rend="italic">*standing</hi> better and every chair full, a person's hand was
observed, by those on the opposite side of the table, just in the act of
drawing two notes out of his pocket.  The alarm was given, and the
hand, from the person behind, was instantly withdrawn, and the notes
left sticking out.  The company became clamorous for taking the
offender before a magistrate, and many attempted to secure him for the
purpose; but Captain Dennis O'Kelly very philosophically seized him by
the collar, kicked him down-stairs, and exultingly exclaimed, `'Twas a
<hi rend="italic">*sufficient punishment</hi> to be deprived of the pleasure of
keeping company with <hi rend="italic">*jontlemen</hi>.'
</p>
<p>A bet for a large sum was once proposed to this `Admirable
Crichton' of the turf and the gaming table, and accepted.  The proposer
asked O'Kelly where lay his <hi rend="italic">*estates</hi> to answer for the
amount if he lost?'  `My estates!' cried O'Kelly.  `Oh, if that's what you
<hi rend="italic">*mane</hi>, I've a <hi rend="italic">*map</hi> of them here' &mdash; and opening
his pocket-book he exhibited bank notes to <hi rend="italic">*ten times</hi> the
sum in question, and ultimately added the <hi rend="italic">*inquirer's</hi>
contribution to them.


<pb n="376"/>

</p>
<p>Such was the wonderful son of Erin, `Captain' or `Colonel' Dennis
O'Kelly.  One would like to know what ultimately became of him.


DICK ENGLAND.<lb/>


</p><p>Jack Tether, Bob W &mdash; r, Tom H &mdash; ll, Captain O'Kelly, and
others, spent with Dick England a great part of the plunder of poor
Clutterbuck, a clerk of the Bank of England, who not only lost his all,
but robbed the Bank of an immense sum to pay his `debts of honour.'
</p>
<p>A Mr B &mdash; , a Yorkshire gentleman, proposed to his brother-in-law, who was with him, to put down ten pounds each and try their luck
at the `Hell' kept by `the Clerks of the Minster,' in the Minster Yard,
next the Church.  It was the race-week.  There were about thirteen
Greeks there, Dick England at their head.  Mr B &mdash;  put down
&pound;10.  England then called `Seven the main &mdash; if seven or eleven is
thrown next, the Caster wins.'  Of course Dick intended to win; but he
blundered in his operation; he <hi rend="italic">*landed</hi> at six and the other
did not answer his hopes.  Yet, with matchless effrontery, he swore he
had called <hi rend="italic">*six</hi> and not seven; and as it was referred to the
majority of the goodly company,

<pb n="377"/>
thirteen <hi rend="italic">*honest gentlemen</hi> gave it in Dick England's favour,
and with him divided the spoil.
</p>
<p>A Mr D &mdash; , a gentleman of considerable landed property in the
North, proposed passing a few days at Scarborough.  Dick England saw
his carriage enter the town, and contrived to get into his company and go
with him to the rooms.  When the assembly was over, he prevailed on
Mr D &mdash;  to sup with him.  After supper Mr D &mdash;  was completely
intoxicated, and every effort to make him play was tried in vain.
</p>
<p>This was, of course, very provoking; but still something must be
done, and a very clever scheme they hit upon to try and `do' this `young
man from the country.'  Dick England and two of his associates played
for five minutes, and then each of them marked a card as follows: &mdash;
`D &mdash;  owes me one hundred guineas,' `D &mdash;  owes me eighty guineas;'
but Dick marked <hi rend="italic">*his</hi> card &mdash; `I owe D &mdash;  thirty guineas.'
</p>
<p>The next day, Mr D &mdash;  met Dick England on the cliff and
apologized for his excess the night before, hoping he had given no
offence `when drunk and incapable.'  Having satisfied the gentleman on
this point, Dick England presented him

<pb n="378"/>
with a thirty-guinea note, which, in spite of contradiction, remonstrance,
and denial of any play having taken place, he forced on Mr D &mdash;  as his
<hi rend="italic">*fair winning</hi> &mdash; adding that he had paid hundreds to
gentlemen in liquor, who knew nothing of it till he had produced the
account.  Of course Mr D &mdash;  could not help congratulating himself at
having fallen in with a perfect gentleman, as well as consoling himself
for any head-ache or other inconvenience resulting from his night's
potation.  They parted with gushing civilities between them.
</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, however, two other gentlemen came up to Mr
D &mdash; , whom the latter had some vague recollection of having seen the
evening before, in company with Dick England; and at length, from
what the two gentlemen said, he had no doubt of the fact, and thought it
a fit opportunity to make a due acknowledgment of the gentlemanly
conduct of their friend, who had paid him a bet which he had no
remembrance of having made.
</p>
<p>No mood could be better for the purpose of the meeting; so the
two gentlemen not only approved of the conduct of Dick, and descanted
on the propriety of paying drunken men what they won, but also
declared that no <hi rend="italic">*gentleman</hi> would refuse to pay a

<pb n="379"/>
debt of honour won from him when drunk; and at once begged leave to
`remind' Mr D &mdash;  that he had lost to them 180 guineas!  In vain the
astounded Mr D &mdash;  denied all knowledge of the transaction; the
gentlemen affected to be highly indignant, and talked loudly of injured
honour.  Besides, had he not received 30 guineas from their friend?  So
he assented, and appointed the next morning to settle the matter.
</p>
<p>Fortunately for Mr D &mdash; , however, some intelligent friends of his
arrived in the mean time, and having heard his statement about the whole
affair, they `smelt a rat,' and determined to ferret it out.  They examined
the waiter &mdash; previously handing him over five guineas &mdash; and this man
declared the truth that Mr D &mdash;  did not play at all &mdash; in fact, that he was
in such a condition that there could not be any real play.  Dick England
was therefore `blown' on this occasion.  Mr D &mdash;  returned him his thirty
guineas, and paid five guineas for his share of the supper; and well he
might, considering that it very nearly cost him 150 guineas &mdash; that is,
having to receive 30 guineas and to pay 180 guineas to the Greeks &mdash;
profit and loss with a vengeance.
</p>
<p>Being thus `blown' at Scarborough, Dick Eng

<pb n="380"/>
land and his associates decamped on the following morning.
</p>
<p>He next formed a connection with a lieutenant on half pay, nephew
to an Irish earl.  With this lieutenant he went to Spa, and realized
something considerable; but not without suspicion &mdash; for a few dice were
missed.
</p>
<p>Dick England returned to London, where he shortly disagreed with
the lieutenant.  The latter joined the worthy before described, Captain
O'Kelly, who was also at enmity with Dick England; and the latter took
an opportunity of knocking their heads together in a public coffee-room,
and thrashing them both till they took shelter under the tables.  Dick had
the strength of an ox, the ferocity of a bull-dog, and `the cunning of the
serpent,' although what the latter is no naturalist has ever yet discovered
or explained.
</p>
<p>The lieutenant determined on revenge for the thrashing.  He had
joined his regiment, and he `peached' against his former friend,
disclosing to the officers the circumstance of the dice at Spa, before
mentioned; and, of course, upset all the designs of Dick England and his
associates.  This enraged all the blacklegs; a combination was

<pb n="381"/>
formed against the lieutenant; and he was shot through the head by `a
brother officer,' who belonged to the confraternity.
</p>
<p>The son of an earl lost forty thousand pounds in play to Dick
England; and shot himself at Stacie's Hotel in consequence &mdash; the very
night before his honourable father sent his steward to pay the `debt of
honour' in full &mdash; though aware that his son had been cheated out of it.
</p>
<p>But the most extraordinary `pass' of Dick England's career is still
to be related &mdash; not without points in it which make it difficult to believe,
in spite of the evidence, that it is the same `party' who was concerned in
it.  Here it is.
</p>
<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi>, in Gilchrist's Collection
of British Duels, in Dr Millingen's reproduction of the latter, the
following account occurs: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`Mr Richard England was put to the bar at the Old Bailey, charged
with the &ldquo;wilful murder&amp;&rdquo; of Mr Rowlls, brewer, of
Kingston, in a duel at Cranford-bridge, June 18, 1784.
</p>
<p>`Lord Derby, the first witness, gave evidence that he was present
at Ascot races.  When in the stand upon the race-course, he heard Mr
England cautioning the gentlemen present not to bet with

<pb n="382"/>
the deceased, as he neither paid what he lost nor what he borrowed.  On
which Mr Rowlls went up to him, called him rascal or scoundrel, and
offered to strike him; when Mr England bid him stand off, or he would
be obliged to knock him down; saying, at the same time &mdash; &ldquo;We
have interrupted the company sufficiently here, and if you have anything
further to say to me, you know where I am to be found.&amp;&rdquo;  A
further altercation ensued; but his Lordship being at the other end of the
stand, did not distinctly hear it, and then the parties retired.
</p>
<p>`Lord Dartrey, afterwards Lord Cremorne, and his lady, with a
gentleman, were at the inn at the time the duel was fought.  They went
into the garden and endeavoured to prevent the duel; several other
persons were collected in the garden.  Mr Rowlls desired his Lordship
and others not to interfere; and on a second attempt of his Lordship to
make peace, Mr Rowlls said, if they did not retire, he must, though
reluctantly, call them impertinent.  Mr England at the same time stepped
forward, and took off his hat; he said &mdash; &ldquo;Gentlemen, I have been
cruelly treated; I have been injured in my honour and character; let
reparation be made, and I am ready to have done this moment.&amp;&rdquo;

<pb n="383"/>
Lady Dartrey retired.  His Lordship stood in the bower of the garden
until he saw Mr Rowlls fall.  One or two witnesses were called, who
proved nothing material.  A paper, containing the prisoner's defence,
being read, <hi rend="italic">the Earl of Derby, the Marquis of Hertford, Sir
Whitbread, jun., Colonel Bishopp, and other gentlemen</hi>, were
called to his character.  They all spoke of him as a man of <hi rend="italic">decent
gentlemanly deportment</hi>, who, instead of seeking quarrels, was
studious to avoid them.  He had been friendly to Englishmen while
abroad, and had rendered some service to the military at the siege of
Newport.
</p>
<p>`Mr Justice Rooke summoned up the evidence; after which the jury
retired for about three quarters of an hour, when they returned a verdict
of &ldquo;manslaughter.&amp;&rdquo;
</p>
<p>`The prisoner having fled from the laws of his country for twelve
years, the Court was disposed to show no lenity.  He was therefore
sentenced to pay a fine of one shilling, and be imprisoned in Newgate
twelve months.'
</p>
<p>This trial took place in the year 1796, and the facts in evidence
give a strange picture of the times.  A duel actually fought in the garden
of an inn, a noble lord close by in a bower therein,

<pb n="384"/>
and his lady certainly within <hi rend="italic">*hearing</hi> of the shots, and
doubtless a spectator of the bloody spectacle.  But this is not the point, &mdash;
the incomprehensible point, &mdash; to which I have alluded &mdash; which is, how
Lord Derby and the other gentlemen of the highest standing could come
forward to speak to the character of <hi rend="italic">*Dick England</hi>, if he
was the same man who killed the unfortunate brewer of Kingston?
</p>
<p>Here is <hi rend="italic">*another</hi> account of the matter, which warrants
the doubt, although it is fearfully circumstantial, as to the certain
identity: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`Mr William Peter le Rowles, of Kingston, brewer, was habitually
fond of play.  On one occasion he was induced &mdash; when in a state of in-toxication &mdash; to play with Dick England, who claimed, in consequence,
winnings to the amount of two hundred guineas.  Mr le Rowles utterly
denied the debt, and was in consequence pursued by England until he
was compelled to a duel, in which Mr le Rowles fell.  Lord Dartrey,
afterwards Lord Cremorne, was present at Ascot Heath races on the fatal
occasion, which happened in 1784; and his evidence before the coroner's
inquest produced a verdict of wilful murder against

<pb n="385"/>
Dick England, who fled at the time, but returned twelve years
afterwards, was tried, and found guilty of manslaughter only.  He was
imprisoned for twelve months.  England was strongly suspected of
highway robberies; particularly on one occasion, when his associate, F &mdash;
, was shot dead by Col. P &mdash;  on his return from the Curragh races to the
town of Naas.  The Marquis of Hertford, Lords Derby and Cremorne,
Colonels Bishopp and Wollaston, and Messrs Whitbread, Breton, &amp;c.,
were evidences in the trial.'[145]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="145"><p>[145] <hi rend="italic">The Gaming Calendar</hi>, by
Seymour Harcourt.</p></note>
<p>It may seem strange that such a man as Dick England could
procure such distinguished `witnesses to character.'  The thing is easily
explained, however.  They knew the man only as a turf companion.  We
can come to no other conclusion, &mdash; remembering other instances of the
kind.  For example, the case of Palmer, convicted for the poisoning of
Cooke.  Had Palmer been on his trial merely for fighting a fatal duel;
there can be no doubt that several noblemen would have come forward to
give him a good character.  I was present at his trial, and saw him
<hi rend="italic">*bow to one, at least, of our most distinguished noblemen</hi>
when the latter took

<pb n="386"/>
his seat near the judge, at the trial.  There was a <hi rend="italic">*turf
acquaintanceship</hi> between them, and, of course, all
`acquaintanceship' may be presumed upon, if we lay ourselves open to
the degradation.
</p>
<p>The following is a curious case in point.  A gentleman of the
highest standing and greatest respectability was accosted by a stranger to
whom he said &mdash; `Sir, you have the advantage of me.'  `Oh!' rejoined the
former, `don't you remember when we used to meet at certain parties at
Bath many years ago?'  `Well, sir,' exclaimed the gentleman, `you may
speak to me should you ever again meet me at certain parties at Bath,
but nowhere else.'



MAJOR BAGGS.<lb/>


</p><p>This famous gamester died in 1792, by a cold caught in `a round-house,' or place of detention, to which he had been taken by Justice
Hyde, from a gaming table.
</p>
<p>When too ill to rise out of his chair, he would be carried in that
chair to the Hazard table.
</p>
<p>He was supposed to have been the utter ruin of above forty persons
at play.  He fought eleven duels.





<pb n="387"/>


THE DUC DE MIREFOIX.<lb/>


</p><p>The Duc de Mirefoix was ambassador at the British Court, and
was extremely fond of chess.  A reverend gentleman being nearly his
equal, they frequently played together.  At that time the clergyman kept
a petty day-school in a small village, and had a living of not more than
twenty pounds a-year.  The French nobleman made uncommon interest
with a noble duke, through whose favour he obtained for his reverend
prot&eacute;g&eacute; a living of about &pound;600 per annum &mdash; an
odd way of obtaining the `cure of souls!'



A RECLAIMED GAMBLER'S ACCOUNT OF HIS CAREER.<lb/>


</p><p>`Some years since I was lieutenant in a regiment, which the alarm
and policy of administration occasioned to be quartered in the vicinity of
the metropolis, where I was for the first time.  A young nobleman of
very distinguished family undertook to be my conductor.  Alas! to what
scenes did he introduce me!  To places of debauchery and dens of
destruction.  I need not detail particulars.  From the lures of the courte-san we went to an adjoining gaming room.

<pb n="388"/>
Though I thought my knowledge of cards superior to those I saw play
that night, I touched no card nor dice.  From this my conductor, a
brother officer, and myself adjourned to Pall Mall.  We returned to our
lodgings about six o'clock in the morning.
</p>
<p>`I could think of nothing but Faro's magic centre, and longed for
the next evening, when I determined to enter that path which has led so
many to infamy, beggary, and suicide.  I began cautiously, and for some
time had reason to be satisfied with my success.  It enabled me to live
expensively.  I made golden calculations of my future fortune as I
improved in skill.  My manuals were treatises on gaming and chances,
and no man understood this doctrine better than I did.  I, however, did
not calculate the disparity of resisting powers &mdash; my purse with
<hi rend="italic">*fifty</hi> guineas, and the Faro bank with a hundred thousand.
It was ruin only which opened my eyes to this truism at last.
</p>
<p>`Good meats, good cooking, and good wines, given gratis and
plenteously, at these houses, drew many to them at first, for the sake of
the society.  Among them I one evening chanced to see a clerical

<pb n="389"/>
prig, who was incumbent of a parish adjoining that in which my mother
lived.  I was intoxicated with wine and pleasure, when I, on this
occasion, entered a haunt of ruin and enterprising avarice in Pall Mall.  I
played high and lost in proportion.
</p>
<p>`The spirit of adventure was now growing on me every day.  I was
sometimes very successful.  Yet my health was impaired, and my temper
soured by the alternation of good and bad fortune, and my pity or
contempt for those with whom I associated.  From the nobleman, whose
acres were nightly melting in the dice box, there were adventurers even
to the <hi rend="italic">*unfledged apprentice</hi>, who came with the pillage of
his unsuspecting master's till, to swell the guilty bank of Dame N &mdash;  and
Co.  Were the Commissioners of Bankruptcy to know how many citizens
are prepared for them at those houses, they would be bound to thank
them.
</p>
<p>`Many a score of guineas have I won of tradesmen, who seemed
only to turn an honest penny in Leadenhall Street, Aldgate, Birchin
Lane, Cornhill, Cheapside, Holborn, the Borough, and other eastern
spots of industry; but I fleeced them only for the benefit of the Faro
bank, which is sure, finally, to absorb the gain of all.  Some of the

<pb n="390"/>
croupiers would call their gold <hi rend="italic">*gifts of the wise men of the
East;</hi> others termed their guineas <hi rend="italic">*Cockney counters!</hi>
</p>
<p>`One night I had such a run of luck in the Hazard room, which
was rather thinly attended, that I won everything, and with my load of
treasure collected from the East and West, nay, probably, some of it
from <hi rend="italic">*Finchley Common</hi> and <hi rend="italic">*Hounslow Heath</hi>,
I went, in the flush of success, to attack the Faro bank.
</p>
<p>`It was my determination, however, if fortune favoured me through
the night, never to tempt her more.  For some hours I proceeded in the
torture of suspense, alternately agitated by hope and fear &mdash; but by five
o'clock in the morning I attained a state of certainty similar to that of a
wretch ushered into the regions of the damned.  I had lost &pound;3500
guineas, which I had brought with me from the Hazard table, together
with &pound;2000 which the bank advanced me on my credit.  There
they stopped; and, with an apathy peculiar to themselves, listened to a
torrent of puerile abuse which I vented against them in my despair.
</p>
<p>`Two days and two nights I shut myself up, to indulge in the most
racking reflections.  I was

<pb n="391"/>
ruined beyond repair, and I had, on the third morning, worked myself up
to resort for relief to a loaded pistol.  I rang for my servant to bring me
some gunpowder, and was debating with myself whether to direct its
force to my brain or my heart, when he entered with a letter.  It was
from Harriet  &mdash;  &mdash; .  She had heard of my misfortunes, and urged me
with the soul and pen of a heroine, to fly the destructive habits of the
town, and to wait for nine months, when her minority would expire, and
she would come into the uncontrolled possession of &pound;1700.  With
that small sum she hoped my expenses, talents, and domestic comfort,
under her housewifery, would create a state of happiness and
independence which millions could not procure in the mad career which I
had pursued.
</p>
<p>`This was the voice of a guardian angel in the moment of despair.
In her next, at my request, she informed me that the channel of her early
and minute information was the clerical prig, her neighbour and admirer,
who was related to one of the croupiers at  &mdash;  &mdash; , and had from him a
regular detail of my proceedings.
</p>
<p>`Soothed by the magic influence of my

<pb n="392"/>
virtuous Harriet, instead of calling the croupier to account, I wrote to the
proprietors of the bank, stating my ruined condition, and my readiness to
sell my commission and pay them what I could.  These gentlemen have
friends in every department.  They completed the transfer of my
lieutenancy in two days, and then, in their superabundant humanity,
offered me the place of croupier in an inferior house which they kept
near Hanover Square.  This offer I declined; and after having paid my
tradesman's bill, I left London with only eleven guineas in my pocket.  I
married the best of women, my preserver, and have ever since lived in
real comfort and happiness, on an income less than one hundred pounds
a year.'


A SURPRISE.<lb/>


</p><p>A stranger plainly dressed took his seat at a Faro table, when the
bank was richer than usual.  After some little routine play, he challenged
the bank, and tossed his pocket-book to the banker that he might be
satisfied of his responsibility.  It was found to contain bills to an
immense amount; and on the banker showing reluctance to accept the
challenge, the stranger sternly demanded com

<pb n="393"/>
pliance with the laws of the game.  The card soon turned up which
decided the ruin of the banker.  `Heaven!' exclaimed an old infirm
Austrian officer, who had sat next to the stranger &mdash; `the twentieth part of
your gains would make me the happiest man in the universe!'  The
stranger briskly answered &mdash; `You shall have it, then;' and quitted the
room.  A servant speedily returned, and presented the officer with the
twentieth part of the bank, adding &mdash; `My master requires no answer,
sir,' and went out.  The successful stranger was soon recognized to be
the great King of Prussia in disguise.</p>

CHAPTER XIII.
<lb/>
THE LOTTERIES AND THEIR BEWILDERMENTS.</head>


<p>IF we are to believe P&eacute;re Menestrier, the institution of
Lotteries is to be found in the Bible, in the words &mdash; `The <hi rend="italic">lot</hi>
causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty,' Prov.
xviii. 18.  Be that as it may, it is certain that lotteries were in use among
the ancient Romans, taking place during the <hi rend="italic">Saturnalia</hi>, or
festivities in honour of the god Saturn, when those who took part in them
received a numbered ticket, which entitled the bearer to a prize.  During
the reign of Augustus the thing became a means of gratifying the
cupidity of his courtiers; and Nero used it as the method of distributing
his gifts to the people, &mdash; granting as many as a thousand tickets a day,
some of them entitling the bearers to slaves, ships, houses, and

<pb n="395"/>
lands.  Domitian compelled the senators and knights to participate in the
lotteries, in order to debase them; and Heliogabalus, in his fantastic
festivities, distributed tickets which entitled the bearers to camels, flies,
and other odd things suggested by his madness.  In all this, however, the
distinctive character of modern lotteries was totally absent: the tickets
were always gratuitous; so that if the people did not win anything, they
never lost.
</p>
<p>In the Middle Ages the same practice prevailed at the banquets of
feudal princes, who apportioned their presents economically, and without
the fear of exciting jealousy among the recipients, by granting lottery
tickets indiscriminately to their friends.  The practice afterwards
descended to the merchants; and in Italy, during the 16th century, it
became a favourite mode of disposing of their wares.
</p>
<p>The application of lotteries by paid tickets to the service of the
state is said to have originated at Florence, under the name of `Lotto,' in
1530; others say at Genoa, under the following circumstances: &mdash; It had
long been customary in the latter city to choose annually, by ballot, five
members of the Senate (composed of 90 persons) in order to

<pb n="396"/>
form a particular council.  Some persons took this opportunity of laying
bets that the lot would fall on such or such senators.  The government,
seeing with what eagerness the people interested themselves in these
bets, conceived the idea of establishing a lottery on the same principle,
which was attended with such great success, that all the cities of Italy
wished to participate in it, and sent large sums of money to Genoa for
that purpose.
</p>
<p>To increase the revenues of the Church, the Pope also was induced
to establish a lottery at Rome; the inhabitants of which place became so
fond of this species of gambling, that they often deprived themselves and
their families of the necessaries of life, that they might have money to
lay out in this speculation.
</p>
<p>The French borrowed the idea from the Italians.  In the year 1520,
under Francis I., lotteries were permitted by edict under the name of
<hi rend="italic">Blanques</hi>, from the Italian <hi rend="italic">bianca carta</hi>, `white
tickets,' &mdash;  because all the losing tickets were considered
<hi rend="italic">blanks;</hi> &mdash; hence the introduction of the word into common
talk, with a similar meaning.  From the year 1539 the state derived a
revenue from the lotteries, although from 1563 to 1609 the French

<pb n="397"/>
parliament repeatedly endeavoured to suppress them as social evils.  At
the marriage of Louis XIV. a lottery was organized to distribute the
royal presents to the people &mdash; after the fashion of the Roman emperor.
Lotteries were multiplied during this reign and that of Louis XV.  In
1776 the Royal Lottery of France was established.  This was abolished in
1793, re-established at the commencement of the Republic; but finally all
lotteries were prohibited by law in 1836, &mdash; excepting `for benevolent
purposes.'  One of the most remarkable of these lotteries `for benevolent
purposes' was the `Lottery of the Gold Lingots,' authorized in 1849, to
favour emigration to California.  In this lottery the grand prize was a
lingot of gold valued at about &pound;1700.
</p>
<p>The old French lottery consisted of 90 numbers, that is, from No.
1 to No. 90, and the drawing was five numbers at a time.  Five wheels
were established at Paris, Lyons, Strasbourg, Bordeaus, and Lille.  A
drawing took place every ten days at each city.  The exit of a single
number was called <hi rend="italic">extrait</hi>, and it won 15 times the amount
deposited, and 70 times if the number was determined; the exit of two
numbers was called the

<pb n="398"/>
<hi rend="italic">ambe</hi>, winning 270 times the deposit, and 5100 times if the
number was determined; &mdash; the exit of three numbers was called the
<hi rend="italic">terne</hi>, winning 5500 times; the <hi rend="italic">quaterne</hi>, or exit
of four numbers, won 75,000 times the deposit.  In all this, however, the
chances were greatly in favour of the state banker; &mdash; in the
<hi rend="italic">extrait</hi> the chances were 18 to 15 in his favour, vastly
increasing, of course, in the remainder; thus in the <hi rend="italic">ambe</hi> it
was 1602 against 270; and so on.
</p>
<p>The first English lottery mentioned in history was drawn in the
year 1569.  It consisted of 400,000 lots, at 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each lot.
The prizes were plate; and the profits were to go towards repairing the
havens or ports of this kingdom.  It was drawn at the west door of St
Paul's Cathedral.  The drawing began on the 10th of January, 1569, and
continued incessantly, <hi rend="italic">*day and night</hi>, till the 6th of May
following.[146]  Another lottery was held at the same place in 1612,
King James having permitted it in favour of `the plantation of English
colonies in Virginia.'  One Thomas Sharplys, a tailor of London, won
the chief prize, which was `4000 crowns in fair plate.' </p>
<note place="foot" n="146"><p>[146] The printed scheme of this lottery is still
in the possession of the Antiquarian Society of London.</p></note>

<pb n="399"/>
<p>In 1680, a lottery was granted to supply London with water.  At
the end of the 17th century, the government being in want of money to
carry on the war, resorted to a lottery, and &pound;1,200,000 was set
apart or <hi rend="italic">*named</hi> for the purpose.  The tickets were all
disposed of in less than six months, friends and enemies joining in the
speculation.  It was a great success; and when right-minded people
murmured at the impropriety of the thing, they were told to hold their
tongues, and assured that this lottery was the very queen of lotteries, and
that it had just taken Namur![147]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="147"><p>[147] This town was captured in 1695, by
William III.</p></note>
<p>At the same time the Dutch gave in to the infatuation with the
utmost enthusiasm; lotteries were established all over Holland; and
learned professors and ministers of the gospel spoke of nothing else but
the lottery to their pupils and hearers.
</p>
<p>From this time forward the spirit of gambling increased so rapidly
and grew so strong in England, that in the reign of Queen Anne private
lotteries had to be suppressed as public nuisances.
</p>
<p>The first <hi rend="italic">parliamentary</hi> lottery was instituted in

<pb n="400"/>
1709, and from this period till 1824 the passing of a lottery bill was in
the programme of every session.  Up to the close of the 18th century the
prizes were generally paid in the form of terminable, and sometimes of
perpetual, annuities.  Loans were also raised by granting a bonus of
lottery tickets to all who subscribed a certain amount.
</p>
<p>This gambling of annuities, despite the restrictions of an act passed
in 1793, soon led to an appalling amount of vice and misery; and in
1808, a committee of the House of Commons urged the suppression of
this ruinous mode of filling the national exchequer.  The last public
lottery in Great Britain was drawn in October, 1826.
</p>
<p>The lotteries exerted a most baneful influence on trade, by relaxing
the sinews of industry and fostering the destructive spirit of gaming
among all orders of men.  Nor was that all.  The stream of this evil was
immensely swelled and polluted, in open defiance of the law, by a set of
artful and designing men, who were ever on the watch to allure and
draw in the ignorant and unwary by the various modes and artifices of
`<hi rend="italic">insurance</hi>,' which were all most flagrant and gross
impositions on the public, as well as a direct violation of the law.  One
of

<pb n="401"/>
the most common and notorious of these schemes was the insuring of
numbers for the next day's drawing, at a <hi rend="italic">*premium</hi> which (if
legal) was much greater than adequate to the risk.  Thus, in 1778, when
the just premium of the lottery was only 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,
the office-keepers charged 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which was a certain gain of
nearly 30 per cent.; and they aggravated the fraud as the drawing
advanced.
</p>
<p>On the sixteenth day of drawing the just premium was not quite
20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., whereas the office-keepers charged &pound;1
4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which clearly shows the great
disadvantage that every person laboured under who was imprudent
enough to be concerned in the insurance of numbers.[148]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="148"><p>[148] Public Ledger, Dec. 3, 1778.</p></note>
<p>In every country where lotteries were in operation numbers were
ruined at the close of each drawing, and of these not a few sought an
oblivion of their folly ill self-murder &mdash; by the rope, the razor, or the
river.
</p>
<p>A more than usual number of adventurers were said to have been
ruined in the lottery of 1788, owing to the several prizes continuing long
in the wheel (which gave occasion to much gambling), and also to the
desperate state of certain branches

<pb n="402"/>
of trade, caused by numerous and important bankruptcies.  The suicides
increased in proportion.  Among them one person made herself
remarkable by a thoughtful provision to prevent disappointment.  A
woman, who had scraped everything together to put into the lottery, and
who found herself ruined at its close, fixed a rope to a beam of sufficient
strength; but lest there should be any accidental failure in the beam or
rope, she placed a large tub of water underneath, that she might drop
into it; and near her also were two razors on a table ready to be used, if
hanging or drowning should prove ineffectual.
</p>
<p>A writer of the time gives the following account of the excitement
that prevailed during the drawing of the lottery: &mdash; `Indeed, whoever
wishes to know what are the &ldquo;blessings&amp;&rdquo; of a lottery,
should often visit Guildhall during the time of its drawing, &mdash; when he
will see thousands of workmen, servants, clerks, apprentices, passing
and repassing, with looks full of suspense and anxiety, and who are
stealing at least from their master's time, if they have not many of them
also robbed him of his property, in order to enable them to become
adventurers.  In the next place, at the end of the drawing,

<pb n="403"/>
let our observer direct his steps to the shops of the pawnbrokers, and
view, as he may, the stock, furniture, and clothes of many hundred poor
families, servants, and others, who have been ruined by the lottery.  If
he wish for further satisfaction, let him attend at the next Old Bailey
Sessions, and hear the death-warrant of many a luckless gambler in
lotteries, who has been guilty of subsequent theft and forgery; or if he
seek more proof, let him attend to the numerous and horrid scenes of
self-murder, which are known to accompany the closing of the wheels of
fortune each year:[149] and then let him determine on &ldquo;the
wisdom and policy&amp;&rdquo; of lotteries in a commercial city.'
</p>
<note place="foot" n="149"><p>[149] A case is mentioned of two servants
who, having lost their all in lotteries, robbed their master; and in order
to prevent being seized and hanged in public, murdered themselves in
private.</p></note>
<p>The capital prizes were so large that they excited the eagerness of
hope; but the sum secured by the government was small when compared
with the infinite mischief it occasioned.  On opening the budget of 1788,
the minister observed in the House of Commons, `that the bargain he had
this year for the lottery was so very good for the public, that it would
produce a gain of &pound;270,000, from

<pb n="404"/>
which he would deduct &pound;12,000 for the expenses of drawing,
&amp;c., and then there would remain a net produce of &pound;258,000.'
This result, therefore, was deemed extraordinary; but what was that to
the extraordinary mischief done to the community by the authorization of
excessive gambling!
</p>
<p>Some curious facts are on record relating to the lotteries.
</p>
<p>Until the year 1800 the drawing of the lottery (which usually
consisted of 60,000 tickets for England alone) occupied forty-two days in
succession; it was, therefore, about forty-two to one against any
particular number being drawn the first day; if it remained in the wheel,
it was forty-one to one against its being drawn on the second, &amp;c.; the
adventurer, therefore, who could for eight-pence insure the return of a
guinea, if a given number came up the first day, would naturally be led,
if he failed, to a small increase of the deposit according to the decrease
of the chance against him, until his number was drawn, or the person
who took the insurance money would take it no longer.
</p>
<p>In the inquiry respecting the mendicity of London, in 1815, Mr
Wakefield declared his opinion that the lottery was a cause of mendicity;


<pb n="405"/>
and related an instance &mdash; the case of an industrious man who applied to
the Committee of Spitalfields Soup Society for relief; and when, on
being asked his profession, said he was a `<hi rend="italic">Translator</hi>' &mdash;
which, when <hi rend="italic">translated</hi>, signifies, it seems, the art of
converting old boots and shoes into wearable ones; `but the lottery is
about to draw, and,' says he, `I have no sale for boots or shoes during
the time that the lottery draws' &mdash; the money of his customers being spent
in the purchase of tickets, or the payment of `insurances.'  The
`translator' may have been mistaken as to the cause of his trade falling
of; but there can be no doubt that the system of the lottery-drawing was
a very infatuating mode of gambling, as the passion was kept alive from
day to day; and though, perhaps, it did not create mendicity, yet it
mainly contributed, with the gin-shops, night-cellars, obscure gambling
houses, and places of amusement, to fill the <hi rend="italic">pawnbrokers</hi>'
shops, and diminish the profits of the worthy `translator of old
shoes.'[150]
</p>
<note place="foot" n="150"><p>[150]  This term is still in use.  I recently
asked one of the craft if he called himself a translator.  `Yes, sir, not of
languages, but old boots and shoes,' was the reply.</p></note>
<p>This reasoning, however, is very uncertain.


<pb n="406"/>

</p>
<p>The sixteenth of a lottery ticket, which is the smallest share that
can be purchased, has not for many years been sold under thirty
shillings, a sum much too large for a person who buys old shoes
`translated,' and even for the `translator' himself, to advance; we may
therefore safely conclude that the purchase of tickets is not the mode of
gambling by which Crispin's customers are brought to distress.
</p>
<p>A great number of foreign lotteries still exist in vigorous
operation.  Some are supported by the state, and others are only
authorized; most of them are flourishing.  In Germany, especially,
lotteries are abundant; immense properties are disposed of by this
method.  The `bank' gains, of course, enormously; and, also of course, a
great deal of trickery and swindling, or something like it, is perpetrated.
</p>
<p>Foreign lottery tickets are now and then illegally offered in
England.  A few years ago there appeared an advertisement in the
papers, offering a considerable income for the payment of one or two
pounds.  Upon inquiry it was found to be the agency of a foreign lottery!
These tempting offers of advertising speculators are a cruel

<pb n="407"/>
addition to the miseries of misfortune.
</p>
<p>The Hamburg lottery seems to afford the most favourable
representation of the system &mdash; as such &mdash; because in it all the money
raised by the sale of tickets is redistributed in the drawing of the lots,
with the exception of 10 per cent. deducted in expenses and otherwise;
but nothing can compensate for the pernicious effects of the spirit of
gambling which is fostered by lotteries, however fairly conducted.  They
are an unmitigated evil.
</p>
<p>In the United States lotteries were established by Congress in
1776, but, save in the Southern States, heavy penalties are now imposed
on persons attempting to establish them.
</p>
<p>I need scarcely say that lotteries, whether foreign or British, are
utterly forbidden by law, excepting those of Art Unions.  The operations
of these associations were indeed suspended in 1811; but in the following
year an act indemnified those who embarked in them for losses which
they had incurred by the arrest of their proceedings; and since that time
they have been <hi rend="italic">*tolerated</hi> under the eye of the law without
any express statute being framed for their exemption.  It is thought,
however, that they tend to keep up the spirit of

<pb n="408"/>
gambling, and therefore ought not to be allowed even on the specious
plea of favouring `art.'
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">*Private</hi> lotteries are now illegal at Common Law in
Great Britain and Ireland; and penalties are also incurred by the
advertisers of <hi rend="italic">*foreign</hi> lotteries.  Some years ago it became
common in Scotland to dispose of merchandise by means of lotteries; but
this is specially condemned in the statute 42 Geo. III. c. 119.  An
evasion of the law has been attempted by affixing a prize to every ticket,
so as to make the transaction resemble a legal sale; but this has been
punished as a fraud, even where it could be proved that the prize
equalled in value the price of the ticket.  The decision rested upon the
plea that in such a transaction there was no definite sale of a specific
article.  Even the lotteries; for Twelfth Cakes, &amp;c., are illegal, and
render their conductors liable to the penalties of the law.  Decisive action
has been taken on this law, and the usual Christmas lotteries have been
this year (1870) rigorously prohibited throughout the country.  It is
impossible to doubt the soundness of the policy that strives to check the
spirit of gambling among the people; but still there may be some truth in
the following remarks

<pb n="409"/>
which appeared on the subject, in a leading journal: &mdash;
</p>
<p>`We hear that the police have received directions to caution the
promoters of lotteries for the distribution of game, wine, spirits, and
other articles of this description, that these schemes are illegal, and that
the offenders will be prosecuted.  These attempts to enforce rigidly the
provisions of the 10 and 11 William III., c. 17, 42 George III., c. 119,
and to check the spirit of speculation which pervades so many classes in
this country may possibly be successful, but as a mere question of
morality there can be no doubt that Derby lotteries, and, in fact, all
speculations on the turf or Stock Exchange, are open to quite as much
animadversion as the Christmas lotteries for a little pig or an aged goose,
which it appears are to be suppressed in future.  Is it not also
questionable policy to enforce every law merely because it is a law,
unless its breach is productive of serious evil to the community?  If
every old Act of Parliament is rummaged out and brought to bear upon
us, we fear we shall find ourselves in rather an uncomfortable position.
We cannot say whether or not the harm produced by these humble
lotteries

<pb n="410"/>
is sufficient to render their forcible suppression a matter of necessity.
They certainly do produce an amount of indigestion which of itself must
be no small penalty to pay for those whose misfortune it is to win the
luxuries raffled for, but we never yet heard of any one being ruined by
raffling for a pig or goose; and if our Government is going to be
paternal and look after our pocket-money, we hope it will also be
maternal and take some little interest in our health.  The sanitary laws
require putting into operation quite as much as the laws against public-house lotteries and skittles.'
</p>
<p>No `extenuating circumstances,' however, can be admitted
respecting the notorious racing lotteries, in spite of the small figure of
the tickets; nay this rather aggravates the danger, being a temptation to
the thoughtless multitude.  One of these lotteries, called the Deptford
Spec., was not long ago suppressed by the strong arm of the law; but
others still exist under different names.  In one of these the law is
thought to be evaded by the sale of a number of photographs; in another,
a chance of winning on a horse is secured by the purchase of certain
numbers of a newspaper struggling into existence; but the following is,
perhaps,

<pb n="411"/>
the drollest phase of the evasion as yet attempted:

CHAPTER XIV.
<lb/>
THE LAWS AGAINST GAMING IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES.
</head>
<div2 type="section" n="1" id="d26">
<head>1.  ANCIENT ROME.</head>


<p>IN ancient Rome all games of chance, with the exception of five
which had relation to bodily vigour, were absolutely prohibited in public
or private.  The loser could not be sued for moneys lost, and could
recover what he might have paid, such right being secured to his heirs
against the heirs of the winner, even after the lapse of 30 years'
prescription.  During 50 years after the loss, should the loser or his heirs
neglect their action, it was open to any one that chose to prosecute, and
chiefly to the municipal authorities, the sum recovered to be expended in
that case for public purposes.  No surety for the payment of money for
gambling purposes was bound.  The betting on

<pb n="413"/>
lawful games was restricted to a certain amount, beyond which the loser
could recover moneys paid, and could not be sued for the amount.  A
person in whose house gambling had taken place, if struck or injured, or
if robbed on the occasion thereof, was denied redress; but offences of
gamblers among themselves were punishable.  Blows or injuries might
be inflicted on the gambling house keeper at any time and anywhere
without being penal as against any person; but theft was not exempted
from punishment, unless committed at the time of gambling &mdash; and not by
a gambler.  Children and freedmen could recover their losses as against
their parents and patrons.
</p>
<p>Cicero, in his second Philippic, speaks of a criminal process
(<hi rend="italic">publicum judicium</hi>) then in force against gamblers.
</p>
<p>The laws of ancient Rome were, therefore, very stringent on this
subject, although, there can be no doubt, without much
effect.</p></div2>

<div2 type="section" n="2" id="d27">
<head>2.  FRANCE.</head>

<p>At the time of the French Revolution warlike games alone
conferred the right of action, restricted, however, in cases of excessive
losses; games

<pb n="414"/>
of strength and skill generally were lawful, but were considered as not
giving any right of action; games of mere chance were prohibited, but
minors alone were allowed to recover moneys lost.
</p>
<p>By the present law of France no judicial action is allowed for
gambling debts and wagers, except in the case of such games as depend
upon bodily skill and effort, foot, horse, and chariot races, and others of
the like nature: the claim may be rejected if the court considers it
excessive; but moneys paid can never be recovered unless on the ground
of fraud.  The keepers of gaming houses, their managers or agents, are
punishable with fine (100 to 6000 francs) and imprisonment (two to six
months), and may be deprived of most of their civil
rights.</p></div2>

<div2 type="section" n="3" id="d28">
<head>3.  PRUSSIA.</head>


<p>By the Prussian Code all games of chance, except when licensed
by the state, are prohibited.  Gaming debts are not the subjects of action;
but moneys paid cannot be sued for by losers.  Wagers give a right of
action when the stakes consist of cash in the hands of a third person;
they are void if the winner had a knowledge of the event, and

<pb n="415"/>
concealed it.  Moneys lent for gambling or betting purposes, or to pay
gambling or betting debts, cannot be sued for.  Gaming house keepers
and gamblers are punishable with fine; professed gamblers with
imprisonment.  Occasional cheating at play obliges to compensation;
professed swindlers at play are punishable as for theft, and banished
afterwards.  Moneys won from a drunken man, if to a considerable
amount, must be returned, and a fine paid of equal
value.</p></div2>


<div2 type="section" n="4" id="d29">
<head>4.  AUSTRIA.</head>


<p>In Austria no right of action is given either to the winner or the
loser.  All games of chance are prohibited except when licensed by the
state.  Cheating at play is punished with imprisonment, according to the
amount of fraudulent gain.  Playing at unlawful games, or allowing such
to take place in one's house, subjects the party to a heavy fine, or in
default, to imprisonment.</p></div2>


<div2 type="section" n="5" id="d30">
<head>5.  ITALY.</head>

<p>The provisions of the Sardinian Civil Code are similar to those of
the French, giving an action for moneys won at games of strength or
skill &mdash; when

<pb n="416"/>
not excessive in amount; but not allowing the recovery of moneys lost,
except on the ground of fraud or <hi rend="italic">*minority</hi>, a provision taken
from the <hi rend="italic">*old</hi> French law.</p></div2>

<div2 type="section" n="6" id="d31">
<head>6.  BAVARIA.</head>


<p>By the Bavarian Code games of skill, and of mixed skill and
chance, are not forbidden.  The loser cannot refuse to pay, nor can he
recover his losses, provided the sport be honestly conducted, and the
stakes not excessive, having regard to the rank, character, and fortune of
the parties.  In cases of fraudulent and excessive gaming, and in all
games of mere chance, the winner cannot claim his winnings, but must
repay the loser on demand.  In the two latter cases (apparently) both
winner and loser are liable to a fine, equal in amount, &mdash; for the first
time of conviction, to one-third of the stakes; for the second time, to
two-thirds; and for the third time, to the whole: in certain cases the bank
is to be confiscated.  Hotel and coffee-house keepers, &amp;c., who allow
gambling on their premises, are punished for the first offence by a fine
of 50 florins; for the second, with one of 100 florins; for the third, with
the loss of the license.  The punish

<pb n="417"/>
ment of private persons for the like offence is left to the discretion of the
judge.  <hi rend="italic">*Unlawful</hi> games may be <hi rend="italic">*legalized</hi> by
authority; but in such case, fraud or gross excess disables the winner
from claiming moneys won, renders him liable to repayment, and
subjects him to arbitrary punishment.  <hi rend="italic">*Immoral</hi> wagers are
void; and <hi rend="italic">*excessive</hi> wagers are to be reduced in amount.
Betting on indifferent things is not prohibited, nor even as to a known
and certain thing &mdash; when there is no deception.  No wager is void on
account of mere disparity of odds.  Professed gamblers, who also cheat
at play, and their accomplices, and the setters-up and collectors of
fictitious lotteries, are subject to imprisonment, with hard labour, for a
term of from four to eight years.
</p>
<p>Although, therefore, cheating gamblers are liable to punishment in
Bavaria, it is evident that gambling is there tolerated to the utmost extent
required by the votaries of Fortune.</p></div2>

<div2 type="section" n="7" id="d32">
<head>7.  SPAIN.</head>


<p>Wagers appear to be lawful in Spain, when not in themselves
fraudulent, or relating to anything illegal or immoral.</p>



<pb n="418"/>
</div2><div2 type="section" n="8" id="d33">
<head>8.  ENGLAND.</head>

<p>In England some of the forms of gambling or gaming have been
absolutely forbidden under heavy penalties, whilst others have been
tolerated, but at the same time discouraged; and the reasons for the
prohibition were not always directed against the impropriety or iniquity
of the practice in itself; &mdash; thus it was alleged in an Act passed in 1541,
that for the sake of the games the people neglected to practise
<hi rend="italic">*archery</hi>, through which England had become great &mdash; `to the
terrible dread and fear of all strange nations.'
</p>
<p>The first of the strictly-called Gaming Acts is one of Charles II.'s
reign, which was intended to check the habit of gambling so prevalent
then, as before stated.  By this Act it was ordered that, if any one shall
play at any pastime or game, by gaming or betting with those who game,
and shall lose more than one hundred pounds on credit, he shall not be
bound to pay, and any contract to do so shall be void.  In consequence
of this Act losers of a less amount &mdash; whether less wealthy or less
profligate &mdash; and the whole of the poorer classes,

<pb n="419"/>
remained unprotected from the cheating of sharpers, for it must be
presumed that nobody has a right to refuse to pay a fair gambling debt,
since he would evidently be glad to receive his winnings.  No doubt
much misery followed through the contrivances of sharpers; still it was a
salutary warning to gamesters of the poorer classes &mdash; whilst in the
higher ranks the `honour' of play was equally stringent, and, I may add,
in many cases ruinous.  By the recital of the Act it is evident that the
object was to check and put down gaming as a business profession, `to
gain a living;' and therefore it specially mulcted the class out of which
`adventurers' in this line usually arise.
</p>
<p>The Act of Queen Anne, by its sweeping character, shows that
gaming had become very virulent, for by it not only were all securities
for money lost at gaming void, but money actually paid, if more than
&pound;10, might be recovered in an action at law; not only might this
be done, within three months, by the loser himself, but by any one else --together with treble the value &mdash; half for himself, and half for the poor
of the parish.  Persons winning, by fraudulent means, &pound;10 and
upwards at any game were condemned by this Act to pay five times the

<pb n="420"/>
amount or value of the thing won, and, moreover, they were to `be
deemed infamous, and suffer such corporal punishment as in cases of
wilful perjury.'  The Act went further: &mdash; if persons were suspected of
getting their living by gaming, they might be summoned before a
magistrate, required to show that the greater portion of their income did
not depend upon gaming, and to find sureties for their good behaviour
during twelve months, or be committed to gaol.
</p>
<p>There were, besides, two curious provisions; &mdash;  any one assaulting
or challenging another to a duel on account of disputes over gaming,
should forfeit all his goods and be imprisoned for two years; secondly,
the royal palaces of St James's and Whitehall were exempted from the
operation of this statute, so long as the sovereign was actually resident
within them &mdash; which last clause probably showed that the entire
Draconian enactment was but a farce.  It is quite certain that it was
inoperative, and that it did no more than express the conscience of the
legislature &mdash; in deference to <hi rend="italic">*principle</hi>, `which nobody could
deny.'
</p>
<p>After the lapse of many years &mdash; the evil being on the increase &mdash;
the legislature stirred again dur

<pb n="421"/>
ing the reign of George II., and passed several Acts against gaming.
The games of Faro, Basset, Hazard, &amp;c., in fact, all games with dice,
were proscribed under a penalty of &pound;200 against the provider of
the game, and &pound;50 a time for the players.  Roulette or Roly Poly,
termed in the Act `a certain pernicious game,' was interdicted, under the
penalty of five times the value of the thing or sum lost at it.
</p>
<p>Thus stood the statute law against gaming down to the year 1845,
when, in consequence of the report of the select committee which sat on
the subject, a new enactment was promulgated, which is in force at the
present time.
</p>
<p>It was admitted that the laws in force against gaming were `of no
avail to prevent the mischiefs which may happen therefrom;' and the
lawgivers enacted a comprehensive measure on the subject.  Much of the
old law &mdash; for instance, the prohibition of games which interfered with
the practice of <hi rend="italic">*archery</hi> &mdash; was repealed; also the Acts of
Charles II., of Queen Anne, and a part of that of George II. &mdash; Gaming
houses, in which a bank is kept by one or more of the players, or in
which the chances of play are not alike favourable to the players &mdash; being
declared unlawful, as of old.  Billiards, bagatelle, or

<pb n="422"/>
`any game of the kind' (open, of course, to legal discussion), may be
played in private houses, or in licensed houses; but still, in the case of
licensed houses of public resort, the police may enter at any time to see
that the law is complied with.  `Licensed for Billiards' must be legibly
printed on some conspicuous place near the door and outside a licensed
house.  Billiards and like games may not be played in public rooms after
one, and before eight, o'clock in the morning of any day, nor on
Sundays, Christmas Day, Good Friday, nor on any public fast or
thanksgiving.  Publicans whose houses are licensed for billiards must not
allow persons to play at any time when public-houses are not allowed to
be open.
</p>
<p>`In order to constitute the house a common gaming house, it is not
necessary to prove that any person found playing at any game was
playing for any money, wager, or stake.  The police may enter the house
on the report of a superintendent, and the authority of a commissioner,
without the necessity of an allegation of two householders; and if any
cards, dice, balls, counters, tables, or other instruments of gaming be
found in the house, or about the person of any of those who shall be
found

<pb n="423"/>
therein, such discovery shall be evidence against the establishment until
the contrary be made to appear.  Those who shall appear as witnesses,
moreover, are protected from the consequences of having been engaged
in unlawful gaming.'[151] </p>

<p>The penalty of cheating at any game is liability to penal servitude
for three years &mdash; the delinquent being proceeded against as one who
obtains money under false pretences.  Wagers and bets are not
recoverable by law, whether from the loser or from the wager-holder;
and money paid for bets may be recovered in an action `for money
received to the defendant's use.'  All betting houses are gaming houses
within the meaning of the Act, and the proprietors and managers of them
are punishable accordingly.
</p>
<p>The existing law on the gaming of horse-racing is as follows.  Bets
on horse-races are illegal; and therefore are not recoverable by law.  In
order to prevent the nuisance which betting houses, disguised under other
names, occasioned, a law was passed in 1853, forbidding the
maintenance of any house, room, or other place, for betting; and by the
new Metropolitan Traffic Regulation Act, now

<pb n="424"/>
in force, any three persons found betting in the street may be fined five
pounds each `for obstructing the thoroughfare' &mdash; a very odd reason,
certainly, since it is the <hi rend="italic">*betting</hi> that we wish to prevent, as
we will not permit it to be carried on in any house, &amp;c.  These
<hi rend="italic">*legal</hi> reasons are too often sadly out of place.  Any
constable, however, may, without a warrant, arrest anybody he may see
in the act of betting in the street.
</p>
<p>The laws relating to horse-racing have undergone curious revisions
and interpretations.  `The law of George II.'s reign, declaring horse-racing to be good, as tending to promote the breed of fine horses,
exempted horse-races from the list of unlawful games, provided that the
sum of money run for or the value of the prize should be fifty pounds
and upwards, that certain weights only might be used, and that no owner
should run more than one horse for the same prize, under pain of
forfeiting all horses except the first.  Newmarket, and Black Hambledon
in Yorkshire, are the only places licensed for races in this Act, which,
however, was also construed to legalize any race at any place whatever,
so long as the stakes were worth fifty pounds and upwards, and the
weights were of the

<pb n="425"/>
regulated standard.  An Act passed five years afterwards removed the
restrictions as to the weights, and declared that any one anywhere might
start a horse-race with any weights, so long as the stakes were fifty
pounds or more.  The provision for the forfeiture of all horses but one
belonging to one owner and running in the same race was overlooked or
forgotten, and owners with perfect impunity ran their horses, as many as
they pleased, in the same race.  In 1839, however, informations were
laid against certain owners, whose horses were claimed as forfeits; and
then everybody woke up to the fact that this curious clause of the Act of
George II. was still unrepealed.  The Legislature interfered in behalf of
the defendants, and passed an Act, repealing in their eagerness not
merely the penal clauses of the Act, but the Act itself, so far as it related
to horse-racing.  Now, it was supposed that upon the Act of the
thirteenth of George II. depended the whole legality of horse-racing, that
the Act of the eighteenth of George II. was merely explanatory of that
statute, which, being repealed, brought the practice again within the old
law, according to which it was illegal.  By a judgment of the Court of

<pb n="426"/>
Common Pleas it was decided, however, that the words of the eighteenth
of George II.  were large enough to legalize all races anywhere for fifty
pounds and upwards, and that the Act was not merely an explanatory
one.  Upon this basis rests the existing law on the subject of horse-racing.  Bets, however, as before stated, on horse-races are still as
illegal as they are on any of the forbidden games &mdash; that is to say, they
are outside the law; the law will not lend its assistance to recover
them.'[152]

<p>The extent to which gambling has been carried on in the street by

<p>Only recently has any effectual check been put to this pernicious
practice.  It is however enacted by the New Gaming Act, that &mdash; `Every
person play

<pb n="427"/>
ing or betting by way of wagering or gaming in any street, road,
highway, or other open and public place to which the public have or are
permitted to have access, at or with any table or instrument of gaming,
or any coin, card, token, or other article used as an instrument of
gaming or means of such wagering or gaming, at any game or pretended
game of chance, shall be deemed a rogue and vagabond within the true
intent and meaning of the recited Act, and as such may be punished
under the provision of that Act.'
</p>
<p>On this provision a daily paper justly remarks: &mdash; `A statute very
much needed has come into force.  Persons playing or betting in the
streets with coins or cards are now made amenable to the 5th George
IV., c. 83, and may be committed to gaol as rogues and vagabonds.
The statutes already in force against such rogues and vagabonds subject
them, we believe, not only to imprisonment with hard labour, but also to
corporal punishment.  In any case the New Act should, if stringently
administered, speedily put a stop to the too common and quite intolerable
nuisance of young men and boys sprawling about the pavement, or in
corners of the wharves by the waterside, and play

<pb n="428"/>
ing at &ldquo;pitch-and-toss,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;shove-halfpenny,&amp;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tommy Dodd,&amp;&rdquo; &ldquo;coddams,&amp;&rdquo; and other
games of chance.  Who has not seen that terrible etching in Hogarth's
&ldquo;Industry and Idleness,&amp;&rdquo; where the idle apprentice, instead
of going devoutly to church and singing out of the same hymn-book with
his master's pretty daughter, is gambling on a tombstone with a knot of
dissolute boys?  A watchful beadle has espied the youthful gamesters,
and is preparing to administer a sounding thwack with a cane on the
shoulders of Thomas Idle.  But the race of London beadles is now well-nigh extinct; and the few that remain dare not use their switches on the
small vagabonds, for fear of being summoned for assault.  It is to be
hoped that the police will be instructed to put the Act sharply in force
against the pitch-and-toss players; and, in passing, we might express a
wish that they would also suppress the ragged urchins who turn
&ldquo;cart-wheels&amp;&rdquo; in the mud, and the half-naked girls who
haunt the vicinity of railway stations and steamboat piers, pestering
passengers to buy cigar-lights.'
