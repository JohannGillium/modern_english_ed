<p>THE treatment of the aboriginal inhabitants of the territories 
over which the government of the United States has extended its 
sway during the last twenty-five years has been &mdash; and still 
continues to be &mdash; one of the most difficult problems ever 
encountered in the development of any great nation.  Marching 
eastward from the Pacific and westward from the turbid waters of 
the Missouri, stretching in two thin blue threads from the "British 
line" to the Mexican frontier, our gallant little army has steadily 
closed in on the savages, "rounding up" the scattered tribes and 
gathering them in upon the immense reservations of land set apart 
for their use.  The government has established agencies to 
represent it with the various tribes with which it has made 
treaties, and it is the object of this paper simply to describe the 
life at one of these agencies. 
</p><p>The reservation allotted to the Southern cheyennes and 
Arapahoes is situated in the Indian Territory, south of the so-called "Cherokee Strip" and west of the famous promised land of the 
"Boomers," the Oklahoma country, and, according to General 
Sheridan's report to the President in 1885, contains within its 
limits 4,297,771 acres, "excellent for grazing, and most of the 
land susceptible of the highest cultivation."  Extensive tracts of 
timber &mdash; scrub-oak, cotton-wood, pecan, and walnut &mdash; line the streams 
and the sides of many of the canons, and cover wide sections of 
rolling prairie country; game &mdash; such as wild turkey, prairie-chicken, quail, and deer &mdash; abounds.  The enrolment taken during 
General Sheridan's visit showed a total of 2169 Cheyennes and 1300 
Arapahoes, distributed in "bands" over the reservation. 
</p><p>Near the military post of Fort Reno, and on the North Fork of 
the Canadian, lies the collection of government buildings forming 
the agency for these Indians, and known to the post-office 
officials and marked down on the maps under the name of Darlington.  
Here the agent resides, and here &mdash; in a great brick building 
fronting a wide unpaved plaza or square, on the various sides of 
which stand the stores of the Indian traders, a hotel, and the 
livery and stage stables, whence the stage line carries the mail 
and passengers to the railroad, thirty miles away &mdash; is situated the 
main office or agency for the two tribes mentioned.  On some 
streets branching off from a park of rather ragged and forlorn 
appearance, in which a few trees raise their crooked branches into 
the air, are placed the residences of the employes, the schools, 
and the saw-mill, the blacksmith, wagon, and tin shops. 
</p><p>Driving out from Fort Reno, we rattle over the prairie past 
the camp of the Indian scouts, their lodges pitched in military 
order on a little rise overlooking the plain toward the agency; 
past the cavalry horses on herd, scaring up great flocks of 
blackbirds, and causing the little prairie-dogs to pop into their 
burrows with shrill barks of anger and alarm; past some camps of 
redskins who have come in to draw their rations, their wagons 
standing near by, and their tough little horses "lariated" out to 
graze; through great thickets of sunflowers, past Indians on 
horseback, squaws and papooses in wagons, to the wooden bridge over 
the river, where some more Indians, tall, wild-looking, handsome 
fellows, are watering their horses, their figures reflected in the 
clear shallow stream.  We move slowly over the not too firm-looking 
structure, and then more rapidly on again over the wide dusty road, 
skirted by the neat frame houses forming the residences of the 
agent and some of the employes, until, swinging to the right, we 
draw up at the door of the huge brick commissary building.  Groups 
of shaggy, wiry ponies are tied to wagons, or held by waiting 
squaws, whose lords pass in and out of the wide doorway, or stand 
about in little knots chatting and smoking; now and then a mounted 
"buck" or Indian policeman, in army blue, slouch-hatted, with 
revolver swinging from belt bristling with cartridges, rides 
briskly by, while, crossing the wide square, comes a train of 
lumbering, creaking, heavily loaded freight wagons, their great 
wheels grinding up the dry soil, which, driven in whirling clouds 
through the air by the strong south wind, fills mouth and eyes with 
gritty substance, and powders bright-hued savage finery and the 
more soberly colored clothing of civilization alike with a thick 
coating of brown dust.  Pushing our way through the motley crowd, 
we ascend the wooden staircase on the outside of the building, and 
enter the office, where we are most courteously received by the 
agent. 
</p><p>We have ample time to look about us here, for it is Monday, 
the busiest day of the week, and while the agent is engaged in 
listening to the various recitals of his tawny charges and in 
answering their questions, we sit back in the easychair by the side 
of his desk and leisurely "take in" the scene before us.  A number 
of the Indians have evidently come in for a "talk," for they are 
crowded into the room, some seated on the chairs lining the walls, 
some lounging, blankets drawn in graceful folds about them, in the 
doorways.  A few are clad in their picturesque native dress, but 
almost all of them wear some articles of civilized clothing, and as 
seen through the blue clouds of cigarette smoke they present an 
interesting picture, with their wild but expressive and intelligent 
faces, each in its setting of long, black, straight hair, their 
bright eyes, and graceful gestures as they converse together in low 
guttural tones.  Among them are some of the leading men of the 
Cheyennes, but a short time ago the fiercest and most formidable of 
the hostile tribes.<ref target="note1"></ref>  Many of their most daring warriors and 
skilful soldiers, however, finally overawed by the strong arm of 
the government, and realizing the hopelessness of further armed 
resistance against their white conquerors, are now the most eager 
to learn how to travel "on the white man's road," and are rapidly 
proving themselves apt pupils.  Some of them are quite well-to-do, 
owning horses and wagons bought and paid for by themselves, and 
following the occupation of "freighters," hauling all the supplies 
for the agencies from the railroads, and receiving the same rates 
of payment for the work as the white men engaged in the same 
business.  Although under the treaty made with the Cheyennes and 
Arapahoes $30,000 in clothing is distributed annually among them, 
and supplies of food (rations) are issued to each head of a family 
at regular intervals, every effort is being made to render the 
Indians self-supporting, and although the attempt to induce them to 
abandon their nomadic mode of life still meets with considerable 
opposition, every encouragement is given to those among them who 
have been persuaded to adopt some peaceful occupation as a means of 
gaining their livelihood.  Two saw-mills are kept running for the 
purpose of sawing native lumber to be used in building farm-houses, 
about fifty of which have been erected at different points on the 
reservation in the last year and a half, the Indians performing all 
the unskilled labor in their construction, such as cutting and 
hauling the lumber, etc., at their own expense.  The farms &mdash; of 
which there are now about four hundred and fifty, running from five 
to one hundred acres in extent under cultivation &mdash; are situated on 
three-hundred-and-twenty-acre tracts, with a view to allotment 
under the so-called "Severalty Bill."  The future owner of one of 
these farms having selected his "location," it is staked out for 
him by one of the white farmers employed by the government as 
instructors, who encloses ten acres with a wire fence, the Indian 
cutting and setting out a sufficient number of posts for the 
purpose.  The ground is then broken at the expense of the 
government; the necessary farming implements, seeds, etc., are 
furnished gratuitously to the embryo agriculturist, who, under the 
instruction of his white teachers, is left to work out his own 
salvation by the sweat of his brow.</p> 
<note id="note1" n="1"><seg type="note-symbol"></seg> <p>
Mr. G. D. Williams, the agent at Darlington, in his report in 
August, 1887, says: "But a little over two years ago one-eighth of 
the entire force of the army was directed against the Cheyennes of 
the agency, who in large numbers were then opposed to any 
innovation tending toward civilization." 
</p></note> 
<p>Wild, untutored, unaccustomed to restraint, and suspicious by 
nature as the Indians are, the position of the government's agent 
is a difficult one, requiring great patience, tact, and careful 
judgment on the part of the official filling it.  He is often 
called upon for advice even in matters concerning the family 
affairs of individuals, must listen to their complaints, and 
endeavor to see that all are treated with equal justice in their 
dealings with the "Great Father," whose representative he is.  He 
must superintend and hold to account the sub-agents and employes, 
attend to the handling of the supplies intended for the use of the 
Indians, the issuing of rations, the wants of the schools, the 
enforcement of obedience to the local laws and rules of the 
reservation through the Indian police, and is responsible for the 
proper conduct of the whole of the complicated business of the 
agency.  The employes at the Cheyenne and Arapahoe agency comprise 
a chief clerk and two assistants in the office at Darlington, two 
engineers for running two saw-mills, two carpenters, two 
blacksmiths, a wagon-maker, and five farmers engaged as 
instructors, and a large number of Indians, apprentices, drivers, 
herders, etc.  The police force, divided into detachments at 
different stations, numbers thirty rank and file and three 
officers &mdash; a captain and two lieutenants &mdash; all full-blooded Indians, 
owning their horses and under regular pay, the officers receiving 
ten and the privates eight dollars monthly, and is composed of 
representatives of both tribes.  The uniform, two suits of which 
are furnished annually by the government to each member of the 
force, is similar in cut and color to that worn by United States 
troops, and consists of a dark blue blouse, light blue trousers, 
and soft felt hat with a ribbon bearing the word "Police" in 
silvered letters.  Officers and men are armed with revolvers, and 
are faithful and efficient, Mr. Williams, the agent, assuring us 
that they have never yet failed to make an arrest during his 
administration. 
</p><p>There are five sub-agencies at different points 
<pb n="11"/> 
on the 
reservation, each under a sub-agent, at the largest of which, 
Cantonment, an abandoned military post, one thousand savages are 
rationed.  Four schools for Indian children, two of which are 
mission schools and two of which are maintained at the expense of 
the government, furnish education to three hundred and twenty red-skinned youngsters of both sexes, whose well-washed faces and clean 
clothing, their excellent discipline and apparent docility, as they 
sit behind the straightly aligned rows of desks in their school-rooms, are in strong contrast to the bands of half-clad, painted, 
unkempt, and unmistakably unwashed little savages we have passed on 
our way over from the "post."  But for an occasional untamed 
glitter of their bright black eyes and a flash of white teeth in 
relief against the dusky hue of their faces, as they stand singing 
Sunday-school hymns for all the world like white children, it is 
hard to realize that any one among them had been born and attained 
the school age under the influence of savage life.  The 
dormitories, refectories, kitchens, etc., are scrupulously clean, 
and the schools can bear favorable comparison with similar 
institutions in more populous and enlightened communities. 
</p><p>As already mentioned, a fixed sum is expended annually for 
clothing, etc., according to a treaty made with these tribes; and 
in addition to this, regular supplies or rations of food are 
distributed every seven days.  This weekly ration consists of 
twenty-one pounds of beef, three and a half pounds of flour, half 
a pound of sugar, three-eighths of a pound of coffee, and a certain 
quantity of beans, salt, baking-powder, soap, etc., for each 
individual Indian.  Heads of families are provided with tickets &mdash;  
running for thirteen weeks, and on which numerals representing each 
week are printed &mdash; which on presentation at the agency entitle the 
holders to their share of the groceries, the issue clerk punching 
out one of the numerals mentioned at each weekly delivery of the 
supplies.  Beef is issued every Monday "on the hoof," and "on 
block" at five different points, each band of forty-four Indians &mdash;  
men, women, and children &mdash; receiving one steer. 
</p><p>The distribution of beef at Darlington takes place at an 
isolated spot on the prairie, some distance from the agency, and 
the sights witnessed at a "big killing" present a scene at once 
picturesque and exciting, if somewhat revolting to the finer 
sensibilities in some of its details.  Long before the hour 
appointed for the slaughter of the animals and the distribution of 
the meat, bands of savages take up the march for the rendezvous 
from all points of the adjacent country.  Wagons &mdash; sometimes of the 
newest and most approved patterns, at others the veriest 
rattletraps to be found on four wheels, filled with squaws, and 
drawn by all kinds of teams, from the piebald, wall-eyed, pink-nosed ponies, to the patient and more or less broken-down mules, 
occasionally both horses and mules hitched to the same outfit &mdash; are 
crowded around the rough "corral" or fenced-in space on the prairie 
where the cattle are herded together, and over which, far up in the 
clear air, ragged-winged buzzards are circling.  Mounted Indians 
gallop up, some armed with revolvers, others with carbines, and 
perched high up on the backs of their horses, ready for the 
exciting sport of pursuing and slaughtering the wild-eyed, long-horned Texan steers, that move restlessly about the narrow limits 
of the corral, bellowing nervously as if in dread anticipation of 
their doom.  A fire is burning near by in which the branding-irons 
are being heated, and policemen and scouts, herders and agency 
officials, move about in the rapidly increasing crowd, busily 
preparing for the work of selecting and turning over the beeves 
designed for slaughter to the waiting Indian butchers.  Descending 
from the "ambulance" in which we have driven over from the "post," 
accompanying the young officer detailed to be present at the 
"issue," we approach a rough log cabin, built close up to the 
fence, in which are placed the scales for weighing each steer as it 
is driven into the long narrow space connecting the corral with the 
gates out of which the brutes are liberated, only to fall victims 
to the eager savages awaiting them on the prairie.  Bounded by a 
high fence on each side, this lane, so contracted in its width as 
to admit of the passage of but one animal at a time, is crowded 
with the frightened steers, who push and gore one another in 
frantic efforts to escape from the torture of the branding-irons 
and knives busily plied by the Indians perched on the top rail of 
the fence, as each one marks in his particular manner the "beef" 
intended for issue to his band. 
</p><p>Rapidly following one another, the brutes are released one by 
one through the gate opened at intervals by a single policeman, who 
frequently has to exert all his agility to escape the angry 
sideward thrust of their horns as the cattle rush through the 
narrow opening.  Some of them dash frantically out over the plain, 
bellowing furiously and throwing up the dirt and dust with the 
sharp points of their cloven hoofs; others stop for a moment 
bewildered, foaming at the mouth and snorting with fear and rage, 
and then gallop away.  Indians mount rapidly and start after, 
revolver or carbine in hand, and a regular hunt in all directions 
over the rolling prairie in front of us begins, as the maddened 
brutes vainly endeavor to escape from their ruthless pursuers.  
Jumping into the ambulance, we too drive out to get a nearer view, 
and we must confess that our participation in a sort of "Wild West" 
hunt in a "spring wagon," instead of on horseback, is a decidedly 
novel experience to us, particularly as the Indians are none too 
expert as marksmen and are apt to shoot wildly, while an excited 
Texan steer has no respect for government ambulances or "special 
artists."  However, our object is to "git thar," to use an apt 
Western expression, and to procure a good opportunity for making 
our notes and sketches, so, under the circumstances, our means of 
transportation is the best we could have desired. 
</p><p>Under the pitiless shots of the butcher the victim falls to 
the ground, and before its limbs have ceased to move in the 
convulsions of death, the hunter has dismounted, and the long, 
keen-bladed knife is plunged to the hilt in the still quivering 
body of the dying brute.  With a yell the Indian signals to the 
squaws, who, urging their horses on, come rapidly out in their 
wagons from the corral, to begin the work of flaying and 
butchering.  They swarm around the carcass with savage eagerness, 
and the tidbits, such as the heart, liver, etc., are quickly cut 
out, and sometimes devoured on the spot.  Every portion of the 
"beef" &mdash; entrails and all &mdash; is used for food, and soon the wagons, 
loaded with huge lumps of still warm meat, drops of blood oozing 
through the cracks in their floors, move away from the scene of 
slaughter, and the buzzards flock down to gather up such stray 
bits &mdash; scanty fare indeed &mdash; as may have been left on the ground.
