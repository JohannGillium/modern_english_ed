<p>THE following work is devoted to an account of the characteristics of
crowds.
</p><p>The whole of the common characteristics with which heredity endows
the individuals of a race constitute the genius of the race.  When,
however, a certain number of these individuals are gathered together in
a crowd for purposes of action, observation proves that, from the mere
fact of their being assembled, there result certain new psychological
characteristics, which are added to the racial characteristics and
differ from them at times to a very considerable degree.
</p><p>Organised crowds have always played an important part in the life
of peoples, but this part has never been of such moment as at present.
The substitution of the unconscious action of crowds for the conscious
activity of individuals is one of the principal characteristics of the
present age.
</p><p>I have endeavoured to examine the difficult problem presented by
crowds in a purely scientific manner &mdash; that is, by making an effort to
proceed with method, and without being influenced by

<pb n="vi"/>

opinions,
theories, and doctrines.  This, I believe, is the only mode of arriving
at the discovery of some few particles of truth, especially when
dealing, as is the case here, with a question that is the subject of
impassioned controversy.  A man of science bent on verifying a
phenomenon is not called upon to concern himself with the interests his
verifications may hurt.  In a recent publication an eminent thinker, M.
Goblet d'Alviela, made the remark that, belonging to none of the
contemporary schools, I am occasionally found in opposition of sundry of
the conclusions of all of them.  I hope this new work will merit a
similar observation.  To belong to a school is necessarily to espouse
its prejudices and preconceived opinions.
</p><p>Still I should explain to the reader why he will find me draw
conclusions from my investigations which it might be thought at first
sight they do not bear; why, for instance, after noting the extreme
mental inferiority of crowds, picked assemblies included, I yet affirm
it would be dangerous to meddle with their organisation, notwithstanding
this inferiority.
</p><p>The reason is, that the most attentive observation of the facts of
history has invariably demonstrated to me that social organisms being
every whit as complicated as those of all beings, it is in no wise in
our power to force them to undergo on a sudden far-reaching
transformations.  Nature has

<pb n="vii"/>

recourse at times to radical measures,
but never after our fashion, which explains how it is that nothing is
more fatal to a people than the mania for great reforms, however
excellent these reforms may appear theoretically.  They would only be
useful were it possible to change instantaneously the genius of nations.
This power, however, is only possessed by time.  Men are ruled by ideas,
sentiments, and customs &mdash; matters which are of the essence of ourselves.
Institutions and laws are the outward manifestation of our character,
the expression of its needs.  Being its outcome, institutions and laws
cannot change this character.
</p><p>The study of social phenomena cannot be separated from that of the
peoples among whom they have come into existence.  From the philosophic
point of view these phenomena may have an absolute value; in practice
they have only a relative value.
</p><p>It is necessary, in consequence, when studying a social phenomenon,
to consider it successively under two very different aspects.  It will
then be seen that the teachings of pure reason are very often contrary
to those of practical reason.  There are scarcely any data, even
physical, to which this distinction is not applicable.  From the point
of view of absolute truth a cube or a circle are invariable geometrical
figures, rigorously defined by certain formulas.  From the point of view
of the impression

<pb n="viii"/>

they make on our eye these geometrical figures
may assume very varied shapes.  By perspective the cube may be
transformed into a pyramid or a square, the circle into an ellipse or a
straight line.  Moreover, the consideration of these fictitious shapes
is far more important than that of the real shapes, for it is they and
they alone that we see and that can be reproduced by photography or in
pictures.  In certain cases there is more truth in the unreal than in
the real.  To present objects with their exact geometrical forms would
be to distort nature and render it unrecognisable.  If we imagine a
world whose inhabitants could only copy or photograph objects, but were
unable to touch them, it would be very difficult for such persons to
attain to an exact idea of their form.  Moreover, the knowledge of this
form, accessible only to a small number of learned men, would present
but a very minor interest.
</p><p>The philosopher who studies social phenomena should bear in mind
that side by side with their theoretical value they possess a practical
value, and that this latter, so far as the evolution of civilisation is
concerned, is alone of importance.  The recognition of this fact should
render him very circumspect with regard to the conclusions that logic
would seem at first to enforce upon him.
</p><p>There are other motives that dictate to him a like reserve.  The
complexity of social facts is

<pb n="ix"/>

such, that it is impossible to grasp
them as a whole and to foresee the effects of their reciprocal influence.
It seems, too, that behind the visible facts are hidden at times
thousands of invisible causes.  Visible social phenomena appear to be
the result of an immense, unconscious working, that as a rule is beyond
the reach of our analysis.  Perceptible phenomena may be compared to the
waves, which are the expression on the surface of the ocean of deep-lying disturbances of which we know nothing.  So far as the majority of
their acts are considered, crowds display a singularly inferior
mentality; yet there are other acts in which they appear to be guided by
those mysterious forces which the ancients denominated destiny, nature,
or providence, which we call the voices of the dead, and whose power it
is impossible to overlook, although we ignore their essence.  It would
seem, at times, as if there were latent forces in the inner being of
nations which serve to guide them.  What, for instance, can be more
complicated, more logical, more marvellous than a language?  Yet whence
can this admirably organised production have arisen, except it be the
outcome of the unconscious genius of crowds?  The most learned
academics, the most esteemed grammarians can do no more than note down
the laws that govern languages; they would be utterly incapable of
creating them.  Even with respect to the ideas of great men

<pb n="x"/>

are we
certain that they are exclusively the offspring of their brains?  No
doubt such ideas are always created by solitary minds, but is it not the
genius of crowds that has furnished the thousands of grains of dust
forming the soil in which they have sprung up?
</p><p>Crowds, doubtless, are always unconscious, but this very
unconsciousness is perhaps one of the secrets of their strength.  In the
natural world beings exclusively governed by instinct accomplish acts
whose marvellous complexity astounds us.  Reason is an attribute of
humanity of too recent date and still too imperfect to reveal to us the
laws of the unconscious, and still more to take its place.  The part
played by the unconscious in all our acts is immense, and that played by
reason very small.  The unconscious acts like a force still unknown.
</p><p>If we wish, then, to remain within the narrow but safe limits
within which science can attain to knowledge, and not to wander in the
domain of vague conjecture and vain hypothesis, all we must do is simply
to take note of such phenomena as are accessible to us, and confine
ourselves to their consideration.  Every conclusion drawn from our
observation is, as a rule, premature, for behind the phenomena which we
see clearly are other phenomena that we see indistinctly, and perhaps
behind these latter, yet others which we do not see at all.

INTRODUCTION.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">THE ERA OF CROWDS.</hi><lb/>
</head>

<p>The evolution of the present age &mdash; The great changes in civilisation are
the consequence of changes in National thought &mdash; Modern belief in the
power of crowds &mdash; It transforms the traditional policy of the European
states &mdash; How the rise of the popular classes comes about, and the manner
in which they exercise their power &mdash; The necessary consequences of the
power of the crowd &mdash; Crowds unable to play a part other than
destructive &mdash; The dissolution of worn-out civilisations is the work of
the crowd &mdash; General ignorance of the psychology of crowds &mdash; Importance of
the study of crowds for legislators and statesmen.

</p><p>THE great upheavals which precede changes of civilisations such as the
fall of the Roman Empire and the foundation of the Arabian Empire, seem
at first sight determined more especially by political transformations,
foreign invasion, or the overthrow of dynasties.  But a more attentive
study of these events shows that behind their apparent causes the real
cause is generally seen to be a

<pb n="xvi"/>

profound modification in the
ideas of the peoples.  The true historical upheavals are not those which
astonish us by their grandeur and violence.  The only important changes
whence the renewal of civilisations results, affect ideas, conceptions,
and beliefs.  The memorable events of history are the visible effects of
the invisible changes of human thought.  The reason these great events
are so rare is that there is nothing so stable in a race as the
inherited groundwork of its thoughts.
</p><p>The present epoch is one of these critical moments in which the
thought of mankind is undergoing a process of transformation.
</p><p>Two fundamental factors are at the base of this transformation.
The first is the destruction of those religious, political, and social
beliefs in which all the elements of our civilisation are rooted.  The
second is the creation of entirely new conditions of existence and
thought as the result of modern scientific and industrial discoveries.
</p><p>The ideas of the past, although half destroyed, being still very
powerful, and the ideas which are to replace them being still in process
of formation, the modern age represents a period of transition and
anarchy.
</p><p>It is not easy to say as yet what will one day be evolved from this
necessarily somewhat chaotic period.  What will be the fundamental ideas
on

<pb n="xv"/>

which the societies that are to succeed our own will be built up?
We do not at present know.  Still it is already clear that on whatever
lines the societies of the future are organised, they will have to count
with a new power, with the last surviving sovereign force of modern
times, the power of crowds.  On the ruins of so many ideas formerly
considered beyond discussion, and to-day decayed or decaying, of so many
sources of authority that successive revolutions have destroyed, this
power, which alone has arisen in their stead, seems soon destined to
absorb the others.  While all our ancient beliefs are tottering and
disappearing, while the old pillars of society are giving way one by
one, the power of the crowd is the only force that nothing menaces, and
of which the prestige is continually on the increase.  The age we are
about to enter will in truth be the ERA OF CROWDS.
</p><p>Scarcely a century ago the traditional policy of European states
and the rivalries of sovereigns were the principal factors that shaped
events.  The opinion of the masses scarcely counted, and most frequently
indeed did not count at all.  To-day it is the traditions which used to
obtain in politics, and the individual tendencies and rivalries of
rulers which do not count; while, on the contrary, the voice of the
masses has become preponderant.  It is this voice that dictates their
conduct to kings,

<pb n="xvi"/>

whose endeavour is to take note of its
utterances.  The destinies of nations are elaborated at present in the
heart of the masses, and no longer in the councils of princes.
</p><p>The entry of the popular classes into political life &mdash; that is to
say, in reality, their progressive transformation into governing
classes &mdash; is one of the most striking characteristics of our epoch of
transition.  The introduction of universal suffrage, which exercised for
a long time but little influence, is not, as might be thought, the
distinguishing feature of this transference of political power.  The
progressive growth of the power of the masses took place at first by the
propagation of certain ideas, which have slowly implanted themselves in
men's minds, and afterwards by the gradual association of individuals
bent on bringing about the realisation of theoretical conceptions.  It
is by association that crowds have come to procure ideas with respect to
their interests which are very clearly defined if not particularly just,
and have arrived at a consciousness of their strength.  The masses are
founding syndicates before which the authorities capitulate one after
the other; they are also founding labour unions, which in spite of all
economic laws tend to regulate the conditions of labour and wages.  They
return to assemblies in which the Government is vested, representatives
utterly lacking initiative and independence, and reduced most often to
nothing else

<pb n="xvii"/>

than the spokesmen of the committees that have chosen
them.
</p><p>To-day the claims of the masses are becoming more and more sharply
defined, and amount to nothing less than a determination to utterly
destroy society as it now exists, with a view to making it hark back to
that primitive communism which was the normal condition of all human
groups before the dawn of civilisation.  Limitations of the hours of
labour, the nationalisation of mines, railways, factories, and the soil,
the equal distribution of all products, the elimination of all the upper
classes for the benefit of the popular classes, &amp;c., such are these
claims.
</p><p>Little adapted to reasoning, crowds, on the contrary, are quick to
act.  As the result of their present organisation their strength has
become immense.  The dogmas whose birth we are witnessing will soon have
the force of the old dogmas; that is to say, the tyrannical and
sovereign force of being above discussion.  The divine right of the
masses is about to replace the divine right of kings.
</p><p>The writers who enjoy the favour of our middle classes, those who
best represent their rather narrow ideas, their somewhat prescribed
views, their rather superficial scepticism, and their at times somewhat
excessive egoism, display profound alarm at this new power which they
see growing; and to combat

<pb n="xviii"/>

the disorder in men's minds they are
addressing despairing appeals to those moral forces of the Church for
which they formerly professed so much disdain.  They talk to us of the
bankruptcy of science, go back in penitence to Rome, and remind us of
the teachings of revealed truth.  These new converts forget that it is
too late.  Had they been really touched by grace, a like operation could
not have the same influence on minds less concerned with the
preoccupations which beset these recent adherents to religion.  The
masses repudiate to-day the gods which their admonishers repudiated
yesterday and helped to destroy.  There is no power, Divine or human,
that can oblige a stream to flow back to its source.
</p><p>There has been no bankruptcy of science, and science has had no
share in the present intellectual anarchy, nor in the making of the new
power which is springing up in the midst of this anarchy.  Science
promised us truth, or at least a knowledge of such relations as our
intelligence can seize: it never promised us peace or happiness.
Sovereignly indifferent to our feelings, it is deaf to our lamentations.
It is for us to endeavour to live with science, since nothing can bring
back the illusions it has destroyed.
</p><p>Universal symptoms, visible in all nations, show us the rapid
growth of the power of crowds, and do not admit of our supposing that it
is

<pb n="xix"/>

destined to cease growing at an early date.  Whatever fate it
may reserve for us, we shall have to submit to it.  All reasoning
against it is a mere vain war of words.  Certainly it is possible that
the advent to power of the masses marks one of the last stages of
Western civilisation, a complete return to those periods of confused
anarchy which seem always destined to precede the birth of every new
society.  But may this result be prevented?
</p><p>Up to now these thoroughgoing destructions of a worn-out
civilisation have constituted the most obvious task of the masses.  It
is not indeed to-day merely that this can be traced.  History tells us,
that from the moment when the moral forces on which a civilisation
rested have lost their strength, its final dissolution is brought about
by those unconscious and brutal crowds known, justifiably enough, as
barbarians.  Civilisations as yet have only been created and directed by
a small intellectual aristocracy, never by crowds.  Crowds are only
powerful for destruction.  Their rule is always tantamount to a
barbarian phase.  A civilisation involves fixed rules, discipline, a
passing from the instinctive to the rational state, forethought for the
future, an elevated degree of culture &mdash; all of them conditions that
crowds, left to themselves, have invariably shown themselves incapable
of realising.  In consequence of the purely destructive nature of their
power crowds act like those microbes which

<pb n="xx"/>

hasten the dissolution of
enfeebled or dead bodies.  When the structure of a civilisation is
rotten, it is always the masses that bring about its downfall.  It is at
such a juncture that their chief mission is plainly visible, and that
for a while the philosophy of number seems the only philosophy of
history.
</p><p>Is the same fate in store for our civilisation?  There is ground to
fear that this is the case, but we are not as yet in a position to be
certain of it.
</p><p>However this may be, we are bound to resign ourselves to the reign
of the masses, since want of foresight has in succession overthrown all
the barriers that might have kept the crowd in check.
</p><p>We have a very slight knowledge of these crowds which are beginning
to be the object of so much discussion.  Professional students of psychology,
having lived far from them, have always ignored them, and when,
as of late, they have turned their attention in this direction it has
only been to consider the crimes crowds are capable of committing.
Without a doubt criminal crowds exist, but virtuous and heroic crowds,
and crowds of many other kinds, are also to be met with.  The crimes of
crowds only constitute a particular phase of their psychology.  The
mental constitution of crowds is not to be learnt merely by a study of
their crimes, any more than that of an individual by a mere description
of his vices.

<pb n="xxi"/>

</p><p>However, in point of fact, all the world's masters, all the
founders of religions or empires, the apostles of all beliefs, eminent
statesmen, and, in a more modest sphere, the mere chiefs of small groups
of men have always been unconscious psychologists, possessed of an
instinctive and often very sure knowledge of the character of crowds,
and it is their accurate knowledge of this character that has enabled
them to so easily establish their mastery.  Napoleon had a marvellous
insight into the psychology of the masses of the country over which he
reigned, but he, at times, completely misunderstood the psychology of
crowds belonging to other races;<ref target="n1">[1]</ref> and it is because he thus misunderstood
it that he engaged in Spain, and notably in Russia, in conflicts
in which his power received blows which were destined within a brief
space of time to ruin it.  A knowledge of the psychology of crowds is
to-day the last resource of the statesman who wishes not to govern
them &mdash; that is becoming a very difficult matter &mdash; but at any rate not to
be too much governed by them.</p>


	<note place="foot" id="n1"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg><p>His most subtle advisers, moreover, did not understand this
psychology any better.  Talleyrand wrote him that "Spain would receive
his soldiers as liberators."  It received them as beasts of prey.  A
psychologist acquainted with the hereditary instincts of the Spanish
race would have easily foreseen this reception. </p></note>

<p>It is only by obtaining some sort of insight into the psychology of
crowds that it can be understood

<pb n="xxii"/>

how slight is the action upon
them of laws and institutions, how powerless they are to hold any
opinions other than those which are imposed upon them, and that it is
not with rules based on theories of pure equity that they are to be led,
but by seeking what produces an impression on them and what seduces
them.  For instance, should a legislator, wishing to impose a new tax,
choose that which would be theoretically the most just?  By no means.
In practice the most unjust may be the best for the masses.  Should it
at the same time be the least obvious, and apparently the least
burdensome, it will be the most easily tolerated.  It is for this reason
that an indirect tax, however exorbitant it be, will always be accepted
by the crowd, because, being paid daily in fractions of a farthing on
objects of consumption, it will not interfere with the habits of the
crowd, and will pass unperceived.  Replace it by a proportional tax on
wages or income of any other kind, to be paid in a lump sum, and were
this new imposition theoretically ten times less burdensome than the
other, it would give rise to unanimous protest.  This arises from the
fact that a sum relatively high, which will appear immense, and will in
consequence strike the imagination, has been substituted for the
unperceived fractions of a farthing.  The new tax would only appear
light had it been saved farthing by farthing, but this economic
proceeding

<pb n="xxiii"/>

involves an amount of foresight of which the masses
are incapable.
</p><p>The example which precedes is of the simplest.  Its appositeness
will be easily perceived.  It did not escape the attention of such a
psychologist as Napoleon, but our modern legislators, ignorant as they
are of the characteristics of a crowd, are unable to appreciate it.
Experience has not taught them as yet to a sufficient degree that men
never shape their conduct upon the teaching of pure reason.
</p><p>Many other practical applications might be made of the psychology
of crowds.  A knowledge of this science throws the most vivid light on a
great number of historical and economic phenomena totally
incomprehensible without it.  I shall have occasion to show that the
reason why the most remarkable of modern historians, Taine, has at times
so imperfectly understood the events of the great French Revolution is,
that it never occurred to him to study the genius of crowds.  He took as
his guide in the study of this complicated period the descriptive method
resorted to by naturalists; but the moral forces are almost absent in
the case of the phenomena which naturalists have to study.  Yet it is
precisely these forces that constitute the true mainsprings of history.
</p><p>In consequence, merely looked at from its practical side, the study
of the psychology of crowds

<pb n="xxiv"/>

deserved to be attempted.  Were its
interest that resulting from pure curiosity only, it would still merit
attention.  It is as interesting to decipher the motives of the actions
of men as to determine the characteristics of a mineral or a plant.  Our
study of the genius of crowds can merely be a brief synthesis, a simple
summary of our investigations.  Nothing more must be demanded of it than
a few suggestive views.  Others will work the ground more thoroughly.
To-day we only touch the surface of a still almost virgin soil.

</head>

<p>What constitutes a crowd from the psychological point of view &mdash; A
numerically strong agglomeration of individuals does not suffice to form
a crowd &mdash; Special characteristics of psychological crowds &mdash; The turning in
a fixed direction of the ideas and sentiments of individuals composing
such a crowd, and the disappearance of their personality &mdash; The crowd is
always dominated by considerations of which it is unconscious &mdash; The
disappearance of brain activity and the predominance of medullar
activity &mdash; The lowering of the intelligence and the complete
transformation of the sentiments &mdash; The transformed sentiments may be
better or worse than those of the individuals of which the crowd is
composed &mdash; A crowd is as easily heroic as criminal.

</p><p>IN its ordinary sense the word "crowd" means a gathering of individuals
of whatever nationality, profession, or sex, and whatever be the chances
that have brought them together.  From the psychological point of view
the expression

<pb n="2"/>

"crowd" assumes quite a different signification.
Under certain given circumstances, and only under those circumstances,
an agglomeration of men presents new characteristics very different from
those of the individuals composing it.  The sentiments and ideas of all
the persons in the gathering take one and the same direction, and their
conscious personality vanishes.  A collective mind is formed, doubtless
transitory, but presenting very clearly defined characteristics.  The
gathering has thus become what, in the absence of a better expression, I
will call an organised crowd, or, if the term is considered preferable,
a psychological crowd.  It forms a single being, and is subjected to the
<hi rend="italic">law of the mental unity of crowds</hi>.
</p><p>It is evident that it is not by the mere fact of a number of
individuals finding themselves accidentally side by side that they
acquire the character of an organised crowd.  A thousand individuals
accidentally gathered in a public place without any determined object in
no way constitute a crowd from the psychological point of view.  To
acquire the special characteristics of such a crowd, the influence is
necessary of certain predisposing causes of which we shall have to
determine the nature.
</p><p>The disappearance of conscious personality and the turning of
feelings and thoughts in a definite

<pb n="3"/>

direction, which are the primary
characteristics of a crowd about to become organised, do not always
involve the simultaneous presence of a number of individuals on one
spot.  Thousands of isolated individuals may acquire at certain moments,
and under the influence of certain violent emotions &mdash; such, for example,
as a great national event &mdash; the characteristics of a psychological crowd.
It will be sufficient in that case that a mere chance should bring them
together for their acts to at once assume the characteristics peculiar
to the acts of a crowd.  At certain moments half a dozen men might constitute
a psychological crowd, which may not happen in the case of
hundreds of men gathered together by accident.  On the other hand, an
entire nation, though there may be no visible agglomeration, may become
a crowd under the action of certain influences.
</p><p>A psychological crowd once constituted, it acquires certain
provisional but determinable general characteristics.  To these general
characteristics there are adjoined particular characteristics which vary
according to the elements of which the crowd is composed, and may modify
its mental constitution.  Psychological crowds, then, are susceptible of
classification; and when we come to occupy ourselves with this matter,
we shall see that a heterogeneous crowd &mdash; that is, a crowd composed of
dissimilar elements &mdash; presents certain characteristics

<pb n="4"/>

in common with
homogeneous crowds &mdash; that is, with crowds composed of elements more or
less akin (sects, castes, and classes) &mdash; and side by side with these
common characteristics particularities which permit of the two kinds of
crowds being differentiated.
</p><p>But before occupying ourselves with the different categories of
crowds, we must first of all examine the characteristics common to them
all.  We shall set to work like the naturalist, who begins by describing
the general characteristics common to all the members of a family before
concerning himself with the particular characteristics which allow the
differentiation of the genera and species that the family includes.
</p><p>It is not easy to describe the mind of crowds with exactness,
because its organisation varies not only according to race and
composition, but also according to the nature and intensity of the exciting
causes to which crowds are subjected.  The same difficulty,
however, presents itself in the psychological study of an individual.
It is only in novels that individuals are found to traverse their whole
life with an unvarying character.  It is only the uniformity of the
environment that creates the apparent uniformity of characters.  I have
shown elsewhere that all mental constitutions contain possibilities of
character which may be manifested in consequence of a sudden change of

<pb n="5"/>

environment.  This explains how it was that among the most savage
members of the French Convention were to be found inoffensive citizens
who, under ordinary circumstances, would have been peaceable notaries or
virtuous magistrates.  The storm past, they resumed their normal
character of quiet, law-abiding citizens.  Napoleon found amongst them
his most docile servants.
</p><p>It being impossible to study here all the successive degrees of
organisation of crowds, we shall concern ourselves more especially with
such crowds as have attained to the phase of complete organisation.  In
this way we shall see what crowds may become, but not what they
invariably are.  It is only in this advanced phase of organisation that
certain new and special characteristics are superposed on the unvarying
and dominant character of the race; then takes place that turning
already alluded to of all the feelings and thoughts of the collectivity
in an identical direction.  It is only under such circumstances, too,
that what I have called above the <hi rend="italic">psychological law of the mental
unity of crowds</hi> comes into play.
</p><p>Among the psychological characteristics of crowds there are some
that they may present in common with isolated individuals, and others,
on the contrary, which are absolutely peculiar to them and are only to
be met with in collectivities.  It is

<pb n="6"/>

these special characteristics
that we shall study, first of all, in order to show their importance.
</p><p>The most striking peculiarity presented by a psychological crowd is
the following: Whoever be the individuals that compose it, however like
or unlike be their mode of life, their occupations, their character, or
their intelligence, the fact that they have been transformed into a
crowd puts them in possession of a sort of collective mind which makes
them feel, think, and act in a manner quite different from that in which
each individual of them would feel, think, and act were he in a state of
isolation.  There are certain ideas and feelings which do not come into
being, or do not transform themselves into acts except in the case of
individuals forming a crowd.  The psychological crowd is a provisional
being formed of heterogeneous elements, which for a moment are combined,
exactly as the cells which constitute a living body form by their
reunion a new being which displays characteristics very different from
those possessed by each of the cells singly.
</p><p>Contrary to an opinion which one is astonished to find coming from
the pen of so acute a philosopher as Herbert Spencer, in the aggregate
which constitutes a crowd there is in no sort a summing-up of or an
average struck between its elements.  What really takes place is a
combination followed by the creation of new characteristics, just as in

<pb n="7"/>

chemistry certain elements, when brought into contact &mdash; bases and
acids, for example &mdash; combine
to form a new body possessing properties quite different from those of
the bodies that have served to form it.
</p><p>It is easy to prove how much the individual forming part of a crowd
differs from the isolated individual, but it is less easy to discover
the causes of this difference.
</p><p>To obtain at any rate a glimpse of them it is necessary in the
first place to call to mind the truth established by modern psychology,
that unconscious phenomena play an altogether preponderating part not
only in organic life, but also in the operations of the intelligence.
The conscious life of the mind is of small importance in comparison with
its unconscious life.  The most subtle analyst, the most acute observer,
is scarcely successful in discovering more than a very small number of
the unconscious motives that determine his conduct.  Our conscious acts
are the outcome of an unconscious substratum created in the mind in the
main by hereditary influences.  This substratum consists of the
innumerable common characteristics handed down from generation to
generation, which constitute the genius of a race.  Behind the avowed
causes of our acts there undoubtedly lie secret causes that we do not
avow, but behind these secret causes there are many

<pb n="9"/>

others more
secret still which we ourselves ignore.  The greater part of our daily
actions are the result of hidden motives which escape our observation.
</p><p>It is more especially with respect to those unconscious elements
which constitute the genius of a race that all the individuals belonging
to it resemble each other, while it is principally in respect to the
conscious elements of their character &mdash; the fruit of education, and yet
more of exceptional hereditary conditions &mdash; that they differ from each
other.  Men the most unlike in the matter of their intelligence possess
instincts, passions, and feelings that are very similar.  In the case of
every thing that belongs to the realm of sentiment &mdash; religion, politics,
morality, the affections and antipathies, &amp;c. &mdash; the most eminent men
seldom surpass the standard of the most ordinary individuals.  From the
intellectual point of view an abyss may exist between a great
mathematician and his boot maker, but from the point of view of
character the difference is most often slight or non-existent.
</p><p>It is precisely these general qualities of character, governed by
forces of which we are unconscious, and possessed by the majority of the
normal individuals of a race in much the same degree &mdash; it is precisely
these qualities, I say, that in crowds become common property.  In the
collective mind the intellectual aptitudes of the individuals, and in
consequence their individuality, are weakened.  The

<pb n="9"/>

heterogeneous is
swamped by the homogeneous, and the unconscious qualities obtain the
upper hand.
</p><p>This very fact that crowds possess in common ordinary qualities
explains why they can never accomplish acts demanding a high degree of
intelligence.  The decisions affecting matters of general interest come
to by an assembly of men of distinction, but specialists in different
walks of life, are not sensibly superior to the decisions that would be
adopted by a gathering of imbeciles.  The truth is, they can only bring
to bear in common on the work in hand those mediocre qualities which are
the birthright of every average individual.  In crowds it is stupidity
and not mother-wit that is accumulated.  It is not all the world, as is
so often repeated, that has more wit than Voltaire, but assuredly
Voltaire that has more wit than all the world, if by "all the world"
crowds are to be understood.
</p><p>If the individuals of a crowd confined themselves to putting in
common the ordinary qualities of which each of them has his share, there
would merely result the striking of an average, and not, as we have said
is actually the case, the creation of new characteristics.  How is it
that these new characteristics are created?  This is what we are now to
investigate.
</p><p>Different causes determine the appearance of

<pb n="10"/>

these
characteristics peculiar to crowds, and not possessed by isolated
individuals.  The first is that the individual forming part of a crowd
acquires, solely from numerical considerations, a sentiment of
invincible power which allows him to yield to instincts which, had he
been alone, he would perforce have kept under restraint.  He will be the
less disposed to check himself from the consideration that, a crowd
being anonymous, and in consequence irresponsible, the sentiment of
responsibility which always controls individuals disappears entirely.
</p><p>The second cause, which is contagion, also intervenes to determine
the manifestation in crowds of their special characteristics, and at the
same time the trend they are to take.  Contagion is a phenomenon of
which it is easy to establish the presence, but that it is not easy to
explain.  It must be classed among those phenomena of a hypnotic order,
which we shall shortly study.  In a crowd every sentiment and act is
contagious, and contagious to such a degree that an individual readily
sacrifices his personal interest to the collective interest.  This is an
aptitude very contrary to his nature, and of which a man is scarcely
capable, except when he makes part of a crowd.
</p><p>A third cause, and by far the most important, determines in the
individuals of a crowd special characteristics which are quite contrary
at times

<pb n="11"/>

to those presented by the isolated individual.  I allude to
that suggestibility of which, moreover, the contagion mentioned above is
neither more nor less than an effect.
</p><p>To understand this phenomenon it is necessary to bear in mind
certain recent physiological discoveries.  We know to-day that by
various processes an individual may be brought into such a condition
that, having entirely lost his conscious personality, he obeys all the
suggestions of the operator who has deprived him of it, and commits acts
in utter contradiction with his character and habits.  The most careful
observations seem to prove that an individual immerged for some length
of time in a crowd in action soon finds himself &mdash; either in consequence
of the magnetic influence given out by the crowd, or from some other
cause of which we are ignorant &mdash; in a special state, which much resembles
the state of fascination in which the hypnotised individual finds
himself in the hands of the hypnotiser.  The activity of the brain being
paralysed in the case of the hypnotised subject, the latter becomes the
slave of all the unconscious activities of his spinal cord, which the
hypnotiser directs at will.  The conscious personality has entirely
vanished; will and discernment are lost.  All feelings and thoughts are
bent in the direction determined by the hypnotiser.
</p><p>Such also is approximately the state of the

<pb n="12"/>

individual forming
part of a psychological crowd.  He is no longer conscious of his acts.
In his case, as in the case of the hypnotised subject, at the same time
that certain faculties are destroyed, others may be brought to a high
degree of exaltation.  Under the influence of a suggestion, he will
undertake the accomplishment of certain acts with irresistible
impetuosity.  This impetuosity is the more irresistible in the case of
crowds than in that of the hypnotised subject, from the fact that, the
suggestion being the same for all the individuals of the crowd, it gains
in strength by reciprocity.  The individualities in the crowd who might
possess a personality sufficiently strong to resist the suggestion are
too few in number to struggle against the current.  At the utmost, they
may be able to attempt a diversion by means of different suggestions.
It is in this way, for instance, that a happy expression, an image
opportunely evoked, have occasionally deterred crowds from the most
bloodthirsty acts.
</p><p>We see, then, that the disappearance of the conscious personality,
the predominance of the unconscious personality, the turning by means of
suggestion and contagion of feelings and ideas in an identical
direction, the tendency to immediately transform the suggested ideas
into acts; these, we see, are the principal characteristics of the
individual forming part of a crowd.  He is no longer himself, but

<pb n="13"/>

has become an automaton who has ceased to be guided by his will.
</p><p>Moreover, by the mere fact that he forms part of an organised
crowd, a man descends several rungs in the ladder of civilisation.
Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd, he is a barbarian &mdash;
that is, a creature acting by instinct.  He possesses the
spontaneity, the violence, the ferocity, and also the enthusiasm and
heroism of primitive beings, whom he further tends to resemble by the
facility with which he allows himself to be impressed by words and
images &mdash; which would be entirely without action on each of the isolated
individuals composing the crowd &mdash; and to be induced to commit acts
contrary to his most obvious interests and his best-known habits.  An
individual in a crowd is a grain of sand amid other grains of sand,
which the wind stirs up at will.
</p><p>It is for these reasons that juries are seen to deliver verdicts of
which each individual juror would disapprove, that parliamentary
assemblies adopt laws and measures of which each of their members would
disapprove in his own person.  Taken separately, the men of the
Convention were enlightened citizens of peaceful habits.  United in a
crowd, they did not hesitate to give their adhesion to the most savage
proposals, to guillotine individuals most clearly innocent, and,
contrary to their interests, to renounce their inviolability and to
decimate themselves.

<pb n="14"/>

</p><p>It is not only by his acts that the individual in a crowd differs
essentially from himself.  Even before he has entirely lost his
independence, his ideas and feelings have undergone a transformation,
and the transformation is so profound as to change the miser into a
spendthrift, the sceptic into a believer, the honest man into a
criminal, and the coward into a hero.  The renunciation of all its
privileges which the nobility voted in a moment of enthusiasm during the
celebrated night of August 4, 1789, would certainly never have been
consented to by any of its members taken singly.
</p><p>The conclusion to be drawn from what precedes is, that the crowd is
always intellectually inferior to the isolated individual, but that,
from the point of view of feelings and of the acts these feelings
provoke, the crowd may, according to circumstances, he better or worse
than the individual.  All depends on the nature of the suggestion to
which the crowd is exposed.  This is the point that has been completely
misunderstood by writers who have only studied crowds from the criminal
point of view.  Doubtless a crowd is often criminal, but also it is
often heroic.  It is crowds rather than isolated individuals that may be
induced to run the risk of death to secure the triumph of a creed or an
idea, that may be fired with enthusiasm for glory and honour, that are
led on &mdash; almost without bread and without arms, as in the

<pb n="15"/>

age of the
Crusades &mdash; to deliver the tomb of Christ from the infidel, or, as in '93,
to defend the fatherland.  Such heroism is without doubt somewhat
unconscious, but it is of such heroism that history is made.  Were
peoples only to be credited with the great actions performed in cold
blood, the annals of the world would register but few of them.

crowds, it remains to study these characteristics in detail.
</p><p>It will be remarked that among the special characteristics of
crowds there are several &mdash; such as impulsiveness, irritability,
incapacity to reason, the absence of judgment and of the critical
spirit, the exaggeration of the sentiments, and others besides &mdash; which
are almost always observed in beings belonging to inferior forms of
evolution &mdash; in women, savages, and children, for instance.  However, I
merely indicate this analogy in passing; its demonstration is outside
the scope of this work.  It would, moreover, be useless for persons
acquainted with the psychology of primitive beings, and would scarcely
carry conviction to those in ignorance of this matter.
</p><p>I now proceed to the successive consideration of the different
characteristics that may be observed in the majority of crowds.
</p>

<pb n="18"/>

<div3 type="section" n="1.2.1" id="d12">
<head>
&sect; 1. IMPULSIVENESS, MOBILITY, AND IRRITABILITY OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>When studying the fundamental characteristics of a crowd we stated
that it is guided almost exclusively by unconscious motives.  Its acts
are far more under the influence of the spinal cord than of the brain.
In this respect a crowd is closely akin to quite primitive beings.  The
acts performed may be perfect so far as their execution is concerned,
but as they are not directed by the brain, the individual conducts
himself according as the exciting causes to which he is submitted may
happen to decide.  A crowd is at the mercy of all external exciting
causes, and reflects their incessant variations.  It is the slave of the
impulses which it receives.  The isolated individual may be submitted to
the same exciting causes as the man in a crowd, but as his brain shows
him the inadvisability of yielding to them, he refrains from yielding.
This truth may be physiologically expressed by saying that the isolated
individual possesses the capacity of dominating his reflex actions,
while a crowd is devoid of this capacity.
</p><p>The varying impulses to which crowds obey may be, according to
their exciting causes, generous or cruel, heroic or cowardly, but they
will always be so imperious that the interest of the individual, even
the interest of self-preservation,

<pb n="19"/>

will not dominate them.  The
exciting causes that may act on crowds being so varied, and crowds
always obeying them, crowds are in consequence extremely mobile.  This
explains how it is that we see them pass in a moment from the most
bloodthirsty ferocity to the most extreme generosity and heroism.  A
crowd may easily enact the part of an executioner, but not less easily
that of a martyr.  It is crowds that have furnished the torrents of
blood requisite for the triumph of every belief.  It is not necessary to
go back to the heroic ages to see what crowds are capable of in this
latter direction.  They are never sparing of their life in an
insurrection, and not long since a general,<note><p>[2]</p></note> becoming suddenly
popular, might easily have found a hundred thousand men ready to
sacrifice their lives for his cause had he demanded it.
</p><p>Any display of premeditation by crowds is in consequence out of the
question.  They may be animated in succession by the most contrary
sentiments, but they will always be under the influence of the exciting
causes of the moment.  They are like the leaves which a tempest whirls
up and scatters in every direction and then allows to fall.  When
studying later on certain revolutionary crowds we shall give some
examples of the variability of their sentiments.

</p>
<p>[2]</p>
<note><p>General Boulanger. </p></note>

<pb n="20"/>

<p>This mobility of crowds renders them very difficult to govern,
especially when a measure of public authority has fallen into their
hands.  Did not the necessities of everyday life constitute a sort of
invisible regulator of existence, it would scarcely be possible for
democracies to last.  Still, though the wishes of crowds are frenzied
they are not durable.  Crowds are as incapable of willing as of thinking
for any length of time.
</p><p>A crowd is not merely impulsive and mobile.  Like a savage, it is
not prepared to admit that anything can come between its desire and the
realisation of its desire.  It is the less capable of understanding such
an intervention, in consequence of the feeling of irresistible power
given it by its numerical strength.  The notion of impossibility
disappears for the individual in a crowd.  An isolated individual knows
well enough that alone he cannot set fire to a palace or loot a shop,
and should he be tempted to do so, he will easily resist the temptation.
Making part of a crowd, he is conscious of the power given him by
number, and it is sufficient to suggest to him ideas of murder or
pillage for him to yield immediately to temptation.  An unexpected
obstacle will be destroyed with frenzied rage.  Did the human organism
allow of the perpetuity of furious passion, it might be said that the
normal condition of a crowd baulked in its wishes is just such a state
of furious passion.

<pb n="21"/>

</p><p>The fundamental characteristics of the race, which constitute the
unvarying source from which all our sentiments spring, always exert an
influence on the irritability of crowds, their impulsiveness and their
mobility, as on all the popular sentiments we shall have to study.  All
crowds are doubtless always irritable and impulsive, but with great
variations of degree.  For instance, the difference between a Latin and
an Anglo-Saxon crowd is striking.  The most recent facts in French
history throw a vivid light on this point.  The mere publication,
twenty-five years ago, of a telegram, relating an insult supposed to
have been offered an ambassador, was sufficient to determine an
explosion of fury, whence followed immediately a terrible war.  Some
years later the telegraphic announcement of an insignificant reverse at
Langson provoked a fresh explosion which brought about the instantaneous
overthrow of the government.  At the same moment a much more serious
reverse undergone by the English expedition to Khartoum produced only a
slight emotion in England, and no ministry was overturned.  Crowds are
everywhere distinguished by feminine characteristics, but Latin crowds
are the most feminine of all.  Whoever trusts in them may rapidly attain
a lofty destiny, but to do so is to be perpetually skirting the brink of
a Tarpeian rock, with the certainty of one day being precipitated from
it.

&sect; 2.  THE SUGGESTIBILITY AND CREDULITY OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>When defining crowds, we said that one of their general
characteristics was an excessive suggestibility, and we have shown to
what an extent suggestions are contagious in every human agglomeration;
a fact which explains the rapid turning of the sentiments of a crowd in
a definite direction.  However indifferent it may be supposed, a crowd,
as a rule, is in a state of expectant attention, which renders
suggestion easy.  The first suggestion formulated which arises implants
itself immediately by a process of contagion in the brains of all assembled,
and the identical bent of the sentiments of the crowd is
immediately an accomplished fact.
</p><p>As is the case with all persons under the influence of suggestion,
the idea which has entered the brain tends to transform itself into an
act.  Whether the act is that of setting fire to a palace, or involves
self-sacrifice, a crowd lends itself to it with equal facility.  All
will depend on the nature of the exciting cause, and no longer, as in
the case of the isolated individual, on the relations existing between
the act suggested and the sum total of the reasons which may be urged
against its realisation.
</p><p>In consequence, a crowd perpetually hovering on the borderland of
unconsciousness, readily yielding to all suggestions, having all the
violence

<pb n="23"/>

of feeling peculiar to beings who cannot appeal to the
influence of reason, deprived of all critical faculty, cannot be
otherwise than excessively credulous.  The improbable does not exist for
a crowd, and it is necessary to bear this circumstance well in mind to
understand the facility with which are created and propagated the most
improbable legends and stories.<note><p>[3]</p></note>

</p><p>[3]</p>
<note><p>Persons who went through the siege of Paris saw numerous
examples of this credulity of crowds.  A candle alight in an upper story
was immediately looked upon as a signal given the besiegers, although it
was evident, after a moment of reflection, that it was utterly
impossible to catch sight of the light of the candle at a distance of
several miles. </p></note>

<p>The creation of the legends which so easily obtain circulation in
crowds is not solely the consequence of their extreme credulity.  It is
also the result of the prodigious perversions that events undergo in the
imagination of a throng.  The simplest event that comes under the observation
of a crowd is soon totally transformed.  A crowd thinks in
images, and the image itself immediately calls up a series of other
images, having no logical connection with the first.  We can easily
conceive this state by thinking of the fantastic succession of ideas to
which we are sometimes led by calling up in our minds any fact.  Our
reason shows us the incoherence there is in these images, but a crowd is
almost blind

<pb n="24"/>

to this truth, and confuses with the real event what
the deforming action of its imagination has superimposed thereon.  A
crowd scarcely distinguishes between the subjective and the objective.
It accepts as real the images evoked in its mind, though they most often
have only a very distant relation with the observed fact.
</p><p>The ways in which a crowd perverts any event of which it is a
witness ought, it would seem, to be innumerable and unlike each other,
since the individuals composing the gathering are of very different
temperaments.  But this is not the case.  As the result of contagion the
perversions are of the same kind, and take the same shape in the case of
all the assembled individuals.
</p><p>The first perversion of the truth effected by one of the
individuals of the gathering is the starting-point of the contagious
suggestion.  Before St. George appeared on the walls of Jerusalem to all
the Crusaders he was certainly perceived in the first instance by one of
those present.  By dint of suggestion and contagion the miracle
signalised by a single person was immediately accepted by all.
</p><p>Such is always the mechanism of the collective hallucinations so
frequent in history &mdash; hallucinations which seem to have all the
recognised characteristics of authenticity, since they are phenomena
observed by thousands of persons.

<pb n="25"/>

</p><p>To combat what precedes, the mental quality of the individuals
composing a crowd must not be brought into consideration.  This quality
is without importance.  From the moment that they form part of a crowd
the learned man and the ignoramus are equally incapable of observation.
</p><p>This thesis may seem paradoxical.  To demonstrate it beyond doubt
it would be necessary to investigate a great number of historical facts,
and several volumes would be insufficient for the purpose.
</p><p>Still, as I do not wish to leave the reader under the impression of
unproved assertions, I shall give him some examples taken at hazard from
the immense number of those that might be quoted.
</p><p>The following fact is one of the most typical, because chosen from
among collective hallucinations of which a crowd is the victim, in which
are to be found individuals of every kind, from the most ignorant to the
most highly educated.  It is related incidentally by Julian Felix, a
naval lieutenant, in his book on "Sea Currents," and has been previously
cited by the <hi rend="italic">Revue Scientique.</hi>
</p><p>The frigate, the <hi rend="italic">Belle Poule</hi>, was cruising in the open sea
for the purpose of finding the cruiser <hi rend="italic">Le Berceau</hi>, from which she
had been separated by a violent storm.  It was broad daylight and in
full sunshine.  Suddenly the watch signalled a disabled

<pb n="26"/>

vessel; the
crew looked in the direction signalled, and every one, officers and
sailors, clearly perceived a raft covered with men towed by boats which
were displaying signals of distress.  Yet this was nothing more than a
collective hallucination.  Admiral Desfosses lowered a boat to go to the
rescue of the wrecked sailors.  On nearing the object sighted, the
sailors and officers on board the boat saw "masses of men in motion,
stretching out their hands, and heard the dull and confused noise of a
great number of voices."  When the object was reached those in the boat
found themselves simply and solely in the presence of a few branches of
trees covered with leaves that had been swept out from the neighbouring
coast.  Before evidence so palpable the hallucination vanished.
</p><p>The mechanism of a collective hallucination of the kind we have
explained is clearly seen at work in this example.  On the one hand we
have a crowd in a state of expectant attention, on the other a
suggestion made by the watch signalling a disabled vessel at sea, a
suggestion which, by a process of contagion, was accepted by all those
present, both officers and sailors.
</p><p>It is not necessary that a crowd should be numerous for the faculty
of seeing what is taking place before its eyes to be destroyed and for
the real facts to be replaced by hallucinations unre

<pb n="27"/>

lated to them.
As soon as a few individuals are gathered together they constitute a
crowd, and, though they should be distinguished men of learning, they
assume all the characteristics of crowds with regard to matters outside
their speciality.  The faculty of observation and the critical spirit
possessed by each of them individually at once disappears.  An ingenious
psychologist, Mr. Davey, supplies us with a very curious example in
point, recently cited in the <hi rend="italic">Annales des Sciences Psychiques</hi>, and
deserving of relation here.  Mr. Davey, having convoked a gathering of
distinguished observers, among them one of the most prominent of English
scientific men, Mr. Wallace, executed in their presence, and after
having allowed them to examine the objects and to place seals where they
wished, all the regulation spiritualistic phenomena, the materialisation
of spirits, writing on slates, &amp;c.  Having subsequently obtained from
these distinguished observers written reports admitting that the
phenomena observed could only have been obtained by supernatural means,
he revealed to them that they were the result of very simple tricks.
"The most astonishing feature of Monsieur Davey's investigation," writes
the author of this account, "is not the marvellousness of the tricks
themselves, but the extreme weakness of the reports made with respect to
them by the non

<pb n="28"/>

initiated witnesses.  It is clear, then," he says,
"that witnesses even in number may give circumstantial relations which
are completely erroneous, but whose result is <hi rend="italic">that, if their
descriptions are accepted as exact</hi>, the phenomena they describe are
inexplicable by trickery.  The methods invented by Mr. Davey were so
simple that one is astonished that he should have had the boldness to
employ them; but he had such a power over the mind of the crowd that he
could persuade it that it saw what it did not see."  Here, as always, we
have the power of the hypnotiser over the hypnotised.  Moreover, when
this power is seen in action on minds of a superior order and previously
invited to be suspicious, it is understandable how easy it is to deceive
ordinary crowds.
</p><p>Analogous examples are innumerable.  As I write these lines the
papers are full of the story of two little girls found drowned in the
Seine.  These children, to begin with, were recognised in the most
unmistakable manner by half a dozen witnesses.  All the affirmations
were in such entire concordance that no doubt remained in the mind of
the <hi rend="italic">juge d'instruction.</hi>  He had the certificate of death drawn
up, but just as the burial of the children was to have been proceeded
with, a mere chance brought about the discovery that the supposed
victims were alive, and had, moreover, but a remote resemblance to the
drowned

<pb n="29"/>

girls.  As in several of the examples previously cited, the
affirmation of the first witness, himself a victim of illusion, had
sufficed to influence the other witnesses.
</p><p>In parallel cases the starting-point of the suggestion is always
the illusion produced in an individual by more or less vague
reminiscences, contagion following as the result of the affirmation of
this initial illusion.  If the first observer be very impressionable, it
will often be sufficient that the corpse he believes he recognises
should present &mdash; apart from all real resemblance &mdash; some peculiarity, a
scar, or some detail of toilet which may evoke the idea of another
person.  The idea evoked may then become the nucleus of a sort of
crystallisation which invades the understanding and paralyses all
critical faculty.  What the observer then sees is no longer the object
itself, but the image-evoked in his mind.  In this way are to be
explained erroneous recognitions of the dead bodies of children by their
own mother, as occurred in the following case, already old, but which
has been recently recalled by the newspapers.  In it are to be traced
precisely the two kinds of suggestion of which I have just pointed out
the mechanism.

</p><p>"The child was recognised by another child, who was mistaken.  The
series of unwarranted recognitions then began.

<pb n="30"/>

</p><p>"An extraordinary thing occurred.  The day after a schoolboy had
recognised the corpse a woman exclaimed, `Good Heavens, it is my child!'
</p><p>"She was taken up to the corpse; she examined the clothing, and
noted a scar on the forehead.  `It is certainly,' she said, `my son who
disappeared last July.  He has been stolen from me and murdered.'
</p><p>"The woman was <hi rend="italic">concierge</hi> in the Rue du Four; her name was
Chavandret.  Her brother-in-law was summoned, and when questioned he
said, `That is the little Filibert.' Several persons living in the
street recognised the child found at La Villette as Filibert Chavandret,
among them being the boy's schoolmaster, who based his opinion on a
medal worn by the lad.
</p><p>"Nevertheless, the neighbours, the brother-in-law, the
schoolmaster, and the mother were mistaken.  Six weeks later the
identity of the child was established.  The boy, belonging to Bordeaux,
had been murdered there and brought by a carrying company to Paris."<note><p>[4]</p></note>

</p><p>[4]</p><note><p><hi rend="italic">L'Eclair</hi>, April 21, 1895. </p></note>

<p>It will be remarked that these recognitions are most often made by
women and children &mdash; that is to say, by precisely the most impressionable
persons.  They show us at the same time what is the

<pb n="31"/>

worth in law
courts of such witnesses.  As far as children, more especially, are
concerned, their statements ought never to be invoked.  Magistrates are
in the habit of repeating that children do not lie.  Did they possess a
psychological culture a little less rudimentary than is the case they
would know that, on the contrary, children invariably lie; the lie is
doubtless innocent, but it is none the less a lie.  It would be better
to decide the fate of an accused person by the toss of a coin than, as
has been so often done, by the evidence of a child.
</p><p>To return to the faculty of observation possessed by crowds, our
conclusion is that their collective observations are as erroneous as
possible, and that most often they merely represent the illusion of an
individual who, by a process of contagion, has suggestioned his fellows.
Facts proving that the most utter mistrust of the evidence of crowds is
advisable might be multiplied to any extent.  Thousands of men were
present twenty-five years ago at the celebrated cavalry charge during
the battle of Sedan, and yet it is impossible, in the face of the most
contradictory ocular testimony, to decide by whom it was commanded.  The
English general, Lord Wolseley, has proved in a recent book that up to
now the gravest errors of fact have been committed with regard to the
most important incidents of the battle of Waterloo &mdash;

<pb n="32"/>

facts that
hundreds of witnesses had nevertheless attested.<note><p>[5]</p></note>

</p><p>[5]</p><note><p>Do we know in the case of one single battle exactly how it took
place?  I am very doubtful on the point.  We know who were the
conquerors and the conquered, but this is probably all.  What M.
D'Harcourt has said with respect to the battle of Solferino, which he
witnessed and in which he was personally engaged, may be applied to all
battles &mdash; "The generals (informed, of course, by the evidence of hundreds
of witnesses) forward their official reports; the orderly officers
modify these documents and draw up a definite narrative; the chief of
the staff raises objections and rewrites the whole on a fresh basis.
It is carried to the Marshal, who exclaims, `You are entirely in error,'
and he substitutes a fresh edition.  Scarcely anything remains of the
original report."  M. D'Harcourt relates this fact as proof of the
impossibility of establishing the truth in connection with the most
striking, the best observed events. </p></note>

<p>Such facts show us what is the value of the testimony of crowds.
Treatises on logic include the unanimity of numerous witnesses in the
category of the strongest proofs that can be invoked in support of the
exactness of a fact.  Yet what we know of the psychology of crowds shows
that treatises on logic need on this point to be rewritten.  The events
with regard to which there exists the most doubt are certainly those
which have been observed by the greatest number of persons.  To say that
a fact has been simultaneously verified by thousands of witnesses is to
say, as a rule, that the real fact is very different from the accepted
account of it.

<pb n="33"/>

</p><p>It clearly results from what precedes that works of history must be
considered as works of pure imagination.  They are fanciful accounts of
ill-observed facts, accompanied by explanations the result of
reflection.  To write such books is the most absolute waste of time.
Had not the past left us its literary, artistic, and monumental works,
we should know absolutely nothing in reality with regard to bygone
times.  Are we in possession of a single word of truth concerning the
lives of the great men who have played preponderating parts in the
history of humanity &mdash; men such as Hercules, Buddha, or Mahomet?  In all
probability we are not.  In point of fact, moreover, their real lives
are of slight importance to us.  Our interest is to know what our great
men were as they are presented by popular legend.  It is legendary
heroes, and not for a moment real heroes, who have impressed the minds
of crowds.
</p><p>Unfortunately, legends &mdash; even although they have been definitely put
on record by books &mdash; have in themselves no stability.  The imagination of
the crowd continually transforms them as the result of the lapse of time
and especially in consequence of racial causes.  There is a great gulf
fixed between the sanguinary Jehovah of the Old Testament and the God of
Love of Sainte Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, and the Buddha worshipped in China has no
traits in common with that venerated in India.

<pb n="34"/>

</p><p>It is not even necessary that heroes should be separated from us by
centuries for their legend to be transformed by the imagination of the
crowd.  The transformation occasionally takes place within a few years.
In our own day we have seen the legend of one of the greatest heroes of
history modified several times in less than fifty years.  Under the
Bourbons Napoleon became a sort of idyllic and liberal philanthropist, a
friend of the humble who, according to the poets, was destined to be
long remembered in the cottage.  Thirty years afterwards this easy-going
hero had become a sanguinary despot, who, after having usurped power and
destroyed liberty, caused the slaughter of three million men solely to
satisfy his ambition.  At present we are witnessing a fresh
transformation of the legend.  When it has undergone the influence of
some dozens of centuries the learned men of the future, face to face
with these contradictory accounts, will perhaps doubt the very existence
of the hero, as some of them now doubt that of Buddha, and will see in
him nothing more than a solar myth or a development of the legend of
Hercules.  They will doubtless console themselves easily for this
uncertainty, for, better initiated than we are to-day in the
characteristics and psychology of crowds, they will know that history is
scarcely capable of preserving the memory of anything except myths.

&sect; 3. THE EXAGGERATION AND INGENUOUSNESS<lb/>
OF THE SENTIMENTS OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Whether the feelings exhibited by a crowd be good or bad, they
present the double character of being very simple and very exaggerated.
On this point, as on so many others, an individual in a crowd resembles
primitive beings.  Inaccessible to fine distinctions, he sees things as
a whole, and is blind to their intermediate phases.  The exaggeration of
the sentiments of a crowd is heightened by the fact that any feeling
when once it is exhibited communicating itself very quickly by a process
of suggestion and contagion, the evident approbation of which it is the
object considerably increases its force.
</p><p>The simplicity and exaggeration of the sentiments of crowds have
for result that a throng knows neither doubt nor uncertainty.  Like
women, it goes at once to extremes.  A suspicion transforms itself as
soon as announced into incontrovertible evidence.  A commencement of
antipathy or disapprobation, which in the case of an isolated individual
would not gain strength, becomes at once furious hatred in the case of
an individual in a crowd.
</p><p>The violence of the feelings of crowds is also increased,
especially in heterogeneous crowds, by the absence of all sense of
responsibility.  The

<pb n="36"/>

certainty of impunity, a certainty the stronger
as the crowd is more numerous, and the notion of a considerable
momentary force due to number, make possible in the case of crowds
sentiments and acts impossible for the isolated individual.  In crowds
the foolish, ignorant, and envious persons are freed from the sense of
their insignificance and powerlessness, and are possessed instead by the
notion of brutal and temporary but immense strength.
</p><p>Unfortunately, this tendency of crowds towards exaggeration is
often brought to bear upon bad sentiments.  These sentiments are
atavistic residuum of the instincts of the primitive man, which the fear
of punishment obliges the isolated and responsible individual to curb.
Thus it is that crowds are so easily led into the worst excesses.
</p><p>Still this does not mean that crowds, skilfully influenced, are not
capable of heroism and devotion and of evincing the loftiest virtues;
they are even more capable of showing these qualities than the isolated
individual.  We shall soon have occasion to revert to this point when we
come to study the morality of crowds.
</p><p>Given to exaggeration in its feelings, a crowd is only impressed by
excessive sentiments.  An orator wishing to move a crowd must make an
abusive use of violent affirmations.  To exaggerate, to affirm, to
resort to repetitions, and never to attempt to prove anything by
reasoning are methods of

<pb n="37"/>

argument well known to speakers at public
meetings.
</p><p>Moreover, a crowd exacts a like exaggeration in the sentiments of
its heroes.  Their apparent qualities and virtues must always be
amplified.  It has been justly remarked that on the stage a crowd
demands from the hero of the piece a degree of courage, morality, and
virtue that is never to be found in real life.
</p><p>Quite rightly importance has been laid on the special standpoint
from which matters are viewed in the theatre.  Such a standpoint exists
no doubt, but its rules for the most part have nothing to do with common
sense and logic.  The art of appealing to crowds is no doubt of an
inferior order, but it demands quite special aptitudes.  It is often
impossible on reading plays to explain their success.  Managers of
theatres when accepting pieces are themselves, as a rule, very uncertain
of their success, because to judge the matter it would be necessary that
they should be able to transform themselves into a crowd.<note><p>[6]</p></note>

</p><p>[6]</p><note><p>It is understandable for this reason why it sometimes happens
that pieces refused by all theatrical managers obtain a prodigious
success when by a stroke of chance they are put on the stage.  The
recent success of Francois Copp&eacute;e's play "Pour la Couronne" is well
known, and yet, in spite of the name of its author, it was refused
during ten years by the managers of the principal Parisian theatres. </p><p>"Charley's
Aunt," refused at every theatre, and finally staged at
the expense of a stockbroker, has had two hundred representations in
France, and more than a thousand in London.  Without the explanation
given above of the impossibility for theatrical managers to mentally
substitute themselves for a crowd, such mistakes in judgment on the part
of competent individuals, who are most interested not to commit such
grave blunders, would be inexplicable.  This is a subject that I cannot
deal with here, but it might worthily tempt the pen of a writer
acquainted with theatrical matters, and at the same time a subtle
psychologist &mdash; of such a writer, for instance, as M. Francisque Sarcey. </p></note>

<pb n="38"/>

<p>Here, once more, were we able to embark on more extensive
explanations, we should show the preponderating influence of racial
considerations.  A play which provokes the enthusiasm of the crowd in
one country has sometimes no success in another, or has only a partial
and conventional success, because it does not put in operation influences
capable of working on an altered public.
</p><p>I need not add that the tendency to exaggeration in crowds is only
present in the case of sentiments and not at all in the matter of
intelligence.  I have already shown that, by the mere fact that an individual
forms part of a crowd, his intellectual standard is immediately
and considerably lowered.  A learned magistrate, M. Tarde, has also
verified this fact in his researches on the crimes of crowds.  It is
only, then, with respect to sentiment that crowds can rise to a very
high or, on the contrary, descend to a very low level.

&sect; 4. THE INTOLERANCE, DICTATORIALNESS<lb/>
AND CONSERVATISM OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Crowds are only cognisant of simple and extreme sentiments; the
opinions, ideas, and beliefs suggested to them are accepted or rejected
as a whole, and considered as absolute truths or as not less absolute
errors.  This is always the case with beliefs induced by a process of
suggestion instead of engendered by reasoning.  Every one is aware of
the intolerance that accompanies religious beliefs, and of the despotic
empire they exercise on men's minds.
</p><p>Being in doubt as to what constitutes truth or error, and having,
on the other hand, a clear notion of its strength, a crowd is as
disposed to give authoritative effect to its inspirations as it is
intolerant.  An individual may accept contradiction and discussion; a
crowd will never do so.  At public meetings the slightest contradiction
on the part of an orator is immediately received with howls of fury and
violent invective, soon followed by blows, and expulsion should the
orator stick to his point.  Without the restraining presence of the
representatives of authority the contradictor, indeed, would often be
done to death.
</p><p>Dictatorialness and intolerance are common to all categories of
crowds, but they are met with in a varying degree of intensity.  Here,
once more, reappears that fundamental notion of race which

<pb n="40"/>

dominates
all the feelings and all the thoughts of men.  It is more especially in
Latin crowds that authoritativeness and intolerance are found developed
in the highest measure.  In fact, their development is such in crowds of
Latin origin that they have entirely destroyed that sentiment of the
independence of the individual so powerful in the Anglo-Saxon.  Latin
crowds are only concerned with the collective independence of the sect
to which they belong, and the characteristic feature of their conception
of independence is the need they experience of bringing those who are in
disagreement with themselves into immediate and violent subjection to
their beliefs.  Among the Latin races the Jacobins of every epoch, from
those of the Inquisition downwards, have never been able to attain to a
different conception of liberty.
</p><p>Authoritativeness and intolerance are sentiments of which crowds
have a very clear notion, which they easily conceive and which they
entertain as readily as they put them in practice when once they are
imposed upon them.  Crowds exhibit a docile respect for force, and are
but slightly impressed by kindness, which for them is scarcely other
than a form of weakness.  Their sympathies have never been bestowed on
easy-going masters, but on tyrants who vigorously oppressed them.  It is
to these latter that they always erect the loftiest statues.

<pb n="41"/>

It is
true that they willingly trample on the despot whom they have stripped
of his power, but it is because, having lost his strength, he has
resumed his place among the feeble, who are to be despised because they
are not to be feared.  The type of hero dear to crowds will always have
the semblance of a Caesar.  His insignia attracts them, his authority
overawes them, and his sword instils them with fear.
</p><p>A crowd is always ready to revolt against a feeble, and to bow down
servilely before a strong authority.  Should the strength of an
authority be intermittent, the crowd, always obedient to its extreme
sentiments, passes alternately from anarchy to servitude, and from
servitude to anarchy.
</p><p>However, to believe in the predominance among crowds of
revolutionary instincts would be to entirely misconstrue their
psychology.  It is merely their tendency to violence that deceives us on
this point.  Their rebellious and destructive outbursts are always very
transitory.  Crowds are too much governed by unconscious considerations,
and too much subject in consequence to secular hereditary influences not
to be extremely conservative.  Abandoned to themselves, they soon weary
of disorder, and instinctively turn to servitude.  It was the proudest
and most untractable of the Jacobins who acclaimed Bonaparte with

<pb n="42"/>

greatest energy when he suppressed all liberty and made his hand of
iron severely felt.
</p><p>It is difficult to understand history, and popular revolutions in
particular, if one does not take sufficiently into account the
profoundly conservative instincts of crowds.  They may be desirous, it
is true, of changing the names of their institutions, and to obtain
these changes they accomplish at times even violent revolutions, but the
essence of these institutions is too much the expression of the
hereditary needs of the race for them not invariably to abide by it.
Their incessant mobility only exerts its influence on quite superficial
matters.  In fact they possess conservative instincts as indestructible
as those of all primitive beings.  Their fetish like respect for all
traditions is absolute; their unconscious horror of all novelty capable
of changing the essential conditions of their existence is very deeply
rooted.  Had democracies possessed the power they wield to-day at the
time of the invention of mechanical looms or of the introduction of
steam-power and of railways, the realisation of these inventions would
have been impossible, or would have been achieved at the cost of
revolutions and repeated massacres.  It is fortunate for the progress of
civilisation that the power of crowds only began to exist when the great
discoveries of science and industry had already been effected.

&sect; 5. THE MORALITY OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Taking the word "morality" to mean constant respect for certain
social conventions, and the permanent repression of selfish impulses, it
is quite evident that crowds are too impulsive and too mobile to be
moral.  If, however, we include in the term morality the transitory
display of certain qualities such as abnegation, self-sacrifice,
disinterestedness, devotion, and the need of equity, we may say, on the
contrary, that crowds may exhibit at times a very lofty morality.
</p><p>The few psychologists who have studied crowds have only considered
them from the point of view of their criminal acts, and noticing how
frequent these acts are, they have come to the conclusion that the moral
standard of crowds is very low.
</p><p>Doubtless this is often the case; but why?  Simply because our
savage, destructive instincts are the inheritance left dormant in all of
us from the primitive ages.  In the life of the isolated individual it
would be dangerous for him to gratify these instincts, while his
absorption in an irresponsible crowd, in which in consequence he is
assured of impunity, gives him entire liberty to follow them.  Being
unable, in the ordinary course of events, to exercise these destructive
instincts on our fellow-men, we confine ourselves to exercising them on
animals.  The passion, so widespread, for the chase and the acts of
ferocity

<pb n="44"/>

of crowds proceed from one and the same source.  A crowd
which slowly slaughters a defenceless victim displays a very cowardly
ferocity; but for the philosopher this ferocity is very closely related
to that of the huntsmen who gather in dozens for the pleasure of taking
part in the pursuit and killing of a luckless stag by their hounds.
</p><p>A crowd may be guilty of murder, incendiarism, and every kind of
crime, but it is also capable of very lofty acts of devotion, sacrifice,
and disinterestedness, of acts much loftier indeed than those of which
the isolated individual is capable.  Appeals to sentiments of glory,
honour, and patriotism are particularly likely to influence the
individual forming part of a crowd, and often to the extent of obtaining
from him the sacrifice of his life.  History is rich in examples
analogous to those furnished by the Crusaders and the volunteers of
1793.  Collectivities alone are capable of great disinterestedness and
great devotion.  How numerous are the crowds that have heroically faced
death for beliefs, ideas, and phrases that they scarcely understood!
The crowds that go on strike do so far more in obedience to an order
than to obtain an increase of the slender salary with which they make
shift.  Personal interest is very rarely a powerful motive force with
crowds, while it is almost the exclusive motive of the conduct of the
isolated individual.  It is assuredly

<pb n="45"/>

not self-interest that has
guided crowds in so many wars, incomprehensible as a rule to their
intelligence &mdash; wars in which they have allowed themselves to be massacred
as easily as the larks hypnotised by the mirror of the hunter.
</p><p>Even in the case of absolute scoundrels it often happens that the
mere fact of their being in a crowd endows them for the moment with very
strict principles of morality.  Taine calls attention to the fact that
the perpetrators of the September massacres deposited on the table of
the committees the pocket-books and jewels they had found on their
victims, and with which they could easily have been able to make away.
The howling, swarming, ragged crowd which invaded the Tuileries during
the revolution of 1848 did not lay hands on any of the objects that
excited its astonishment, and one of which would have meant bread for
many days.
</p><p>This moralisation of the individual by the crowd is not certainly a
constant rule, but it is a rule frequently observed.  It is even
observed in circumstances much less grave than those I have just cited.
I have remarked that in the theatre a crowd exacts from the hero of the
piece exaggerated virtues, and it is a commonplace observation that an
assembly, even though composed of inferior elements, shows itself as a
rule very prudish.  The debauchee, the <hi rend="italic">souteneur</hi>, the

<pb n="46"/>

rough
often break out into murmurs at a slightly risky scene or expression,
though they be very harmless in comparison with their customary
conversation.
</p><p>If, then, crowds often abandon themselves to low instincts, they
also set the example at times of acts of lofty morality.  If
disinterestedness, resignation, and absolute devotion to a real or
chimerical ideal are moral virtues, it may be said that crowds often
possess these virtues to a degree rarely attained by the wisest
philosophers.  Doubtless they practice them unconsciously, but that is
of small import.  We should not complain too much that crowds are more
especially guided by unconscious considerations and are not given to
reasoning.  Had they, in certain cases, reasoned and consulted their
immediate interests, it is possible that no civilisation would have
grown up on our planet and humanity would have had no history.

&sect; 1. THE IDEAS OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>WHEN studying in a preceding work the part played by ideas in the
evolution of nations, we showed that every civilisation is the outcome
of a small number of fundamental ideas that are very

<pb n="48"/>

rarely
renewed.  We showed how these ideas are implanted in the minds of
crowds, with what difficulty the process is effected, and the power
possessed by the ideas in question when once it has been accomplished.
Finally we saw that great historical perturbations are the result, as a
rule, of changes in these fundamental ideas.
</p><p>Having treated this subject at sufficient length, I shall not
return to it now, but shall confine myself to saying a few words on the
subject of such ideas as are accessible to crowds, and of the forms
under which they conceive them.
</p><p>They may be divided into two classes.  In one we shall place
accidental and passing ideas created by the influences of the moment:
infatuation for an individual or a doctrine, for instance.  In the other
will be classed the fundamental ideas, to which the environment, the
laws of heredity and public opinion give a very great stability; such
ideas are the religious beliefs of the past and the social and
democratic ideas of to-day.
</p><p>These fundamental ideas resemble the volume of the water of a
stream slowly pursuing its course; the transitory ideas are like the
small waves, for ever changing, which agitate its surface, and are more
visible than the progress of the stream itself although without real
importance.
</p><p>At the present day the great fundamental ideas which were the
mainstay of our fathers are

<pb n="49"/>

tottering more and more.  They have lost
all solidity, and at the same time the institutions resting upon them
are severely shaken.  Every day there are formed a great many of those
transitory minor ideas of which I have just been speaking; but very few
of them to all appearance seem endowed with vitality and destined to
acquire a preponderating influence.
</p><p>Whatever be the ideas suggested to crowds they can only exercise
effective influence on condition that they assume a very absolute, uncompromising,
and simple shape.  They present themselves then in the
guise of images, and are only accessible to the masses under this form.
These imagelike ideas are not connected by any logical bond of analogy
or succession, and may take each other's place like the slides of a
magic-lantern which the operator withdraws from the groove in which they
were placed one above the other.  This explains how it is that the most
contradictory ideas may be seen to be simultaneously current in crowds.
According to the chances of the moment, a crowd will come under the
influence of one of the various ideas stored up in its understanding,
and is capable, in consequence, of committing the most dissimilar acts.
Its complete lack of the critical spirit does not allow of its perceiving
these contradictions.
</p><p>This phenomenon is not peculiar to crowds.  It

<pb n="50"/>

is to be
observed in many isolated individuals, not only among primitive beings,
but in the case of all those &mdash; the fervent sectaries of a religious
faith, for instance &mdash; who by one side or another of their intelligence
are akin to primitive beings.  I have observed its presence to a curious
extent in the case of educated Hindoos brought up at our European
universities and having taken their degree.  A number of Western ideas
had been superposed on their unchangeable and fundamental hereditary or
social ideas.  According to the chances of the moment, the one or the
other set of ideas showed themselves each with their special
accompaniment of acts or utterances, the same individual presenting in
this way the most flagrant contradictions.  These contradictions are
more apparent than real, for it is only hereditary ideas that have
sufficient influence over the isolated individual to become motives of
conduct.  It is only when, as the result of the intermingling of
different races, a man is placed between different hereditary tendencies
that his acts from one moment to another may be really entirely
contradictory.  It would be useless to insist here on these phenomena,
although their psychological importance is capital.  I am of opinion
that at least ten years of travel and observation would be necessary to
arrive at a comprehension of them.

<pb n="51"/>

</p><p>Ideas being only accessible to crowds after having assumed a very
simple shape must often undergo the most thoroughgoing transformations
to become popular.  It is especially when we are dealing with somewhat
lofty philosophic or scientific ideas that we see how far-reaching are
the modifications they require in order to lower them to the level of
the intelligence of crowds.  These modifications are dependent on the
nature of the crowds, or of the race to which the crowds belong, but
their tendency is always belittling and in the direction of
simplification.  This explains the fact that, from the social point of
view, there is in reality scarcely any such thing as a hierarchy of
ideas &mdash; that is to say, as ideas of greater or less elevation.  However
great or true an idea may have been to begin with, it is deprived of
almost all that which constituted its elevation and its greatness by the
mere fact that it has come within the intellectual range of crowds and
exerts an influence upon them.
</p><p>Moreover, from the social point of view the hierarchical value of
an idea, its intrinsic worth, is without importance.  The necessary
point to consider is the effects it produces.  The Christian ideas of
the Middle Ages, the democratic ideas of the last century, or the social
ideas of to-day are assuredly not very elevated.  Philosophically considered,
they can only be regarded as somewhat

<pb n="52"/>

sorry errors, and yet
their power has been and will be immense, and they will count for a long
time to come among the most essential factors that determine the conduct
of States.
</p><p>Even when an idea has undergone the transformations which render it
accessible to crowds, it only exerts influence when, by various
processes which we shall examine elsewhere, it has entered the domain of
the unconscious, when indeed it has become a sentiment, for which much
time is required.
</p><p>For it must not be supposed that merely because the justness of an
idea has been proved it can be productive of effective action even on
cultivated minds.  This fact may be quickly appreciated by noting how
slight is the influence of the clearest demonstration on the majority of
men.  Evidence, if it be very plain, may be accepted by an educated
person, but the convert will be quickly brought back by his unconscious
self to his original conceptions.  See him again after the lapse of a
few days and he will put forward afresh his old arguments in exactly the
same terms.  He is in reality under the influence of anterior ideas,
that have become sentiments, and it is such ideas alone that influence
the more recondite motives of our acts and utterances.  It cannot be
otherwise in the case of crowds.
</p><p>When by various processes an idea has ended

<pb n="53"/>

by penetrating into
the minds of crowds, it possesses an irresistible power, and brings
about a series of effects, opposition to which is bootless.  The
philosophical ideas which resulted in the French Revolution took nearly
a century to implant themselves in the mind of the crowd.  Their
irresistible force, when once they had taken root, is known.  The
striving of an entire nation towards the conquest of social equality,
and the realisation of abstract rights and ideal liberties, caused the
tottering of all thrones and profoundly disturbed the Western world.
During twenty years the nations were engaged in internecine conflict,
and Europe witnessed hecatombs that would have terrified Ghengis Khan
and Tamerlane.  The world had never seen on such a scale what may result
from the promulgation of an idea.
</p><p>A long time is necessary for ideas to establish themselves in the
minds of crowds, but just as long a time is needed for them to be
eradicated.  For this reason crowds, as far as ideas are concerned, are
always several generations behind learned men and philosophers.  All
statesmen are well aware to-day of the admixture of error contained in
the fundamental ideas I referred to a short while back, but as the
influence of these ideas is still very powerful they are obliged to
govern in accordance with principles in the truth of which they have
ceased to believe.

<div3 type="section" n="1.3.2" id="d19">
<head>
&sect; 2. THE REASONING POWER OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>It cannot absolutely be said that crowds do not reason and are not
to be influenced by reasoning.
</p><p>However, the arguments they employ and those which are capable of
influencing them are, from a logical point of view, of such an inferior
kind that it is only by way of analogy that they can be described as
reasoning.
</p><p>The inferior reasoning of crowds is based, just as is reasoning of
a high order, on the association of ideas, but between the ideas
associated by crowds there are only apparent bonds of analogy or succession.
The mode of reasoning of crowds resembles that of the
Esquimaux who, knowing from experience that ice, a transparent body,
melts in the mouth, concludes that glass, also a transparent body,
should also melt in the mouth; or that of the savage who imagines that
by eating the heart of a courageous foe he acquires his bravery; or of
the workman who, having been exploited by one employer of labour,
immediately concludes that all employers exploit their men.
</p><p>The characteristics of the reasoning of crowds are the association
of dissimilar things possessing a merely apparent connection between
each other, and the immediate generalisation of particular cases.  It is
arguments of this kind that are always presented to crowds by those who
know how to manage them.  They are the only arguments

<pb n="55"/>

by which
crowds are to be influenced.  A chain of logical argumentation is
totally incomprehensible to crowds, and for this reason it is
permissible to say that they do not reason or that they reason falsely
and are not to be influenced by reasoning.  Astonishment is felt at
times on reading certain speeches at their weakness, and yet they had an
enormous influence on the crowds which listened to them, but it is
forgotten that they were intended to persuade collectivities and not to
be read by philosophers.  An orator in intimate communication with a
crowd can evoke images by which it will be seduced.  If he is successful
his object has been attained, and twenty volumes of harangues &mdash; always
the outcome of reflection &mdash; are not worth the few phrases which appealed
to the brains it was required to convince.
</p><p>It would be superfluous to add that the powerlessness of crowds to
reason aright prevents them displaying any trace of the critical spirit,
prevents them, that is, from being capable of discerning truth from
error, or of forming a precise judgment on any matter.  Judgments
accepted by crowds are merely judgments forced upon them and never
judgments adopted after discussion.  In regard to this matter the
individuals who do not rise above the level of a crowd are numerous.
The ease with which certain opinions obtain general acceptance results
more especially from the impossibility

<pb n="56"/>

experienced by the majority
of men of forming an opinion peculiar to themselves and based on
reasoning of their own.
</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="1.3.3" id="d20">
<head>
&sect; 3. THE IMAGINATION OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Just as is the case with respect to persons in whom the reasoning
power is absent, the figurative imagination of crowds is very powerful,
very active and very susceptible of being keenly impressed.  The images
evoked in their mind by a personage, an event, an accident, are almost
as lifelike as the reality.  Crowds are to some extent in the position
of the sleeper whose reason, suspended for the time being, allows the
arousing in his mind of images of extreme intensity which would quickly
be dissipated could they be submitted to the action of reflection.
Crowds, being incapable both of reflection and of reasoning, are devoid
of the notion of improbability; and it is to be noted that in a general
way it is the most improbable things that are the most striking.
</p><p>This is why it happens that it is always the marvellous and
legendary side of events that more specially strike crowds.  When a
civilisation is analysed it is seen that, in reality, it is the marvellous
and the legendary that are its true supports.  Appearances have
always played a much more important part than reality in history, where
the unreal is always of greater moment than the real.

<pb n="57"/>

</p><p>Crowds being only capable of thinking in images are only to be
impressed by images.  It is only images that terrify or attract them and
become motives of action.
</p><p>For this reason theatrical representations, in which the image is
shown in its most clearly visible shape, always have an enormous
influence on crowds.  Bread and spectacular shows constituted for the
plebeians of ancient Rome the ideal of happiness, and they asked for
nothing more.  Throughout the successive ages this ideal has scarcely
varied.  Nothing has a greater effect on the imagination of crowds of
every category than theatrical representations.  The entire audience
experiences at the same time the same emotions, and if these emotions
are not at once transformed into acts, it is because the most
unconscious spectator cannot ignore that he is the victim of illusions,
and that he has laughed or wept over imaginary adventures.  Sometimes,
however, the sentiments suggested by the images are so strong that they
tend, like habitual suggestions, to transform themselves into acts.  The
story has often been told of the manager of a popular theatre who, in
consequence of his only playing sombre dramas, was obliged to have the
actor who took the part of the traitor protected on his leaving the
theatre, to defend him against the violence of the spectators, indignant
at the crimes, imaginary

<pb n="58"/>

though they were, which the traitor had
committed.  We have here, in my opinion, one of the most remarkable
indications of the mental state of crowds, and especially of the
facility with which they are suggestioned.  The unreal has almost as
much influence on them as the real.  They have an evident tendency not
to distinguish between the two.
</p><p>The power of conquerors and the strength of States is based on the
popular imagination.  It is more particularly by working upon this
imagination that crowds are led.  All great historical facts, the rise
of Buddhism, of Christianity, of Islamism, the Reformation, the French
Revolution, and, in our own time, the threatening invasion of Socialism
are the direct or indirect consequences of strong impressions produced
on the imagination of the crowd.
</p><p>Moreover, all the great statesmen of every age and every country,
including the most absolute despots, have regarded the popular
imagination as the basis of their power, and they have never attempted
to govern in opposition to it "It was by becoming a Catholic," said
Napoleon to the Council of State, "that I terminated the Vend&eacute;en war.
By becoming a Mussulman that I obtained a footing in Egypt.  By becoming
an Ultramontane that I won over the Italian priests, and had I to govern
a nation of Jews I would rebuild Solomon's

<pb n="59"/>

temple."  Never perhaps
since Alexander and C&aelig;sar has any great man better understood how the
imagination of the crowd should be impressed.  His constant
preoccupation was to strike it.  He bore it in mind in his victories, in
his harangues, in his speeches, in all his acts.  On his deathbed it was
still in his thoughts.
</p><p>How is the imagination of crowds to be impressed?  We shall soon
see.  Let us confine ourselves for the moment to saying that the feat is
never to be achieved by attempting to work upon the intelligence or
reasoning faculty, that is to say, by way of demonstration.  It was not
by means of cunning rhetoric that Antony succeeded in making the
populace rise against the murderers of C&aelig;sar; it was by reading his
will to the multitude and pointing to his corpse.
</p><p>Whatever strikes the imagination of crowds presents itself under
the shape of a startling and very clear image, freed from all accessory
explanation, or merely having as accompaniment a few marvellous or
mysterious facts: examples in point are a great victory, a great
miracle, a great crime, or a great hope.  Things must be laid before the
crowd as a whole, and their genesis must never be indicated.  A hundred
petty crimes or petty accidents will not strike the imagination of
crowds in the least, whereas a single great crime or a single great
accident will profoundly impress them, even though the

<pb n="60"/>

results be
infinitely less disastrous than those of the hundred small accidents put
together.  The epidemic of influenza, which caused the death but a few
years ago of five thousand persons in Paris alone, made very little
impression on the popular imagination.  The reason was that this
veritable hecatomb was not embodied in any visible image, but was only
learnt from statistical information furnished weekly.  An accident which
should have caused the death of only five hundred instead of five
thousand persons, but on the same day and in public, as the outcome of
an accident appealing strongly to the eye, by the fall, for instance, of
the Eiffel Tower, would have produced, on the contrary, an immense
impression on the imagination of the crowd.  The probable loss of a
transatlantic steamer that was supposed, in the absence of news, to have
gone down in mid-ocean profoundly impressed the imagination of the crowd
for a whole week.  Yet official statistics show that 850 sailing vessels
and 203 steamers were lost in the year 1894 alone.  The crowd, however,
was never for a moment concerned by these successive losses, much more
important though they were as far as regards the destruction of life and
property, than the loss of the Atlantic liner in question could possibly
have been.
</p><p>It is not, then, the facts in themselves that strike the popular
imagination, but the way in which

<pb n="61"/>

they take place and are brought
under notice.  It is necessary that by their condensation, if I may thus
express myself, they should produce a startling image which fills and
besets the mind.  To know the art of impressing the imagination of
crowds is to know at the same time the art of governing them.

CHAPTER IV.<lb/>

<hi rend="italic">A RELIGIOUS SHAPE ASSUMED BY ALL THE<lb/>
CONVICTIONS OF CROWDS.</hi><lb/>
</head>

<p>What is meant by the religious sentiment &mdash; It is independent of the
worship of a divinity &mdash; Its characteristics &mdash; The strength of convictions
assuming a religious shape &mdash; Various examples &mdash; Popular gods have never
disappeared &mdash; New forms under which they are revived &mdash; Religious forms of
atheism &mdash; Importance of these notions from the historical point of view &mdash;
The Reformation, Saint Bartholomew, the Terror, and all analogous events
are the result of the religious sentiments of crowds and not of the will
of isolated individuals.

</p><p>WE have shown that crowds do not reason, that they accept or reject
ideas as a whole, that they tolerate neither discussion nor
contradiction, and that the suggestions brought to bear on them invade
the entire field of their understanding and tend at once to transform
themselves into acts.  We have shown that crowds suitably influenced are
ready to sacrifice themselves for the ideal with which they have been
inspired.  We have also seen that they only entertain violent and
extreme sentiments,

<pb n="63"/>

that in their case sympathy quickly becomes
adoration, and antipathy almost as soon as it is aroused is transformed
into hatred.  These general indications furnish us already with a presentiment
of the nature of the convictions of crowds.
</p><p>When these convictions are closely examined, whether at epochs
marked by fervent religious faith, or by great political upheavals such
as those of the last century, it is apparent that they always assume a
peculiar form which I cannot better define than by giving it the name of
a religious sentiment.
</p><p>This sentiment has very simple characteristics, such as worship of
a being supposed superior, fear of the power with which the being is
credited, blind submission to its commands, inability to discuss its
dogmas, the desire to spread them, and a tendency to consider as enemies
all by whom they are not accepted.  Whether such a sentiment apply to an
invisible God, to a wooden or stone idol, to a hero or to a political
conception, provided that it presents the preceding characteristics, its
essence always remains religious.  The supernatural and the miraculous
are found to be present to the same extent.  Crowds unconsciously accord
a mysterious power to the political formula or the victorious leader
that for the moment arouses their enthusiasm.

<pb n="64"/>

</p><p>A person is not religious solely when he worships a divinity, but
when he puts all the resources of his mind, the complete submission of
his will, and the whole-souled ardour of fanaticism at the service of a
cause or an individual who becomes the goal and guide of his thoughts
and actions.
</p><p>Intolerance and fanaticism are the necessary accompaniments of the
religious sentiment.  They are inevitably displayed by those who believe
themselves in the possession of the secret of earthly or eternal
happiness.  These two characteristics are to be found in all men grouped
together when they are inspired by a conviction of any kind.  The
Jacobins of the Reign of Terror were at bottom as religious as the
Catholics of the Inquisition, and their cruel ardour proceeded from the
same source.
</p><p>The convictions of crowds assume those characteristics of blind
submission, fierce intolerance, and the need of violent propaganda which
are inherent in the religious sentiment, and it is for this reason that
it may be said that all their beliefs have a religious form.  The hero
acclaimed by a crowd is a veritable god for that crowd.  Napoleon was
such a god for fifteen years, and a divinity never had more fervent
worshippers or sent men to their death with greater ease.  The Christian
and Pagan Gods never exercised a more absolute empire over the minds
that had fallen under their sway.

<pb n="65"/>

</p><p>All founders of religious or political creeds have established them
solely because they were successful in inspiring crowds with those
fanatical sentiments which have as result that men find their happiness
in worship and obedience and are ready to lay down their lives for their
idol.  This has been the case at all epochs.  Fustel de Coulanges, in
his excellent work on Roman Gaul, justly remarks that the Roman Empire
was in no wise maintained by force, but by the religious admiration it
inspired.  "It would be without a parallel in the history of the world,"
he observes rightly, "that a form of government held in popular detestation
should have lasted for five centuries. . . .  It would be
inexplicable that the thirty legions of the Empire should have
constrained a hundred million men to obedience."  The reason of their
obedience was that the Emperor, who personified the greatness of Rome,
was worshipped like a divinity by unanimous consent.  There were altars
in honour of the Emperor in the smallest townships of his realm.  "From
one end of the Empire to the other a new religion was seen to arise in
those days which had for its divinities the emperors themselves.  Some
years before the Christian era the whole of Gaul, represented by sixty
cities, built in common a temple near the town of Lyons in honour of
Augustus. . . .  Its priests, elected by the united Gallic cities, were
the principal personages

<pb n="66"/>

in their country. . . .  It is impossible
to attribute all this to fear and servility.  Whole nations are not
servile, and especially for three centuries.  It was not the courtiers
who worshipped the prince, it was Rome, and it was not Rome merely, but
it was Gaul, it was Spain, it was Greece and Asia."
</p><p>To-day the majority of the great men who have swayed men's minds no
longer have altars, but they have statues, or their portraits are in the
hands of their admirers, and the cult of which they are the object is
not notably different from that accorded to their predecessors.  An
understanding of the philosophy of history is only to be got by a
thorough appreciation of this fundamental point of the psychology of
crowds.  The crowd demands a god before everything else.
</p><p>It must not be supposed that these are the superstitions of a
bygone age which reason has definitely banished.  Sentiment has never
been vanquished in its eternal conflict with reason.  Crowds will hear
no more of the words divinity and religion, in whose name they were so
long enslaved; but they have never possessed so many fetishes as in the
last hundred years, and the old divinities have never had so many
statues and altars raised in their honour.  Those who in recent years
have studied the popular movement known under the name of Boulangism
have been able to see with what ease

<pb n="67"/>

the religious instincts of
crowds are ready to revive.  There was not a country inn that did not
possess the hero's portrait.  He was credited with the power of
remedying all injustices and all evils, and thousands of men would have
given their lives for him.  Great might have been his place in history
had his character been at all on a level with his legendary reputation.
</p><p>It is thus a very useless commonplace to assert that a religion is
necessary for the masses, because all political, divine, and social
creeds only take root among them on the condition of always assuming the
religious shape &mdash; a shape which obviates the danger of discussion.  Were
it possible to induce the masses to adopt atheism, this belief would exhibit
all the intolerant ardour of a religious sentiment, and in its
exterior forms would soon become a cult.  The evolution of the small
Positivist sect furnishes us a curious proof in point.  What happened to
the Nihilist whose story is related by that profound thinker
Dosto&iuml;ewsky has quickly happened to the Positivists.  Illumined one
day by the light of reason he broke the images of divinities and saints
that adorned the altar of a chapel, extinguished the candles, and,
without losing a moment, replaced the destroyed objects by the works of
atheistic philosophers such as B&uuml;chner and Moleschott, after which he
piously relighted the candles.  The object of his religious beliefs had

<pb n="68"/>

been transformed, but can it be truthfully said that his religious
sentiments had changed?
</p><p>Certain historical events &mdash; and they are precisely the most
important &mdash; I again repeat, are not to be understood unless one has
attained to an appreciation of the religious form which the convictions
of crowds always assume in the long run.  There are social phenomena
that need to be studied far more from the point of view of the
psychologist than from that of the naturalist.  The great historian
Taine has only studied the Revolution as a naturalist, and on this
account the real genesis of events has often escaped him.  He has
perfectly observed the facts, but from want of having studied the
psychology of crowds he has not always been able to trace their causes.
The facts having appalled him by their bloodthirsty, anarchic, and
ferocious side, he has scarcely seen in the heroes of the great drama
anything more than a horde of epileptic savages abandoning themselves
without restraint to their instincts.  The violence of the Revolution,
its massacres, its need of propaganda, its declarations of war upon all
things, are only to be properly explained by reflecting that the
Revolution was merely the establishment of a new religious belief in the
mind of the masses.  The Reformation, the massacre of Saint Bartholomew,
the French religious wars, the Inquisition, the Reign of Terror are
phenomena of an identical kind, brought about by

<pb n="69"/>

crowds animated by
those religious sentiments which necessarily lead those imbued with them
to pitilessly extirpate by fire and sword whoever is opposed to the
establishment of the new faith.  The methods of the Inquisition are
those of all whose convictions are genuine and sturdy.  Their
convictions would not deserve these epithets did they resort to other
methods.
</p><p>Upheavals analogous to those I have just cited are only possible
when it is the soul of the masses that brings them about.  The most
absolute despots could not cause them.  When historians tell us that the
massacre of Saint Bartholomew was the work of a king, they show
themselves as ignorant of the psychology of crowds as of that of
sovereigns.  Manifestations of this order can only proceed from the soul
of crowds.  The most absolute power of the most despotic monarch can
scarcely do more than hasten or retard the moment of their apparition.
The massacre of Saint Bartholomew or the religious wars were no more the
work of kings than the Reign of Terror was the work of Robespierre,
Danton, or Saint Just.  At the bottom of such events is always to be
found the working of the soul of the masses, and never the power of
potentates.

</p><p>HAVING studied the mental constitution of crowds and become acquainted
with their modes of feeling, thinking, and reasoning, we shall now
proceed to examine how their opinions and beliefs arise and become
established.
</p><p>The factors which determine these opinions and beliefs are of two
kinds: remote factors and immediate factors.
</p><p>The remote factors are those which render crowds capable of
adopting certain convictions and absolutely refractory to the acceptance
of others.  These factors prepare the ground in which are suddenly seen
to germinate certain new ideas whose force and consequences are a cause
of astonishment, though they are only spontaneous in appearance.  The
outburst and putting in practice of certain ideas among crowds present
at times a startling suddenness.  This is only a superficial effect,
behind which must be sought a preliminary and preparatory action of long
duration.
</p><p>The immediate factors are those which, coming on the top of this
long, preparatory working, in whose absence they would remain without
effect, serve as the source of active persuasion on crowds; that is,
they are the factors which cause the idea to take

<pb n="72"/>

shape and set it
loose with all its consequences.  The resolutions by which
collectivities are suddenly carried away arise out of these immediate
factors; it is due to them that a riot breaks out or a strike is decided
upon, and to them that enormous majorities invest one man with power to
overthrow a government.
</p><p>The successive action of these two kinds of factors is to be traced
in all great historical events.  The French Revolution &mdash; to cite but one
of the most striking of such events &mdash; had among its remote factors the
writings of the philosophers, the exactions of the nobility, and the
progress of scientific thought.  The mind of the masses, thus prepared,
was then easily roused by such immediate factors as the speeches of
orators, and the resistance of the court party to insignificant reforms.
</p><p>Among the remote factors there are some of a general nature, which
are found to underlie all the beliefs and opinions of crowds.  They are
race, traditions, time, institutions, and education.
</p><p>We now proceed to study the influence of these different factors.
</p>
<div3 type="section" n="2.1.1" id="d24">
<head>
&sect; 1. RACE.<lb/>
</head>

<p>This factor, race, must be placed in the first rank, for in itself
it far surpasses in importance all the others.  We have sufficiently
studied it in another work; it is therefore needless to deal with it
again.

<pb n="73"/>

We showed, in a previous volume, what an historical race is,
and how, its character once formed, it possesses, as the result of the
laws of heredity such power that its beliefs, institutions, and arts &mdash; in
a word, all the elements of its civilisation &mdash; are merely the outward
expression of its genius.  We showed that the power of the race is such
that no element can pass from one people to another without undergoing
the most profound transformations.<note><p>[7]</p></note>

</p><p>[7]</p><note><p>The novelty of this proposition being still considerable and
history being quite unintelligible without it, I devoted four chapters
to its demonstration in my last book ("The Psychological Laws of the
Evolution of Peoples").  From it the reader will see that, in spite of
fallacious appearances, neither language, religion, arts, or, in a word,
any element of civilisation, can pass, intact, from one people to
another. </p></note>

<p>Environment, circumstances, and events represent the social
suggestions of the moment.  They may have a considerable influence, but
this influence is always momentary if it be contrary to the suggestions
of the race; that is, to those which are inherited by a nation from the
entire series of its ancestors.
</p><p>We shall have occasion in several of the chapters of this work to
touch again upon racial influence, and to show that this influence is so
great that it dominates the characteristics peculiar to the genius of
crowds.  It follows from this fact that the crowds of different
countries offer very considerable differences of beliefs and conduct and
are not to be influenced in the same manner.
</p>
</div3>

<pb n="74"/>

<div3 type="section" n="2.1.2" id="d25">
<head>
&sect; 2. TRADITIONS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Traditions represent the ideas, the needs, and the sentiments of
the past.  They are the synthesis of the race, and weigh upon us with
immense force.
</p><p>The biological sciences have been transformed since embryology has
shown the immense influence of the past on the evolution of living
beings; and the historical sciences will not undergo a less change when
this conception has become more widespread.  As yet it is not
sufficiently general, and many statesmen are still no further advanced
than the theorists of the last century, who believed that a society
could break off with its past and be entirely recast on lines suggested
solely by the light of reason.
</p><p>A people is an organism created by the past, and, like every other
organism, it can only be modified by slow hereditary accumulations.
</p><p>It is tradition that guides men, and more especially so when they
are in a crowd.  The changes they can effect in their traditions with
any ease, merely bear, as I have often repeated, upon names and outward
forms.
</p><p>This circumstance is not to be regretted.  Neither a national
genius nor civilisation would be possible without traditions.  In
consequence man's two great concerns since he has existed have been to
create a network of traditions which he afterwards endeavours to destroy
when their beneficial effects

<pb n="75"/>

have worn themselves out.
Civilisation is impossible without traditions, and progress impossible
without the destruction of those traditions.  The difficulty, and it is
an immense difficulty, is to find a proper equilibrium between stability
and variability.  Should a people allow its customs to become too firmly
rooted, it can no longer change, and becomes, like China, incapable of
improvement.  Violent revolutions are in this case of no avail; for what
happens is that either the broken fragments of the chain are pieced together
again and the past resumes its empire without change, or the
fragments remain apart and decadence soon succeeds anarchy.
</p><p>The ideal for a people is in consequence to preserve the
institutions of the past, merely changing them insensibly and little by
little.  This ideal is difficult to realise.  The Romans in ancient and
the English in modern times are almost alone in having realised it.
</p><p>It is precisely crowds that cling the most tenaciously to
traditional ideas and oppose their being changed with the most
obstinacy.  This is notably the case with the category of crowds
constituting castes.  I have already insisted upon the conservative
spirit of crowds, and shown that the most violent rebellions merely end
in a changing of words and terms.  At the end of the last century, in
the presence of destroyed churches, of priests

<pb n="76"/>

expelled the country
or guillotined, it might have been thought that the old religious ideas
had lost all their strength, and yet a few years had barely lapsed
before the abolished system of public worship had to be re-established
in deference to universal demands.<note><p>[8]</p></note>

</p><p>[8]</p><note><p>The report of the ex-Conventionist, Fourcroy, quoted by Taine,
is very clear on this point. </p><p>"What is everywhere seen with respect
to the keeping of Sunday and
attendance at the churches proves that the majority of Frenchmen desire
to return to their old usages and that it is no longer opportune to
resist this natural tendency. . . .  The great majority of men stand in
need of religion, public worship, and priests.  <hi rend="italic">It is an error of
some modern philosophers, by which I myself have been led away</hi>, to
believe in the possibility of instruction being so general as to destroy
religious prejudices, which for a great number of unfortunate persons
are a source of consolation. . . .  The mass of the people, then, must
be allowed its priests, its altars, and its public worship." </p></note>

<p>Blotted out for a moment, the old traditions had resumed their sway.
</p><p>No example could better display the power of tradition on the mind
of crowds.  The most redoubtable idols do not dwell in temples, nor the
most despotic tyrants in palaces; both the one and the other can be
broken in an instant.  But the invisible masters that reign in our
innermost selves are safe from every effort at revolt, and only yield to
the slow wearing away of centuries.

<div3 type="section" n="2.1.3" id="d26">
<head>
&sect; 3. TIME.<lb/>
</head>

<p>In social as in biological problems time is one of the most
energetic factors.  It is the sole real creator and the sole great
destroyer.  It is time that has made mountains with grains of sand and
raised the obscure cell of geological eras to human dignity.  The action
of centuries is sufficient to transform any given phenomenon.  It has
been justly observed that an ant with enough time at its disposal could
level Mount Blanc.  A being possessed of the magical force of varying
time at his will would have the power attributed by believers to God.
</p><p>In this place, however, we have only to concern ourselves with the
influence of time on the genesis of the opinions of crowds.  Its action
from this point of view is still immense.  Dependent upon it are the
great forces such as race, which cannot form themselves without it.  It
causes the birth, the growth, and the death of all beliefs.  It is by
the aid of time that they acquire their strength and also by its aid
that they lose it.
</p><p>It is time in particular that prepares the opinions and beliefs of
crowds, or at least the soil on which they will germinate.  This is why
certain ideas are realisable at one epoch and not at another.  It is
time that accumulates that immense detritus of beliefs and thoughts on
which the ideas of a given period spring up.  They do not grow at hazard

<pb n="78"/>

and by chance; the roots of each of them strike down into a long
past.  When they blossom it is time that has prepared their blooming;
and to arrive at a notion of their genesis it is always back in the past
that it is necessary to search.  They are the daughters of the past and
the mothers of the future, but throughout the slaves of time.
</p><p>Time, in consequence, is our veritable master, and it suffices to
leave it free to act to see all things transformed.  At the present day
we are very uneasy with regard to the threatening aspirations of the
masses and the destructions and upheavals foreboded thereby.  Time,
without other aid, will see to the restoration of equilibrium.  "No form
of government," M. Lavisse very properly writes, "was founded in a day.
Political and social organisations are works that demand centuries.  The
feudal system existed for centuries in a shapeless, chaotic state before
it found its laws; absolute monarchy also existed for centuries before
arriving at regular methods of government, and these periods of
expectancy were extremely troubled."

<head>
&sect; 4. POLITICAL AND SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>The idea that institutions can remedy the defects of societies,
that national progress is the consequence of the improvement of
institutions and governments, and that social changes can be effected by
decrees &mdash; this idea, I say, is still gene

<pb n="79"/>

rally accepted.  It was the
starting-point of the French Revolution, and the social theories of the
present day are based upon it.
</p><p>The most continuous experience has been unsuccessful in shaking
this grave delusion.  Philosophers and historians have endeavoured in
vain to prove its absurdity, but yet they have had no difficulty in
demonstrating that institutions are the outcome of ideas, sentiments,
and customs, and that ideas, sentiments, and customs are not to be
recast by recasting legislative codes.  A nation does not choose its
institutions at will any more than it chooses the colour of its hair or
its eyes.  Institutions and governments are the product of the race.
They are not the creators of an epoch, but are created by it.  Peoples
are not governed in accordance with their caprices of the moment, but as
their character determines that they shall be governed.  Centuries are
required to form a political system and centuries needed to change it.
Institutions have no intrinsic virtue: in themselves they are neither
good nor bad.  Those which are good at a given moment for a given people
may be harmful in the extreme for another nation.
</p><p>Moreover, it is in no way in the power of a people to really change
its institutions.  Undoubtedly, at the cost of violent revolutions, it
can change their name, but in their essence they remain unmodified.  The
names are mere futile labels with

<pb n="80"/>

which an historian who goes to the
bottom of things need scarcely concern himself.  It is in this way, for
instance, that England,<note><p>[9]</p></note> the most democratic country in the world,
lives, nevertheless, under a monarchical <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>, whereas the
countries in which the most oppressive despotism is rampant are the
Spanish-American Republics, in spite of their republican constitutions.
The destinies of peoples are determined by their character and not by
their government.  I have endeavoured to establish this view in my
previous volume by setting forth categorical examples.

</p><p>[9]</p><note><p>The most advanced republicans, even of the United States,
recognise this fact.  The American magazine, <hi rend="italic">The Forum</hi>, recently
gave categorical expression to the opinion in terms which I reproduce
here from the <hi rend="italic">Review of Reviews</hi> for December, 1894: &mdash;
</p><p>"It should never be forgotten, even by the most ardent enemies of
an aristocracy, that England is to-day the most democratic country of
the universe, the country in which the rights of the individual are most
respected, and in which the individual possesses the most liberty." </p></note>

<p>To lose time in the manufacture of cut-and-dried constitutions is,
in consequence, a puerile task, the useless labour of an ignorant
rhetorician.  Necessity and time undertake the charge of elaborating
constitutions when we are wise enough to allow these two factors to act.
This is the plan the Anglo-Saxons have adopted, as their great
historian, Macaulay, teaches us in a passage that the politicians of all
Latin countries ought to learn by

<pb n="81"/>

heart.  After having shown all the
good that can be accomplished by laws which appear from the point of
view of pure reason a chaos of absurdities and contradictions, he
compares the scores of constitutions that have been engulphed in the
convulsions of the Latin peoples with that of England, and points out
that the latter has only been very slowly changed part by part, under
the influence of immediate necessities and never of speculative
reasoning.

</p><p>"To think nothing of symmetry and much of convenience; never to
remove an anomaly merely because it is an anomaly; never to innovate
except when some grievance is felt; never to innovate except so far as
to get rid of the grievance; never to lay down any proposition of wider
extent than the particular case for which it is necessary to provide;
these are the rules which have, from the age of John to the age of
Victoria, generally guided the deliberations of our two hundred and
fifty Parliaments."

</p><p>It would be necessary to take one by one the laws and institutions
of each people to show to what extent they are the expression of the
needs of each race and are incapable, for that reason, of being
violently transformed.  It is possible, for, instance, to indulge in
philosophical dissertations on the advantages and disadvantages of
centralisation;

<pb n="82"/>

but when we see a people composed of very different
races devote a thousand years of efforts to attaining to this
centralisation; when we observe that a great revolution, having for
object the destruction of all the institutions of the past, has been
forced to respect this centralisation, and has even strengthened it;
under these circumstances we should admit that it is the outcome of
imperious needs, that it is a condition of the existence of the nation
in question, and we should pity the poor mental range of politicians who
talk of destroying it.  Could they by chance succeed in this attempt,
their success would at once be the signal for a frightful civil war,<note><p>[10]</p></note>
which, moreover, would immediately bring back a new system of centralisation
much more oppressive than the old.

</p><p>[10]</p>

<note><p>If a comparison be made between the profound religious and
political dissensions which separate the various parties in France, and
are more especially the result of social questions, and the separatist
tendencies which were manifested at the time of the Revolution, and
began to again display themselves towards the close of the Franco-German
war, it will be seen that the different races represented in France are
still far from being completely blended.  The vigorous centralisation of
the Revolution and the creation of artificial departments destined to
bring about the fusion of the ancient provinces was certainly its most
useful work.  Were it possible to bring about the decentralisation which
is to-day preoccupying minds lacking in foresight, the achievement would
promptly have for consequence the most sanguinary disorders.  To
overlook this fact is to leave out of account the entire history of
France. </p></note>

<pb n="83"/>

<p>The conclusion to be drawn from what precedes is, that it is not in
institutions that the means is to be sought of profoundly influencing
the genius of the masses.  When we see certain countries, such as the
United States, reach a high degree of prosperity under democratic
institutions, while others, such as the Spanish-American Republics, are
found existing in a pitiable state of anarchy under absolutely similar
institutions, we should admit that these institutions are as foreign to
the greatness of the one as to the decadence of the others.  Peoples are
governed by their character, and all institutions which are not
intimately modelled on that character merely represent a borrowed
garment, a transitory disguise.  No doubt sanguinary wars and violent
revolutions have been undertaken, and will continue to be undertaken, to
impose institutions to which is attributed, as to the relics of saints,
the supernatural power of creating welfare.  It may be said, then, in
one sense, that institutions react on the mind of the crowd inasmuch as
they engender such upheavals.  But in reality it is not the institutions
that react in this manner, since we know that, whether triumphant or
vanquished, they possess in themselves no virtue.  It is illusions and
words that have influenced the mind of the crowd, and especially words &mdash;
words which are as powerful as they are chimerical, and whose
astonishing sway we shall shortly demonstrate.

&sect; 5. INSTRUCTION AND EDUCATION.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Foremost among the dominant ideas of the present epoch is to be
found the notion that instruction is capable of considerably changing
men, and has for its unfailing consequence to improve them and even to
make them equal.  By the mere fact of its being constantly repeated,
this assertion has ended by becoming one of the most steadfast
democratic dogmas.  It would be as difficult now to attack it as it
would have been formerly to have attacked the dogmas of the Church.
</p><p>On this point, however, as on many others, democratic ideas are in
profound disagreement with the results of psychology and experience.
Many eminent philosophers, among them Herbert Spencer, have had no
difficulty in showing that instruction neither renders a man more moral
nor happier, that it changes neither his instincts nor his hereditary
passions, and that at times &mdash; for this to happen it need only be badly
directed &mdash; it is much more pernicious than useful.  Statisticians have
brought confirmation of these views by telling us that criminality
increases with the generalisation of instruction, or at any rate of a
certain kind of instruction, and that the worst enemies of society, the
anarchists, are recruited among the prize-winners of schools; while in a
recent work a distinguished magistrate, M. Adolphe Guillot, made

<pb n="85"/>

the
observation that at present 3,000 educated criminals are met with for
every 1,000 illiterate delinquents, and that in fifty years the criminal
percentage of the population has passed from 227 to 552 for every
100,000 inhabitants, an increase of 133 per cent.  He has also noted in
common with his colleagues that criminality is particularly on the
increase among young persons, for whom, as is known, gratuitous and
obligatory schooling has &mdash; in France &mdash; replaced apprenticeship.
</p><p>It is not assuredly &mdash; and nobody has ever maintained this
proposition &mdash; that well-directed instruction may not give very useful
practical results, if not in the sense of raising the standard of
morality, at least in that of developing professional capacity.
Unfortunately the Latin peoples, especially in the last tweny-five
years, have based their systems of instruction on very erroneous
principles, and in spite of the observations of the most eminent minds,
such as Br&eacute;al, Fustel de Coulanges, Taine, and many others, they
persist in their lamentable mistakes.  I have myself shown, in a work
published some time ago, that the French system of education transforms
the majority of those who have undergone it into enemies of society, and
recruits numerous disciples for the worst forms of socialism.
</p><p>The primary danger of this system of education &mdash; very properly
qualified as Latin &mdash; consists in the

<pb n="86"/>

fact that it is based on the
fundamental psychological error that the intelligence is developed by
the learning by heart of text-books.  Adopting this view, the endeavour
has been made to enforce a knowledge of as many hand-books as possible.
From the primary school till he leaves the university a young man does
nothing but acquire books by heart without his judgment or personal
initiative being ever called into play.  Education consists for him in
reciting by heart and obeying.
</p><p>"Learning lessons, knowing by heart a grammar or a compendium,
repeating well and imitating well &mdash; that," writes a former Minister of
Public Instruction, M. Jules Simon, "is a ludicrous form of education
whose every effort is an act of faith tacitly admitting the
infallibility of the master, and whose only results are a belittling of
ourselves and a rendering of us impotent."
</p><p>Were this education merely useless, one might confine one's self to
expressing compassion for the unhappy children who, instead of making
needful studies at the primary school, are instructed in the genealogy
of the sons of Clotaire, the conflicts between Neustria and Austrasia,
or zoological classifications.  But the system presents a far more
serious danger.  It gives those who have been submitted to it a violent
dislike to the state of life in which they were born, and an intense

<pb n="87"/>

desire to escape from it.  The working man no longer wishes to
remain a working man, or the peasant to continue a peasant, while the
most humble members of the middle classes admit of no possible career
for their sons except that of State-paid functionaries.  Instead of
preparing men for life French schools solely prepare them to occupy
public functions, in which success can be attained without any necessity
for self-direction or the exhibition of the least glimmer of personal
initiative.  At the bottom of the social ladder the system creates an
army of proletarians discontented with their lot and always ready to
revolt, while at the summit it brings into being a frivolous
bourgeoisie, at once sceptical and credulous, having a superstitious
confidence in the State, whom it regards as a sort of Providence, but
without forgetting to display towards it a ceaseless hostility, always
laying its own faults to the door of the Government, and incapable of
the least enterprise without the intervention of the authorities.
</p><p>The State, which manufactures by dint of textbooks all these
persons possessing diplomas, can only utilise a small number of them,
and is forced to leave the others without employment.  It is obliged in
consequence to resign itself to feeding the first mentioned and to
having the others as its enemies.  From the top to the bottom of the
social pyramid, from the humblest clerk to the

<pb n="88"/>

professor and the
prefect, the immense mass of persons boasting diplomas besiege the
professions.  While a business man has the greatest difficulty in
finding an agent to represent him in the colonies, thousands of
candidates solicit the most modest official posts.  There are 20,000
schoolmasters and mistresses without employment in the department of the
Seine alone, all of them persons who, disdaining the fields or the workshops,
look to the State for their livelihood.  The number of the chosen
being restricted, that of the discontented is perforce immense.  The
latter are ready for any revolution, whoever be its chiefs and whatever
the goal they aim at.  The acquisition of knowledge for which no use can
be found is a sure method of driving a man to revolt.<note><p>[11]</p></note>

</p><p>[11]</p><note><p>This phenomenon, moreover, is not peculiar to the Latin
peoples.  It is also to be observed in China, which is also a country in
the hands of a solid hierarchy of mandarins or functionaries, and where
a function is obtained, as in France, by competitive examination, in
which the only test is the imperturbable recitation of bulky manuals.
The army of educated persons without employment is considered in China
at the present day as a veritable national calamity.  It is the same in
India where, since the English have opened schools, not for educating
purposes, as is the case in England itself, but simply to furnish the
indigenous inhabitants with instruction, there has been formed a special
class of educated persons, the Baboos, who, when they do not obtain
employment, become the irreconcilable enemies of the English rule.  In
the case of all the Baboos, whether provided with employment or not, the
first effect of their instruction has been to lower their standard of
morality.  This is a fact on which I have insisted at length in my book,
"The Civilisations of India" &mdash; a fact, too, which has been observed by
all authors who have visited the great peninsula. </p></note>

<p>It is evidently too late to retrace our steps.  Experience alone,
that supreme educator of peoples, will be at pains to show us our
mistake.  It alone will be powerful enough to prove the necessity of
replacing our odious text-books and our pitiable examinations by
industrial instruction capable of inducing our young men to return to
the fields, to the workshop, and to the colonial enterprise which they
avoid to-day at all costs.
</p><p>The professional instruction which all enlightened minds are now
demanding was the instruction received in the past by our forefathers.
It is still in vigour at the present day among the nations who rule the
world by their force of will, their initiative, and their spirit of
enterprise.  In a series of remarkable pages, whose principal passages I
reproduce further on, a great thinker, M. Taine, has clearly shown that
our former system of education was approximately that in vogue to-day in
England and America, and in a remarkable parallel between the Latin and
Anglo-Saxon systems he has plainly pointed out the consequences of the
two methods.
</p><p>One might consent, perhaps, at a pinch, to

<pb n="90"/>

continue to accept
all the disadvantages of our classical education, although it produced
nothing but discontented men, and men unfitted for their station in
life, did the superficial acquisition of so much knowledge, the
faultless repeating by heart of so many text-books, raise the level of
intelligence.  But does it really raise this level?  Alas, no!  The
conditions of success in life are the possession of judgment,
experience, initiative, and character &mdash; qualities which are not bestowed
by books.  Books are dictionaries, which it is useful to consult, but of
which it is perfectly useless to have lengthy portions in one's head.
</p><p>How is it possible for professional instruction to develop the
intelligence in a measure quite beyond the reach of classical
instruction?  This has been well shown by M. Taine.

</p><p>"Ideas, he says, are only formed in their natural and normal
surroundings; the promotion of the growth is effected by the innumerable
impressions appealing to the senses which a young man receives daily in
the workshop, the mine, the law court, the study, the builder's yard,
the hospital; at the sight of tools, materials, and operations; in the
presence of customers, workers, and labour, of work well or ill done,
costly or lucrative.  In such a way are obtained those trifling
perceptions of detail of the eyes, the ear,

<pb n="91"/>

the hands, and even the
sense of smell, which, picked up involuntarily, and silently elaborated,
take shape within the learner, and suggest to him sooner or, later this
or that new combination, simplification, economy, improvement, or invention.
The young Frenchman is deprived, and precisely at the age when
they are most fruitful, of all these precious contacts, of all these
indispensable elements of assimilation.  For seven or eight years on end
he is shut up in a school, and is cut off from that direct personal
experience which would give him a keen and exact notion of men and
things and of the various ways of handling them."

</p><p>" . . . At least nine out of ten have wasted their time and pains
during several years of their life &mdash; telling, important, even decisive
years.  Among such are to be counted, first of all, the half or two-thirds of those who present themselves for examination &mdash; I refer to those
who are rejected; and then among those who are successful, who obtain a
degree, a certificate, a diploma, there is still a half or two-thirds &mdash; I
refer to the overworked.  Too much has been demanded of them by exacting
that on a given day, on a chair or before a board, they should, for two
hours in succession, and with respect to a group of sciences, be living
repertories of all human know

<pb n="92"/>

ledge.  In point of fact they were
that, or nearly so, for two hours on that particular day, but a month
later they are so no longer.  They could not go through the examination
again.  Their too numerous and too burdensome acquisitions slip
incessantly from their mind, and are not replaced.  Their mental vigour
has declined, their fertile capacity for growth has dried up, the
fully-developed man appears, and he is often a used up man.  Settled
down, married, resigned to turning in a circle, and indefinitely in the
same circle, he shuts himself up in his confined function, which he
fulfils adequately, but nothing more.  Such is the average yield:
assuredly the receipts do not balance the expenditure.  In England or
America, where, as in France previous to 1789, the contrary proceeding
is adopted, the outcome obtained is equal or superior."

</p><p>The illustrious psychologist subsequently shows us the difference
between our system and that of the Anglo-Saxons.  The latter do not
possess our innumerable special schools.  With them instruction is not
based on book-learning, but on object lessons.  The engineer, for
example, is trained in a workshop, and never at a school; a method which
allows of each individual reaching the level his intelligence permits
of.  He becomes a workman or a foreman if he can get no further, an

<pb n="93"/>

engineer if his aptitudes take him as far.  This manner of
proceeding is much more democratic and of much greater benefit to
society than that of making the whole career of an individual depend on
an examination, lasting a few hours, and undergone at the age of
nineteen or twenty.

</p><p>"In the hospital, the mine, the factory, in the architect's or the
lawyer's office, the student, who makes a start while very young, goes
through his apprenticeship, stage by stage, much as does with us a law
clerk in his office, or an artist in his studio.  Previously, and before
making a practical beginning, he has had an opportunity of following
some general and summary course of instruction, so as to have a
framework ready prepared in which to store the observations he is
shortly to make.  Furthermore he is able, as a rule, to avail himself of
sundry technical courses which he can follow in his leisure hours, so as
to co-ordinate step by step the daily experience he is gathering.  Under
such a system the practical capabilities increase and develop of
themselves in exact proportion to the faculties of the student, and in
the direction requisite for his future task and the special work for
which from now onwards he desires to fit himself.  By this means in
England or the United States a young man is quickly in a position to
develop his capacity to

<pb n="94"/>

the utmost.  At twenty-five years of age,
and much sooner if the material and the parts are there, he is not
merely a useful performer, he is capable also of spontaneous enterprise;
he is not only a part of a machine, but also a motor.  In France, where
the contrary system prevails &mdash; in France, which with each succeeding
generation is falling more and more into line with China &mdash; the sum total
of the wasted forces is enormous."

</p><p>The great philosopher arrives at the following conclusion with
respect to the growing incongruity between our Latin system of education
and the requirements of practical life: &mdash;

</p><p>"In the three stages of instruction, those of childhood,
adolescence and youth, the theoretical and pedagogic preparation by
books on the school benches has lengthened out and become overcharged in
view of the examination, the degree, the diploma, and the certificate,
and solely in this view, and by the worst methods, by the application of
an unnatural and anti-social <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>, by the excessive
postponement of the practical apprenticeship, by our boarding-school
system, by artificial training and mechanical cramming, by overwork,
without thought for the time that is to follow, for the adult age and
the functions of the man, without regard for the real world on

<pb n="95"/>

which
the young man will shortly be thrown, for the society in which we move
and to which he must be adapted or be taught to resign himself in
advance, for the struggle in which humanity is engaged, and in which to
defend himself and to keep his footing he ought previously to have been
equipped, armed, trained, and hardened.  This indispensable equipment,
this acquisition of more importance than any other, this sturdy common
sense and nerve and will-power our schools do not procure the young
Frenchman; on the contrary, far from qualifying him for his approaching
and definite state, they disqualify him.  In consequence, his entry into
the world and his first steps in the field of action are most often
merely a succession of painful falls, whose effect is that he long
remains wounded and bruised, and sometimes disabled for life.  The test
is severe and dangerous.  In the course of it the mental and moral
equilibrium is affected, and runs the risk of not being re-established.
Too sudden and complete disillusion has supervened.  The deceptions have
been too great, the disappointments too keen."<note><p>[12]</p></note>

</p><p>[12]</p><note><p>Taine, "Le Regime moderne," vol. ii., 1894.  These pages are
almost the last that Taine wrote.  They resume admirably the results of
the great philosopher's long experience.  Unfortunately they are in my
opinion totally incomprehensible for such of our university professors
who have not lived abroad.  Education is the only means at our disposal
of influencing to some extent the mind of a nation, and it is profoundly
saddening to have to think that there is scarcely any one in France who
can arrive at understanding that our present system of teaching is a
grave cause of rapid decadence, which instead of elevating our youth,
lowers and perverts it.  </p><p>A useful comparison may be made between Taine's pages and the
observations on American education recently made by M. Paul Bourget in
his excellent book, "Outre-Mer."  He, too, after having noted that our
education merely produces narrow-minded bourgeois, lacking in initiative
and will-power, or anarchists &mdash; "those two equally harmful types of the
civilised man, who degenerates into impotent platitude or insane
destructiveness" &mdash; he too, I say, draws a comparison that cannot be the
object of too much reflection between our French <hi rend="italic">lyc&eacute;es</hi>
(public schools), those factories of degeneration, and the American
schools, which prepare a man admirably for life.  The gulf existing
between truly democratic nations and those who have democracy in their
speeches, but in no wise in their thoughts, is clearly brought out in
this comparison. </p></note>

<p>Have we digressed in what precedes from the psychology of crowds?
Assuredly not.  If we desire to understand the ideas and beliefs that
are germinating to-day in the masses, and will spring up to-morrow, it
is necessary to know how the ground has been prepared.  The instruction
given the youth of a country allows of a knowledge of what that country
will one day be.  The education accorded the present generation
justifies the most gloomy previsions.  It is in part by instruction and
education that the mind of the masses is improved or deteriorated.  It
was necessary in consequence to show how this mind has been

<pb n="97"/>

fashioned by the system in vogue, and how the mass of the
indifferent and the neutral has become progressively an army of the
discontented ready to obey all the suggestions of utopians and rhetoricians.
It is in the schoolroom that socialists and anarchists are found
nowadays, and that the way is being paved for the approaching period of
decadence for the Latin peoples.

</p><p>WE have just investigated the remote and preparatory factors which give

a special receptivity, and make possible
therein the growth of certain sentiments and certain ideas.  It now
remains for us to study the factors capable of acting in a direct
manner.  We shall see in a forthcoming chapter how these factors should
be put in force in order that they may produce their full effect.
</p><p>In the first part of this work we studied the sentiments, ideas,
and methods of reasoning of collective bodies, and from the knowledge
thus acquired it would evidently be possible to deduce in a general way
the means of making an impression on their mind.  We already know what
strikes the imagination of crowds, and are acquainted with the power and
contagiousness of suggestions, of those especially that are presented
under the form of images.  However, as suggestions may proceed from very
different sources, the factors capable of acting on the minds of crowds
may differ considerably.  It is necessary, then, to study them separately.
This is not a useless study.  Crowds are somewhat like the
sphinx of ancient fable: it is necessary to arrive at a solution of the
problems offered by their psychology or to resign ourselves to being
devoured by them.
</p>
<div3 type="section" n="2.2.1" id="d30">
<head>
&sect; 1. IMAGES, WORDS, AND FORMULAS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>When studying the imagination of crowds we saw that it is
particularly open to the impressions

<pb n="100"/>

produced by images.  These
images do not always lie ready to hand, but it is possible to evoke them
by the judicious employment of words and formulas.  Handled with art,
they possess in sober truth the mysterious power formerly attributed to
them by the adepts of magic.  They cause the birth in the minds of
crowds of the most formidable tempests, which in turn they are capable
of stilling.  A pyramid far loftier than that of old Cheops could be
raised merely with the bones of men who have been victims of the power
of words and formulas.
</p><p>The power of words is bound up with the images they evoke, and is
quite independent of their real significance.  Words whose sense is the
most ill-defined are sometimes those that possess the most influence.
Such, for example, are the terms democracy, socialism, equality,
liberty, &amp;c., whose meaning is so vague that bulky volumes do not
suffice to precisely fix it.  Yet it is certain that a truly magical
power is attached to those short syllables, as if they contained the
solution of all problems.  They synthesise the most diverse unconscious
aspirations and the hope of their realisation.
</p><p>Reason and arguments are incapable of combatting certain words and
formulas.  They are uttered with solemnity in the presence of crowds,
and as soon as they have been pronounced an

<pb n="101"/>

expression of respect
is visible on every countenance, and all heads are bowed.  By many they
are considered as natural forces, as supernatural powers.  They evoke
grandiose and vague images in men's minds, but this very vagueness that
wraps them in obscurity augments their mysterious power.  They are the
mysterious divinities hidden behind the tabernacle, which the devout
only approach in fear and trembling.
</p><p>The images evoked by words being independent of their sense, they
vary from age to age and from people to people, the formulas remaining
identical.  Certain transitory images are attached to certain words: the
word is merely as it were the button of an electric bell that calls them
up.
</p><p>All words and all formulas do not possess the power of evoking
images, while there are some which have once had this power, but lose it
in the course of use, and cease to waken any response in the mind.  They
then become vain sounds, whose principal utility is to relieve the
person who employs them of the obligation of thinking.  Armed with a
small stock of formulas and commonplaces learnt while we are young, we
possess all that is needed to traverse life without the tiring necessity
of having to reflect on anything whatever.
</p><p>If any particular language be studied, it is seen that the words of
which it is composed change

<pb n="102"/>

rather slowly in the course of ages,
while the images these words evoke or the meaning attached to them
changes ceaselessly.  This is the reason why, in another work, I have
arrived at the conclusion that the absolute translation of a language,
especially of a dead language, is totally impossible.  What do we do in
reality when we substitute a French for a Latin, Greek, or Sanscrit
expression, or even when we endeavour to understand a book written in
our own tongue two or three centuries back?  We merely put the images
and ideas with which modern life has endowed our intelligence in the
place of absolutely distinct notions and images which ancient life had
brought into being in the mind of races submitted to conditions of
existence having no analogy with our own.  When the men of the
Revolution imagined they were copying the Greeks and Romans, what were
they doing except giving to ancient words a sense the latter had never
had?  What resemblance can possibly exist between the institutions of
the Greeks and those designated to-day by corresponding words?  A
republic at that epoch was an essentially aristocratic institution,
formed of a reunion of petty despots ruling over a crowd of slaves kept
in the most absolute subjection.  These communal aristocracies, based on
slavery, could not have existed for a moment without it.
</p><p>The word "liberty," again, what signification could

<pb n="103"/>

it have in
any way resembling that we attribute to it to-day at a period when the
possibility of the liberty of thought was not even suspected, and when
there was no greater and more exceptional crime than that of discussing
the gods, the laws and the customs of the city?  What did such a word as
"fatherland" signify to an Athenian or Spartan unless it were the cult
of Athens or Sparta, and in no wise that of Greece, composed of rival
cities always at war with each other?  What meaning had the same word
"fatherland" among the ancient Gauls, divided into rival tribes and
races, and possessing different languages and religions, and who were
easily vanquished by Caesar because he always found allies among them?
It was Rome that made a country of Gaul by endowing it with political
and religious unity.  Without going back so far, scarcely two centuries
ago, is it to be believed that this same notion of a fatherland was
conceived to have the same meaning as at present by French princes like
the great Cond&eacute;, who allied themselves with the foreigner against
their sovereign?  And yet again, the same word had it not a sense very
different from the modern for the French royalist emigrants, who thought
they obeyed the laws of honour in fighting against France, and who from
their point of view did indeed obey them, since the feudal law bound the
vassal to the lord and not to the soil, so that

<pb n="104"/>

where the sovereign
was there was the true fatherland?
</p><p>Numerous are the words whose meaning has thus profoundly changed
from age to age &mdash; words which we can only arrive at understanding in the
sense in which they were formerly understood after a long effort.  It
has been said with truth that much study is necessary merely to arrive
at conceiving what was signified to our great grandfathers by such words
as the "king" and the "royal family."  What, then, is likely to be the
case with terms still more complex?
</p><p>Words, then, have only mobile and transitory significations which
change from age to age and people to people; and when we desire to exert
an influence by their means on the crowd what it is requisite to know is
the meaning given them by the crowd at a given moment, and not the
meaning which they formerly had or may yet have for individuals of a
different mental constitution.
</p><p>Thus, when crowds have come, as the result of political upheavals
or changes of belief, to acquire a profound antipathy for the images
evoked by certain words, the first duty of the true statesman is to
change the words without, of course, laying hands on the things
themselves, the latter being too intimately bound up with the inherited
constitution to be transformed.  The judicious Tocqueville

<pb n="105"/>

long ago
made the remark that the work of the consulate and the empire consisted
more particularly in the clothing with new words of the greater part of
the institutions of the past &mdash; that is to say, in replacing words evoking
disagreeable images in the imagination of the crowd by other words of
which the novelty prevented such evocations.  The "taille" or tallage
has become the land tax; the "gabelle," the tax on salt; the "aids," the
indirect contributions and the consolidated duties; the tax on trade
companies and guilds, the license, &amp;c.
</p><p>One of the most essential functions of statesmen consists, then, in
baptizing with popular or, at any rate, indifferent words things the
crowd cannot endure under their old names.  The power of words is so
great that it suffices to designate in well-chosen terms the most odious
things to make them acceptable to crowds.  Taine justly observes that it
was by invoking liberty and fraternity &mdash; words very popular at the time &mdash;
that the Jacobins were able "to install a despotism worthy of Dahomey, a
tribunal similar to that of the Inquisition, and to accomplish human
hecatombs akin to those of ancient Mexico."  The art of those who
govern, as is the case with the art of advocates, consists above all in
the science of employing words.  One of the greatest difficulties of
this art is, that in one and the same society the

<pb n="106"/>

same words most
often have very different meanings for the different social classes, who
employ in appearance the same words, but never speak the same language.
</p><p>In the preceding examples it is especially time that has been made
to intervene as the principal factor in the changing of the meaning of
words.  If, however, we also make race intervene, we shall then see
that, at the same period, among peoples equally civilised but of
different race, the same words very often correspond to extremely dissimilar
ideas.  It is impossible to understand these differences without
having travelled much, and for this reason I shall not insist upon them.
I shall confine myself to observing that it is precisely the words most
often employed by the masses which among different peoples possess the
most different meanings.  Such is the case, for instance, with the words
"democracy" and "socialism" in such frequent use nowadays.
</p><p>In reality they correspond to quite contrary ideas and images in
the Latin and Anglo-Saxon mind.  For the Latin peoples the word "democracy"
signifies more especially the subordination of the will and the
initiative of the individual to the will and the initiative of the
community represented by the State.  It is the State that is charged, to
a greater and greater degree, with the direction of everything, the
centralisation, the

<pb n="107"/>

monopolisation, and the manufacture of everything.
To the State it is that all parties without exception, radicals,
socialists, or monarchists, constantly appeal.  Among the Anglo-Saxons
and notably in America this same word "democracy" signifies, on the
contrary, the intense development of the will of the individual, and as
complete a subordination as possible of the State, which, with the
exception of the police, the army, and diplomatic relations, is not
allowed the direction of anything, not even of public instruction.  It
is seen, then, that the same word which signifies for one people the
subordination of the will and the initiative of the individual and the
preponderance of the State, signifies for another the excessive
development of the will and the initiative of the individual and the
complete subordination of the State.<note><p>[13]</p></note>

</p><p>[13]</p><note><p>In my book, "The Psychological Laws of the Evolution of
Peoples," I have insisted at length on the differences which distinguish
the Latin democratic ideal from the Anglo-Saxon democratic ideal.
Independently, and as the result of his travels, M. Paul Bourget has
arrived, in his quite recent book, "Outre-Mer," at conclusions almost
identical with mine. </p></note>

&sect; 2. ILLUSIONS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>From the dawn of civilisation onwards crowds have always undergone
the influence of illusions.  It is to the creators of illusions that
they have raised more temples, statues, and altars than to

<pb n="108"/>

any
other class of men.  Whether it be the religious illusions of the past
or the philosophic and social illusions of the present, these formidable
sovereign powers are always found at the head of all the civilisations
that have successively flourished on our planet.  It is in their name
that were built the temples of Chaldea and Egypt and the religious
edifices of the Middle Ages, and that a vast upheaval shook the whole of
Europe a century ago, and there is not one of our political, artistic,
or social conceptions that is free from their powerful impress.
Occasionally, at the cost of terrible disturbances, man overthrows them,
but he seems condemned to always set them up again.  Without them he
would never have emerged from his primitive barbarian state, and without
them again he would soon return to it.  Doubtless they are futile
shadows; but these children of our dreams have forced the nations to
create whatever the arts may boast of splendour or civilisation of
greatness.
</p><p>"If one destroyed in museums and libraries, if one hurled down on
the flagstones before the churches all the works and all the monuments
of art that religions have inspired, what would remain of the great
dreams of humanity?  To give to men that portion of hope and illusion
without which they cannot live, such is the reason for the existence of
gods, heroes, and poets.  During fifty

<pb n="109"/>

years science appeared to
undertake this task.  But science has been compromised in hearts
hungering after the ideal, because it does not dare to be lavish enough
of promises, because it cannot lie."<note><p>[14]</p></note>

</p><p>[14]</p><note><p>Daniel Lesueur. </p></note>

<p>The philosophers of the last century devoted themselves with
fervour to the destruction of the religious, political, and social
illusions on which our forefathers had lived for a long tale of
centuries.  By destroying them they have dried up the springs of hope
and resignation.  Behind the immolated chimeras they came face to face
with the blind and silent forces of nature, which are inexorable to
weakness and ignore pity.
</p><p>Notwithstanding all its progress, philosophy has been unable as yet
to offer the masses any ideal that can charm them; but, as they must
have their illusions at all cost, they turn instinctively, as the insect
seeks the light, to the rhetoricians who accord them what they want.
Not truth, but error has always been the chief factor in the evolution
of nations, and the reason why socialism is so powerful to-day is that
it constitutes the last illusion that is still vital.  In spite of all
scientific demonstrations it continues on the increase.  Its principal
strength lies in the fact that it is championed by minds sufficiently
ignorant of things as they are in reality to venture boldly to promise

<pb n="110"/>

mankind happiness.  The social illusion reigns to-day upon all the
heaped-up ruins of the past, and to it belongs the future.  The masses
have never thirsted after truth.  They turn aside from evidence that is
not to their taste, preferring to deify error, if error seduce them.
Whoever can supply them with illusions is easily their master; whoever
attempts to destroy their illusions is always their victim.
</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="section" n="2.2.3" id="d32">
<head>
&sect; 3. EXPERIENCE.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Experience constitutes almost the only effective process by which a
truth may be solidly established in the mind of the masses, and
illusions grown too dangerous be destroyed.  To this end, however, it is
necessary that the experience should take place on a very large scale,
and be very frequently repeated.  The experiences undergone by one
generation are useless, as a rule, for the generation that follows,
which is the reason why historical facts, cited with a view to
demonstration, serve no purpose.  Their only utility is to prove to what
an extent experiences need to be repeated from age to age to exert any
influence, or to be successful in merely shaking an erroneous opinion
when it is solidly implanted in the mind of the masses.
</p><p>Our century and that which preceded it will doubtless be alluded to
by historians as an era

<pb n="111"/>

of curious experiments, which in no other
age have been tried in such number.
</p><p>The most gigantic of these experiments was the French Revolution.
To find out that a society is not to be refashioned from top to bottom
in accordance with the dictates of pure reason, it was necessary that
several millions of men should be massacred and that Europe should be
profoundly disturbed for a period of twenty years.  To prove to us
experimentally that dictators cost the nations who acclaim them dear,
two ruinous experiences have been required in fifty years, and in spite
of their clearness they do not seem to have been sufficiently
convincing.  The first, nevertheless, cost three millions of men and an
invasion, the second involved a loss of territory, and carried in its
wake the necessity for permanent armies.  A third was almost attempted
not long since, and will assuredly be attempted one day.  To bring an
entire nation to admit that the huge German army was not, as was
currently alleged thirty years ago, a sort of harmless national
guard,<note><p>[15]</p></note> the terrible war

<pb n="112"/>

which cost us so dear had to take
place.  To bring about the recognition that Protection ruins the nations
who adopt it, at least twenty years of disastrous experience will be
needful.  These examples might be indefinitely multiplied.

</p><p>[15]</p><note><p>The opinion of the crowd was formed in this case by those
rough-and-ready associations of dissimilar things, the mechanism of
which I have previously explained.  The French national guard of that
period, being composed of peaceable shopkeepers, utterly lacking in
discipline and quite incapable of being taken seriously, whatever bore a
similar name, evoked the same conception and was considered in
consequence as harmless.  The error of the crowd was shared at the time
by its leaders, as happens so often in connection with opinions dealing
with generalisations.  In a speech made in the Chamber on the 31st of
December, 1867, and quoted in a book by M. E. Ollivier that has appeared
recently, a statesman who often followed the opinion of the crowd but
was never in advance of it &mdash; I allude to M. Thiers &mdash; declared that Prussia
only possessed a national guard analogous to that of France, and in
consequence without importance, in addition to a regular army about
equal to the French regular army; assertions about as accurate as the
predictions of the same statesman as to the insignificant future
reserved for railways. </p></note>

&sect; 4. REASON.<lb/>
</head>

<p>In enumerating the factors capable of making an impression on the
minds of crowds all mention of reason might be dispensed with, were it
not necessary to point out the negative value of its influence.
</p><p>We have already shown that crowds are not to be influenced by
reasoning, and can only comprehend rough-and-ready associations of
ideas.  The orators who know how to make an impression upon them always
appeal in consequence to their sentiments and never to their reason.
The laws

<pb n="113"/>

of logic have no action on crowds.<note><p>[16]</p></note>  To bring home
conviction to crowds it is necessary first of all to thoroughly
comprehend the sentiments by which they are animated, to pretend to
share these sentiments, then to endeavour to modify them by calling up,
by means of rudimentary associations, certain eminently suggestive
notions, to be capable, if need be, of going back to the point of view
from which a start was made, and, above all, to

<pb n="114"/>

divine from instant
to instant the sentiments to which one's discourse is giving birth.
This necessity of ceaselessly varying one's language in accordance with
the effect produced at the moment of speaking deprives from the outset a
prepared and studied harangue of all efficaciousness.  In such a speech
the orator follows his own line of thought, not that of his hearers, and
from this fact alone his influence is annihilated.

</p><p>[16]</p><note><p>My first observations with regard to the art of impressing
crowds and touching the slight assistance to be derived in this
connection from the rules of logic date back to the seige of Paris, to
the day when I saw conducted to the Louvre, where the Government was
then sitting, Marshal V &mdash; , whom a furious crowd asserted they had
surprised in the act of taking the plans of the fortifications to sell
them to the Prussians.  A member of the Government (G. P &mdash; ), a very
celebrated orator, came out to harangue the crowd, which was demanding
the immediate execution of the prisoner.  I had expected that the
speaker would point out the absurdity of the accusation by remarking
that the accused Marshal was positively one of those who had constructed
the fortifications, the plan of which, moreover, was on sale at every
booksellers.  To my immense stupefaction &mdash; I was very young then &mdash; the
speech was on quite different lines.  "Justice shall be done," exclaimed
the orator, advancing towards the prisoner, "and pitiless justice.  Let
the Government of the National Defence conclude your inquiry.  In the
meantime we will keep the prisoner in custody."  At once calmed by this
apparent concession, the crowd broke up, and a quarter of an hour later
the Marshal was able to return home.  He would infallibly have been torn
in pieces had the speaker treated the infuriated crowd to the logical
arguments that my extreme youth induced me to consider as very
convincing. </p></note>

<p>Logical minds, accustomed to be convinced by a chain of somewhat
close reasoning, cannot avoid having recourse to this mode of persuasion
when addressing crowds, and the inability of their arguments always
surprises them.  "The usual mathematical consequences based on the
syllogism &mdash; that is, on associations of identities &mdash; are imperative . . ."
writes a logician.  "This imperativeness would enforce the assent even
of an inorganic mass were it capable of following associations of
identities."  This is doubtless true, but a crowd is no more capable
than an inorganic mass of following such associations, nor even of
understanding them.  If the attempt be made to convince by reasoning
primitive minds &mdash; savages or children, for instance &mdash; the slight value
possessed by this method of arguing will be understood.
</p><p>It is not even necessary to descend so low as primitive beings to
obtain an insight into the utter powerlessness of reasoning when it has
to fight

<pb n="115"/>

against sentiment.  Let us merely call to mind how
tenacious, for centuries long, have been religious superstitions in
contradiction with the simplest logic.  For nearly two thousand years
the most luminous geniuses have bowed before their laws, and modern
times have to be reached for their veracity to be merely contested.  The
Middle Ages and the Renaissance possessed many enlightened men, but not
a single man who attained by reasoning to an appreciation of the
childish side of his superstitions, or who promulgated even a slight
doubt as to the misdeeds of the devil or the necessity of burning
sorcerers.
</p><p>Should it be regretted that crowds are never guided by reason?  We
would not venture to affirm it.  Without a doubt human reason would not
have availed to spur humanity along the path of civilisation with the
ardour and hardihood its illusions have done.  These illusions, the
offspring of those unconscious forces by which we are led, were
doubtless necessary.  Every race carries in its mental constitution the
laws of its destiny, and it is, perhaps, these laws that it obeys with a
resistless impulse, even in the case of those of its impulses which
apparently are the most unreasoned.  It seems at times as if nations
were submitted to secret forces analogous to those which compel the
acorn to transform itself into an oak or a comet to follow its orbit.

<pb n="116"/>

</p><p>What little insight we can get into these forces must be sought for
in the general course of the evolution of a people, and not in the
isolated facts from which this evolution appears at times to proceed.
Were these facts alone to be taken into consideration, history would
seem to be the result of a series of improbable chances.  It was
improbable that a Galilean carpenter should become for two thousand
years an all-powerful God in whose name the most important civilisations
were founded; improbable, too, that a few bands of Arabs, emerging from
their deserts, should conquer the greater part of the old Graco-Roman
world, and establish an empire greater than that of Alexander;
improbable, again, that in Europe, at an advanced period of its development,
and when authority throughout it had been systematically
hierarchised, an obscure lieutenant of artillery should have succeeded
in reigning over a multitude of peoples and kings.
</p><p>Let us leave reason, then, to philosophers, and not insist too
strongly on its intervention in the governing of men.  It is not by
reason, but most often in spite of it, that are created those sentiments
that are the mainsprings of all civilisation &mdash; sentiments such as honour,
self-sacrifice, religious faith, patriotism, and the love of glory.

&sect; 1. THE LEADERS OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>As soon as a certain number of living beings are gathered together,
whether they be animals or men, they place themselves instinctively
under the authority of a chief.
</p><p>In the case of human crowds the chief is often nothing more than a
ringleader or agitator, but as such he plays a considerable part.  His
will is the nucleus around which the opinions of the crowd are grouped
and attain to identity.  He constitutes the first element towards the
organisation of heterogeneous crowds, and paves the way for their
organisation in sects; in the meantime he directs them.  A crowd is a
servile flock that is incapable of ever doing without a master.
</p><p>The leader has most often started as one of the led.  He has
himself been hypnotised by the idea, whose apostle he has since become.
It has taken possession of him to such a degree that everything outside
it vanishes, and that every contrary opinion appears to him an error or
a superstition.  An example in point is Robespierre, hypnotised by the
philosophical ideas of Rousseau, and employing the methods of the
Inquisition to propagate them.
</p><p>The leaders we speak of are more frequently men of action than
thinkers.  They are not gifted with keen foresight, nor could they be,
as this quality generally conduces to doubt and inactivity.

<pb n="119"/>

They
are especially recruited from the ranks of those morbidly nervous,
excitable, half-deranged persons who are bordering on madness.  However
absurd may be the idea they uphold or the goal they pursue, their
convictions are so strong that all reasoning is lost upon them.
Contempt and persecution do not affect them, or only serve to excite
them the more.  They sacrifice their personal interest, their family &mdash;
everything.  The very instinct of self-preservation is entirely obliterated
in them, and so much so that often the only recompense they
solicit is that of martyrdom.  The intensity of their faith gives great
power of suggestion to their words.  The multitude is always ready to
listen to the strong-willed man, who knows how to impose himself upon
it.  Men gathered in a crowd lose all force of will, and turn
instinctively to the person who possesses the quality they lack.
</p><p>Nations have never lacked leaders, but all of the latter have by no
means been animated by those strong convictions proper to apostles.
These leaders are often subtle rhetoricians, seeking only their own
personal interest, and endeavouring to persuade by flattering base
instincts.  The influence they can assert in this manner may be very
great, but it is always ephemeral.  The men of ardent convictions who
have stirred the soul of crowds, the Peter the Hermits, the Luthers, the
Savonarolas,

<pb n="120"/>

the men of the French Revolution, have only exercised
their fascination after having been themselves fascinated first of all
by a creed.  They are then able to call up in the souls of their fellows
that formidable force known as faith, which renders a man the absolute
slave of his dream.
</p><p>The arousing of faith &mdash; whether religious, political, or social,
whether faith in a work, in a person, or an idea &mdash; has always been the
function of the great leaders of crowds, and it is on this account that
their influence is always very great.  Of all the forces at the disposal
of humanity, faith has always been one of the most tremendous, and the
gospel rightly attributes to it the power of moving mountains.  To endow
a man with faith is to multiply his strength tenfold.  The great events
of history have been brought about by obscure believers, who have had
little beyond their faith in their favour.  It is not by the aid of the
learned or of philosophers, and still less of sceptics, that have been
built up the great religions which have swayed the world, or the vast
empires which have spread from one hemisphere to the other.
</p><p>In the cases just cited, however, we are dealing with great
leaders, and they are so few in number that history can easily reckon
them up.  They form the summit of a continuous series, which extends
from these powerful masters of men down to the workman who, in the smoky
atmosphere of

<pb n="121"/>

an inn, slowly fascinates his comrades by ceaselessly
drumming into their ears a few set phrases, whose purport he scarcely
comprehends, but the application of which, according to him, must surely
bring about the realisation of all dreams and of every hope.
</p><p>In every social sphere, from the highest to the lowest, as soon as
a man ceases to be isolated he speedily falls under the influence of a
leader.  The majority of men, especially among the masses, do not
possess clear and reasoned ideas on any subject whatever outside their
own speciality.  The leader serves them as guide.  It is just possible
that he may be replaced, though very inefficiently, by the periodical
publications which manufacture opinions for their readers and supply
them with ready-made phrases which dispense them of the trouble of
reasoning.
</p><p>The leaders of crowds wield a very despotic authority, and this
despotism indeed is a condition of their obtaining a following.  It has
often been remarked how easily they extort obedience, although without
any means of backing up their authority, from the most turbulent section
of the working classes.  They fix the hours of labour and the rate of
wages, and they decree strikes, which are begun and ended at the hour
they ordain.
</p><p>At the present day these leaders and agitators

<pb n="122"/>

tend more and
more to usurp the place of the public authorities in proportion as the
latter allow themselves to be called in question and shorn of their
strength.  The tyranny of these new masters has for result that the
crowds obey them much more docilely than they have obeyed any government.
If in consequence of some accident or other the leaders should be
removed from the scene the crowd returns to its original state of a
collectivity without cohesion or force of resistance.  During the last
strike of the Parisian omnibus employ&eacute;s the arrest of the two leaders
who were directing it was at once sufficient to bring it to an end.  It
is the need not of liberty but of servitude that is always predominant
in the soul of crowds.  They are so bent on obedience that they instinctively
submit to whoever declares himself their master.
</p><p>These ringleaders and agitators may be divided into two clearly
defined classes.  The one includes the men who are energetic and
possess, but only intermittently, much strength of will, the other the
men, far rarer than the preceding, whose strength of will is enduring.
The first mentioned are violent, brave, and audacious.  They are more
especially useful to direct a violent enterprise suddenly decided on, to
carry the masses with them in spite of danger, and to transform into
heroes the men who but yesterday were recruits.

<pb n="123"/>

Men of this kind
were Ney and Murat under the First Empire, and such a man in our own
time was Garibaldi, a talentless but energetic adventurer who succeeded
with a handful of men in laying hands on the ancient kingdom of Naples,
defended though it was by a disciplined army.
</p><p>Still, though the energy of leaders of this class is a force to be
reckoned with, it is transitory, and scarcely outlasts the exciting
cause that has brought it into play.  When they have returned to their
ordinary course of life the heroes animated by energy of this
description often evince, as was the case with those I have just cited,
the most astonishing weakness of character.  They seem incapable of
reflection and of conducting themselves under the simplest
circumstances, although they had been able to lead others.  These men
are leaders who cannot exercise their function except on the condition
that they be led themselves and continually stimulated, that they have
always as their beacon a man or an idea, that they follow a line of
conduct clearly traced.  The second category of leaders, that of men of
enduring strength of will, have, in spite of a less brilliant aspect, a
much more considerable influence.  In this category are to be found the
true founders of religions and great undertakings: St. Paul, Mahomet,
Christopher Columbus, and de Lesseps, for example.  Whether they be
intelligent

<pb n="124"/>

or narrow-minded is of no importance: the world belongs
to them.  The persistent will-force they possess is an immensely rare
and immensely powerful faculty to which everything yields.  What a
strong and continuous will is capable of is not always properly
appreciated.  Nothing resists it; neither nature, gods, nor man.
</p><p>The most recent example of what can be effected by a strong and
continuous will is afforded us by the illustrious man who separated the
Eastern and Western worlds, and accomplished a task that during three
thousand years had been attempted in vain by the greatest sovereigns.
He failed later in an identical enterprise, but then had intervened old
age, to which everything, even the will, succumbs.
</p><p>When it is desired to show what may be done by mere strength of
will, all that is necessary is to relate in detail the history of the
difficulties that had to be surmounted in connection with the cutting of
the Suez Canal.  An ocular witness, Dr. Cazalis, has summed up in a few
striking lines the entire story of this great work, recounted by its
immortal author.
</p><p>"From day to day, episode by episode, he told the stupendous story
of the canal.  He told of all he had had to vanquish, of the impossible
he had made possible, of all the opposition he encountered, of the
coalition against him, and the disappointments, the reverses, the
defeats which had been unavailing

<pb n="125"/>

to discourage or depress him.  He
recalled how England had combatted him, attacking him without cessation,
how Egypt and France had hesitated, how the French Consul had been
foremost in his opposition to the early stages of the work, and the
nature of the opposition he had met with, the attempt to force his
workmen to desert from thirst by refusing them fresh water; how the
Minister of Marine and the engineers, all responsible men of experienced
and scientific training, had naturally all been hostile, were all
certain on scientific grounds that disaster was at hand, had calculated
its coming, foretelling it for such a day and hour as an eclipse is
foretold."
</p><p>The book which relates the lives of all these great leaders would
not contain many names, but these names have been bound up with the most
important events in the history of civilisation.

&sect; 2. THE MEANS OF ACTION OF THE LEADERS:<lb/>
AFFIRMATION, REPETITION, CONTAGION.<lb/>
</head>

<p>When it is wanted to stir up a crowd for a short space of time, to
induce it to commit an act of any nature &mdash; to pillage a palace, or to die
in defence of a stronghold or a barricade, for instance &mdash; the crowd must
be acted upon by rapid suggestion, among which example is the most
powerful in its effect.  To attain this end, however, it is necessary
that the crowd should have been previously prepared by

<pb n="126"/>

certain
circumstances, and, above all, that he who wishes to work upon it should
possess the quality to be studied farther on, to which I give the name
of prestige.
</p><p>When, however, it is proposed to imbue the mind of a crowd with
ideas and beliefs &mdash; with modern social theories, for instance &mdash; the
leaders have recourse to different expedients.  The principal of them
are three in number and clearly defined &mdash; affirmation, repetition, and
contagion.  Their action is somewhat slow, but its effects, once
produced, are very lasting.
</p><p>Affirmation pure and simple, kept free of all reasoning and all
proof, is one of the surest means of making an idea enter the mind of
crowds.  The conciser an affirmation is, the more destitute of every
appearance of proof and demonstration, the more weight it carries.  The
religious books and the legal codes of all ages have always resorted to
simple affirmation.  Statesmen called upon to defend a political cause,
and commercial men pushing the sale of their products by means of
advertising are acquainted with the value of affirmation.
</p><p>Affirmation, however, has no real influence unless it be constantly
repeated, and so far as possible in the same terms.  It was Napoleon, I
believe, who said that there is only one figure in rhetoric of serious
importance, namely, repetition.  The thing

<pb n="127"/>

affirmed comes by
repetition to fix itself in the mind in such a way that it is accepted
in the end as a demonstrated truth.
</p><p>The influence of repetition on crowds is comprehensible when the
power is seen which it exercises on the most enlightened minds.  This
power is due to the fact that the repeated statement is embedded in the
long run in those profound regions of our unconscious selves in which
the motives of our actions are forged.  At the end of a certain time we
have forgotten who is the author of the repeated assertion, and we
finish by believing it.  To this circumstance is due the astonishing
power of advertisements.  When we have read a hundred, a thousand, times
that X's chocolate is the best, we imagine we have heard it said in many
quarters, and we end by acquiring the certitude that such is the fact.
When we have read a thousand times that Y's flour has cured the most
illustrious persons of the most obstinate maladies, we are tempted at
last to try it when suffering from an illness of a similar kind.  If we
always read in the same papers that A is an arrant scamp and B a most
honest man we finish by being convinced that this is the truth, unless,
indeed, we are given to reading another paper of the contrary opinion,
in which the two qualifications are reversed.  Affirmation and
repetition are alone powerful enough to combat each other.

<pb n="128"/>

</p><p>When an affirmation has been sufficiently repeated and there is
unanimity in this repetition &mdash; as has occurred in the case of certain
famous financial undertakings rich enough to purchase every assistance &mdash;
what is called a current of opinion is formed and the powerful mechanism
of contagion intervenes.  Ideas, sentiments, emotions, and beliefs
possess in crowds a contagious power as intense as that of microbes.
This phenomenon is very natural, since it is observed even in animals
when they are together in number.  Should a horse in a stable take to
biting his manger the other horses in the stable will imitate him.  A
panic that has seized on a few sheep will soon extend to the whole
flock.  In the case of men collected in a crowd all emotions are very
rapidly contagious, which explains the suddenness of panics.  Brain
disorders, like madness, are themselves contagious.  The frequency of
madness among doctors who are specialists for the mad is notorious.
Indeed, forms of madness have recently been cited &mdash; agoraphobia, for
instance &mdash; which are communicable from men to animals.
</p><p>For individuals to succumb to contagion their simultaneous presence
on the same spot is not indispensable.  The action of contagion may be
felt from a distance under the influence of events which give all minds
an individual trend and the characteristics peculiar to crowds.  This is
especially

<pb n="129"/>

the case when men's minds have been prepared to undergo
the influence in question by those remote factors of which I have made a
study above.  An example in point is the revolutionary movement of 1848,
which, after breaking out in Paris, spread rapidly over a great part of
Europe and shook a number of thrones.
</p><p>Imitation, to which so much influence is attributed in social
phenomena, is in reality a mere effect of contagion.  Having shown its
influence elsewhere, I shall confine myself to reproducing what I said
on the subject fifteen years ago.  My remarks have since been developed
by other writers in recent publications.
</p><p>"Man, like animals, has a natural tendency to imitation.  Imitation
is a necessity for him, provided always that the imitation is quite
easy.  It is this necessity that makes the influence of what is called
fashion so powerful.  Whether in the matter of opinions, ideas, literary
manifestations, or merely of dress, how many persons are bold enough to
run counter to the fashion?  It is by examples not by arguments that
crowds are guided.  At every period there exists a small number of individualities
which react upon the remainder and are imitated by the
unconscious mass.  It is needful however, that these individualities
should not be in too pronounced disagreement with received ideas.  Were
they so, to imitate them would be too difficult

<pb n="130"/>

and their influence
would be nil.  For this very reason men who are too superior to their
epoch are generally without influence upon it.  The line of separation
is too strongly marked.  For the same reason too Europeans, in spite of
all the advantages of their civilisation, have so insignificant an
influence on Eastern people; they differ from them to too great an
extent.
</p><p>"The dual action of the past and of reciprocal imitation renders,
in the long run, all the men of the same country and the same period so
alike that even in the case of individuals who would seem destined to
escape this double influence, such as philosophers, learned men, and men
of letters, thought and style have a family air which enables the age to
which they belong to be immediately recognised.  It is not necessary to
talk for long with an individual to attain to a thorough knowledge of
what he reads, of his habitual occupations, and of the surroundings amid
which he lives."<note><p>[17]</p></note>

</p><p>[17]</p><note><p>Gustave le Bon, "L'Homme et les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s," vol.  ii. p.
116. 1881. </p></note>

<p>Contagion is so powerful that it forces upon individuals not only
certain opinions, but certain modes of feeling as well.  Contagion is
the cause of the contempt in which, at a given period, certain works are
held &mdash; the example of "Tannha&uuml;ser" may be cited &mdash; which, a few years
later, for the same

<pb n="131"/>

reason are admired by those who were foremost
in criticising them.
</p><p>The opinions and beliefs of crowds are specially propagated by
contagion, but never by reasoning.  The conceptions at present rife
among the working classes have been acquired at the public-house as the
result of affirmation, repetition, and contagion, and indeed the mode of
creation of the beliefs of crowds of every age has scarcely been
different.  Renan justly institutes a comparison between the first
founders of Christianity and "the socialist working men spreading their
ideas from public-house to public-house"; while Voltaire had already
observed in connection with the Christian religion that "for more than a
hundred years it was only embraced by the vilest riff-raff."
</p><p>It will be noted that in cases analogous to those I have just
cited, contagion, after having been at work among the popular classes,
has spread to the higher classes of society.  This is what we see
happening at the present day with regard to the socialist doctrines
which are beginning to be held by those who will yet be their first
victims.  Contagion is so powerful a force that even the sentiment of
personal interest disappears under its action.
</p><p>This is the explanation of the fact that every opinion adopted by
the populace always ends in implanting itself with great vigour in the
highest

<pb n="132"/>

social strata, however obvious be the absurdity of the
triumphant opinion.  This reaction of the lower upon the higher social
classes is the more curious, owing to the circumstance that the beliefs
of the crowd always have their origin to a greater or less extent in
some higher idea, which has often remained without influence in the
sphere in which it was evolved.  Leaders and agitators, subjugated by
this higher idea, take hold of it, distort it and create a sect which
distorts it afresh, and then propagates it amongst the masses, who carry
the process of deformation still further.  Become a popular truth the
idea returns, as it were, to its source and exerts an influence on the
upper classes of a nation.  In the long run it is intelligence that
shapes the destiny of the world, but very indirectly.  The philosophers
who evolve ideas have long since returned to dust, when, as the result
of the process I have just described, the fruit of their reflection ends
by triumphing.

&sect; 3. PRESTIGE.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Great power is given to ideas propagated by affirmation,
repetition, and contagion by the circumstance that they acquire in time
that mysterious force known as prestige.
</p><p>Whatever has been a ruling power in the world, whether it be ideas
or men, has in the main enforced its authority by means of that
irresistible

<pb n="133"/>

force expressed by the word "prestige."  The term is
one whose meaning is grasped by everybody, but the word is employed in
ways too different for it to be easy to define it.  Prestige may involve
such sentiments as admiration or fear.  Occasionally even these
sentiments are its basis, but it can perfectly well exist without them.
The greatest measure of prestige is possessed by the dead, by beings,
that is, of whom we do not stand in fear &mdash; by Alexander, C&aelig;sar,
Mahomet, and Buddha, for example.  On the other hand, there are fictive
beings whom we do not admire &mdash; the monstrous divinities of the
subterranean temples of India, for instance &mdash; but who strike us
nevertheless as endowed with a great prestige.
</p><p>Prestige in reality is a sort of domination exercised on our mind
by an individual, a work, or an idea.  This domination entirely
paralyses our critical faculty, and fills our soul with astonishment and
respect.  The sentiment provoked is inexplicable, like all sentiments,
but it would appear to be of the same kind as the fascination to which a
magnetised person is subjected.  Prestige is the mainspring of all
authority.  Neither gods, kings, nor women have ever reigned without it.
</p><p>The various kinds of prestige may be grouped under two principal
heads: acquired prestige and personal prestige.  Acquired prestige is
that resulting

<pb n="134"/>

from name, fortune, and reputation.  It may be
independent of personal prestige.  Personal prestige, on the contrary,
is something essentially peculiar to the individual; it may coexist with
reputation, glory, and fortune, or be strengthened by them, but it is
perfectly capable of existing in their absence.
</p><p>Acquired or artificial prestige is much the most common.  The mere
fact that an individual occupies a certain position, possesses a certain
fortune, or bears certain titles, endows him with prestige, however
slight his own personal worth.  A soldier in uniform, a judge in his
robes, always enjoys prestige.  Pascal has very properly noted the
necessity for judges of robes and wigs.  Without them they would be
stripped of half their authority.  The most unbending socialist is
always somewhat impressed by the sight of a prince or a marquis; and the
assumption of such titles makes the robbing of tradesmen an easy
matter.<note><p>[18]</p></note>

</p><p>[18]</p><note><p>The influence of titles, decorations, and uniforms on crowds
is to be traced in all countries, even in those in which the sentiment
of personal independence is the most strongly developed.  I quote in
this connection a curious passage from a recent book of travel, on the
prestige enjoyed in England by great persons. </p><p>"I had observed, under various circumstances, the peculiar sort of
intoxication produced in the most reasonable Englishmen by the contact
or sight of an English peer. </p><p>"Provided his fortune enables him to keep up his rank, he is sure
of their affection in advance, and brought into contact with him they
are so enchanted as to put up with anything at his hands.  They may be
seen to redden with pleasure at his approach, and if he speaks to them
their suppressed joy increases their redness, and causes their eyes to
gleam with unusual brilliance.  Respect for nobility is in their blood,
so to speak, as with Spaniards the love of dancing, with Germans that of
music, and with Frenchmen the liking for revolutions.  Their passion for
horses and Shakespeare is less violent, the satisfaction and pride they
derive from these sources a less integral part of their being.  There is
a considerable sale for books dealing with the peerage, and go where one
will they are to be found, like the Bible, in all hands." </p></note>

<pb n="135"/>

<p>The prestige of which I have just spoken is exercised by persons;
side by side with it may be placed that exercised by opinions, literary
and artistic works, &amp;c.  Prestige of the latter kind is most often
merely the result of accumulated repetitions.  History, literary and
artistic history especially, being nothing more than the repetition of
identical judgments, which nobody endeavours to verify, every one ends
by repeating what he learnt at school, till there come to be names and
things which nobody would venture to meddle with.  For a modern reader
the perusal of Homer results incontestably in immense boredom; but who
would venture to say so?  The Parthenon, in its present state, is a
wretched ruin, utterly destitute of interest, but it is endowed with
such prestige that it does not appear to us as it really is, but with
all its accompaniment of historic memories.  The special characteristic
of prestige is to prevent us seeing

<pb n="136"/>

things as they are and to
entirely paralyse our judgment.  Crowds always, and individuals as a
rule, stand in need of ready-made opinions on all subjects.  The
popularity of these opinions is independent of the measure of truth or
error they contain, and is solely regulated by their prestige.
</p><p>I now come to personal prestige.  Its nature is very different from
that of artificial or acquired prestige, with which I have just been
concerned.  It is a faculty independent of all titles, of all authority,
and possessed by a small number of persons whom it enables to exercise a
veritably magnetic fascination on those around them, although they are
socially their equals, and lack all ordinary means of domination.  They
force the acceptance of their ideas and sentiments on those about them,
and they are obeyed as is the tamer of wild beasts by the animal that
could easily devour him.
</p><p>The great leaders of crowds, such as Buddha, Jesus, Mahomet, Joan
of Arc, and Napoleon, have possessed this form of prestige in a high
degree, and to this endowment is more particularly due the position they
attained.  Gods, heroes, and dogmas win their way in the world of their
own inward strength.  They are not to be discussed: they disappear,
indeed, as soon as discussed.
</p><p>The great personages I have just cited were in

<pb n="137"/>

possession of
their power of fascination long before they became illustrious, and
would never have become so without it.  It is evident, for instance,
that Napoleon at the zenith of his glory enjoyed an immense prestige by
the mere fact of his power, but he was already endowed in part with this
prestige when he was without power and completely unknown.  When, an
obscure general, he was sent, thanks to influential protection, to command
the army of Italy, he found himself among rough generals who were
of a mind to give a hostile reception to the young intruder dispatched
them by the Directory.  From the very beginning, from the first
interview, without the aid of speeches, gestures, or threats, at the
first sight of the man who was to become great they were vanquished.
Taine furnishes a curious account of this interview taken from
contemporary memoirs.

</p><p>"The generals of division, amongst others Augereau, a sort of
swashbuckler, uncouth and heroic, proud of his height and his bravery,
arrive at the staff quarters very badly disposed towards the little
upstart dispatched them from Paris.  On the strength of the description
of him that has been given them, Augereau is inclined to be insolent and
insubordinate; a favourite of Barras, a general who owes his rank to the
events of Vend&eacute;miaire who has won his grade by street-fighting, who
is

<pb n="138"/>

looked upon as bearish, because he is always thinking in
solitude, of poor aspect, and with the reputation of a mathematician and
dreamer.  They are introduced, and Bonaparte keeps them waiting.  At
last he appears, girt with his sword; he puts on his hat, explains the
measures he has taken, gives his orders, and dismisses them.  Augereau
has remained silent; it is only when he is outside that he regains his
self-possession and is able to deliver himself of his customary oaths.
He admits with Mass&eacute;na that this little devil of a general has
inspired him with awe; he cannot understand the ascendency by which from
the very first he has felt himself overwhelmed."

</p><p>Become a great man, his prestige increased in proportion as his
glory grew, and came to be at least equal to that of a divinity in the
eyes of those devoted to him.  General Vandamme, a rough, typical
soldier of the Revolution, even more brutal and energetic than Augereau,
said of him to Marshal d'Arnano in 1815, as on one occasion they mounted
together the stairs of the Tuileries:  "That devil of a man exercises a
fascination on me that I cannot explain even to myself, and in such a
degree that, though I fear neither God nor devil, when I am in his
presence I am ready to tremble like a child, and he could make me go
through the eye of a needle to throw myself into the fire."

<pb n="139"/>

</p><p>Napoleon exercised a like fascination on all who came into contact
with him.<note><p>[19]</p></note>

</p><p>[19]</p><note><p>Thoroughly conscious of his prestige, Napoleon was aware that
he added to it by treating rather worse than stable lads the great
personages around him, and among whom figured some of those celebrated
men of the Convention of whom Europe had stood in dread.  The gossip of
the period abounds in illustrations of this fact.  One day, in the midst
of a Council of State, Napoleon grossly insults Beugnot, treating him as
one might an unmannerly valet.  The effect produced, he goes up to him
and says, "Well, stupid, have you found your head again?"  Whereupon
Beugnot, tall as a drum-major, bows very low, and the little man raising
his hand, takes the tall one by the ear, "an intoxicating sign of
favour," writes Beugnot, "the familiar gesture of the master who waxes
gracious."  Such examples give a clear idea of the degree of base
platitude that prestige can provoke.  They enable us to understand the
immense contempt of the great despot for the men surrounding him &mdash; men
whom he merely looked upon as "food for powder." </p></note>

<p>Davoust used to say, talking of Maret's devotion and of his own:
"Had the Emperor said to us, `It is important in the interest of my
policy that Paris should be destroyed without a single person leaving it
or escaping,' Maret I am sure would have kept the secret, but he could
not have abstained from compromising himself by seeing that his family
got clear of the city.  On the other hand, I, for fear of letting the
truth leak out, would have let my wife and children stay."
</p><p>It is necessary to bear in mind the astounding power exerted by
fascination of this order to

<pb n="140"/>

understand that marvellous return from
the Isle of Elba, that lightning-like conquest of France by an isolated
man confronted by all the organised forces of a great country that might
have been supposed weary of his tyranny.  He had merely to cast a look
at the generals sent to lay hands on him, and who had sworn to
accomplish their mission.  All of them submitted without discussion.

</p><p>"Napoleon," writes the English General Wolseley, "lands in France
almost alone, a fugitive from the small island of Elba which was his
kingdom, and succeeded in a few weeks, without bloodshed, in upsetting
all organised authority in France under its legitimate king; is it
possible for the personal ascendency of a man to affirm itself in a more
astonishing manner?  But from the beginning to the end of this campaign,
which was his last, how remarkable too is the ascendency he exercised
over the Allies, obliging them to follow his initiative, and how near he
came to crushing them!"

</p><p>His prestige outlived him and continued to grow.  It is his
prestige that made an emperor of his obscure nephew.  How powerful is
his memory still is seen in the resurrection of his legend in progress
at the present day.  Ill-treat men as you will, massacre them by
millions, be the cause of invasion upon invasion, all is permitted you
if you possess

<pb n="141"/>

prestige in a sufficient degree and the talent
necessary to uphold it.
</p><p>I have invoked, no doubt, in this case a quite exceptional example
of prestige, but one it was useful to cite to make clear the genesis of
great religions, great doctrines, and great empires.  Were it not for
the power exerted on the crowd by prestige, such growths would be
incomprehensible.
</p><p>Prestige, however, is not based solely on personal ascendency,
military glory, and religious terror; it may have a more modest origin
and still be considerable.  Our century furnishes several examples.  One
of the most striking ones that posterity will recall from age to age
will be supplied by the history of the illustrious man who modified the
face of the globe and the commercial relations of the nations by
separating two continents.  He succeeded in his enterprise owing to his
immense strength of will, but also owing to the fascination he exercised
on those surrounding him.  To overcome the unanimous opposition he met
with, he had only to show himself.  He would speak briefly, and in face
of the charm he exerted his opponents became his friends.  The English
in particular strenuously opposed his scheme; he had only to put in an
appearance in England to rally all suffrages.  In later years, when he
passed Southampton, the bells were rung on his passage; and at the
present day a movement

<pb n="142"/>

is on foot in England to raise a statue in
his honour.
</p><p>"Having vanquished whatever there is to vanquish, men and things,
marshes, rocks, and sandy wastes," he had ceased to believe in
obstacles, and wished to begin Suez over again at Panama.  He began
again with the same methods as of old; but he had aged, and, besides,
the faith that moves mountains does not move them if they are too lofty.
The mountains resisted, and the catastrophe that ensued destroyed the
glittering aureole of glory that enveloped the hero.  His life teaches
how prestige can grow and how it can vanish.  After rivalling in
greatness the most famous heroes of history, he was lowered by the
magistrates of his country to the ranks of the vilest criminals.  When
he died his coffin, unattended, traversed an indifferent crowd.  Foreign
sovereigns are alone in rendering homage to his memory as to that of one
of the greatest men that history has known.<note><p>[20]</p></note>

</p><p>[20]</p><note><p>An Austrian paper, the <hi rend="italic">Neue Freie Presse</hi>, of Vienna,
has indulged on the subject of the destiny of de Lesseps in reflections
marked by a most judicious psychological insight.  I therefore reproduce
them here: &mdash; </p><p>"After the condemnation of Ferdinand de Lesseps one has no longer
the right to be astonished at the sad end of Christopher Columbus.  If
Ferdinand de Lesseps were a rogue every noble illusion is a crime.
Antiquity would have crowned the memory of de Lesseps with an aureole of
glory, and would have made him drink from the bowl of nectar in the
midst of Olympus, for he has altered the face of the earth and
accomplished works which make the creation more perfect.  The President
of the Court of Appeal has immortalised himself by condemning Ferdinand
de Lesseps, for the nations will always demand the name of the man who
was not afraid to debase his century by investing with the convict's cap
an aged man, whose life redounded to the glory of his contemporaries. </p><p>"Let there be no more talk in the future of inflexible justice,
there where reigns a bureaucratic hatred of audacious feats.  The
nations have need of audacious men who believe in themselves and
overcome every obstacle without concern for their personal safety.
Genius cannot he prudent; by dint of prudence it could never enlarge the
sphere of human activity </p><p>". . . Ferdinand de Lesseps has known the intoxication of triumph
and the bitterness of disappointment &mdash; Suez and Panama.  At this point
the heart revolts at the morality of success.  When de Lesseps had
succeeded in joining two seas princes and nations rendered him their
homage; to-day, when he meets with failure among the rocks of the
Cordilleras, he is nothing but a vulgar rogue. . . .  In this result we
see a war between the classes of society, the discontent of bureaucrats
and employ&eacute;s, who take their revenge with the aid of the criminal
code on those who would raise themselves above their fellows. . . .
Modern legislators are filled with embarrassment when confronted by the
lofty ideas due to human genius; the public comprehends such ideas still
less, and it is easy for an advocate-general to prove that Stanley is a
murderer and de Lesseps a deceiver." </p></note>

<pb n="143"/>

<p>Still, the various examples that have just been cited represent
extreme cases.  To fix in detail the psychology of prestige, it would be
necessary to place them at the extremity of a series, which would range
from the founders of religions and empires to the private individual who
endeavours

<pb n="144"/>

to dazzle his neighbours by a new coat or a decoration.
</p><p>Between the extreme limits of this series would find a place all
the forms of prestige resulting from the different elements composing a
civilisation &mdash; sciences, arts, literature, &amp;c. &mdash; and it would be seen that
prestige constitutes the fundamental element of persuasion.  Consciously
or not, the being, the idea, or the thing possessing prestige is immediately
imitated in consequence of contagion, and forces an entire
generation to adopt certain modes of feeling and of giving expression to
its thought.  This imitation, moreover, is, as a rule, unconscious,
which accounts for the fact that it is perfect.  The modern painters who
copy the pale colouring and the stiff attitudes of some of the
Primitives are scarcely alive to the source of their inspiration.  They
believe in their own sincerity, whereas, if an eminent master had not
revived this form of art, people would have continued blind to all but
its na&iuml;ve and inferior sides.  Those artists who, after the manner of
another illustrious master, inundate their canvasses with violet shades
do not see in nature more violet than was detected there fifty years
ago; but they are influenced, "suggestioned," by the personal and
special impressions of a painter who, in spite of this eccentricity, was
successful in acquiring great prestige.  Similar examples might be
brought forward in connection with all the elements of civilisation.

<pb n="145"/>

</p><p>It is seen from what precedes that a number of factors may be
concerned in the genesis of prestige; among them success was always one
of the most important.  Every successful man, every idea that forces
itself into recognition, ceases, <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi>, to be called in
question.  The proof that success is one of the principal stepping-stones to prestige is that the disappearance of the one is almost always
followed by the disappearance of the other.  The hero whom the crowd
acclaimed yesterday is insulted to-day should he have been overtaken by
failure.  The re-action, indeed, will be the stronger in proportion as
the prestige has been great.  The crowd in this case considers the
fallen hero as an equal, and takes its revenge for having bowed to a
superiority whose existence it no longer admits.  While Robespierre was
causing the execution of his colleagues and of a great number of his
contemporaries, he possessed an immense prestige.  When the
transposition of a few votes deprived him of power, he immediately lost
his prestige, and the crowd followed him to the guillotine with the
self-same imprecations with which shortly before it had pursued his
victims.  Believers always break the statues of their former gods with
every symptom of fury.
</p><p>Prestige lost by want of success disappears in a brief space of
time.  It can also be worn away, but more slowly by being subjected to
discussion.

<pb n="146"/>

This latter power, however, is exceedingly sure.  From
the moment prestige is called in question it ceases to be prestige.  The
gods and men who have kept their prestige for long have never tolerated
discussion.  For the crowd to admire, it must be kept at a distance.

<head>
&sect; 1. FIXED BELIEFS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>A CLOSE parallel exists between the anatomical and psychological
characteristics of living beings.

<pb n="148"/>

In these anatomical
characteristics certain invariable, or slightly variable, elements are
met with, to change which the lapse is necessary of geological ages.
Side by side with these fixed, indestructible features are to be found
others extremely changeable, which the art of the breeder or
horticulturist may easily modify, and at times to such an extent as to
conceal the fundamental characteristics from an observer at all
inattentive.
</p><p>The same phenomenon is observed in the case of moral
characteristics.  Alongside the unalterable psychological elements of a
race, mobile and changeable elements are to be encountered.  For this
reason, in studying the beliefs and opinions of a people, the presence
is always detected of a fixed groundwork on which are engrafted opinions
as changing as the surface sand on a rock.
</p><p>The opinions and beliefs of crowds may be divided, then, into two
very distinct classes.  On the one hand we have great permanent beliefs,
which endure for several centuries, and on which an entire civilisation
may rest.  Such, for instance, in the past were feudalism, Christianity,
and Protestantism; and such, in our own time, are the nationalist
principle and contemporary democratic and social ideas.  In the second
place, there are the transitory, changing opinions, the outcome, as a
rule, of general conceptions, of which every age sees the birth and
disappearance; examples in

<pb n="149"/>

point are the theories which mould
literature and the arts &mdash; those, for instance, which produced
romanticism, naturalism, mysticism, &amp;c.  Opinions of this order are as
superficial, as a rule, as fashion, and as changeable.  They may be
compared to the ripples which ceaselessly arise and vanish on the
surface of a deep lake.
</p><p>The great generalised beliefs are very restricted in number.  Their
rise and fall form the culminating points of the history of every
historic race.  They constitute the real framework of civilisation.
</p><p>It is easy to imbue the mind of crowds with a passing opinion, but
very difficult to implant therein a lasting belief.  However, a belief
of this latter description once established, it is equally difficult to
uproot it.  It is usually only to be changed at the cost of violent
revolutions.  Even revolutions can only avail when the belief has almost
entirely lost its sway over men's minds.  In that case revolutions serve
to finally sweep away what had already been almost cast aside, though
the force of habit prevented its complete abandonment.  The beginning of
a revolution is in reality the end of a belief.
</p><p>The precise moment at which a great belief is doomed is easily
recognisable; it is the moment when its value begins to be called in
question.  Every general belief being little else than a fiction,

<pb n="150"/>

it can only survive on the condition that it be not subjected to
examination.
</p><p>But even when a belief is severely shaken, the institutions to
which it has given rise retain their strength and disappear but slowly.
Finally, when the belief has completely lost its force, all that rested
upon it is soon involved in ruin.  As yet a nation has never been able
to change its beliefs without being condemned at the same time to
transform all the elements of its civilisation.  The nation continues
this process of transformation until it has alighted on and accepted a
new general belief: until this juncture it is perforce in a state of
anarchy.  General beliefs are the indispensable pillars of
civilisations; they determine the trend of ideas.  They alone are
capable of inspiring faith and creating a sense of duty.
</p><p>Nations have always been conscious of the utility of acquiring
general beliefs, and have instinctively understood that their
disappearance would be the signal for their own decline.  In the case of
the Romans, the fanatical cult of Rome was the belief that made them
masters of the world, and when the belief had died out Rome was doomed
to die.  As for the barbarians who destroyed the Roman civilisation, it
was only when they had acquired certain commonly accepted beliefs that
they attained a measure of cohesion and emerged from anarchy.

<pb n="151"/>

</p><p>Plainly it is not for nothing that nations have always displayed
intolerance in the defence of their opinions.  This intolerance, open as
it is to criticism from the philosophic standpoint, represents in the
life of a people the most necessary of virtues.  It was to found or
uphold general beliefs that so many victims were sent to the stake in
the Middle Ages and that so many inventors and innovators have died in
despair even if they have escaped martyrdom.  It is in defence, too, of
such beliefs that the world has been so often the scene of the direst
disorder, and that so many millions of men have died on the battlefield,
and will yet die there.
</p><p>There are great difficulties in the way of establishing a general
belief, but when it is definitely implanted its power is for a long time
to come invincible, and however false it be philosophically it imposes
itself upon the most luminous intelligence.  Have not the European
peoples regarded as incontrovertible for more than fifteen centuries
religious legends which, closely examined, are as barbarous<note><p>[21]</p></note> as those
of Moloch?  The frightful absurdity of the legend of a God who revenges
himself for the disobedience of one of his

<pb n="152"/>

creatures by inflicting
horrible tortures on his son remained unperceived during many centuries.
Such potent geniuses as a Galileo, a Newton, and a Leibnitz never
supposed for an instant that the truth of such dogmas could be called in
question.  Nothing can be more typical than this fact of the hypnotising
effect of general beliefs, but at the same time nothing can mark more
decisively the humiliating limitations of our intelligence.

</p><p>[21]</p><note><p>Barbarous, philosophically speaking, I mean.  In practice they
have created an entirely new civilisation, and for fifteen centuries
have given mankind a glimpse of those enchanted realms of generous
dreams and of hope which he will know no more. </p></note>

<p>As soon as a new dogma is implanted in the mind of crowds it
becomes the source of inspiration whence are evolved its institutions,
arts, and mode of existence.  The sway it exerts over men's minds under
these circumstances is absolute.  Men of action have no thought beyond
realising the accepted belief, legislators beyond applying it, while
philosophers, artists, and men of letters are solely preoccupied with
its expression under various shapes.
</p><p>From the fundamental belief transient accessory ideas may arise,
but they always bear the impress of the belief from which they have
sprung.  The Egyptian civilisation, the European civilisation of the
Middle Ages, the Mussulman civilisation of the Arabs are all the outcome
of a small number of religious beliefs which have left their mark on the
least important elements of these civilisations and allow of their
immediate recognition.
</p><p>Thus it is that, thanks to general beliefs, the men

<pb n="153"/>

of every
age are enveloped in a network of traditions, opinions, and customs
which render them all alike, and from whose yoke they cannot extricate
themselves.  Men are guided in their conduct above all by their beliefs
and by the customs that are the consequence of those beliefs.  These
beliefs and customs regulate the smallest acts of our existence, and the
most independent spirit cannot escape their influence.  The tyranny
exercised unconsciously on men's minds is the only real tyranny, because
it cannot be fought against.  Tiberius, Ghengis Khan, and Napoleon were
assuredly redoubtable tyrants, but from the depth of their graves Moses,
Buddha, Jesus, and Mahomet have exerted on the human soul a far
profounder despotism.  A conspiracy may overthrow a tyrant, but what can
it avail against a firmly established belief?  In its violent struggle
with Roman Catholicism it is the French Revolution that has been
vanquished, and this in spite of the fact that the sympathy of the crowd
was apparently on its side, and in spite of recourse to destructive
measures as pitiless as those of the Inquisition.  The only real tyrants
that humanity has known have always been the memories of its dead or the
illusions it has forged itself.
</p><p>The philosophic absurdity that often marks general beliefs has
never been an obstacle to their triumph.  Indeed the triumph of such
beliefs

<pb n="154"/>

would seem impossible unless on the condition that they
offer some mysterious absurdity.  In consequence, the evident weakness
of the socialist beliefs of to-day will not prevent them triumphing
among the masses.  Their real inferiority to all religious beliefs is
solely the result of this consideration, that the ideal of happiness
offered by the latter being realisable only in a future life, it was
beyond the power of anybody to contest it.  The socialist ideal of
happiness being intended to be realised on earth, the vanity of its
promises will at once appear as soon as the first efforts towards their
realisation are made, and simultaneously the new belief will entirely
lose its prestige.  Its strength, in consequence, will only increase
until the day when, having triumphed, its practical realisation shall
commence.  For this reason, while the new religion exerts to begin with,
like all those that have preceded it, a destructive influence, it will
be unable, in the future, to play a creative part.

&sect; 2. THE CHANGEABLE OPINIONS OF CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Above the substratum of fixed beliefs, whose power we have just
demonstrated, is found an overlying growth of opinions, ideas, and
thoughts which are incessantly springing up and dying out.  Some of them
exist but for a day, and the more important scarcely outlive a
generation.  We have

<pb n="155"/>

already noted that the changes which supervene
in opinions of this order are at times far more superficial than real,
and that they are always affected by racial considerations.  When
examining, for instance, the political institutions of France we showed
that parties to all appearance utterly distinct &mdash; royalists, radicals,
imperialists, socialists, &amp;c. &mdash; have an ideal absolutely identical, and
that this ideal is solely dependent on the mental structure of the
French race, since a quite contrary ideal is found under analogous names
among other races.  Neither the name given to opinions nor deceptive
adaptations alter the essence of things.  The men of the Great
Revolution, saturated with Latin literature, who (their eyes fixed on
the Roman Republic), adopted its laws, its fasces, and its togas, did
not become Romans because they were under the empire of a powerful
historical suggestion.  The task of the philosopher is to investigate
what it is which subsists of ancient beliefs beneath their apparent
changes, and to identify amid the moving flux of opinions the part
determined by general beliefs and the genius of the race.
</p><p>In the absence of this philosophic test it might be supposed that
crowds change their political or religious beliefs frequently and at
will.  All history, whether political, religious, artistic, or literary,
seems to prove that such is the case.

<pb n="156"/>

</p><p>As an example, let us take a very short period of French history,
merely that from 1790 to 1820, a period of thirty years' duration, that
of a generation.  In the course of it we see the crowd at first
monarchical become very revolutionary, then very imperialist, and again
very monarchical.  In the matter of religion it gravitates in the same
lapse of time from Catholicism to atheism, then towards deism, and then
returns to the most pronounced forms of Catholicism.  These changes take
place not only amongst the masses, but also amongst those who direct
them.  We observe with astonishment the prominent men of the Convention,
the sworn enemies of kings, men who would have neither gods nor masters,
become the humble servants of Napoleon, and afterwards, under Louis
XVIII., piously carry candles in religious processions.
</p><p>Numerous, too, are the changes in the opinions of the crowd in the
course of the following seventy years.  The "Perfidious Albion" of the
opening of the century is the ally of France under Napoleon's heir;
Russia, twice invaded by France, which looked on with satisfaction at
French reverses, becomes its friend.
</p><p>In literature, art, and philosophy the successive evolutions of
opinion are more rapid still.  Romanticism, naturalism, mysticism, &amp;c.,
spring up and die out in turn.  The artist and the writer

<pb n="157"/>

applauded
yesterday are treated on the morrow with profound contempt.
</p><p>When, however, we analyse all these changes in appearance so far
reaching, what do we find?  All those that are in opposition with the
general beliefs and sentiments of the race are of transient duration,
and the diverted stream soon resumes its course.  The opinions which are
not linked to any general belief or sentiment of the race, and which in
consequence cannot possess stability, are at the mercy of every chance,
or, if the expression be preferred, of every change in the surrounding
circumstances.  Formed by suggestion and contagion, they are always
momentary; they crop up and disappear as rapidly on occasion as the
sandhills formed by the wind on the sea-coast.
</p><p>At the present day the changeable opinions of crowds are greater in
number than they ever were, and for three different reasons.
</p><p>The first is that as the old beliefs are losing their influence to
a greater and greater extent, they are ceasing to shape the ephemeral
opinions of the moment as they did in the past.  The weakening of
general beliefs clears the ground for a crop of haphazard opinions
without a past or a future.
</p><p>The second reason is that the power of crowds being on the
increase, and this power being less and less counterbalanced, the
extreme mobility of

<pb n="158"/>

ideas, which we have seen to be a peculiarity
of crowds, can manifest itself without let or hindrance.
</p><p>Finally, the third reason is the recent development of the
newspaper press, by whose agency the most contrary opinions are being
continually brought before the attention of crowds.  The suggestions
that might result from each individual opinion are soon destroyed by
suggestions of an opposite character.  The consequence is that no
opinion succeeds in becoming widespread, and that the existence of all
of them is ephemeral.  An opinion nowadays dies out before it has found
a sufficiently wide acceptance to become general.
</p><p>A phenomenon quite new in the world's history, and most
characteristic of the present age, has resulted from these different
causes; I allude to the powerlessness of governments to direct opinion.
</p><p>In the past, and in no very distant past, the action of governments
and the influence of a few writers and a very small number of newspapers
constituted the real reflectors of public opinion.  To-day the writers
have lost all influence, and the newspapers only reflect opinion.  As
for statesmen, far from directing opinion, their only endeavour is to
follow it.  They have a dread of opinion, which amounts at times to
terror, and causes them to adopt an utterly unstable line of conduct.
</p><p>The opinion of crowds tends, then, more and

<pb n="159"/>

more to become the
supreme guiding principle in politics.  It goes so far to-day as to
force on alliances, as has been seen recently in the case of the Franco-Russian alliance, which is solely the outcome of a popular movement.  A
curious symptom of the present time is to observe popes, kings, and
emperors consent to be interviewed as a means of submitting their views
on a given subject to the judgment of crowds.  Formerly it might have
been correct to say that politics were not a matter of sentiment.  Can
the same be said today, when politics are more and more swayed by the
impulse of changeable crowds, who are uninfluenced by reason and can
only be guided by sentiment?
</p><p>As to the press, which formerly directed opinion, it has had, like
governments, to humble itself before the power of crowds.  It wields, no
doubt, a considerable influence, but only because it is exclusively the
reflection of the opinions of crowds and of their incessant variations.
Become a mere agency for the supply of information, the press has
renounced all endeavour to enforce an idea or a doctrine.  It follows
all the changes of public thought, obliged to do so by the necessities
of competition under pain of losing its readers.  The old staid and
influential organs of the past, such as the <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi>, the
<hi rend="italic">D&eacute;bats</hi>, or the <hi rend="italic">Si&eacute;cle</hi>, which were accepted as
oracles by

<pb n="160"/>

the preceding generation, have disappeared or have
become typical modern papers, in which a maximum of news is sandwiched
in between light articles, society gossip, and financial puffs.  There
can be no question to-day of a paper rich enough to allow its
contributors to air their personal opinions, and such opinions would be
of slight weight with readers who only ask to be kept informed or to be
amused, and who suspect every affirmation of being prompted by motives
of speculation.  Even the critics have ceased to be able to assure the
success of a book or a play.  They are capable of doing harm, but not of
doing a service.  The papers are so conscious of the uselessness of
everything in the shape of criticism or personal opinion, that they have
reached the point of suppressing literary criticism, confining
themselves to citing the title of a book, and appending a "puff" of two
or three lines.<note><p>[22]</p></note>  In twenty years' time the same fate will probably
have overtaken theatrical criticism.

</p><p>[22]</p>
<note><p>These remarks refer to the French newspaper press. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Note of
the Translator.</hi> </p></note>

<p>The close watching of the course of opinion has become to-day the
principal preoccupation of the press and of governments.  The effect
produced by an event, a legislative proposal, a speech, is without
intermission what they require to know, and the task is not easy, for
nothing is more mobile

<pb n="161"/>

and changeable than the thought of crowds,
and nothing more frequent than to see them execrate to-day what they
applauded yesterday.
</p><p>This total absence of any sort of direction of opinion, and at the
same time the destruction of general beliefs, have had for final result
an extreme divergency of convictions of every order, and a growing
indifference on the part of crowds to everything that does not plainly
touch their immediate interests.  Questions of doctrine, such as
socialism, only recruit champions boasting genuine convictions among the
quite illiterate classes, among the workers in mines and factories, for
instance.  Members of the lower middle class, and working men possessing
some degree of instruction, have either become utterly sceptical or
extremely unstable in their opinions.
</p><p>The evolution which has been effected in this direction in the last
twenty-five years is striking.  During the preceding period,
comparatively near us though it is, opinions still had a certain general
trend; they had their origin in the acceptance of some fundamental
belief.  By the mere fact that an individual was a monarchist he
possessed inevitably certain clearly defined ideas in history as well as
in science, while by the mere fact that he was a republican, his ideas
were quite contrary.  A monarchist was well aware that men are not
descended from monkeys, and a republican was

<pb n="162"/>

not less well aware
that such is in truth their descent.  It was the duty of the monarchist
to speak with horror, and of the republican to speak with veneration, of
the great Revolution.  There were certain names, such as those of
Robespierre and Marat, that had to be uttered with an air of religious
devotion, and other names, such as those of C&aelig;sar, Augustus, or
Napoleon, that ought never to be mentioned unaccompanied by a torrent of
invective.  Even in the French Sorbonne this ingenuous fashion of
conceiving history was general.<note><p>[23]</p></note>

</p><p>[23]</p><note><p>There are pages in the books of the French official professors
of history that are very curious from this point of view.  They prove
too how little the critical spirit is developed by the system of
university education in vogue in France.  I cite as an example the
following extracts from the "French Revolution" of M. Rambaud, professor
of history at the Sorbonne:  </p><p>"The taking of the Bastille was a culminating event in the history
not only of France, but of all Europe; and inaugurated a new epoch in
the history of the world!"  </p><p>With respect to Robespierre, we learn with stupefaction that "his
dictatorship was based more especially on opinion, persuasion, and moral
authority; it was a sort of pontificate in the hands of a virtuous man!"
(pp. 91 and 220.) </p></note>

<p>At the present day, as the result of discussion and analysis, all
opinions are losing their prestige; their distinctive features are
rapidly worn away, and few survive capable of arousing our enthusiasm.
The man of modern times is more and more a prey to indifference.

<pb n="163"/>

</p><p>The general wearing away of opinions should not be too greatly
deplored.  That it is a symptom of decadence in the life of a people
cannot be contested.  It is certain that men of immense, of almost
supernatural insight, that apostles, leaders of crowds &mdash; men, in a word,
of genuine and strong convictions &mdash; exert a far greater force than men
who deny, who criticise, or who are indifferent, but it must not be
forgotten that, given the power possessed at present by crowds, were a
single opinion to acquire sufficient prestige to enforce its general
acceptance, it would soon be endowed with so tyrannical a strength that
everything would have to bend before it, and the era of free discussion
would be closed for a long time.  Crowds are occasionally easy-going
masters, as were Heliogabalus and Tiberius, but they are also violently
capricious.  A civilisation, when the moment has come for crowds to
acquire a high hand over it, is at the mercy of too many chances to
endure for long.  Could anything postpone for a while the hour of its
ruin, it would be precisely the extreme instability of the opinions of
crowds and their growing indifference with respect to all general
beliefs.

<hi rend="italic">Heterogeneous crowds.</hi>  Different varieties of them &mdash; The influence

crowds.</hi>  Their different varieties &mdash; Sects, castes, and
classes.

</p><p>WE have sketched in this work the general characteristics common to
psychological crowds.  It remains to point out the particular characteristics
which accompany those of a general order in the different
categories of collectivities, when they are transformed into a crowd
under the influences of the proper exciting causes.

<pb n="165"/>

</p><p>We will, first of all, set forth in a few words a classification of
crowds.
</p><p>Our starting-point will be the simple multitude.  Its most inferior
form is met with when the multitude is composed of individuals belonging
to different races.  In this case its only common bond of union is the
will, more or less respected of a chief.  The barbarians of very diverse
origin who during several centuries invaded the Roman Empire, may be
cited as a specimen of multitudes of this kind.
</p><p>On a higher level than these multitudes composed of different races
are those which under certain influences have acquired common characteristics,
and have ended by forming a single race.  They present at times
characteristics peculiar to crowds, but these characteristics are
overruled to a greater or less extent by racial considerations.
</p><p>These two kinds of multitudes may, under certain influences
investigated in this work, be transformed into organised or
psychological crowds.  We shall break up these organised crowds into the
following divisions: &mdash;

                    1. Anonymous crowds (street<lb/>
                         crowds, for example).<lb/>
A. Heterogeneous<lb/>
     crowds.        2. Crowds not anonymous<lb/>
                         (juries, parliamentary<lb/>
                         assemblies, &amp;c.).<lb/>

<pb n="166"/>

                    1. Sects (political sects,<lb/>
                         religious sects, &amp;c.).<lb/>
                    2. Castes (the military caste,<lb/>
B. Homogeneous           the priestly caste, the<lb/>
     crowds.             working caste, &amp;c.).<lb/>
                    3. Classes (the middle classes,<lb/>
                         the peasant classes, &amp;c.).<lb/>

</p><p>We will point out briefly the distinguishing characteristics of
these different categories of crowds.
</p>
<div3 type="section" n="3.1.1" id="d43">
<head>
&sect; 1. HETEROGENEOUS CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>It is these collectivities whose characteristics have been studied
in this volume.  They are composed of individuals of any description, of
any profession, and any degree of intelligence.
</p><p>We are now aware that by the mere fact that men form part of a
crowd engaged in action, their collective psychology differs essentially
from their individual psychology, and their intelligence is affected by
this differentiation.  We have seen that intelligence is without
influence in collectivities, they being solely under the sway of
unconscious sentiments.
</p><p>A fundamental factor, that of race, allows of a tolerably thorough
differentiation of the various heterogeneous crowds.
</p><p>We have often referred already to the part played by race, and have
shown it to be the

<pb n="167"/>

most powerful of the factors capable of determining
men's actions.  Its action is also to be traced in the character
of crowds.  A crowd composed of individuals assembled at haphazard, but
all of them Englishmen or Chinamen, will differ widely from another
crowd also composed of individuals of any and every description, but of
other races &mdash; Russians, Frenchmen, or Spaniards, for example.
</p><p>The wide divergencies which their inherited mental constitution
creates in men's modes of feeling and thinking at once come into prominence
when, which rarely happens, circumstances gather together in the
same crowd and in fairly equal proportions individuals of different
nationality, and this occurs, however identical in appearance be the
interests which provoked the gathering.  The efforts made by the
socialists to assemble in great congresses the representatives of the
working-class populations of different countries, have always ended in
the most pronounced discord.  A Latin crowd, however revolutionary or
however conservative it be supposed, will invariably appeal to the
intervention of the State to realise its demands.  It is always distinguished
by a marked tendency towards centralisation and by a leaning,
more or less pronounced, in favour of a dictatorship.  An English or an
American crowd, on the contrary, sets no store

<pb n="168"/>

on the State, and
only appeals to private initiative.  A French crowd lays particular
weight on equality and an English crowd on liberty.  These differences
of race explain how it is that there are almost as many different forms
of socialism and democracy as there are nations.
</p><p>The genius of the race, then, exerts a paramount influence upon the
dispositions of a crowd.  It is the powerful underlying force that
limits its changes of humour.  It should be considered as an essential
law that <hi rend="italic">the inferior characteristics of crowds are the less
accentuated in proportion as the spirit of the race is strong.</hi>  The
crowd state and the domination of crowds is equivalent to the barbarian
state, or to a return to it.  It is by the acquisition of a solidly
constituted collective spirit that the race frees itself to a greater
and greater extent from the unreflecting power of crowds, and emerges
from the barbarian state.  The only important classification to be made
of heterogeneous crowds, apart from that based on racial considerations,
is to separate them into anonymous crowds, such as street crowds, and
crowds not anonymous &mdash; deliberative assemblies and juries, for example.
The sentiment of responsibility absent from crowds of the first
description and developed in those of the second often gives a very
different tendency to their respective acts.

&sect; 2. HOMOGENEOUS CROWDS.<lb/>
</head>

<p>Homogeneous crowds include: 1. Sects; 2. Castes; 3. Classes.
</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">sect</hi> represents the first step in the process of
organisation of homogeneous crowds.  A sect includes individuals
differing greatly as to their education, their professions, and the
class of society to which they belong, and with their common beliefs as
the connecting link.  Examples in point are religious and political
sects.
</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">caste</hi> represents the highest degree of organisation of
which the crowd is susceptible.  While the sect includes individuals of
very different professions, degrees of education and social surrounding,
who are only linked together by the beliefs they hold in common, the
caste is composed of individuals of the same profession, and in
consequence similarly educated and of much the same social status.
Examples in point are the military and priestly castes.
</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">class</hi> is formed of individuals of diverse origin, linked
together not by a community of beliefs, as are the members of a sect, or
by common professional occupations, as are the members of a caste, but
by certain interests and certain habits of life and education almost
identical.  The middle class and the agricultural class are examples.
</p><p>Being only concerned in this work with

<pb n="170"/>

heterogeneous crowds,
and reserving the study of homogeneous crowds (sects, castes, and
classes) for another volume, I shall not insist here on the
characteristics of crowds of this latter kind.  I shall conclude this
study of heterogeneous crowds by the examination of a few typical and
distinct categories of crowds.

CHAPTER II.<lb/>

<hi rend="italic">CROWDS TERMED CRIMINAL CROWDS.</hi><lb/>
</head>

<p>Crowds termed criminal crowds &mdash; A crowd may be legally yet not
psychologically criminal &mdash; The absolute unconsciousness of the acts of
crowds &mdash; Various examples &mdash; Psychology of the authors of the September
massacres &mdash; Their reasoning, their sensibility, their ferocity, and their
morality.

</p><p>OWING to the fact that crowds, after a period of excitement, enter upon
a purely automatic and unconscious state, in which they are guided by
suggestion, it seems difficult to qualify them in any case as criminal.
I only retain this erroneous qualification because it has been
definitely brought into vogue by recent psychological investigations.
Certain acts of crowds are assuredly criminal, if considered merely in
themselves, but criminal in that case in the same way as the act of a
tiger devouring a Hindoo, after allowing its young to maul him for their
amusement.
</p><p>The usual motive of the crimes of crowds is a

<pb n="172"/>

powerful
suggestion, and the individuals who take part in such crimes are
afterwards convinced that they have acted in obedience to duty, which is
far from being the case with the ordinary criminal.
</p><p>The history of the crimes committed by crowds illustrates what
precedes.
</p><p>The murder of M. de Launay, the governor of the Bastille, may be
cited as a typical example.  After the taking of the fortress the
governor, surrounded by a very excited crowd, was dealt blows from every
direction.  It was proposed to hang him, to cut off his head, to tie him
to a horse's tail.  While struggling, he accidently kicked one of those
present.  Some one proposed, and his suggestion was at once received
with acclamation by the crowd, that the individual who had been kicked
should cut the governor's throat.
</p><p>"The individual in question, a cook out of work, whose chief reason
for being at the Bastille was idle curiosity as to what was going on,
esteems, that since such is the general opinion, the action is patriotic
and even believes he deserves a medal for having destroyed a monster.
With a sword that is lent him he strikes the bared neck, but the weapon
being somewhat blunt and not cutting, he takes from his pocket a small
black-handled knife and (in his capacity of cook he would be experienced
in cutting up meat) successfully effects the operation."

<pb n="173"/>

</p><p>The working of the process indicated above is clearly seen in this
example.  We have obedience to a suggestion, which is all the stronger
because of its collective origin, and the murderer's conviction that he
has committed a very meritorious act, a conviction the more natural
seeing that he enjoys the unanimous approval of his fellow-citizens.  An
act of this kind may be considered crime legally but not
psychologically.
</p><p>The general characteristics of criminal crowds are precisely the
same as those we have met with in all crowds: openness to suggestion,
credulity, mobility, the exaggeration of the sentiments good or bad, the
manifestation of certain forms of morality, &amp;c.
</p><p>We shall find all these characteristics present in a crowd which
has left behind it in French history the most sinister memories &mdash; the
crowd which perpetrated the September massacres.  In point of fact it
offers much similarity with the crowd that committed the Saint
Bartholomew massacres.  I borrow the details from the narration of M.
Taine, who took them from contemporary sources.
</p><p>It is not known exactly who gave the order or made the suggestion
to empty the prisons by massacring the prisoners.  Whether it was
Danton, as is probable, or another does not matter; the one interesting
fact for us is the powerful suggestion

<pb n="174"/>

received by the crowd
charged with the massacre.
</p><p>The crowd of murderers numbered some three hundred persons, and was
a perfectly typical heterogeneous crowd.  With the exception of a very
small number of professional scoundrels, it was composed in the main of
shopkeepers and artisans of every trade: bootmakers, locksmiths,
hairdressers, masons, clerks, messengers, &amp;c.  Under the influence of
the suggestion received they are perfectly convinced, as was the cook
referred to above, that they are accomplishing a patriotic duty.  They
fill a double office, being at once judge and executioner, but they do
not for a moment regard themselves as criminals.
</p><p>Deeply conscious of the importance of their duty, they begin by
forming a sort of tribunal, and in connection with this act the
ingenuousness of crowds and their rudimentary conception of justice are
seen immediately.  In consideration of the large number of the accused,
it is decided that, to begin with, the nobles, priests, officers, and
members of the king's household &mdash; in a word, all the individuals whose
mere profession is proof of their guilt in the eyes of a good patriot &mdash;
shall be slaughtered in a body, there being no need for a special
decision in their case.  The remainder shall be judged on their personal
appearance and their reputation.  In this way the rudimentary conscience
of the

<pb n="175"/>

crowd is satisfied.  It will now be able to proceed legally
with the massacre, and to give free scope to those instincts of ferocity
whose genesis I have set forth elsewhere, they being instincts which
collectivities always have it in them to develop to a high degree.
These instincts, however &mdash; as is regularly the case in crowds &mdash; will not
prevent the manifestation of other and contrary sentiments, such as a
tenderheartedness often as extreme as the ferocity.
</p><p>"They have the expansive sympathy and prompt sensibility of the
Parisian working man.  At the Abbaye, one of the federates, learning
that the prisoners had been left without water for twenty-six hours, was
bent on putting the gaoler to death, and would have done so but for the
prayers of the prisoners themselves.  When a prisoner is acquitted (by
the improvised tribunal) every one, guards and slaughterers included,
embraces him with transports of joy and applauds frantically," after
which the wholesale massacre is recommenced.  During its progress a
pleasant gaiety never ceases to reign.  There is dancing and singing
around the corpses, and benches are arranged "for the ladies," delighted
to witness the killing of aristocrats.  The exhibition continues,
moreover, of a special description of justice.
</p><p>A slaughterer at the Abbaye having complained that the ladies
placed at a little distance saw

<pb n="176"/>

badly, and that only a few of those
present had the pleasure of striking the aristocrats, the justice of the
observation is admitted, and it is decided that the victims shall be
made to pass slowly between two rows of slaughterers, who shall be under
the obligation to strike with the back of the sword only so as to
prolong the agony.  At the prison de la Force the victims are stripped
stark naked and literally "carved" for half an hour, after which, when
every one has had a good view, they are finished off by a blow that lays
bare their entrails.
</p><p>The slaughterers, too, have their scruples and exhibit that moral
sense whose existence in crowds we have already pointed out.  They
refuse to appropriate the money and jewels of the victims, taking them
to the table of the committees.
</p><p>Those rudimentary forms of reasoning, characteristic of the mind of
crowds, are always to be traced in all their acts.  Thus, after the
slaughter of the 1,200 or 1,500 enemies of the nation, some one makes
the remark, and his suggestion is at once adopted, that the other
prisons, those containing aged beggars, vagabonds, and young prisoners,
hold in reality useless mouths, of which it would be well on that
account to get rid.  Besides, among them there should certainly be
enemies of the people, a woman of the name of Delarue, for instance, the
widow of a poisoner:

<pb n="177"/>

"She must be furious at being in prison, if
she could she would set fire to Paris: she must have said so, she has
said so.  Another good riddance."  The demonstration appears convincing,
and the prisoners are massacred without exception, included in the
number being some fifty children of from twelve to seventeen years of
age, who, of course, might themselves have become enemies of the nation,
and of whom in consequence it was clearly well to be rid.
</p><p>At the end of a week's work, all these operations being brought to
an end, the slaughterers can think of reposing themselves.  Profoundly
convinced that they have deserved well of their country, they went to
the authorities and demanded a recompense.  The most zealous went so far
as to claim a medal.
</p><p>The history of the Commune of 1871 affords several facts analogous
to those which precede.  Given the growing influence of crowds and the
successive capitulations before them of those in authority, we are
destined to witness many others of a like nature.

<hi rend="italic">CRIMINAL JURIES.</hi><lb/>
</head>

<p>Criminal juries &mdash; General characteristics of juries &mdash; statistics show that
their decisions are independent of their composition &mdash; The manner in
which an impression may be made on juries &mdash; The style and influence of
argument &mdash; The methods of persuasion of celebrated counsel &mdash; The nature of
those crimes for which juries are respectively indulgent or severe &mdash; The
utility of the jury as an institution, and the danger that would result
from its place being taken by magistrates.

</p><p>BEING unable to study here every category of jury, I shall only examine
the most important &mdash; that of the juries of the Court of Assize.  These
juries afford an excellent example of the heterogeneous crowd that is
not anonymous.  We shall find them display suggestibility and but slight
capacity for reasoning, while they are open to the influence of the
leaders of crowds, and they are guided in the main by unconscious
sentiments.  In the course of this investigation we shall have occasion
to observe some interesting examples of

<pb n="179"/>

the errors that may be
made by persons not versed in the psychology of crowds.
</p><p>Juries, in the first place, furnish us a good example of the slight
importance of the mental level of the different elements composing a
crowd, so far as the decisions it comes to are concerned.  We have seen
that when a deliberative assembly is called upon to give its opinion on
a question of a character not entirely technical, intelligence stands
for nothing.  For instance, a gathering of scientific men or of artists,
owing to the mere fact that they form an assemblage, will not deliver
judgments on general subjects sensibly different from those rendered by
a gathering of masons or grocers.  At various periods, and in particular
previous to 1848, the French administration instituted a careful choice
among the persons summoned to form a jury, picking the jurors from among
the enlightened classes; choosing professors, functionaries, men of
letters, &amp;c.  At the present day jurors are recruited for the most part
from among small tradesmen, petty capitalists, and employ&eacute;s.  Yet, to
the great astonishment of specialist writers, whatever the composition
of the jury has been, its decisions have been identical.  Even the
magistrates, hostile as they are to the institution of the jury, have
had to recognise the exactness of the assertion.  M. B&eacute;rard des
Glajeux, a former President of the Court of Assizes, ex

<pb n="180"/>

presses
himself on the subject in his "Memoirs" in the following terms: &mdash;

</p><p>"The selection of jurymen is to-day in reality in the hands of the
municipal councillors, who put people down on the list or eliminate them
from it in accordance with the political and electoral preoccupations
inherent in their situation. . . .  The majority of the jurors chosen
are persons engaged in trade, but persons of less importance than
formerly, and employ&eacute;s belonging to certain branches of the
administration. . . .  Both opinions and professions counting for
nothing once the <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of judge assumed, many of the jurymen
having the ardour of neophytes, and men of the best intentions being
similarly disposed in humble situations, the spirit of the jury has not
changed: <hi rend="italic">its verdicts have remained the same."</hi>

</p><p>Of the passage just cited the conclusions, which are just, are to
be borne in mind and not the explanations, which are weak.  Too much
astonishment should not be felt at this weakness, for, as a rule,
counsel equally with magistrates seem to be ignorant of the psychology
of crowds and, in consequence, of juries.  I find a proof of this statement
in a fact related by the author just quoted.  He remarks that
Lachaud, one of the most illustrious barristers practising in the Court
of Assize,

<pb n="181"/>

made systematic use of his right to object to a juror in
the case of all individuals of intelligence on the list.  Yet
experience &mdash; and experience alone &mdash; has ended by acquainting us with the
utter uselessness of these objections.  This is proved by the fact that
at the present day public prosecutors and barristers, at any rate those
belonging to the Parisian bar, have entirely renounced their right to
object to a juror; still, as M. des Glajeux remarks, the verdicts have
not changed, "they are neither better nor worse."
</p><p>Like all crowds, juries are very strongly impressed by sentimental
considerations, and very slightly by argument.  "They cannot resist the
sight," writes a barrister, "of a mother giving its child the breast, or
of orphans."  "It is sufficient that a woman should be of agreeable
appearance," says M. des Glajeux, "to win the benevolence of the jury."
</p><p>Without pity for crimes of which it appears possible they might
themselves be the victims &mdash; such crimes, moreover, are the most dangerous
for society &mdash; juries, on the contrary, are very indulgent in the case of
breaches of the law whose motive is passion.  They are rarely severe on
infanticide by girl-mothers, or hard on the young woman who throws
vitriol at the man who has seduced and deserted her, for the reason that
they feel instinctively that society runs but slight danger

<pb n="182"/>

from
such crimes,<note><p>[24]</p></note> and that in a country in which the law does not protect
deserted girls the crime of the girl who avenges herself is rather
useful than harmful, inasmuch as it frightens future seducers in
advance.

</p><p>[24]</p><note><p>It is to be remarked, in passing, that this division of crimes
into those dangerous and those not dangerous for society, which is well
and instinctively made by juries is far from being unjust.  The object
of criminal laws is evidently to protect society against dangerous
criminals and not to avenge it.  On the other hand, the French code, and
above all the minds of the French magistrates, are still deeply imbued
with the spirit of vengeance characteristic of the old primitive law,
and the term <hi rend="italic">"vindicte"</hi> (prosecution, from the Latin
<hi rend="italic">vindicta</hi>, vengeance) is still in daily use.  A proof of this
tendency on the part of the magistrates is found in the refusal by many
of them to apply B&eacute;renger's law, which allows of a condemned person
not undergoing his sentence unless he repeats his crime.  Yet no
magistrate can be ignorant, for the fact is proved by statistics, that
the application of a punishment inflicted for the first time infallibly
leads to further crime on the part of the person punished.  When judges
set free a sentenced person it always seems to them that society has not
been avenged.  Rather than not avenge it they prefer to create a
dangerous, confirmed criminal. </p></note>

<p>Juries, like all crowds, are profoundly impressed by prestige, and
President des Glajeux very properly remarks that, very democratic as
juries are in their composition, they are very aristocratic in their
likes and dislikes:  "Name, birth, great wealth, celebrity, the
assistance of an illustrious counsel, everything in the nature of
distinction or that

<pb n="183"/>

lends brilliancy to the accused, stands him in
extremely good stead."
</p><p>The chief concern of a good counsel should be to work upon the
feelings of the jury, and, as with all crowds, to argue but little, or
only to employ rudimentary modes of reasoning.  An English barrister,
famous for his successes in the assize courts, has well set forth the
line of action to be followed: &mdash;

</p><p>"While pleading he would attentively observe the jury.  The most
favourable opportunity has been reached.  By dint of insight and
experience the counsel reads the effect of each phrase on the faces of
the jurymen, and draws his conclusions in consequence.  His first step
is to be sure which members of the jury are already favourable to his
cause.  It is short work to definitely gain their adhesion, and having
done so he turns his attention to the members who seem, on the contrary,
ill-disposed, and endeavours to discover why they are hostile to the
accused.  This is the delicate part of his task, for there may be an
infinity of reasons for condemning a man, apart from the sentiment of
justice."

</p><p>These few lines <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</hi> the entire mechanism of the art
of oratory, and we see why the speech prepared in advance has so slight
an effect, it

<pb n="184"/>

being necessary to be able to modify the terms
employed from moment to moment in accordance with the impression
produced.
</p><p>The orator does not require to convert to his views all the members
of a jury, but only the leading spirits among it who will determine the
general opinion.  As in all crowds, so in juries there are a small
number of individuals who serve as guides to the rest.  "I have found by
experience," says the counsel cited above, "that one or two energetic
men suffice to carry the rest of the jury with them."  It is those two
or three whom it is necessary to convince by skilful suggestions.  First
of all, and above all, it is necessary to please them.  The man forming
part of a crowd whom one has succeeded in pleasing is on the point of
being convinced, and is quite disposed to accept as excellent any
arguments that may be offered him.  I detach the following anecdote from
an interesting account of M. Lachaud, alluded to above: &mdash;

</p><p>"It is well known that during all the speeches he would deliver in
the course of an assize sessions, Lachaud never lost sight of the two or
three jurymen whom he knew or felt to be influential but obstinate.  As
a rule he was successful in winning over these refractory jurors.  On
one occasion, however, in the provinces, he had to deal with a

<pb n="185"/>

juryman whom he plied in vain for three-quarters of an hour with
his most cunning arguments; the man was the seventh juryman, the first
on the second bench.  The case was desperate.  Suddenly, in the middle
of a passionate demonstration, Lachaud stopped short, and addressing the
President of the court said:  `Would you give instructions for the
curtain there in front to be drawn?  The seventh juryman is blinded by
the sun.'  The juryman in question reddened, smiled, and expressed his
thanks.  He was won over for the defence."

</p><p>Many writers, some of them most distinguished, have started of late
a strong campaign against the institution of the jury, although it is
the only protection we have against the errors, really very frequent, of
a caste that is under no control.<note><p>[25]</p></note>  A

<pb n="186"/>

portion of these writers
advocate a jury recruited solely from the ranks of the enlightened
classes; but we have already proved that even in this case the verdicts
would be identical with those returned under the present system.  Other
writers, taking their stand on the errors committed by juries, would
abolish the jury and replace it by judges.  It is difficult to see how
these would-be reformers can forget that the errors for which the jury
is blamed were committed in the first instance by judges, and that when
the accused person comes before a jury he has already been held to be
guilty by several magistrates, by the <hi rend="italic">juge d'instruction</hi>, the
public prosecutor, and the Court of Arraignment.  It should thus be
clear that were the accused to be definitely judged by magistrates
instead of by jurymen, he would lose his only chance of being admitted
innocent.  The errors of juries have always been first of all the errors
of magistrates.  It is solely the magistrates, then, who should be
blamed when particularly monstrous judicial errors crop up, such, for
instance, as the

<pb n="187"/>

quite recent condemnation of Dr. L &mdash;  who,
prosecuted by a <hi rend="italic">juge d'instruction</hi>, of excessive stupidity, on
the strength of the denunciation of a half-idiot girl, who accused the
doctor of having performed an illegal operation upon her for thirty
francs, would have been sent to penal servitude but for an explosion of
public indignation, which had for result that he was immediately set at
liberty by the Chief of the State.  The honourable character given the
condemned man by all his fellow-citizens made the grossness of the
blunder self-evident.  The magistrates themselves admitted it, and yet
out of caste considerations they did all they could to prevent the
pardon being signed.  In all similar affairs the jury, confronted with
technical details it is unable to understand, naturally hearkens to the
public prosecutor, arguing that, after all, the affair has been investigated
by magistrates trained to unravel the most intricate situations.
Who, then, are the real authors of the error &mdash; the jurymen or the magistrates?
We should cling vigorously to the jury.  It constitutes,
perhaps, the only category of crowd that cannot be replaced by any
individuality.  It alone can temper the severity of the law, which,
equal for all, ought in principle to be blind and to take no cognisance
of particular cases.  Inaccessible to pity, and heeding nothing but the
text of the law, the judge in his professional severity

<pb n="188"/>

would visit
with the same penalty the burglar guilty of murder and the wretched girl
whom poverty and her abandonment by her seducer have driven to
infanticide.  The jury, on the other hand, instinctively feels that the
seduced girl is much less guilty than the seducer, who, however, is not
touched by the law, and that she deserves every indulgence.

</p><p>[25]</p>
<note><p>The magistracy is, in point of fact, the only administration
whose acts are under no control.  In spite of all its revolutions,
democratic France does not possess that right of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> of
which England is so proud.  We have banished all the tyrants, but have
set up a magistrate in each city who disposes at will of the honour and
liberty of the citizens.  An insignificant <hi rend="italic">juge d'instruction</hi> (an
examining magistrate who has no exact counterpart in England. &mdash;
<hi rend="italic">Trans.</hi>), fresh from the university, possesses the revolting power
of sending to prison at will persons of the most considerable standing,
on a simple supposition on his part of their guilt, and without being
obliged to justify his act to any one.  Under the pretext of pursuing
his investigation he can keep these persons in prison for six months or
even a year, and free them at last without owing them either an
indemnity or excuses.  The warrant in France is the exact equivalent of
the <hi rend="italic">lettre de cachet</hi>, with this difference, that the latter, with
the use of which the monarchy was so justly reproached, could only be
resorted to by persons occupying a very high position, while the warrant
is an instrument in the hands of a whole class of citizens which is far
from passing for being very enlightened or very independent. </p></note>

<p>Being well acquainted with the psychology of castes, and also with
the psychology of other categories of crowds, I do not perceive a single
case in which, wrongly accused of a crime, I should not prefer to have
to deal with a jury rather than with magistrates.  I should have some
chance that my innocence would be recognised by the former and not the
slightest chance that it would be admitted by the latter.  The power of
crowds is to be dreaded, but the power of certain castes is to be
dreaded yet more.  Crowds are open to conviction; castes never are.

<p>General characteristics of electoral crowds &mdash; The manner of persuading

Universal suffrage cannot be replaced in spite of its slight

same even if the right of voting were restricted to a limited class of
citizens &mdash; Of what universal suffrage is the expression in all countries.

</p><p>ELECTORAL crowds &mdash; that is to say, collectivities invested with the power
of electing the holders of certain functions &mdash; constitute heterogeneous
crowds, but as their action is confined to a single clearly determined
matter, namely, to choosing between different candidates, they present
only a few of the

<pb n="190"/>

characteristics previously described.  Of
the characteristics peculiar to crowds, they display in particular but
slight aptitude for reasoning, the absence of the critical spirit,
irritability, credulity, and simplicity.  In their decision, moreover,
is to be traced the influence of the leaders of crowds and the part
played by the factors we have enumerated: affirmation, repetition,
prestige, and contagion.
</p><p>Let us examine by what methods electoral crowds are to be
persuaded.  It will be easy to deduce their psychology from the methods
that are most successful.
</p><p>It is of primary importance that the candidate should possess
prestige. Personal prestige can only be replaced by that resulting from
wealth.  Talent and even genius are not elements of success of serious
importance.
</p><p>Of capital importance, on the other hand, is the necessity for the
candidate of possessing prestige, of being able, that is, to force
himself upon the electorate without discussion.  The reason why the
electors, of whom a majority are working men or peasants, so rarely
choose a man from their own ranks to represent them is that such a
person enjoys no prestige among them.  When, by chance, they do elect a
man who is their equal, it is as a rule for subsidiary reasons &mdash; for
instance, to spite an eminent man, or an influential employer of labour
on whom the elector is in daily dependence, and

<pb n="191"/>

whose master he has
the illusion he becomes in this way for a moment.
</p><p>The possession of prestige does not suffice, however, to assure the
success of a candidate.  The elector stickles in particular for the
flattery of his greed and vanity.  He must be overwhelmed with the most
extravagant blandishments, and there must be no hesitation in making him
the most fantastic promises.  If he is a working man it is impossible to
go too far in insulting and stigmatising employers of labour.  As for
the rival candidate, an effort must be made to destroy his chance by
establishing by dint of affirmation, repetition, and contagion that he
is an arrant scoundrel, and that it is a matter of common knowledge that
he has been guilty of several crimes.  It is, of course, useless to
trouble about any semblance of proof.  Should the adversary be ill-acquainted with the psychology of crowds he will try to justify himself
by arguments instead of confining himself to replying to one set of
affirmations by another; and he will have no chance whatever of being
successful.
</p><p>The candidate's written programme should not be too categorical,
since later on his adversaries might bring it up against him; in his
verbal programme, however, there cannot be too much exaggeration.  The
most important reforms may be fearlessly promised.  At the moment they
are

<pb n="192"/>

made these exaggerations produce a great effect, and they are
not binding for the future, it being a matter of constant observation
that the elector never troubles himself to know how far the candidate he
has returned has followed out the electoral programme he applauded, and
in virtue of which the election was supposed to have been secured.
</p><p>In what precedes, all the factors of persuasion which we have
described are to be recognised.  We shall come across them again in the
action exerted by words and formulas, whose magical sway we have already
insisted upon.  An orator who knows how to make use of these means of
persuasion can do what he will with a crowd.  Expressions such as
infamous capital, vile exploiters, the admirable working man, the
socialisation of wealth, &amp;c., always produce the same effect, although
already somewhat worn by use.  But the candidate who hits on a new
formula as devoid as possible of precise meaning, and apt in consequence
to flatter the most varied aspirations, infallibly obtains a success.
The sanguinary Spanish revolution of 1873 was brought about by one of
these magical phrases of complex meaning on which everybody can put his
own interpretation.  A contemporary writer has described the launching
of this phrase in terms that deserve to be quoted: &mdash;

</p><p>"The radicals have made the discovery that a

<pb n="193"/>

centralised
republic is a monarchy in disguise, and to humour them the Cortes had
unanimously proclaimed a <hi rend="italic">federal republic</hi>, though none of the
voters could have explained what it was he had just voted for.  This
formula, however, delighted everybody; the joy was intoxicating,
delirious.  The reign of virtue and happiness had just been inaugurated
on earth.  A republican whose opponent refused him the title of
federalist considered himself to be mortally insulted.  People addressed
each other in the streets with the words:  `Long live the federal
republic!'  After which the praises were sung of the mystic virtue of
the absence of discipline in the army, and of the autonomy of the
soldiers.  What was understood by the `federal republic?'  There were
those who took it to mean the emancipation of the provinces,
institutions akin to those of the United States and administrative
decentralisation; others had in view the abolition of all authority and
the speedy commencement of the great social liquidation.  The socialists
of Barcelona and Andalusia stood out for the absolute sovereignty of the
communes; they proposed to endow Spain with ten thousand independent
municipalities, to legislate on their own account, and their creation to
be accompanied by the suppression of the police and the army.  In the
southern provinces the insurrection was soon seen to spread from town to
town and village to village.

<pb n="194"/>

Directly a village had made its
<hi rend="italic">pronunciamento</hi> its first care was to destroy the telegraph wires
and the railway lines so as to cut off all communication with its
neighbours and Madrid.  The sorriest hamlet was determined to stand on
its own bottom.  Federation had given place to cantonalism, marked by
massacres, incendiarism, and every description of brutality, and bloody
saturnalia were celebrated throughout the length and breadth of the
land."

</p><p>With respect to the influence that may be exerted by reasoning on
the minds of electors, to harbour the least doubt on this subject can
only be the result of never having read the reports of an electioneering
meeting.  In such a gathering affirmations, invectives, and sometimes
blows are exchanged, but never arguments.  Should silence be established
for a moment it is because some one present, having the reputation of a
"tough customer," has announced that he is about to heckle the candidate
by putting him one of those embarrassing questions which are always the
joy of the audience.  The satisfaction, however, of the opposition party
is shortlived, for the voice of the questioner is soon drowned in the
uproar made by his adversaries.  The following reports of public
meetings, chosen from hundreds of similar examples, and taken from the
daily papers, may be considered as typical: &mdash;

<pb n="195"/>

</p><p>"One of the organisers of the meeting having asked the assembly to
elect a president, the storm bursts.  The anarchists leap on to the
platform to take the committee table by storm.  The socialists make an
energetic defence; blows are exchanged, and each party accuses the other
of being spies in the pay of the Government, &amp;c. . . .  A citizen leaves
the hall with a black eye.
</p><p>"The committee is at length installed as best it may be in the
midst of the tumult, and the right to speak devolves upon `Comrade' X.
</p><p>"The orator starts a vigorous attack on the socialists, who
interrupt him with shouts of `Idiot, scoundrel, blackguard!' &amp;c.,
epithets to which Comrade X. replies by setting forth a theory according
to which the socialists are `idiots' or `jokers.'"
</p><p>"The Allemanist party had organised yesterday evening, in the Hall
of Commerce, in the Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, a great meeting,
preliminary to the workers' <hi rend="italic">f&ecirc;te</hi> of the 1st of May.  The
watchword of the meeting was `Calm and Tranquillity!'
</p><p>"Comrade G &mdash;  alludes to the socialists as `idiots' and `humbugs.'
</p><p>"At these words there is an exchange of invectives and orators and
audience come to blows.  Chairs, tables, and benches are converted into
weapons," &amp;c., &amp;c.

</p><p>It is not to be imagined for a moment that this

<pb n="196"/>

description of
discussion is peculiar to a determined class of electors and dependent
on their social position.  In every anonymous assembly whatever, though
it be composed exclusively of highly educated persons, discussion always
assumes the same shape.  I have shown that when men are collected in a
crowd there is a tendency towards their mental levelling at work, and
proof of this is to be found at every turn.  Take, for example, the
following extract from a report of a meeting composed exclusively of
students, which I borrow from the <hi rend="italic">Temps</hi> of 13th of February,
1895: &mdash;

</p><p>"The tumult only increased as the evening went on; I do not believe
that a single orator succeeded in uttering two sentences without being
interrupted.  At every instant there came shouts from this or that
direction or from every direction at once.  Applause was intermingled
with hissing, violent discussions were in progress between individual
members of the audience, sticks were brandished threateningly, others
beat a tattoo on the floor, and the interrupters were greeted with yells
of `Put him out!' or `Let him speak!'
</p><p>"M. C &mdash;  lavished such epithets as odious and cowardly, monstrous,
vile, venal and vindictive, on the Association, which he declared he
wanted to destroy," &amp;c., &amp;c.

</p><p>How, it may be asked, can an elector form an

<pb n="197"/>

opinion under
such conditions?  To put such a question is to harbour a strange
delusion as to the measure of liberty that may be enjoyed by a
collectivity.  Crowds have opinions that have been imposed upon them,
but they never boast reasoned opinions.  In the case under consideration
the opinions and votes of the electors are in the hands of the election
committees, whose leading spirits are, as a rule, publicans, their
influence over the working men, to whom they allow credit, being great.
"Do you know what an election committee is?" writes M. Sch&eacute;rer, one
of the most valiant champions of present-day democracy.  "It is neither
more nor less than the corner-stone of our institutions, the masterpiece
of the political machine.  France is governed to-day by the election
committees."<note><p>[26]</p></note>

</p><p>[26]</p><note><p>Committees under whatever name, clubs, syndicates, &amp;c.,
constitute perhaps the most redoubtable danger resulting from the power
of crowds.  They represent in reality the most impersonal and, in
consequence, the most oppressive form of tyranny.  The leaders who
direct the committees being supposed to speak and act in the name of a
collectivity, are freed from all responsibility, and are in a position
to do just as they choose.  The most savage tyrant has never ventured
even to dream of such proscriptions as those ordained by the committees
of the Revolution.  Barras has declared that they decimated the
convention, picking off its members at their pleasure.  So long as he
was able to speak in their name, Robespierre wielded absolute power.
The moment this frightful dictator separated himself from them, for
reasons of personal pride, he was lost.  The reign of crowds is the
reign of committees, that is, of the leaders of crowds.  A severer
despotism cannot be imagined. </p></note>

<p>To exert an influence over them is not difficult, provided the
candidate be in himself acceptable and possess adequate financial
resources.  According to the admissions of the donors, three millions

<pb n="198"/>

of francs sufficed to secure the repeated elections of General
Boulanger.
</p><p>Such is the psychology of electoral crowds.  It is identical with
that of other crowds: neither better nor worse.
</p><p>In consequence I draw no conclusion against universal suffrage from
what precedes.  Had I to settle its fate, I should preserve it as it is
for practical reasons, which are to be deduced in point of fact from our
investigation of the psychology of crowds.  On this account I shall
proceed to set them forth.
</p><p>No doubt the weak side of universal suffrage is too obvious to be
overlooked.  It cannot be gainsaid that civilisation has been the work
of a small minority of superior intelligences constituting the
culminating point of a pyramid, whose stages, widening in proportion to
the decrease of mental power, represent the masses of a nation.  The
greatness of a civilisation cannot assuredly depend upon the votes given
by inferior elements boasting solely numerical strength.  Doubtless,

<pb n="199"/>

too, the votes recorded by crowds are often very dangerous.  They
have already cost us several invasions, and in view of the triumph of
socialism, for which they are preparing the way, it is probable that the
vagaries of popular sovereignty will cost us still more dearly.
</p><p>Excellent, however, as these objections are in theory, in practice
they lose all force, as will be admitted if the invincible strength be
remembered of ideas transformed into dogmas.  The dogma of the
sovereignty of crowds is as little defensible, from the philosophical
point of view, as the religious dogmas of the Middle Ages, but it enjoys
at present the same absolute power they formerly enjoyed.  It is as
unattackable in consequence as in the past were our religious ideas.
Imagine a modern freethinker miraculously transported into the midst of
the Middle Ages.  Do you suppose that, after having ascertained the
sovereign power of the religious ideas that were then in force, he would
have been tempted to attack them?  Having fallen into the hands of a
judge disposed to send him to the stake, under the imputation of having
concluded a pact with the devil, or of having been present at the
witches sabbath, would it have occurred to him to call in question the
existence of the devil or of the sabbath?  It were as wise to oppose
cyclones with discussion as the beliefs of crowds.  The

<pb n="200"/>

dogma of
universal suffrage possesses to-day the power the Christian dogmas
formerly possessed.  Orators and writers allude to it with a respect and
adulation that never fell to the share of Louis XIV.  In consequence the
same position must be taken up with regard to it as with regard to all
religious dogmas.  Time alone can act upon them.
</p><p>Besides, it would be the more useless to attempt to undermine this
dogma, inasmuch as it has an appearance of reasonableness in its favour.
"In an era of equality," Tocqueville justly remarks, "men have no faith
in each other on account of their being all alike; yet this same
similitude gives them an almost limitless confidence in the judgment of
the public, the reason being that it does not appear probable that, all
men being equally enlightened, truth and numerical superiority should
not go hand in hand."
</p><p>Must it be believed that with a restricted suffrage &mdash; a suffrage
restricted to those intellectually capable if it be desired &mdash; an
improvement would be effected in the votes of crowds?  I cannot admit
for a moment that this would be the case, and that for the reasons I
have already given touching the mental inferiority of all
collectivities, whatever their composition.  In a crowd men always tend
to the same level, and, on general questions, a vote, recorded by forty
academicians is no better than that of forty water-carriers.  I do

<pb n="201"/>

not in the least believe that any of the votes for which universal
suffrage is blamed &mdash; the re-establishment of the Empire, for instance &mdash;
would have fallen out differently had the voters been exclusively
recruited among learned and liberally educated men.  It does not follow
because an individual knows Greek or mathematics, is an architect, a
veterinary surgeon, a doctor, or a barrister, that he is endowed with a
special intelligence of social questions.  All our political economists
are highly educated, being for the most part professors or academicians,
yet is there a single general question &mdash; protection, bimetallism, &amp;c. &mdash; on
which they have succeeded in agreeing?  The explanation is that their
science is only a very attenuated form of our universal ignorance.  With
regard to social problems, owing to the number of unknown quantities
they offer, men are substantially, equally ignorant.
</p><p>In consequence, were the electorate solely composed of persons
stuffed with sciences their votes would be no better than those emitted
at present.  They would be guided in the main by their sentiments and by
party spirit.  We should be spared none of the difficulties we now have
to contend with, and we should certainly be subjected to the oppressive
tyranny of castes.
</p><p>Whether the suffrage of crowds be restricted or general, whether it
be exercised under a republic

<pb n="202"/>

or a monarchy, in France, in Belgium,
in Greece, in Portugal, or in Spain, it is everywhere identical; and,
when all is said and done, it is the expression of the unconscious
aspirations and needs of the race.  In each country the average opinions
of those elected represent the genius of the race, and they will be
found not to alter sensibly from one generation to another.
</p><p>It is seen, then, that we are confronted once more by the
fundamental notion of race, which we have come across so often, and on
this other notion, which is the outcome of the first, that institutions
and governments play but a small part in the life of a people.  Peoples
are guided in the main by the genius of their race, that is, by that
inherited residue of qualities of which the genius is the sum total.
Race and the slavery of our daily necessities are the mysterious master-causes that rule our destiny.

progressive curtailment of all liberty &mdash; Conclusion.

</p><p>IN parliamentary assemblies we have an example of heterogeneous crowds
that are not anonymous.

<pb n="204"/>

Although the mode of election of
their members varies from epoch to epoch, and from nation to nation,
they present very similar characteristics.  In this case the influence
of the race makes itself felt to weaken or exaggerate the
characteristics common to crowds, but not to prevent their manifestation.
The parliamentary assemblies of the most widely different
countries, of Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, and America
present great analogies in their debates and votes, and leave the
respective governments face to face with identical difficulties.
</p><p>Moreover, the parliamentary system represents the ideal of all
modern civilised peoples.  The system is the expression of the idea,
psychologically erroneous, but generally admitted, that a large
gathering of men is much more capable than a small number of coming to a
wise and independent decision on a given subject.
</p><p>The general characteristics of crowds are to be met with in
parliamentary assemblies: intellectual simplicity, irritability,
suggestibility, the exaggeration of the sentiments and the
preponderating influence of a few leaders.  In consequence, however, of
their special composition parliamentary crowds offer some distinctive
features, which we shall point out shortly.
</p><p>Simplicity in their opinions is one of their most important
characteristics.  In the case of all

<pb n="205"/>

parties, and more especially
so far as the Latin peoples are concerned, an invariable tendency is met
with in crowds of this kind to solve the most complicated social
problems by the simplest abstract principles and general laws applicable
to all cases.  Naturally the principles vary with the party; but owing
to the mere fact that the individual members are a part of a crowd, they
are always inclined to exaggerate the worth of their principles, and to
push them to their extreme consequences.  In consequence parliaments are
more especially representative of extreme opinions.
</p><p>The most perfect example of the ingenuous simplification of
opinions peculiar to assemblies is offered by the Jacobins of the French
Revolution.  Dogmatic and logical to a man, and their brains full of
vague generalities, they busied themselves with the application of
fixed-principles without concerning themselves with events.  It has been
said of them, with reason, that they went through the Revolution without
witnessing it.  With the aid of the very simple dogmas that served them
as guide, they imagined they could recast society from top to bottom,
and cause a highly refined civilisation to return to a very anterior
phase of the social evolution.  The methods they resorted to to realise
their dream wore the same stamp of absolute ingenuousness.  They
confined themselves, in reality, to destroying what stood in their way.

<pb n="206"/>

All of them, moreover &mdash; Girondists, the Men of the Mountain, the
Thermidorians, &amp;c. &mdash; were alike animated by the same spirit.
</p><p>Parliamentary crowds are very open to suggestion; and, as in the
case of all crowds, the suggestion comes from leaders possessing
prestige; but the suggestibility of parliamentary assemblies has very
clearly defined limits, which it is important to point out.
</p><p>On all questions of local or regional interest every member of an
assembly has fixed, unalterable opinions, which no amount of argument
can shake.  The talent of a Demosthenes would be powerless to change the
vote of a Deputy on such questions as protection or the privilege of
distilling alcohol, questions in which the interests of influential
electors are involved.  The suggestion emanating from these electors and
undergone before the time to vote arrives, sufficiently outweighs
suggestions from any other source to annul them and to maintain an
absolute fixity of opinion.<note><p>[27]</p></note>

</p><p>[27]</p><note><p>The following reflection of an English parliamentarian of long
experience doubtless applies to these opinions, fixed beforehand, and
rendered unalterable by electioneering necessities:  "During the fifty
years that I have sat at Westminster, I have listened to thousands of
speeches; but few of them have changed my opinion, not one of them has
changed my vote."</p></note>

<p>On general questions &mdash; the overthrow of a Cabinet, the imposition of
a tax, &amp;c. &mdash; there is no

<pb n="207"/>

longer any fixity of opinion, and the
suggestions of leaders can exert an influence, though not in quite the
same way as in an ordinary crowd.  Every party has its leaders, who
possess occasionally an equal influence.  The result is that the Deputy
finds himself placed between two contrary suggestions, and is inevitably
made to hesitate.  This explains how it is that he is often seen to vote
in contrary fashion in an interval of a quarter of an hour or to add to
a law an article which nullifies it; for instance, to withdraw from
employers of labour the right of choosing and dismissing their workmen,
and then to very nearly annul this measure by an amendment.
</p><p>It is for the same reason that every Chamber that is returned has
some very stable opinions, and other opinions that are very shifting.
On the whole, the general questions being the more numerous, indecision
is predominant in the Chamber &mdash; the indecision which results from the
ever-present fear of the elector, the suggestion received from whom is
always latent, and tends to counterbalance the influence of the leaders.
</p><p>Still, it is the leaders who are definitely the masters in those
numerous discussions, with regard to the subject-matter of which the
members of an assembly are without strong preconceived opinions.
</p><p>The necessity for these leaders is evident, since, under the name
of heads of groups, they are met

<pb n="208"/>

with in the assemblies of every
country.  They are the real rulers of an assembly.  Men forming a crowd
cannot do without a master, whence it results that the votes of an
assembly only represent, as a rule, the opinions of a small minority.
</p><p>The influence of the leaders is due in very small measure to the
arguments they employ, but in a large degree to their prestige.  The
best proof of this is that, should they by any circumstance lose their
prestige, their influence disappears.
</p><p>The prestige of these political leaders is individual, and
independent of name or celebrity: a fact of which M. Jules Simon gives
us some very curious examples in his remarks on the prominent men of the
Assembly of 1848, of which he was a member: &mdash;

</p><p>"Two months before he was all-powerful, Louis Napoleon was entirely
without the least importance.
</p><p>"Victor Hugo mounted the tribune.  He failed to achieve success.
He was listened to as F&eacute;lix Pyat was listened to, but he did not
obtain as much applause.  `I don't like his ideas,' Vaulabelle said to
me, speaking of F&eacute;lix Pyat,' but he is one of the greatest writers
and the greatest orator of France.'  Edgar Quinet, in spite of his
exceptional and powerful intelligence, was held in no esteem whatever.
He had been popular for awhile before

<pb n="209"/>

the opening of the Assembly;
in the Assembly he had no popularity.
</p><p>"The splendour of genius makes itself less felt in political
assemblies than anywhere else.  They only give heed to eloquence
appropriate to the time and place and to party services, not to services
rendered the country.  For homage to be rendered Lamartine in 1848 and
Thiers in 1871, the stimulant was needed of urgent, inexorable interest.
As soon as the danger was passed the parliamentary world forgot in the
same instant its gratitude and its fright."

</p><p>I have quoted the preceding passage for the sake of the facts it
contains, not of the explanations it offers, their psychology being
somewhat poor.  A crowd would at once lose its character of a crowd were
it to credit its leaders with their services, whether of a party nature
or rendered their country.  The crowd that obeys a leader is under the
influence of his prestige, and its submission is not dictated by any
sentiment of interest or gratitude.
</p><p>In consequence the leader endowed with sufficient prestige wields
almost absolute power.  The immense influence exerted during a long
series of years, thanks to his prestige, by a celebrated Deputy,<note><p>[28]</p></note>
beaten at the last general election in con

<pb n="210"/>

sequence of certain
financial events, is well known.  He had only to give the signal and
Cabinets were overthrown.  A writer has clearly indicated the scope of
his action in the following lines: &mdash;

</p><p>[28]</p><note><p>M. Clemenceau. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Note of the Translator.</hi></p></note>

<p>"It is due, in the main, to M. X &mdash;  that we paid three times as
dearly as we should have done for Tonkin, that we remained so long on a
precarious footing in Madagascar, that we were defrauded of an empire in
the region of the Lower Niger, and that we have lost the preponderating
situation we used to occupy in Egypt.  The theories of M. X &mdash;  have
cost us more territories than the disasters of Napoleon I."

</p><p>We must not harbour too bitter a grudge against the leader in
question.  It is plain that he has cost us very dear; but a great part
of his influence was due to the fact that he followed public opinion,
which, in colonial matters, was far from being at the time what it has
since become.  A leader is seldom in advance of public opinion; almost
always all he does is to follow it and to espouse all its errors.
</p><p>The means of persuasion of the leaders we are dealing with, apart
from their prestige, consist in the factors we have already enumerated
several times.  To make a skilful use of these resources a leader must
have arrived at a comprehension, at

<pb n="211"/>

least in an unconscious manner,
of the psychology of crowds, and must know how to address them.  He
should be aware, in particular, of the fascinating influence of words,
phrases, and images.  He should possess a special description of
eloquence, composed of energetic affirmations &mdash; unburdened with proofs &mdash;
and impressive images, accompanied by very summary arguments.  This is a
kind of eloquence that is met with in all assemblies, the English
Parliament included, the most serious though it is of all.

</p><p>"Debates in the House of Commons," says the English philosopher
Maine, "may be constantly read in which the entire discussion is
confined to an exchange of rather weak generalities and rather violent
personalities.  General formulas of this description exercise a
prodigious influence on the imagination of a pure democracy.  It will
always be easy to make a crowd accept general assertions, presented in
striking terms, although they have never been verified, and are perhaps
not susceptible of verification."

</p><p>Too much importance cannot be attached to the "striking terms"
alluded to in the above quotation.  We have already insisted, on several
occasions, on the special power of words and formulas.  They must be
chosen in such a way as to evoke very

<pb n="212"/>

vivid images.  The following
phrase, taken from a speech by one of the leaders of our assemblies,
affords an excellent example: &mdash;

</p><p>"When the same vessel shall bear away to the fever-haunted lands of
our penitentiary settlements the politician of shady reputation and the
anarchist guilty of murder, the pair will be able to converse together,
and they will appear to each other as the two complementary aspects of
one and the same state of society."

</p><p>The image thus evoked is very vivid, and all the adversaries of the
speaker felt themselves threatened by it.  They conjured up a double
vision of the fever-haunted country and the vessel that may carry them
away; for is it not possible that they are included in the somewhat ill-defined category of the politicians menaced?  They experienced the
lurking fear that the men of the Convention must have felt whom the
vague speeches of Robespierre threatened with the guillotine, and who,
under the influence of this fear, invariably yielded to him.
</p><p>It is all to the interest of the leaders to indulge in the most
improbable exaggerations.  The speaker of whom I have just cited a
sentence was able to affirm, without arousing violent protestations,
that bankers and priests had subsidised

<pb n="213"/>

the throwers of bombs, and
that the directors of the great financial companies deserve the same
punishment as anarchists.  Affirmations of this kind are always
effective with crowds.  The affirmation is never too violent, the
declamation never too threatening.  Nothing intimidates the audience
more than this sort of eloquence.  Those present are afraid that if they
protest they will be put down as traitors or accomplices.
</p><p>As I have said, this peculiar style of eloquence has ever been of
sovereign effect in all assemblies.  In times of crisis its power is
still further accentuated.  The speeches of the great orators of the
assemblies of the French Revolution are very interesting reading from
this point of view.  At every instant they thought themselves obliged to
pause in order to denounce crime and exalt virtue, after which they
would burst forth into imprecations against tyrants, and swear to live
free men or perish.  Those present rose to their feet, applauded
furiously, and then, calmed, took their seats again.
</p><p>On occasion, the leader may be intelligent and highly educated, but
the possession of these qualities does him, as a rule, more harm than
good.  By showing how complex things are, by allowing of explanation and
promoting comprehension, intelligence always renders its owner indulgent,
and blunts, in a large measure, that intensity and violence of
conviction needful for

<pb n="214"/>

apostles.  The great leaders of crowds of
all ages, and those of the Revolution in particular, have been of
lamentably narrow intellect; while it is precisely those whose
intelligence has been the most restricted who have exercised the
greatest influence.
</p><p>The speeches of the most celebrated of them, of Robespierre,
frequently astound one by their incoherence: by merely reading them no
plausible explanation is to be found of the great part played by the
powerful dictator: &mdash;

</p><p>"The commonplaces and redundancies of pedagogic eloquence and Latin
culture at the service of a mind childish rather than undistinguished,
and limited in its notions of attack and defence to the defiant attitude
of schoolboys.  Not an idea, not a happy turn of phrase, or a telling
hit: a storm of declamation that leaves us bored.  After a dose of this
unexhilarating reading one is attempted to exclaim `Oh!' with the
amiable Camille Desmoulins."

</p><p>It is terrible at times to think of the power that strong
conviction combined with extreme narrowness of mind gives a man
possessing prestige.  It is none the less necessary that these
conditions should be satisfied for a man to ignore obstacles and display
strength of will in a high measure.

<pb n="215"/>

Crowds instinctively recognise
in men of energy and conviction the masters they are always in need of.
</p><p>In a parliamentary assembly the success of a speech depends almost
solely on the prestige possessed by the speaker, and not at all on the
arguments he brings forward.  The best proof of this is that when for
one cause or another a speaker loses his prestige, he loses
simultaneously all his influence, that is, his power of influencing
votes at will.
</p><p>When an unknown speaker comes forward with a speech containing good
arguments, but only arguments, the chances are that he will only obtain
a hearing.  A Deputy who is a psychologist of insight, M. Desaubes, has
recently traced in the following lines the portrait of the Deputy who
lacks prestige: &mdash;

</p><p>"When he takes his place in the tribune he draws a document from
his portfolio, spreads it out methodically before him, and makes a start
with assurance.
</p><p>"He flatters himself that he will implant in the minds of his
audience the conviction by which he is himself animated.  He has weighed
and reweighed his arguments; he is well primed with figures and proofs;
he is certain he will convince his hearers.  In the face of the evidence
he is to

<pb n="216"/>

adduce all resistance would be futile.  He begins,
confident in the justice of his cause, and relying upon the attention of
his colleagues, whose only anxiety, of course, is to subscribe to the
truth.
</p><p>"He speaks, and is at once surprised at the restlessness of the
House, and a little annoyed by the noise that is being made.
</p><p>"How is it silence is not kept?  Why this general inattention?
What are those Deputies thinking about who are engaged in conversation?
What urgent motive has induced this or that Deputy to quit his seat?
</p><p>"An expression of uneasiness crosses his face; he frowns and stops.
Encouraged by the Presisident, he begins again, raising his voice.
He is only listened to all the less.  He lends emphasis to his words,
and gesticulates: the noise around him increases.  He can no longer hear
himself, and again stops; finally, afraid that his silence may provoke
the dreaded cry, `The Closure!' he starts off again.  The clamour
becomes unbearable."

</p><p>When parliamentary assemblies reach a certain pitch of excitement
they become identical with ordinary heterogeneous crowds, and their
sentiments in consequence present the peculiarity of being always
extreme.  They will be seen to commit acts of the greatest heroism or
the worst

<pb n="217"/>

excesses.  The individual is no longer himself, and so
entirely is this the case that he will vote measures most adverse to his
personal interests.
</p><p>The history of the French Revolution shows to what an extent
assemblies are capable of losing their self-consciousness, and of
obeying suggestions most contrary to their interests.  It was an
enormous sacrifice for the nobility to renounce its privileges, yet it
did so without hesitation on a famous night during the sittings of the
Constituant Assembly.  By renouncing their inviolability the men of the
Convention placed themselves under a perpetual menace of death and yet
they took this step, and were not afraid to decimate their own ranks,
though perfectly aware that the scaffold to which they were sending
their colleagues to-day might be their own fate to-morrow.  The truth is
they had attained to that completely automatic state which I have
described elsewhere, and no consideration would hinder them from
yielding to the suggestions by which they were hypnotised.  The
following passage from the memoirs of one of them, Billaud-Varennes, is
absolutely typical on this score:  "The decisions with which we have
been so reproached," he says, <hi rend="italic">"were not desired by us two days, a
single day before they were taken: it was the crisis and nothing else
that gave rise to them."</hi>  Nothing can be more accurate.

<pb n="218"/>

</p><p>The same phenomena of unconsciousness were to be witnessed during
all the stormy sittings of the Convention.

</p><p>"They approved and decreed measures," says Taine, "which they held
in horror &mdash; measures which were not only stupid and foolish, but measures
that were crimes &mdash; the murder of innocent men, the murder of their
friends.  The Left, supported by the Right, unanimously and amid loud
applause, sent to the scaffold Danton, its natural chief, and the great
promoter and leader of the Revolution.  Unanimously and amid the
greatest applause the Right, supported by the Left, votes the worst
decrees of the revolutionary government.  Unanimously and amid cries of
admiration and enthusiasm, amid demonstrations of passionate sympathy
for Collot d'Herbois, Couthon, and Robespierre, the Convention by
spontaneous and repeated re-elections keeps in office the homicidal
government which the Plain detests because it is homicidal, and the
Mountain detests because it is decimated by it.  The Plain and the
Mountain, the majority and the minority, finish by consenting to help on
their own suicide.  The 22 Prairial the entire Convention offered itself
to the executioner; the 8 Thermidor, during the first quarter of an hour
that followed Robespierre's speech, it did the same thing again."

<pb n="219"/>

</p><p>This picture may appear sombre.  Yet it is accurate.  Parliamentary
assemblies, sufficiently excited and hypnotised, offer the same characteristics.
They become an unstable flock, obedient to every impulsion.
The following description of the Assembly of 1848 is due to M. Spuller,
a parliamentarian whose faith in democracy is above suspicion.  I
reproduce it from the <hi rend="italic">Revue litt&eacute;raire</hi>, and it is thoroughly
typical.  It offers an example of all the exaggerated sentiments which I
have described as characteristic of crowds, and of that excessive
changeableness which permits of assemblies passing, from moment to
moment, from one set of sentiments to another entirely opposite.

</p><p>"The Republican party was brought to its perdition by its
divisions, its jealousies, its suspicions, and, in turn, its blind
confidence and its limitless hopes.  Its ingenuousness and candour were
only equalled by its universal mistrust.  An absence of all sense of
legality, of all comprehension of discipline, together with boundless
terrors and illusions; the peasant and the child are on a level in these
respects.  Their calm is as great as their impatience; their ferocity is
equal to their docility.  This condition is the natural consequence of a
temperament that is not formed and of the lack of education.  Nothing
astonishes such persons, and everything disconcerts them.  Trembling
with

<pb n="220"/>

fear or brave to the point of heroism, they would go through
fire and water or fly from a shadow.
</p><p>"They are ignorant of cause and effect and of the connecting links
between events.  They are as promptly discouraged as they are exalted,
they are subject to every description of panic, they are always either
too highly strung or too downcast, but never in the mood or the measure
the situation would require.  More fluid than water they reflect every
line and assume every shape.  What sort of a foundation for a government
can they be expected to supply?"

</p><p>Fortunately all the characteristics just described as to be met
with in parliamentary assemblies are in no wise constantly displayed.
Such assemblies only constitute crowds at certain moments.  The
individuals composing them retain their individuality in a great number
of cases, which explains how it is that an assembly is able to turn out
excellent technical laws.  It is true that the author of these laws is a
specialist who has prepared them in the quiet of his study, and that in
reality the law voted is the work of an individual and not of an
assembly.  These laws are naturally the best.  They are only liable to
have disastrous results when a series of amendments has converted them
into the outcome of a collective effort.  The work of a crowd is always
inferior,

<pb n="221"/>

whatever its nature, to that of an isolated individual.
It is specialists who safeguard assemblies from passing ill-advised or
unworkable measures.  The specialist in this case is a temporary leader
of crowds.  The Assembly is without influence on him, but he has
influence over the Assembly.
</p><p>In spite of all the difficulties attending their working,
parliamentary assemblies are the best form of government mankind has
discovered as yet, and more especially the best means it has found to
escape the yoke of personal tyrannies.  They constitute assuredly the
ideal government at any rate for philosophers, thinkers, writers,
artists, and learned men &mdash; in a word, for all those who form the cream of
a civilisation.
</p><p>Moreover, in reality they only present two serious dangers, one
being inevitable financial waste, and the other the progressive
restriction of the liberty of the individual.
</p><p>The first of these dangers is the necessary consequence of the
exigencies and want of foresight of electoral crowds.  Should a member
of an assembly propose a measure giving apparent satisfaction to
democratic ideas, should he bring in a Bill, for instance, to assure
old-age pensions to all workers, and to increase the wages of any class
of State employ&eacute;s, the other Deputies, victims of suggestion in their
dread of their electors, will

<pb n="222"/>

not venture to seem to disregard the
interests of the latter by rejecting the proposed measure, although well
aware they are imposing a fresh strain on the Budget and necessitating
the creation of new taxes.  It is impossible for them to hesitate to
give their votes.  The consequences of the increase of expenditure are
remote and will not entail disagreeable consequences for them personally,
while the consequences of a negative vote might clearly come to
light when they next present themselves for re-election.
</p><p>In addition to this first cause of an exaggerated expenditure there
is another not less imperative &mdash; the necessity of voting all grants for
local purposes.  A Deputy is unable to oppose grants of this kind
because they represent once more the exigencies of the electors, and
because each individual Deputy can only obtain what he requires for his
own constituency on the condition of acceding to similar demands on the
part of his colleagues.<note><p>[29]</p></note>

</p><p>[29]</p><note><p>In its issue of April 6, 1895, the <hi rend="italic">Economiste</hi> published
a curious review of the figures that may be reached by expenditure
caused solely by electoral considerations, and notably of the outlay on
railways.  To put Langayes (a town of 3,000 inhabitants, situated on a
mountain) in communication with Puy, a railway is voted that will cost
15 millions of francs.  Seven millions are to be spent to put Beaumont
(3,500 inhabitants) in communication with Castel-Sarrazin; 7 millions to
put Oust (a village of 523 inhabitants) in communication with Seix
(1,200 inhabitants); 6 millions to put Prade in communication with the
hamlet of Olette (747 inhabitants), &amp;c.  In 1895 alone 90 millions of
francs were voted for railways of only local utility.  There is other no
less important expenditure necessitated also by electioneering
considerations.  The law instituting workingmen's pensions will soon
involve a minimum annual outlay of 165 millions, according to the
Minister of Finance, and of 800 millions according to the academician M.
Leroy-Beaulieu.  It is evident that the continued growth of expenditure
of this kind must end in bankruptcy.  Many European countries &mdash; Portugal,
Greece, Spain, Turkey &mdash; have reached this stage, and others, such as
Italy, will soon be reduced to the same extremity.  Still too much alarm
need not be felt at this state of things, since the public has
successively consented to put up with the reduction of four-fifths in
the payment of their coupons by these different countries.  Bankruptcy
under these ingenious conditions allows the equilibrium of Budgets
difficult to balance to be instantly restored.  Moreover, wars,
socialism, and economic conflicts hold in store for us a profusion of
other catastrophes in the period of universal disintegration we are
traversing, and it is necessary to be resigned to living from hand to
mouth without too much concern for a future we cannot control.</p></note>

<pb n="223"/>

<p>The second of the dangers referred to above &mdash; the inevitable
restrictions on liberty consummated by parliamentary assemblies &mdash; is
apparently less obvious, but is, nevertheless, very real.  It is the
result of the innumerable laws &mdash; having always a restrictive action &mdash;
which parliaments consider themselves obliged to vote and to whose
consequences, owing to their shortsightedness, they are in a great
measure blind.
</p><p>The danger must indeed be most inevitable, since even England
itself, which assuredly offers

<pb n="224"/>

the most popular type of the
parliamentary <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>, the type in which the representative is
most independent of his elector, has been unable to escape it.  Herbert
Spencer has shown, in a work already old, that the increase of apparent
liberty must needs be followed by the decrease of real liberty.
Returning to this contention in his recent book, "The Individual
<hi rend="italic">versus</hi> the State," he thus expresses himself with regard to the
English Parliament: &mdash;

</p><p>"Legislation since this period has followed the course, I pointed
out.  Rapidly multiplying dictatorial measures have continually tended
to restrict individual liberties, and this in two ways.  Regulations
have been established every year in greater number, imposing a
constraint on the citizen in matters in which his acts were formerly
completely free, and forcing him to accomplish acts which he was
formerly at liberty to accomplish or not to accomplish at will.  At the
same time heavier and heavier public, and especially local, burdens have
still further restricted his liberty by diminishing the portion of his
profits he can spend as he chooses, and by augmenting the portion which
is taken from him to be spent according to the good pleasure of the
public authorities."

</p><p>This progressive restriction of liberties shows

<pb n="225"/>

itself in
every country in a special shape which Herbert Spencer has not pointed
out; it is that the passing of these innumerable series of legislative
measures, all of them in a general way of a restrictive order, conduces
necessarily to augment the number, the power, and the influence of the
functionaries charged with their application.  These functionaries tend
in this way to become the veritable masters of civilised countries.
Their power is all the greater owing to the fact that, amidst the
incessant transfer of authority, the administrative caste is alone in
being untouched by these changes, is alone in possessing irresponsibility,
impersonality, and perpetuity.  There is no more oppressive
despotism than that which presents itself under this triple form.
</p><p>This incessant creation of restrictive laws and regulations,
surrounding the pettiest actions of existence with the most complicated
formalities, inevitably has for its result the confining within narrower
and narrower limits of the sphere in which the citizen may move freely.
Victims of the delusion that equality and liberty are the better assured
by the multiplication of laws, nations daily consent to put up with
trammels increasingly burdensome.  They do not accept this legislation
with impunity.  Accustomed to put up with every yoke, they soon end by
desiring servitude, and lose all spontaneousness and energy.  They are
then no

<pb n="226"/>

more than vain shadows, passive, unresisting and powerless
automata.
</p><p>Arrived at this point, the individual is bound to seek outside
himself the forces he no longer finds within him.  The functions of
governments necessarily increase in proportion as the indifference and
helplessness of the citizens grow.  They it is who must necessarily
exhibit the initiative, enterprising, and guiding spirit in which
private persons are lacking.  It falls on them to undertake everything,
direct everything, and take everything under their protection.  The
State becomes an all-powerful god.  Still experience shows that the
power of such gods was never either very durable or very strong.
</p><p>This progressive restriction of all liberties in the case of
certain peoples, in spite of an outward license that gives them the
illusion that these liberties are still in their possession, seems at
least as much a consequence of their old age as of any particular
system.  It constitutes one of the precursory symptoms of that decadent
phase which up to now no civilisation has escaped.
</p><p>Judging by the lessons of the past, and by the symptoms that strike
the attention on every side, several of our modern civilisations have
reached that phase of extreme old age which precedes decadence.  It
seems inevitable that all peoples should pass through identical phases
of existence,

<pb n="227"/>

since history is so often seen to repeat its course.
</p><p>It is easy to note briefly these common phases of the evolution of
civilisations, and I shall terminate this work with a summary of them.
This rapid sketch will perhaps throw some gleams of light on the causes
of the power at present wielded by crowds.

</p><p>If we examine in their main lines the genesis of the greatness and
of the fall of the civilisations that preceded our own, what do we see?
</p><p>At the dawn of civilisation a swarm of men of various origin,
brought together by the chances of migrations, invasions, and conquests.
Of different blood, and of equally different languages and beliefs, the
only common bond of union between these men is the half-recognised law
of a chief.  The psychological characteristics of crowds are present in
an eminent degree in these confused agglomerations.  They have the
transient cohesion of crowds, their heroism, their weaknesses, their
impulsiveness, and their violence.  Nothing is stable in connection with
them.  They are barbarians.
</p><p>At length time accomplishes its work.  The identity of
surroundings, the repeated intermingling of races, the necessities of
life in common exert their influence.  The assemblage of dissimilar
units begins

<pb n="228"/>

to blend into a whole, to form a race; that is, an
aggregate possessing common characteristics and sentiments to which
heredity will give greater and greater fixity.  The crowd has become a
people, and this people is able to emerge from its barbarous state.
However, it will only entirely emerge therefrom when, after long
efforts, struggles necessarily repeated, and innumerable
recommencements, it shall have acquired an ideal.  The nature of this
ideal is of slight importance; whether it be the cult of Rome, the might
of Athens, or the triumph of Allah, it will suffice to endow all the
individuals of the race that is forming with perfect unity of sentiment
and thought.
</p><p>At this stage a new civilisation, with its institutions, its
beliefs, and its arts, may be born.  In pursuit of its ideal, the race
will acquire in succession the qualities necessary to give it splendour,
vigour, and grandeur.  At times no doubt it will still be a crowd, but
henceforth, beneath the mobile and changing characteristics of crowds,
is found a solid substratum, the genius of the race which confines
within narrow limits the transformations of a nation and overrules the
play of chance.
</p><p>After having exerted its creative action, time begins that work of
destruction from which neither gods nor men escape.  Having reached a
certain level of strength and complexity a civilisation ceases to grow,
and having ceased to grow it is

<pb n="229"/>

condemned to a speedy decline.  The
hour of its old age has struck.
</p><p>This inevitable hour is always marked by the weakening of the ideal
that was the mainstay of the race.  In proportion as this ideal pales
all the religious, political, and social structures inspired by it begin
to be shaken.
</p><p>With the progressive perishing of its ideal the race loses more and
more the qualities that lent it its cohesion, its unity, and its
strength.  The personality and intelligence of the individual may
increase, but at the same time this collective egoism of the race is
replaced by an excessive development of the egoism of the individual,
accompanied by a weakening of character and a lessening of the capacity
for action.  What constituted a people, a unity, a whole, becomes in the
end an agglomeration of individualities lacking cohesion, and artificially
held together for a time by its traditions and institutions.
It is at this stage that men, divided by their interests and
aspirations, and incapable any longer of self-government, require
directing in their pettiest acts, and that the State exerts an absorbing
influence.
</p><p>With the definite loss of its old ideal the genius of the race
entirely disappears; it is a mere swarm of isolated individuals and
returns to its original state &mdash; that of a crowd.  Without consistency and
without a future, it has all the transitory characteristics

<pb n="230"/>

of
crowds.  Its civilisation is now without stability, and at the mercy of
every chance.  The populace is sovereign, and the tide of barbarism
mounts.  The civilisation may still seem brilliant because it possesses
an outward front, the work of a long past, but it is in reality an
edifice crumbling to ruin, which nothing supports, and destined to fall
in at the first storm.
</p><p>To pass in pursuit of an ideal from the barbarous to the civilised
state, and then, when this ideal has lost its virtue, to decline and
die, such is the cycle of the life of a people.
