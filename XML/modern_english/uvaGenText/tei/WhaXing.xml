<p>MRS. BALLINGER is one of the ladies who pursue Culture in bands, as 
though it were dangerous to meet alone.  To this end she had 
founded the Lunch Club, an association composed of herself and 
several other indomitable huntresses of erudition.  The Lunch Club, 
after three or four winters of lunching and debate, had acquired 
such local distinction that the entertainment of distinguished 
strangers became one of its accepted functions; in recognition of 
which it duly extended to the celebrated "Osric Dane," on the day 
of her arrival in Hillbridge, an invitation to be present at the 
next meeting. 
</p><p>The Club was to meet at Mrs. Ballinger's.  The other members, 
behind her back, were of one voice in deploring her unwillingness 
to cede her rights in favor of Mrs. Plinth, whose house made a more 
impressive setting for the entertainment of celebrities; while, as 
Mrs. Leveret observed, there was always the picture-gallery to fall 
back on. 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth made no secret of sharing this view.  She had 
always regarded it as one of her obligations to entertain the Lunch 
Club's distinguished guests.  Mrs. Plinth was almost as proud of 
her obligations as she was of her picture-gallery; she was in fact 
fond of implying that the one possession implied the other, and 
that only a woman of her wealth could afford to live up to a 
standard as high as that which she had set herself.  An all-round 
sense of duty, roughly adaptable to various ends, was, in her 
opinion, all that Providence exacted of the more humbly stationed; 
but the power which had predestined Mrs. Plinth to keep footmen 
clearly intended her to maintain an equally specialized staff of 
responsibilities.  It was the more to be regretted that Mrs. 
Ballinger, whose obligations to society were bounded by the narrow 
scope of two parlour-maids, should have been so tenacious of the 
right to entertain Osric Dane. 
</p><p>The question of that lady's reception had for a month past 
profoundly moved the members of the Lunch Club.  It was not that 
they felt themselves unequal to the task, but that their sense of 
the opportunity plunged them into the agreeable uncertainty of the 
lady who weighs the alternatives of a well-stocked wardrobe.  If 
such subsidiary members as Mrs. Leveret were fluttered by the 
thought of exchanging ideas with the author of "The Wings of 
Death," no forebodings of the kind disturbed the conscious adequacy 
of Mrs. Plinth, Mrs. Ballinger and Miss Van Vluyck.  "The Wings of 
Death" had, in fact, at Miss Van Vluyck's suggestion, been chosen 
as the subject of discussion at the last club meeting, and each 
member had thus been enabled to express her own opinion or to 
appropriate whatever seemed most likely to be of use in the 
comments of the others.  Mrs. Roby alone had abstained from 
profiting by the opportunity thus offered; but it was now openly 
recognised that, as a member of the Lunch Club, Mrs. Roby was a 
failure.  "It all comes," as Miss Van Vluyck put it, "of accepting 
a woman on a man's estimation."  Mrs. Roby, returning to Hillbridge 
from a prolonged sojourn in exotic regions&mdash;the other ladies no 
longer took the trouble to remember where&mdash;had been emphatically 
commended by the distinguished biologist, Professor Foreland, as 
the most agreeable woman he had ever met; and the members of the 
Lunch Club, awed by an encomium that carried the weight of a 
diploma, and rashly assuming that the Professor's social sympathies 
would follow the line of his scientific bent, had seized the chance 
of annexing a biological member.  Their disillusionment was 
complete.  At Miss Van Vluyck's first off-hand mention of the 
pterodactyl Mrs. Roby had confusedly murmured: "I know so little 
about metres&mdash;" and after that painful betrayal of incompetence she 
had prudently withdrawn from farther participation in the mental 
gymnastics of the club. <pb n="685"/>  
</p><p>"I suppose she flattered him," Miss Van Vluyck summed up&mdash;"or 
else it's the way she does her hair." 
</p><p>The dimensions of Miss Van Vluyck's dining-room having 
restricted the membership of the club to six, the non-conductiveness of one member was a serious obstacle to the exchange 
of ideas, and some wonder had already been expressed that Mrs. Roby 
should care to live, as it were, on the intellectual bounty of the 
others.  This feeling was augmented by the discovery that she had 
not yet read "The Wings of Death."  She owned to having heard the 
name of Osric Dane; but that&mdash;incredible as it appeared&mdash;was the 
extent of her acquaintance with the celebrated novelist.  The 
ladies could not conceal their surprise, but Mrs. Ballinger, whose 
pride in the club made her wish to put even Mrs. Roby in the best 
possible light, gently insinuated that, though she had not had time 
to acquaint herself with "The Wings of Death," she must at least be 
familiar with its equally remarkable predecessor, "The Supreme 
Instant." 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby wrinkled her sunny brows in a conscientious effort 
of memory, as a result of which she recalled that, oh, yes, she <hi rend="italic">
had</hi> seen the book at her brother's, when she was staying with him 
in Brazil, and had even carried it off to read one day on a boating 
party; but they had all got to shying things at each other in the 
boat, and the book had gone overboard, so she had never had the 
chance&mdash; 
</p><p>The picture evoked by this anecdote did not advance Mrs. 
Roby's credit with the club, and there was a painful pause, which 
was broken by Mrs. Plinth's remarking: "I can understand that, with 
all your other pursuits, you should not find much time for reading; 
but I should have thought you might at least have <hi rend="italic"> got up</hi> 'The 
Wings of Death' before Osric Dane's arrival." 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby took this rebuke good-humouredly.  She had meant, 
she owned to glance through the book; but she had been so absorbed 
in a novel of Trollope's that&mdash; 
</p><p>"No one reads Trollope now," Mrs. Ballinger interrupted 
impatiently. 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby looked pained.  "I'm only just beginning," she 
confessed. 
</p><p>"And does he interest you?" Mrs. Plinth inquired. 
</p><p>"He amuses me." 
</p><p>"Amusement," said Mrs. Plinth sententiously, "is hardly what 
I look for in my choice of books." 
</p><p>"Oh, certainly, 'The Wings of Death' is not amusing," ventured 
Mrs. Leveret, whose manner of putting forth an opinion was like 
that of an obliging salesman with a variety of other styles to 
submit if his first selection does not suit. 
</p><p>"Was it <hi rend="italic"> meant</hi> to be?" enquired Mrs. Plinth, who was fond 
of asking questions that she permitted no one but herself to 
answer.  "Assuredly not." 
</p><p>"Assuredly not&mdash;that is what I was going to say," assented 
Mrs. Leveret, hastily rolling up her opinion and reaching for 
another.  "It was meant to&mdash;to elevate." 
</p><p>Miss Van Vluyck adjusted her spectacles as though they were 
the black cap of condemnation.  "I hardly see," she interposed, 
"how a book steeped in the bitterest pessimism can be said to 
elevate, however much it may instruct." 
</p><p>"I meant, of course, to instruct," said Mrs. Leveret, flurried 
by the unexpected distinction between two terms which she had 
supposed to be synonymous.  Mrs. Leveret's enjoyment of the Lunch 
Club was frequently marred by such surprises; and not knowing her 
own value to the other ladies as a mirror for their mental 
complacency she was sometimes troubled by a doubt of her worthiness 
to join in their debates.  It was only the fact of having a dull 
sister who thought her clever that saved her from a sense of 
hopeless inferiority. 
</p><p>"Do they get married in the end?" Mrs. Roby interposed. 
</p><p>"They&mdash;who?" the Lunch Club collectively exclaimed. 
</p><p>"Why, the girl and man.  It's a novel, isn't it?  I always 
think that's the one thing that matters.  If they're parted it 
spoils my dinner." 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth and Mrs. Ballinger exchanged scandalised glances, 
and the latter said: "I should hardly advise you to read 'The Wings 
of Death,' in that spirit.  For my part, when there are so many 
books that one <hi rend="italic"> has</hi> to read, I wonder how any one can find time 
for those that are merely amusing." 
</p><p>"The beautiful part of it," Laura Glyde murmured, "is surely 
just this&mdash;that no one can tell <hi rend="italic"> how</hi> 'The Wings of Death' ends. 
<pb n="686"/>  Osric Dane, overcome by the dread significance of her own 
meaning, has mercifully veiled it&mdash;perhaps even from herself&mdash;as 
Apelles, in representing the sacrifice of Iphigenia, veiled the 
face of Agamemnon." 
</p><p>"What's that?  Is it poetry?" whispered Mrs. Leveret nervously 
to Mrs. Plinth, who, disdaining a definite reply, said coldly: "You 
should look it up.  I always make it a point to look things up."  
Her tone added&mdash;"though I might easily have it done for me by the 
footman." 
</p><p>"I was about to say," Miss Van Vluyck resumed, "that it must 
always be a question whether a book <hi rend="italic"> can</hi> instruct unless it 
elevates." 
</p><p>"Oh&mdash;" murmured Mrs. Leveret, now feeling herself hopelessly 
astray. 
</p><p>"I don't know," said Mrs. Ballinger, scenting in Miss Van 
Vluyck's tone a tendency to depreciate the coveted distinction of 
entertaining Osric Dane; "I don't know that such a question can 
seriously be raised as to a book which has attracted more attention 
among thoughtful people than any novel since 'Robert Elsmere.'" 
</p><p>"Oh, but don't you see," exclaimed Laura Glyde, "that it's 
just the dark hopelessness of it all&mdash;the wonderful tone-scheme of 
black on black&mdash;that makes it such an artistic achievement?  It 
reminded me so when I read it of Prince Rupert's <hi rend="italic"> maniere noire</hi> 
. . . the book is etched, not painted, yet one feels the colour 
values so intensely . . ." 
</p><p>"Who is <hi rend="italic"> he?"</hi> Mrs. Leveret whispered to her neighbour.  
"Some one she's met abroad?" 
</p><p>"The wonderful part of the book," Mrs. Ballinger conceded, "is 
that it may be looked at from so many points of view.  I hear that 
as a study of determinism Professor Lupton ranks it with 'The Data 
of Ethics.'" 
</p><p>"I'm told that Osric Dane spent ten years in preparatory 
studies before beginning to write it," said Mrs. Plinth.  "She 
looks up everything&mdash;verifies everything.  It has always been my 
principle, as you know.  Nothing would induce me, now, to put aside 
a book before I'd finished it, just because I can buy as many more 
as I want." 
</p><p>"And what do <hi rend="italic"> you</hi> think of 'The Wings of Death'?" Mrs. Roby 
abruptly asked her. 
</p><p>It was the kind of question that might be termed out of order, 
and the ladies glanced at each other as though disclaiming any 
share in such a breach of discipline.  They all knew that there was 
nothing Mrs. Plinth so much disliked as being asked her opinion of 
a book.  Books were written to read; if one read them what more 
could be expected?  To be questioned in detail regarding the 
contents of a volume seemed to her as great an outrage as being 
searched for smuggled laces at the Custom House.  The club had 
always respected this idiosyncrasy of Mrs. Plinth's.  Such opinions 
as she had were imposing and substantial: her mind, like her house, 
was furnished with monumental "pieces" that were not meant to be 
suddenly disarranged; and it was one of the unwritten rules of the 
Lunch Club that, within her own province, each member's habits of 
thought should be respected.  The meeting therefore closed with an 
increased sense, on the part of the other ladies, of Mrs. Roby's 
hopeless unfitness to be one of them.

</head> 
<p>MRS. LEVERET, on the eventful day, had arrived early at Mrs. 
Ballinger's, her volume of Appropriate Allusions in her pocket. 
</p><p>It always flustered Mrs. Leveret to be late at the Lunch Club: 
she liked to collect her thoughts and gather a hint, as the others 
assembled, of the turn the conversation was likely to take.  To-day, however, she felt herself completely at a loss; and even the 
familiar contact of Appropriate Allusions, which stuck into her as 
she sat down, failed to give her any reassurance.  It was an 
admirable little volume, compiled to meet all the social 
emergencies; so that, whether on the occasion of Anniversaries, 
joyful or melancholy (as the classification ran), of Banquets, 
social or municipal, or of Baptisms, Church of England or 
sectarian, its student need never be at a loss for a pertinent 
reference.  Mrs. Leveret, though she had for years devoutly conned 
its pages, valued it, however, rather for its moral support than 
for its practical services; for though in the privacy of her own 
room she commanded an army of quotations, these invariably deserted 
her at the critical moment, and the only line she retained&mdash; 
<pb n="687"/> <hi rend="italic"> Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?</hi>&mdash;was one 
she had never yet found the occasion to apply. 
</p><p>To-day she felt that even the complete mastery of the volume 
would hardly have insured her self-possession; for she thought it 
probable, even if she <hi rend="italic"> did</hi>, in some miraculous way, remember an 
Allusion, it would be only to find that Osric Dane used a different 
volume (Mrs. Leveret was convinced that literary people always 
carried them), and would consequently not recognise her quotations. 
</p><p>Mrs. Leveret's sense of being adrift was intensified by the 
appearance of Mrs. Ballinger's drawing-room.  To a careless eye its 
aspect was unchanged; but those acquainted with Mrs. Ballinger's 
way of arranging her books would instantly have detected the marks 
of recent perturbation.  Mrs. Ballinger's province, as a member of 
the Lunch Club, was the Book of the Day.  On that, whatever it was, 
from a novel to a treatise on experimental psychology, she was 
confidently, authoritatively "up."  What became of last year's 
books, or last week's even; what she did with the "subjects" she 
had previously professed with equal authority; no one had ever yet 
discovered.  Her mind was an hotel where facts came and went like 
transient lodgers, without leaving their address behind, and 
frequently without paying for their board.  It was Mrs. Ballinger's 
boast that she was "abreast with the Thought of the Day," and her 
pride that this advanced position should be expressed by the books 
on her drawing-room table.  These volumes, frequently renewed, and 
almost always damp from the press, bore names generally unfamiliar 
to Mrs. Leveret, and giving her, as she furtively scanned them, a 
disheartening glimpse of new fields of knowledge to be breathlessly 
traversed in Mrs. Ballinger's wake.  But to-day a number of 
maturer-looking volumes were adroitly mingled with the <hi rend="italic"> primeurs</hi> 
of the press&mdash;Karl Marx jostled Professor Bergson, and the 
"Confessions of St. Augustine" lay beside the last work on 
"Mendelism"; so that even to Mrs. Leveret's fluttered perceptions 
it was clear that Mrs. Ballinger didn't in the least know what 
Osric Dane was likely to talk about, and had taken measures to be 
prepared for anything.  Mrs. Leveret felt like a passenger on an 
ocean steamer who is told that there is no immediate danger, but 
that she had better put on her life-belt. 
</p><p>It was a relief to be roused from these forebodings by Miss 
Van Vluyck's arrival. 
</p><p>"Well, my dear," the new-comer briskly asked her hostess, 
"what subjects are we to discuss to-day?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger was furtively replacing a volume of Wordsworth 
by a copy of Verlaine.  "I hardly know," she said somewhat 
nervously.  "Perhaps we had better leave that to circumstances." 
</p><p>"Circumstances?" said Miss Van Vluyck drily.  "That means, I 
suppose, that Laura Glyde will take the floor as usual, and we 
shall be deluged with literature." 
</p><p>Philanthropy and statistics were Miss Van Vluyck's province, 
and she naturally resented any tendency to divert their guest's 
attention from these topics. 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth at this moment appeared. 
</p><p>"Literature?" she protested in a tone of remonstrance.  "But 
this is perfectly unexpected.  I understood we were to talk of 
Osric Dane's novel." 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger winced at the discrimination, but let it pass.  
"We can hardly make that our chief subject&mdash;at least not <hi rend="italic"> too</hi> 
intentionally," she suggested.  "Of course we can let our talk <hi rend="italic">
drift</hi> in that direction; but we ought to have some other topic as 
an introduction, and that is what I wanted to consult you about.  
The fact is, we know so little of Osric Dane's tastes and interests 
that it is difficult to make any special preparation." 
</p><p>"It may be difficult," said Mrs. Plinth with decision, "but it 
is absolutely necessary.  I know what that happy-go-lucky principle 
leads to.  As I told one of my nieces the other day, there are 
certain emergencies for which a lady should always be prepared.  
It's in shocking taste to wear colours when one pays a visit of 
condolence, or a last year's dress when there are reports that 
one's husband is on the wrong side of the market; and so it is with 
conversation.  All I ask is that I should know beforehand what is 
to be talked about; then I feel sure of being able to say the 
proper thing." 
</p><p>"I quite agree with you," Mrs. Ballinger anxiously assented; 
"but&mdash;" 
</p><p>And at that instant, heralded by the fluttered parlour-maid, 
Osric Dane appeared upon the threshold. <pb n="688"/>  
</p><p>Mrs. Leveret told her sister afterward that she had known at 
a glance what was coming.  She saw that Osric Dane was not going to 
meet them half way.  That distinguished personage had indeed 
entered with an air of compulsion not calculated to promote the 
easy exercise of hospitality.  She looked as though she were about 
to be photographed for a new edition of her books. 
</p><p>The desire to propitiate a divinity is generally in inverse 
ratio to its responsiveness, and the sense of discouragement 
produced by Osric Dane's entrance visibly increased the Lunch 
Club's eagerness to please her.  Any lingering idea that she might 
consider herself under an obligation to her entertainers was at 
once dispelled by her manner: as Mrs. Leveret said afterward to her 
sister, she had a way of looking at you that made you feel as if 
there was something wrong with your hat.  This evidence of 
greatness produced such an immediate impression on the ladies that 
a shudder of awe ran through them when Mrs. Roby, as their hostess 
led the great personage into the dining-room, turned back to 
whisper to the others: "What a brute she is!" 
</p><p>The hour about the table did not tend to correct this verdict.  
It was passed by Osric Dane in the silent deglutition of Mrs. 
Ballinger's menu, and by the members of the Club in the emission of 
tentative platitudes which their guest seemed to swallow as 
perfunctorily as the successive courses of the luncheon. 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger's deplorable delay in fixing a topic had thrown 
the Club into a mental disarray which increased with the return to 
the drawing-room, where the actual business of discussion was to 
open.  Each lady waited for the other to speak; and there was a 
general shock of disappointment when their hostess opened the 
conversation by the painfully commonplace inquiry: "Is this your 
first visit to Hillbridge?" 
</p><p>Even Mrs. Leveret was conscious that this was a bad beginning; 
and a vague impulse of deprecation made Miss Glyde interject: "It 
is a very small place indeed." 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth bristled.  "We have a great many representative 
people," she said, in the tone of one who speaks for her order. 
</p><p>Osric Dane turned to her thoughtfully.  "What do they 
represent?" she asked. 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth's constitutional dislike to being questioned was 
intensified by her sense of unpreparedness; and her reproachful 
glance passed the question on to Mrs. Ballinger. 
</p><p>"Why," said that lady, glancing in turn at the other members, 
"as a community I hope it is not too much to say that we stand for 
culture." 
</p><p>"For art&mdash;" Miss Glyde eagerly interjected. 
</p><p>"For art and literature," Mrs. Ballinger emended. 
</p><p>"And for sociology, I trust," snapped Miss Van Vluyck. 
</p><p>"We have a standard," said Mrs. Plinth, feeling herself 
suddenly secure on the vast expanse of a generalisation: and Mrs. 
Leveret, thinking there must be room for more than one on so broad 
a statement, took courage to murmur: "Oh, certainly; we have a 
standard." 
</p><p>"The object of our little club," Mrs. Ballinger continued, "is 
to concentrate the highest tendencies of Hillbridge&mdash;to centralise 
and focus its complex intellectual effort." 
</p><p>This was felt to be so happy that the ladies drew an almost 
audible breath of relief. 
</p><p>"We aspire," the President went on, "to stand for what is 
highest in art, literature and ethics." 
</p><p>Osric Dane again turned to her.  "What ethics?" she asked. 
</p><p>A tremor of apprehension encircled the room.  None of the 
ladies required any preparation to pronounce on a question of 
morals; but when they were called ethics it was different.  The 
club, when fresh from the "Encyclopaedia Britannica," the "Reader's 
Handbook" or Smith's "Classical Dictionary," could deal confidently 
with any subject; but when taken unawares it had been known to 
define agnosticism as a heresy of the Early Church and Professor 
Froude as a distinguished histologist; and such minor members as 
Mrs. Leveret still secretly regarded ethics as something vaguely 
pagan. 
</p><p>Even to Mrs. Ballinger, Osric Dane's question was unsettling, 
and there was a general sense of gratitude when Laura Glyde leaned 
forward to say, with her most sympathetic accent: "You must excuse 
us, Mrs. Dane, for not being able, just at <pb n="689"/>  present, to talk 
of anything but 'The Wings of Death.'" 
</p><p>"Yes," said Miss Van Vluyck, with a sudden resolve to carry 
the war into the enemy's camp.  "We are so anxious to know the 
exact purpose you had in mind in writing your wonderful book." 
</p><p>"You will find," Mrs. Plinth interposed, "that we are not 
superficial readers." 
</p><p>"We are eager to hear from you," Miss Van Vluyck continued, 
"if the pessimistic tendency of the book is an expression of your 
own convictions or&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Or merely," Miss Glyde hastily thrust in, "a sombre 
background brushed in to throw your figures into more vivid relief.  
<hi rend="italic"> Are</hi> you not primarily plastic?" 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">" I</hi> have always maintained," Mrs. Ballinger interposed, 
"that you represent the purely objective method&mdash;" 
</p><p>Osric Dane helped herself critically to coffee.  "How do you 
define objective?" she then inquired. 
</p><p>There was a flurried pause before Laura Glyde intensely 
murmured: "In reading <hi rend="italic"> you</hi> we don't define, we feel." 
</p><p>Osric Dane smiled.  "The cerebellum," she remarked, "is not 
infrequently the seat of the literary emotions."  And she took a 
second lump of sugar. 
</p><p>The sting that this remark was vaguely felt to conceal was 
almost neutralised by the satisfaction of being addressed in such 
technical language. 
</p><p>"Ah, the cerebellum," said Miss Van Vluyck complacently.  "The 
Club took a course in psychology last winter." 
</p><p>"Which psychology?" asked Osric Dane. 
</p><p>There was an agonising pause, during which each member of the 
Club secretly deplored the distressing inefficiency of the others.  
Only Mrs. Roby went on placidly sipping her chartreuse.  At last 
Mrs. Ballinger said, with an attempt at a high tone: "Well, really, 
you know, it was last year that we took psychology, and this winter 
we have been so absorbed in&mdash;" 
</p><p>She broke off, nervously trying to recall some of the Club's 
discussions; but her faculties seemed to be paralysed by the 
petrifying stare of Osric Dane.  What <hi rend="italic"> had</hi> the club been 
absorbed in lately?  Mrs. Ballinger, with a vague purpose of 
gaining time, repeated slowly: "We've been so intensely absorbed 
in&mdash;" 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby put down her liqueur glass and drew near the group 
with a smile. 
</p><p>"In Xingu?" she gently prompted. 
</p><p>A thrill ran through the other members.  They exchanged 
confused glances, and then, with one accord, turned a gaze of 
mingled relief and interrogation on their unexpected rescuer.  The 
expression of each denoted a different phase of the same emotion.  
Mrs. Plinth was the first to compose her features to an air of 
reassurance: after a moment's hasty adjustment her look almost 
implied that it was she who had given the word to Mrs. Ballinger. 
</p><p>"Xingu, of course!" exclaimed the latter with her accustomed 
promptness, while Miss Van Vluyck and Laura Glyde seemed to be 
plumbing the depths of memory, and Mrs. Leveret, feeling 
apprehensively for Appropriate Allusions, was somehow reassured by 
the uncomfortable pressure of its bulk against her person. 
</p><p>Osric Dane's change of countenance was no less striking than 
that of her entertainers.  She too put down her coffee-cup, but 
with a look of distinct annoyance: she too wore, for a brief 
moment, what Mrs. Roby afterward described as the look of feeling 
for something in the back of her head; and before she could 
dissemble these momentary signs of weakness, Mrs. Roby, turning to 
her with a deferential smile, had said: "And we've been so hoping 
that to-day you would tell us just what you think of it." 
</p><p>Osric Dane received the homage of the smile as a matter of 
course; but the accompanying question obviously embarrassed her, 
and it became clear to her observers that she was not quick at 
shifting her facial scenery.  It was as though her countenance had 
so long been set in an expression of unchallenged superiority that 
the muscles had stiffened, and refused to obey her orders. 
</p><p>"Xingu&mdash;" she murmured, as if seeking in her turn to gain 
time. 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby continued to press her.  "Knowing how engrossing the 
subject is, you will understand how it happens that the Club has 
let everything else go to the wall for the moment.  Since we took 
up Xingu I might almost say&mdash;were it not for your books&mdash;that 
nothing else seems to us worth remembering." 
</p><p>Osric Dane's stern features were darkened rather than lit up 
by an uneasy smile. <pb n="690"/>  "I am glad to hear there is one 
exception," she gave out between narrowed lips. 
</p><p>"Oh, of course," Mrs. Roby said prettily; "but as you have 
shown us that&mdash;so very naturally!&mdash;you don't care to talk about 
your own things, we really can't let you off from telling us 
exactly what you think about Xingu; especially," she added, with a 
persuasive smile, "as some people say that one of your last books 
was simply saturated with it." 
</p><p>It was an <hi rend="italic"> it</hi>, then&mdash;the assurance sped like fire through 
the parched minds of the other members.  In their eagerness to gain 
the least little clue to Xingu they almost forgot the joy of 
assisting at the discomfiture of Mrs. Dane. 
</p><p>The latter reddened nervously under her antagonist's direct 
assault.  "May I ask," she faltered out in an embarrassed tone, "to 
which of my books you refer?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby did not falter.  "That's just what I want you to 
tell us; because, though I was present, I didn't actually take 
part." 
</p><p>"Present at what?" Mrs. Dane took her up; and for an instant 
the trembling members of the Lunch Club thought that the champion 
Providence had raised up for them had lost a point.  But Mrs. Roby 
explained herself gaily: "At the discussion, of course.  And so 
we're dreadfully anxious to know just how it was that you went into 
the Xingu." 
</p><p>There was a portentous pause, a silence so big with 
incalculable dangers that the members with one accord checked the 
words on their lips, like soldiers dropping their arms to watch a 
single combat between their leaders.  Then Mrs. Dane gave 
expression to their inmost dread by saying sharply: "Ah&mdash;you say <hi rend="italic">
the</hi> Xingu, do you?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby smiled undauntedly.  "It <hi rend="italic"> is</hi> a shade pedantic, 
isn't it?  Personally, I always drop the article; but I don't know 
how the other members feel about it." 
</p><p>The other members looked as though they would willingly have 
dispensed with this deferential appeal to their opinion, and Mrs. 
Roby, after a bright glance about the group, went on: "They 
probably think, as I do, that nothing really matters except the 
thing itself&mdash;except Xingu." 
</p><p>No immediate reply seemed to occur to Mrs. Dane, and Mrs. 
Ballinger gathered courage to say: "Surely every one must feel that 
about Xingu." 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth came to her support with a heavy murmur of assent, 
and Laura Glyde breathed emotionally: "I have known cases where it 
has changed a whole life." 
</p><p>"It has done me worlds of good," Mrs. Leveret interjected, 
seeming to herself to remember that she had either taken it or read 
it in the winter before. 
</p><p>"Of course," Mrs. Roby admitted, "the difficulty is that one 
must give up so much time to it.  It's very long." 
</p><p>"I can't imagine," said Miss Van Vluyck tartly, "grudging the 
time given to such a subject." 
</p><p>"And deep in places," Mrs. Roby pursued; (so then it was a 
book!)  "And it isn't easy to skip." 
</p><p>"I never skip," said Mrs. Plinth dogmatically. 
</p><p>"Ah, it's dangerous to, in Xingu.  Even at the start there are 
places where one can't.  One must just wade through." 
</p><p>"I should hardly call it <hi rend="italic"> wading</hi>," said Mrs. Ballinger 
sarcastically. 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby sent her a look of interest.  "Ah&mdash;you always found 
it went swimmingly?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger hesitated.  "Of course there are difficult 
passages," she conceded modestly. 
</p><p>"Yes; some are not at all clear&mdash;even," Mrs. Roby added, "if 
one is familiar with the original." 
</p><p>"As I suppose you are?" Osric Dane interposed, suddenly fixing 
her with a look of challenge. 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby met it by a deprecating smile.  "Oh, it's really not 
difficult up to a certain point; though some of the branches are 
very little known, and it's almost impossible to get at the 
source." 
</p><p>"Have you ever tried?" Mrs. Plinth enquired, still distrustful 
of Mrs. Roby's thoroughness. 
</p><p>Mrs. Roby was silent for a moment; then she replied with 
lowered lids: "No&mdash;but a friend of mine did; a very brilliant man; 
and he told me it was best for women&mdash;not to . . ." 
</p><p>A shudder ran around the room.  Mrs. Leveret coughed so that 
the parlour-maid, who was handing the cigarettes, should not hear; 
Miss Van Vluyck's face took on a nauseated expression, and Mrs. 
Plinth <pb n="691"/>  looked as if she were passing some one she did not 
care to bow to.  But the most remarkable result of Mrs. Roby's 
words was the effect they produced on the Lunch Club's 
distinguished guest.  Osric Dane's impassive features suddenly 
melted to an expression of the warmest human sympathy, and edging 
her chair toward Mrs. Roby's she asked: "Did he really?  And&mdash;did 
you find he was right?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger, in whom annoyance at Mrs. Roby's unwonted 
assumption of prominence was beginning to displace gratitude for 
the aid she had rendered, could not consent to her being allowed, 
by such dubious means, to monopolise the attention of their guest.  
If Osric Dane had not enough self-respect to resent Mrs. Roby's 
flippancy, at least the Lunch Club would do so in the person of its 
President. 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger laid her hand on Mrs. Roby's arm.  "We must not 
forget," she said with a frigid amiability, "that absorbing as 
Xingu is to <hi rend="italic"> us</hi>, it may be less interesting to&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Oh, no, on the contrary, I assure you," Osric Dane 
energetically intervened. 
</p><p>"&mdash;to others," Mrs. Ballinger finished firmly; "and we must 
not allow our little meeting to end without persuading Mrs. Dane to 
say a few words to us on a subject which, to-day, is much more 
present in all our thoughts.  I refer, of course, to 'The Wings of 
Death.'" 
</p><p>The other members, animated by various degrees of the same 
sentiment, and encouraged by the humanised mien of their 
redoubtable guest, repeated after Mrs. Ballinger: "Oh, yes, you 
really <hi rend="italic"> must</hi> talk to us a little about your book." 
</p><p>Osric Dane's expression became as bored, though not as 
haughty, as when her work had been previously mentioned.  But 
before she could respond to Mrs. Ballinger's request, Mrs. Roby had 
risen from her seat, and was pulling her veil down over her 
frivolous nose. 
</p><p>"I'm so sorry," she said, advancing toward her hostess with 
outstretched hand, "but before Mrs. Dane begins I think I'd better 
run away.  Unluckily, as you know, I haven't read her books, so I 
should be at a terrible disadvantage among you all; and besides, 
I've an engagement to play bridge." 
</p><p>If Mrs. Roby had simply pleaded her ignorance of Osric Dane's 
works as a reason for withdrawing, the Lunch Club, in view of her 
recent prowess, might have approved such evidence of discretion; 
but to couple this excuse with the brazen announcement that she was 
foregoing the privilege for the purpose of joining a bridge-party, 
was only one more instance of her deplorable lack of 
discrimination. 
</p><p>The ladies were disposed, however, to feel that her 
departure&mdash;now that she had performed the sole service she was ever 
likely to render them&mdash;would probably make for greater order and 
dignity in the impending discussion, besides relieving them of the 
sense of self-distrust which her presence always mysteriously 
produced.  Mrs. Ballinger therefore restricted herself to a formal 
murmur of regret, and the other members were just grouping 
themselves comfortably about Osric Dane when the latter, to their 
dismay, started up from the sofa on which she had been 
deferentially enthroned. 
</p><p>"Oh wait&mdash;do wait, and I'll go with you!" she called out to 
Mrs. Roby; and, seizing the hands of the disconcerted members, she 
administered a series of farewell pressures with the mechanical 
haste of a railway-conductor punching tickets. 
</p><p>"I'm so sorry&mdash;I'd quite forgotten&mdash;" she flung back at them 
from the threshold; and as she joined Mrs. Roby, who had turned in 
surprise at her appeal, the other ladies had the mortification of 
hearing her say, in a voice which she did not take the pains to 
lower: "If you'll let me walk a little way with you, I should so 
like to ask you a few more questions about Xingu . . ." 
</p> 
</div2> 
<div2 type="section" n="3" id="d6"> 
<head>                           III</head> 

<p>THE incident had been so rapid that the door closed on the 
departing pair before the other members had had time to understand 
what was happening.  Then a sense of the indignity put upon them by 
Osric Dane's unceremonious desertion began to contend with the 
confused feeling that they had been cheated out of their due 
without exactly knowing how or why. 
</p><p>There was an awkward silence, during which Mrs. Ballinger, 
with a perfunctory hand, rearranged the skilfully grouped 
literature at which her distinguished guest had not so much as 
glanced; then Miss Van Vluyck tartly pronounced: "Well, I <pb n="692"/>  
can't say that I consider Osric Dane's departure a great loss." 
</p><p>This confession crystallised the fluid resentment of the other 
members, and Mrs. Leveret exclaimed: "I do believe she came on 
purpose to be nasty!" 
</p><p>It was Mrs. Plinth's private opinion that Osric Dane's 
attitude toward the Lunch Club might have been very different had 
it welcomed her in the majestic setting of the Plinth drawing-rooms; but not liking to reflect on the inadequacy of Mrs. 
Ballinger's establishment she sought a round-about satisfaction in 
depreciating her <hi rend="italic"> savoir faire</hi>. 
</p><p>"I said from the first that we ought to have had a subject 
ready.  It's what always happens when you're unprepared.  Now if 
we'd only got up Xingu&mdash;" 
</p><p>The slowness of Mrs. Plinth's mental processes was always 
allowed for by the Club; but this instance of it was too much for 
Mrs. Ballinger's equanimity. 
</p><p>"Xingu!" she scoffed.  "Why, it was the fact of our knowing so 
much more about it than she did&mdash;unprepared though we were&mdash;that 
made Osric Dane so furious.  I should have thought that was plain 
enough to everybody!" 
</p><p>This retort impressed even Mrs. Plinth, and Laura Glyde, moved 
by an impulse of generosity, said: "Yes, we really ought to be 
grateful to Mrs. Roby for introducing the topic.  It may have made 
Osric Dane furious, but at least it made her civil." 
</p><p>"I am glad we were able to show her," added Miss Van Vluyck, 
"that a broad and up-to-date culture is not confined to the great 
intellectual centres." 
</p><p>This increased the satisfaction of the other members, and they 
began to forget their wrath against Osric Dane in the pleasure of 
having contributed to her defeat. 
</p><p>Miss Van Vluyck thoughtfully rubbed her spectacles.  "What 
surprised me most," she continued, "was that Fanny Roby should be 
so up on Xingu." 
</p><p>This frank admission threw a slight chill on the company, but 
Mrs. Ballinger said with an air of indulgent irony: "Mrs. Roby 
always has the knack of making a little go a long way; still, we 
certainly owe her a debt for happening to remember that she'd heard 
of Xingu."  And this was felt by the other members to be a graceful 
way of cancelling once for all the Club's obligation to Mrs. Roby. 
</p><p>Even Mrs. Leveret took courage to speed a timid shaft of 
irony: "I fancy Osric Dane hardly expected to take a lesson in 
Xingu at Hillbridge!" 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger smiled.  "When she asked me what we 
represented&mdash;do you remember?&mdash;I wish I'd simply said we 
represented Xingu!" 
</p><p>All the ladies laughed appreciatively at this sally, except 
Mrs. Plinth, who said, after a moment's deliberation: "I'm not sure 
it would have been wise to do so." 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger, who was already beginning to feel as if she 
had launched at Osric Dane the retort which had just occurred to 
her, looked ironically at Mrs. Plinth.  "May I ask why?" she 
enquired. 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth looked grave.  "Surely," she said, "I understood 
from Mrs. Roby herself that the subject was one it was as well not 
to go into too deeply?" 
</p><p>Miss Van Vluyck rejoined with precision: "I think that applied 
only to an investigation of the origin of the&mdash;of the&mdash;"; and 
suddenly she found that her usually accurate memory had failed her.  
"It's a part of the subject I never studied myself," she concluded 
lamely. 
</p><p>"Nor I," said Mrs. Ballinger. 
</p><p>Laura Glyde bent toward them with widened eyes.  "And yet it 
seems&mdash;doesn't it?&mdash;the part that is fullest of an esoteric 
fascination?" 
</p><p>"I don't know on what you base that," said Miss Van Vluyck 
argumentatively. 
</p><p>"Well, didn't you notice how intensely interested Osric Dane 
became as soon as she heard what the brilliant foreigner&mdash;he <hi rend="italic">
was</hi> a foreigner, wasn't he?&mdash;had told Mrs. Roby about the origin&mdash; 
the origin of the rite&mdash;or whatever you call it?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth looked disapproving, and Mrs. Ballinger visibly 
wavered.  Then she said in a decisive tone: "It may not be 
desirable to touch on the&mdash;on that part of the subject in general 
conversation; but, from the importance it evidently has to a woman 
of Osric Dane's distinction, I feel as if we ought not to be afraid 
to discuss it among ourselves&mdash;without gloves&mdash;though with closed 
doors, if necessary." 
</p><p>"I'm quite of your opinion," Miss Van Vluyck came briskly to 
her support; "on <pb n="693"/>  condition, that is, that all grossness of 
language is avoided." 
</p><p>"Oh, I'm sure we shall understand without that," Mrs. Leveret 
tittered; and Laura Glyde added significantly: "I fancy we can read 
between the lines," while Mrs. Ballinger rose to assure herself 
that the doors were really closed. 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth had not yet given her adhesion.  "I hardly see," 
she began, "what benefit is to be derived from investigating such 
peculiar customs&mdash;" 
</p><p>But Mrs. Ballinger's patience had reached the extreme limit of 
tension.  "This at least," she returned; "that we shall not be 
placed again in the humiliating position of finding ourselves less 
up on our own subjects than Fanny Roby!" 
</p><p>Even to Mrs. Plinth this argument was conclusive.  She peered 
furtively about the room and lowered her commanding tones to ask: 
"Have you got a copy?" 
</p><p>"A&mdash;a copy?" stammered Mrs. Ballinger.  She was aware that the 
other members were looking at her expectantly, and that this answer 
was inadequate, so she supported it by asking another question.  "A 
copy of what?" 
</p><p>Her companions bent their expectant gaze on Mrs. Plinth, who, 
in turn, appeared less sure of herself than usual.  "Why, of&mdash;of&mdash; 
the book," she explained. 
</p><p>"What book?" snapped Miss Van Vluyck, almost as sharply as 
Osric Dane. 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger looked at Laura Glyde, whose eyes were 
interrogatively fixed on Mrs. Leveret.  The fact of being deferred 
to was so new to the latter that it filled her with an insane 
temerity.  "Why, Xingu, of course!" she exclaimed. 
</p><p>A profound silence followed this direct challenge to the 
resources of Mrs. Ballinger's library, and the latter, after 
glancing nervously toward the Books of the Day, returned in a 
deprecating voice: "It's not a thing one cares to leave about." 
</p><p>"I should think <hi rend="italic"> not!"</hi> exclaimed Mrs. Plinth. 
</p><p>"It <hi rend="italic"> is</hi> a book, then?" said Miss Van Vluyck. 
</p><p>This again threw the company into disarray, and Mrs. 
Ballinger, with an impatient sigh, rejoined: "Why&mdash;there <hi rend="italic"> is</hi> a 
book&mdash;naturally . . ." 
</p><p>"Then why did Miss Glyde call it a religion?" 
</p><p>Laura Glyde started up.  "A religion?  I never&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Yes, you did," Miss Van Vluyck insisted; "you spoke of rites; 
and Mrs. Plinth said it was a custom." 
</p><p>Miss Glyde was evidently making a desperate effort to 
reinforce her statement; but accuracy of detail was not her 
strongest point.  At length she began in a deep murmur: "Surely 
they used to do something of the kind at the Eleusinian 
mysteries&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Oh&mdash;" said Miss Van Vluyck, on the verge of disapproval; and 
Mrs. Plinth protested: "I understood there was to be no 
indelicacy!" 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger could not control her irritation.  "Really, it 
is too bad that we should not be able to talk the matter over 
quietly among ourselves.  Personally, I think that if one goes into 
Xingu at all&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Oh, so do I!" cried Miss Glyde. 
</p><p>"And I don't see how one can avoid doing so, if one wishes to 
keep up with the Thought of the Day&mdash;" 
</p><p>Mrs. Leveret uttered an exclamation of relief.  "There&mdash;that's 
it!" she interposed. 
</p><p>"What's it?" the President curtly took her up. 
</p><p>"Why&mdash;it's a&mdash;a Thought: I mean a philosophy." 
</p><p>This seemed to bring a certain relief to Mrs. Ballinger and 
Laura Glyde, but Miss Van Vluyck said dogmatically: "Excuse me if 
I tell you that you're all mistaken.  Xingu happens to be a 
language." 
</p><p>"A language!" the Lunch Club cried. 
</p><p>"Certainly.  Don't you remember Fanny Roby's saying that there 
were several branches, and that some were hard to trace?  What 
could that apply to but dialects?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger could no longer restrain a contemptuous laugh.  
"Really, if the Lunch Club has reached such a pass that it has to 
go to Fanny Roby for instruction on a subject like Xingu, it had 
almost better cease to exist!" 
</p><p>"It's really her fault for not being clearer," Laura Glyde put 
in. 
</p><p>"Oh, clearness and Fanny Roby!" Mrs. Ballinger shrugged.  "I 
daresay we shall find she was mistaken on almost every point." 
</p><p>"Why not look it up?" said Mrs. Plinth. 
</p><p>As a rule this recurrent suggestion of Mrs. Plinth's was 
ignored in the heat of discus-<pb n="694"/> sion, and only resorted to 
afterward in the privacy of each member's home.  But on the present 
occasion the desire to ascribe their own confusion of thought to 
the vague and contradictory nature of Mrs. Roby's statements caused 
the members of the Lunch Club to utter a collective demand for a 
book of reference. 
</p><p>At this point the production of her treasured volume gave Mrs. 
Leveret, for a moment, the unusual experience of occupying the 
centre front; but she was not able to hold it long, for Appropriate 
Allusions contained no mention of Xingu. 
</p><p>"Oh, that's not the kind of thing we want!" exclaimed Miss Van 
Vluyck.  She cast a disparaging glance over Mrs. Ballinger's 
assortment of literature, and added impatiently: "Haven't you any 
useful books?" 
</p><p>"Of course I have," replied Mrs. Ballinger indignantly; "but 
I keep them in my husband's dressing-room." 
</p><p>From this region, after some difficulty and delay, the 
parlour-maid produced the W-Z volume of an Encyclopaedia and, in 
deference to the fact that the demand for it had come from Miss Van 
Vluyck, laid the ponderous tome before her. 
</p><p>There was a moment of painful suspense while Miss Van Vluyck 
rubbed her spectacles, adjusted them, and turned to Z; and a murmur 
of surprise when she said: "It isn't here." 
</p><p>"I suppose," said Mrs. Plinth, "it's not fit to be put in a 
book of reference." 
</p><p>"Oh, nonsense!" exclaimed Mrs. Ballinger.  "Try X." 
</p><p>Miss Van Vluyck turned back through the volume, peering short-sightedly up and down the pages, till she came to a stop and 
remained motionless, like a dog on a point. 
</p><p>"Well, have you found it?" Mrs. Ballinger enquired, after a 
considerable delay. 
</p><p>"Yes.  I've found it," said Miss Van Vluyck in a queer voice. 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth hastily interposed: "I beg you won't read it aloud 
if there's anything offensive." 
</p><p>Miss Van Vluyck, without answering, continued her silent 
scrutiny. 
</p><p>"Well, what <hi rend="italic"> is</hi> it?" exclaimed Laura Glyde excitedly. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">" Do</hi> tell us!" urged Mrs. Leveret, feeling that she would 
have something awful to tell her sister. 
</p><p>Miss Van Vluyck pushed the volume aside and turned slowly 
toward the expectant group. 
</p><p>"It's a river." 
</p><p>"A <hi rend="italic"> river?"</hi> 
</p><p>"Yes: in Brazil.  Isn't that where she's been living?" 
</p><p>"Who?  Fanny Roby?  Oh, but you must be mistaken.  You've been 
reading the wrong thing," Mrs. Ballinger exclaimed, leaning over 
her to seize the volume. 
</p><p>"It's the only <hi rend="italic"> Xingu</hi> in the Encyclopaedia; and she <hi rend="italic"> 
has</hi> 
been living in Brazil," Miss Van Vluyck persisted. 
</p><p>"Yes: her brother has a consulship there," Mrs. Leveret 
eagerly interposed. 
</p><p>"But it's too ridiculous!  I&mdash;we&mdash;why we <hi rend="italic"> all</hi> remember 
studying Xingu last year&mdash;or the year before last," Mrs. Ballinger 
stammered. 
</p><p>"I thought I did when <hi rend="italic"> you</hi> said so," Laura Glyde avowed. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">" I</hi> said so?" cried Mrs. Ballinger. 
</p><p>"Yes.  You said it had crowded everything else out of your 
mind." 
</p><p>"Well, <hi rend="italic"> you</hi> said it had changed your whole life!" 
</p><p>"For that matter, Miss Van Vluyck said she had never grudged 
the time she'd given it." 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth interposed: "I made it clear that I knew nothing 
whatever of the original." 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger broke off the dispute with a groan.  "Oh, what 
does it all matter if she's been making fools of us?  I believe 
Miss Van Vluyck's right&mdash;she was talking of the river all the 
while!" 
</p><p>"How could she?  It's too preposterous," Miss Glyde exclaimed. 
</p><p>"Listen."  Miss Van Vluyck had repossessed herself of the 
Encyclopaedia, and restored her spectacles to a nose reddened by 
excitement.  "'The Xingu, one of the principal rivers of Brazil, 
rises on the plateau of Mato Grosso, and flows in a northerly 
direction for a length of no less than one thousand one hundred and 
eighteen miles, entering the Amazon near the mouth of the latter 
river.  The upper course of the Xingu is auriferous and fed by 
numerous branches.  Its source was first discovered in 1884 by the 
German explorer von den Steinen, after a difficult and dangerous 
expedition through a region in-<pb n="695"/> habited by tribes still in 
the Stone Age of culture.'" 
</p><p>The ladies received this communication in a state of stupefied 
silence from which Mrs. Leveret was the first to rally.  "She 
certainly <hi rend="italic"> did</hi> speak of its having branches." 
</p><p>The word seemed to snap the last thread of their incredulity.  
"And of its great length," gasped Mrs. Ballinger. 
</p><p>"She said it was awfully deep, and you couldn't skip&mdash;you just 
had to wade through," Miss Glyde subjoined. 
</p><p>The idea worked its way more slowly through Mrs. Plinth's 
compact resistances.  "How could there be anything improper about 
a river?" she inquired. 
</p><p>"Improper?" 
</p><p>"Why, what she said about the source&mdash;that it was corrupt?" 
</p><p>"Not corrupt, but hard to get at," Laura Glyde corrected.  
"Some one who'd been there had told her so.  I daresay it was the 
explorer himself&mdash;doesn't it say the expedition was dangerous?" 
</p><p>"'Difficult and dangerous,'" read Miss Van Vluyck. 
</p><p>Mrs. Ballinger pressed her hands to her throbbing temples.  
"There's nothing she said that wouldn't apply to a river&mdash;to this 
river!"  She swung about excitedly to the other members.  "Why, do 
you remember her telling us that she hadn't read 'The Supreme 
Instant' because she'd taken it on a boating party while she was 
staying with her brother, and some one had 'shied' it overboard&mdash; 
'shied' of course was her own expression?" 
</p><p>The ladies breathlessly signified that the expression had not 
escaped them. 
</p><p>"Well&mdash;and then didn't she tell Osric Dane that one of her 
books was simply saturated with Xingu?  Of course it was, if some 
of Mrs. Roby's rowdy friends had thrown it into the river!" 
</p><p>This surprising reconstruction of the scene in which they had 
just participated left the members of the Lunch Club inarticulate.  
At length Mrs. Plinth, after visibly labouring with the problem, 
said in a heavy tone: "Osric Dane was taken in too." 
</p><p>Mrs. Leveret took courage at this.  "Perhaps that's what Mrs. 
Roby did it for.  She said Osric Dane was a brute, and she may have 
wanted to give her a lesson." 
</p><p>Miss Van Vluyck frowned.  "It was hardly worth while to do it 
at our expense." 
</p><p>"At least," said Miss Glyde with a touch of bitterness, "she 
succeeded in interesting her, which was more than we did." 
</p><p>"What chance had we?" rejoined Mrs. Ballinger.  "Mrs. Roby 
monopolised her from the first.  And <hi rend="italic"> that</hi>, I've no doubt, was 
her purpose&mdash;to give Osric Dane a false impression of her own 
standing in the Club.  She would hesitate at nothing to attract 
attention: we all know how she took in poor Professor Foreland." 
</p><p>"She actually makes him give bridge-teas every Thursday," Mrs. 
Leveret piped up. 
</p><p>Laura Glyde struck her hands together.  "Why, this is 
Thursday, and it's <hi rend="italic"> there</hi> she's gone, of course; and taken Osric 
with her!" 
</p><p>"And they're shrieking over us at this moment," said Mrs. 
Ballinger between her teeth. 
</p><p>This possibility seemed too preposterous to be admitted.  "She 
would hardly dare," said Miss Van Vluyck, "confess the imposture to 
Osric Dane." 
</p><p>"I'm not so sure: I thought I saw her make a sign as she left.  
If she hadn't made a sign, why should Osric Dane have rushed out 
after her?" 
</p><p>"Well, you know, we'd all been telling her how wonderful Xingu 
was, and she said she wanted to find out more about it," Mrs. 
Leveret said, with a tardy impulse of justice to the absent. 
</p><p>This reminder, far from mitigating the wrath of the other 
members, gave it a stronger impetus. 
</p><p>"Yes&mdash;and that's exactly what they're both laughing over now," 
said Laura Glyde ironically. 
</p><p>Mrs. Plinth stood up and gathered her expensive furs about her 
monumental form.  "I have no wish to criticise," she said; "but 
unless the Lunch Club can protect its members against the 
recurrence of such&mdash;such unbecoming scenes, I for one&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Oh, so do I!" agreed Miss Glyde, rising also. 
</p><p>Miss Van Vluyck closed the Encyclopaedia and proceeded to 
button herself into her jacket.  "My time is really too valuable&mdash;" 
she began. 
</p><p>"I fancy we are all of one mind," said Mrs. Ballinger, looking 
searchingly at Mrs. Leveret, who looked at the others. <pb n="696"/>  
</p><p>"I always deprecate anything like a scandal&mdash;" Mrs. Plinth 
continued. 
</p><p>"She has been the cause of one to-day!" exclaimed Miss Glyde. 
</p><p>Mrs. Leveret moaned: "I don't see how she <hi rend="italic"> could!"</hi> and Miss 
Van Vluyck said, picking up her note-book: "Some women stop at 
nothing." 
</p><p>"&mdash;but if," Mrs. Plinth took up her argument impressively, 
"anything of the kind had happened in <hi rend="italic"> my</hi> house" (it never would 
have, her tone implied), "I should have felt that I owed it to 
myself either to ask for Mrs. Roby's resignation&mdash;or to offer 
mine." 
</p><p>"Oh, Mrs. Plinth&mdash;" gasped the Lunch Club. 
</p><p>"Fortunately for me," Mrs. Plinth continued with an awful 
magnanimity, "the matter was taken out of my hands by our 
President's decision that the right to entertain distinguished 
guests was a privilege vested in her office; and I think the other 
members will agree that, as she was alone in this opinion, she 
ought to be alone in deciding on the best way of effacing its&mdash;its 
really deplorable consequences." 
</p><p>A deep silence followed this unexpected outbreak of Mrs. 
Plinth's long-stored resentment. 
</p><p>"I don't see why <hi rend="italic"> I</hi> should be expected to ask her to 
resign&mdash;" Mrs. Ballinger at length began; but Laura Glyde turned 
back to remind her: "You know she made you say that you'd got on 
swimmingly in Xingu." 
</p><p>An ill-timed giggle escaped from Mrs. Leveret, and Mrs. 
Ballinger energetically continued "&mdash;but you needn't think for a 
moment that I'm afraid to!" 
</p><p>The door of the drawing-room closed on the retreating backs of 
the Lunch Club, and the President of that distinguished 
association, seating herself at her writing-table, and pushing away 
a copy of "The Wings of Death" to make room for her elbow, drew 
forth a sheet of the club's note-paper, on which she began to 
write: "My dear Mrs. Roby&mdash;"
