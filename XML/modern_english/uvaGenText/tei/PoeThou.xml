<pb n="471"/>   
<p>I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma.  I will 
expound to you &mdash; as I alone can &mdash; the secret of the enginery that effected 
the Rattleborough miracle &mdash; the one, the true, the admitted, the undisputed, 
the indisputable miracle, which put a definite end to infidelity among the 
Rattleburghers, and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all the 
carnal-minded who had ventured to be sceptical before. 
</p><p>This event &mdash; which I should be very sorry to discuss in a tone of 
unsuitable levity &mdash; occurred in the summer of 18 &mdash; .  Mr Barnabas 
Shuttleworthy &mdash; one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the 
borough &mdash; had been missing for several days under circumstances which gave 
rise to suspicion of foul play.  Mr Shuttleworthy had set out from 
Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the 
avowed intention of proceeding to the city of &mdash;, about fifteen miles 
distant, and of returning the night of the same day.  Two hours after his 
departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting.  The animal was 
wounded, too, and covered with mud.  These circumstances naturally gave 
rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man; and when it was 
<pb n="472"/>  
found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the 
whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body. 
</p><p>The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the 
bosom friend of Mr Shuttleworthy &mdash; a Mr Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was 
universally called, 'Charley Goodfellow', or 'Old Charley Goodfellow'. 
Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the name 
itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never yet 
been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there never 
yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest, good-natured, and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did you 
good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the face, as 
much as to say: 'I have a clear conscience myself, am afraid of no man, and 
am altogether above doing a mean action.'  And thus all the hearty, 
careless, 'walking gentlemen' of the stage are very certain to be called 
Charles. 
</p><p>Now, 'Old Charley Goodfellow', although he had been in Rattleborough 
not longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew 
anything about him before he came to settle in the neighbourhood, had 
experienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all 
the respectable people in the borough.  Not a man of them but would have 
taken his bare word for a thousand at any moment; and, as for the women, 
there is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him.  And all 
this came of his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing, in 
consequence, that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very 'best 
letter of recommendation'. 
</p><p>I have already said that Mr Shuttleworthy was one 
of the most respectable, and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in 
Rattleborough, while 'Old Charley Goodfellow' was upon as intimate terms 
with him as if he had been his own brother.  The two old gentlemen were 
next-door neighbours and, although Mr Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, 
visited 'Old Charley', and never was known to take a meal in his house, 
still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, 
as I have just observed; for 'Old Charley' never let a day pass without 
stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour came on, and very 
often he would stay to breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner; and 
then the amount of wine that was made way with by the two cronies at a 
sitting, 
<pb n="473"/>  
it would really be a difficult thing to ascertain.  'Old 
Charley's' favourite beverage was Chateau Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr 
Shuttleworthy's heart good to see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, 
quart after quart; so that, one day, when the wine was in and the wit, as a 
natural consequence, somewhat out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him 
upon the back: 'I tell you what it is, "Old Charley", you are, by all odds, 
the heartiest old fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since 
you love to guzzle the wine at that fashion, I'll be darned if I don't have 
to make thee a present of a big box of the Chateau Margaux.  Od rot me,' &mdash; 
(Mr Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went 
beyond 'Od rot me', or 'By gosh', or 'By the jolly golly',) &mdash; 'Od rot me,' 
says he, 'if I don't send an order to town this very afternoon for a double 
box of the best that can be got, and I'll make ye a present of it, I will! &mdash; 
ye needn't say a word now &mdash; I will, I tell ye, and there's an end of it; so 
look out for it &mdash; it will come to hand some of these fine days precisely 
when ye are looking for it the least!'  I mention this little bit of 
liberality on the part of Mr Shuttleworthy, just by way of showing you how 
very intimate an understanding existed between the two friends. 
</p><p>Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly 
understood that Mr Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any 
one so profoundly affected as 'Old Charley Goodfellow'.  When he first 
heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his 
master's saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol-shot, that had gone 
clean through and through the poor animal's chest without quite killing 
him &mdash; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had 
been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if 
he had had a fit of the ague. 
</p><p>At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do 
anything at all, or to decide upon any plan of action; so that for a long 
time he endeavoured to dissuade Mr Shuttleworthy's other friends from 
making a stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile &mdash; say for a 
week or two, or a month or two &mdash; to see if something wouldn't turn up, or if 
Mr Shuttleworthy wouldn't come in the natural way, and explain his reasons 
for sending his horse on before.  I dare say you have often observed this 
disposition to temporize, or to procrastinate, in people who are labouring 
under any very poignant sorrow.  Their powers of mind seem to be rendered 
torpid, so that they have a horror of anything like action, and like 
nothing in the world so well as to 
<pb n="474"/>  
lie quietly in bed and 'nurse their 
grief', as the old ladies express it &mdash; that is to say, ruminate over their 
trouble. 
</p><p>The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the 
wisdom and discretion of 'Old Charley', that the greater part of them felt 
disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business 'until 
something should turn up', as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I 
believe that, after all, this would have been the general determination, 
but for the very suspicious interference of Mr Shuttleworthy's nephew, a 
young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad character. 
This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to nothing like 
reason in the matter of 'lying quiet', but insisted upon making immediate 
search for the 'corpse of the murdered man'.  This was the expression he 
employed; and Mr Goodfellow acutely remarked at the time that it was 'a 
singular expression, to say no more'.  This remark of 'Old Charley's', too, 
had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the party was heard to ask, 
very impressively, 'how it happened that young Mr Pennifeather was so 
intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy 
uncle's disappearance, as to feel authorized to assert, distinctly and 
unequivocally, that his uncle was "a murdered man"'.  Hereupon some little 
squibbling and bickering occurred among various members of the crowd, and 
especially between 'Old Charley' and Mr Pennifeather &mdash; although this latter 
occurrence was, indeed, by no means a novelty, for little good-will had 
subsisted between the parties for the last three or four months; and 
matters had even gone so far that Mr Pennifeather had actually knocked down 
his uncle's friend for some alleged excess of liberty that the latter had 
taken in the uncle's house, of which the nephew was an inmate.  Upon this 
occasion 'Old Charley' is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation 
and Christian charity.  He arose from the blow, adjusted his clothes, and 
made no attempt at retaliation at all &mdash; merely muttering a few words about 
'taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity', &mdash; a natural 
and very justifiable ebullition of anger, which meant nothing, however, 
and, beyond doubt, was no sooner given vent to than forgotten. 
</p><p>However these matters may be (which have no reference to the point now 
at issue), it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, 
principally through the persuasion of Mr Pennifeather, came at length to 
the determination of dispersing over the adjacent country in search of the 
missing Mr Shuttleworthy. 
<pb n="475"/>  
I say they came to this determination in the 
first instance.  After it had been fully resolved that a search should be 
made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should 
disperse &mdash; that is to say, distribute themselves in parties &mdash; for the more 
thorough examination of the region round about.  I forget, however, by what 
ingenious train of reasoning it was that 'Old Charley' finally convinced 
the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan that could be pursued. 
Convince them, however, he did &mdash; all except Mr Pennifeather; and, in the 
end, it was arranged that a search should be instituted, carefully and very 
thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, 'Old Charley' himself leading the 
way. 
</p><p>As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer 
than 'Old Charley', whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx; but, 
although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners, 
by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood, 
and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a 
week, still no trace of Mr Shuttleworthy could be discovered.  When I say 
no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally; for trace, 
to some extent, there certainly was.  The poor gentleman had been tracked, 
by his horse's shoes (which were peculiar), to a spot about three miles to 
the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city.  Here the 
track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland &mdash; the path coming 
out again into the main road, and cutting off about half a mile of the 
regular distance.  Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party came 
at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles, to the 
right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost 
sight of.  It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature had here 
taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much larger and 
heavier than a man, had been drawn from the by-path to the pool.  This 
latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and the party 
were upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any result, when 
Providence suggested to Mr Goodfellow the expediency of draining the water 
off altogether.  This project was received with cheers, and many high 
compliments to 'Old Charley' upon his sagacity and consideration.  As many 
of the burghers had brought spades with them, supposing that they might 
possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse, the drain was easily and 
speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom visible, than 
<pb n="476"/>  
right in the 
middle of the mud that remained was discovered a black silk velvet 
waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately recognized as the 
property of Mr Pennifeather.  This waistcoat was much torn 
and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the party 
who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner on the 
very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy's departure for the city; while there were 
others again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that Mr P. did not 
wear the garment in question at any period during the remainder of that 
memorable day; nor could any one be found to say that he had seen it upon Mr. 
P.'s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr Shuttleworthy's 
disappearance. 
</p><p>Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr Pennifeather, and it was 
observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were 
excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he 
had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word.  Hereupon, 
the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at 
once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed 
enemies for his instantaneous arrest.  But, on the other hand, the 
magnanimity of Mr Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant 
lustre through contrast.  He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of 
Mr Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere 
forgiveness of that wild young gentleman &mdash; 'the heir of the worthy Mr 
Shuttleworthy,' &mdash; for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had, no 
doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr 
Goodfellow).  'He forgave him for it,' he said, 'from the very bottom of 
his heart; and for himself (Mr Goodfellow), so far from pushing the 
suspicious circumstances to extremity, which, he was sorry to say, really 
had arisen against Mr Pennifeather, he (Mr Goodfellow) would make every 
exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his 
possession to &mdash; to &mdash; to &mdash; soften down, as much as he could conscientiously do 
so, the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of 
business.' 
</p><p>Mr Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain, very 
much to the credit both of his head and of his heart; but your warm-hearted 
people are seldom apposite in their observations &mdash; they run into all sorts 
of blunders, contre-temps and mal apropos-isms, in the hot-headedness of 
their zeal to serve a friend &mdash; thus, often with the kindest intentions in 
the world, doing infinitely more to prejudice his cause than to advance it. 
<pb n="477"/>  
</p><p>So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of 
'Old Charley'; for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the 
suspected, yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he 
uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the 
speaker in the good opinion of his audience, had the effect of deepening 
the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pled, and 
of arousing against him the fury of the mob. 
</p><p>One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his 
allusion to the suspected as 'the heir of the worthy old gentleman, Mr 
Shuttleworthy'.  The people had really never thought of this before.  They 
had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or two 
previously by the uncle (who had no living relative except the nephew), and 
they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter 
that was settled &mdash; so single-minded a race of beings were the 
Rattleburghers; but the remarks of 'Old Charley' brought them at once to a 
consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility of 
the threats having been nothing more than a threat.  And straightway, 
hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono? &mdash; a question that tended 
even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young 
man.  And here, lest I be misunderstood, permit me to digress for one 
moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple Latin phrase 
which I have employed is invariably mistranslated and misconceived.  'Cui 
bono?' in all the crack novels and elsewhere, &mdash; in those of Mrs Gore, for 
example (the author of Cecil), a lady who quotes all tongues from the 
Chaldaean to Chickasaw, and is helped to her learning, 'as needed', upon a 
systematic plan, by Mr Beckford, &mdash; in all the crack novels, I say, from 
those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two 
little Latin words cui bono are rendered 'to what purpose?' or (as if quo 
bono) 'to what good?'  Their true meaning, nevertheless, is 'for whose 
advantage'.  Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit?  It is a purely legal 
phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under 
consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the 
probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the 
deed's accomplishment.  Now, in the present instance, the question cui 
bono? very pointedly implicated Mr Pennifeather.  His uncle had threatened 
him, after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance.  But the 
threat had not been actually kept; the 
<pb n="478"/>  
original will, it appeared, had not 
been altered.  Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder 
on the part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; 
and even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into 
the good graces of the uncle.  But the will being unaltered, while the 
threat to alter remained suspended over the nephew's head, there appears at 
once the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity; and so 
concluded, very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle. 
</p><p>Mr Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the 
crowd, after some further search, proceeded homeward, having him in 
custody.  On the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to 
confirm the suspicion entertained.  Mr Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be 
always a little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a 
few paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the 
grass.  Having quickly examined it, he was observed, too, to make a sort of 
half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was 
noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up 
was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized as 
belonging to Mr Pennifeather.  Moreover, his initials were engraved upon 
the handle.  The blade of this knife was open and bloody. 
</p><p>No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew, and immediately upon 
reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination. 
</p><p>Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn.  The prisoner being 
questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr Shuttleworthy's 
disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that very 
morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had been 
discovered through the sagacity of Mr Goodfellow. 
</p><p>This latter now came forward, and, with tears in his eyes, asked 
permission to be examined.  He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed 
his Maker, not less than his fellow-men, would permit him no longer to 
remain silent.  Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man 
(notwithstanding the latter's ill treatment of himself, Mr Goodfellow) had 
induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest, by 
way of endeavouring to account for what appeared suspicious in the 
circumstances that told so seriously against Mr Pennifeather; but these 
circumstances were now altogether too convincing &mdash; 
<pb n="479"/>  
too damning; he would 
hesitate no longer &mdash; he would tell all he knew although his heart (Mr 
Goodfellow's) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort.  He then went 
on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr 
Shuttleworthy's departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had 
mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing (Mr Goodfellow's), that his object 
in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an unusually large 
sum of money in the 'Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank', and that, then and 
there, the said Mr Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to the same nephew 
his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will originally made, and 
of cutting him off with a shilling.  He (the witness) now solemnly called 
upon the accused to state whether what he (the witness) had just stated was 
or was not the truth in every substantial particular.  Much to the 
astonishment of every one present Mr Pennifeather frankly admitted that it 
was. 
</p><p>The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of 
constables to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle. 
From this search they almost immediately returned with the well-known 
steel-bound, russet leather pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in 
the habit of carrying for years.  Its valuable contents, however, had been 
abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavoured to extort from the 
prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their 
concealment.  Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter. 
The constables, also, discovered between the bed and sacking of the 
unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials of 
his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim. 
</p><p>At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man 
had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had 
received, and it was proposed by Mr Goodfellow that a post-mortem 
examination of the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if 
possible, of discovering the ball.  This was accordingly done; and, as if 
to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr Goodfellow, 
after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest, was enabled to 
detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon 
trial, was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr Pennifeather's 
rifle, while it was far too large for that of any other person in the 
borough or its vicinity.  To render the matter even surer yet, however, 
this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the 
usual suture; and upon 
<pb n="480"/>  
examination, this seam corresponded precisely with 
an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the 
accused himself to be his own property.  Upon the finding of this bullet, 
the examining magistrate refused to listen to any further testimony, and 
immediately committed the prisoner for trial &mdash; declining resolutely to take 
any bail in the case, although against this severity Mr Goodfellow very 
warmly remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might 
be required.  This generosity on the part of 'Old Charley' was only in 
accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct 
during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle.  In the 
present instance, the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the 
excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten, 
when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr 
Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar's worth of property upon the 
face of the earth. 
</p><p>The result of the committal may be readily foreseen.  Mr Pennifeather, 
amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough, was brought to trial at the 
next criminal sessions, when the chain of circumstantial evidence 
strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts, which Mr 
Goodfellow's sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the 
court) was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive, that the 
jury, without leaving their seats, returned an immediate verdict of 'Guilty 
of murder in the first degree'.  Soon afterwards the unhappy wretch 
received sentence of death, and was remanded to the county jail to await 
the inexorable vengeance of the law. 
</p><p>In the meantime, the noble behaviour of 'Old Charley Goodfellow' had 
doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough.  He became ten 
times a greater favourite than ever; and, as a natural result of the 
hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce, 
the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled him 
to observe, and very frequently had little reunions at his own house, 
when wit and jollity reigned supreme &mdash; dampened a little, of course, by the 
occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended 
over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host. 
</p><p>One fine day, this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised 
at the receipt of the following letter: &mdash; </p> 
<pb n="481"/>  

<p> 
Charles Goodfellow, Esquire;<lb/> 
</p><p>Dear Sir &mdash; In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about 
two months since, by our esteemed correspondent, Mr Barnabas Shuttleworthy, 
we have the honour of forwarding this morning, to your address, a double 
box of Chateau-Margaux, of the antelope brand, violet seal.  Box numbered 
and marked as per margin. 
  We remain, sir,<lb/> 
     Your most ob'nt ser'ts,<lb/> 
        HOGGS, FROGS, BOGS, &amp; CO.<lb/> 
City of &mdash;, June 21, 18 &mdash; .<lb/> 
 
</p><p>P.S. &mdash; The box will reach you, by wagon, on the day after your receipt 
of this letter.  Our respects to Mr Shuttleworthy. 
                    H., F., B., &amp; Co.<lb/> 
&mdash;<lb/> 
Charles Goodfellow, Esq.,<lb/> 
Rattleborough, From H., F., B., &amp; Co.<lb/> 
Chat. Mar. A &mdash; No. 1. &mdash; 6 doz. bts. (1/2 Gross).<lb/> 
</p> 

<p>The fact is, that Mr Goodfellow had, since the death of Mr. Shuttleworthy, 
given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised Chateau-Margaux; 
and he, therefore looked upon it now as a sort of especial dispensation of 
Providence in his behalf.  He was highly delighted, of course, and in the 
exuberance of his joy invited a large party of friends to a petit souper on 
the morrow, for the purpose of broaching the good old Mr Shuttleworthy's 
present.  Not that he said anything about 'the good old Mr Shuttleworthy' 
when he issued the invitations.  The fact is, he thought much and concluded 
to say nothing at all.  He did not mention to any one &mdash; if I remember 
aright &mdash; that he had received a present of Chateau-Margaux.  He merely asked 
his friends to come and help him drink some of a remarkably fine quality 
and rich flavour that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months 
ago, and of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow.  I have often 
puzzled myself to imagine why it was that 'Old Charley' came to the 
conclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his old 
friend, but I could never precisely understand his reason for the silence, 
although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason, no doubt. 
</p><p>The morrow at length arrived, and with it a very large and highly 
respectable company at Mr Goodfellow's house.  Indeed, half the borough was 
there &mdash; I myself among the number &mdash; but, much to the vexation of the host, 
the Chateau-Margaux did not arrive until a late hour, and when the 
sumptuous supper supplied by 'Old Charley' had been done very ample justice 
by the guests.  It came at length, however, a monstrously big box of it 
there was, too, &mdash; and as the whole party were in excessively good humour, it 
was decided, nem. con., that it should be lifted upon the table and its 
contents disembowelled forthwith. 
<pb n="482"/>  
</p><p>No sooner said than done.  I lent a helping hand; and, in a trice, we 
had the box upon the table, in the midst of all the bottles and glasses, 
not a few of which were demolished in the scuffle.  'Old Charley', who was 
pretty much intoxicated, and excessively red in the face, now took a seat, 
with an air of mock dignity, at the head of the board, and thumped 
furiously upon it with a decanter, calling the company to keep order 
'during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure'. 
</p><p>After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as 
very often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence 
ensued.  Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, 
'with an infinite deal of pleasure'.  I inserted a chisel, and giving it a 
few slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly off, and, 
at the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly 
facing the host, the bruised, bloody, and nearly putrid corpse of the 
murdered Mr Shuttleworthy himself.  It gazed for a few moments fixedly and 
sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the 
countenance of Mr Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and impressively, 
the words &mdash; 'Thou art the man!' and then, falling over the side of the chest 
as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs quiveringly upon the 
table. 
</p><p>The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description.  The rush for 
the doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the 
room fainted outright through sheer horror.  But after the first wild, 
shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr Goodfellow.  If I 
live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony which 
was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with triumph 
and wine.  For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of marble; his 
eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be turned inward and 
absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable murderous soul.  At 
length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out into the external 
world, and, with a quick leap, he sprang from his chair, and falling 
heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and in contact with the 
corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed confession of the 
hideous crime for which Mr Pennifeather was then imprisoned and doomed to 
die. 
</p><p>What he recounted was in substance this: &mdash;   He followed his victim to 
the vicinity of the pool; there shot his horse with a pistol; despatched 
its rider with the butt end; possessed himself of the pocket-book; and, 
supposing the horse dead, dragged 
<pb n="483"/>  
it with great labour to the brambles by 
the pool.  Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of Mr Shuttleworthy, and 
thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through 
the woods. 
</p><p>The waistcoat, the knife, the pocket-book, and bullet, had been placed 
by himself where found, with the view of avenging himself upon Mr 
Pennifeather.  He had also contrived the discovery of the stained 
handkerchief and shirt. 
</p><p>Toward the end of the blood-chilling recital, the words of the guilty 
wretch faltered and grew hollow.  When the record was finally exhausted, he 
arose, staggered backward from the table, and fell &mdash; dead. 
 
</p><p>The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although 
efficient, were simple indeed.  Mr Goodfellow's excess of frankness had 
disgusted me, and excited my suspicions from the first.  I was present when 
Mr Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then 
arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat 
of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled.  I was thus prepared 
to view the manoeuvring of 'Old Charley' in a very different light from 
that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough.  I saw 
at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or 
indirectly, from himself.  But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the 
true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr G. in the 
carcass of the horse.  I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers 
had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and 
another where it went out.  If it were found in the animal then, after 
having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by the 
person who found it.  The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea 
suggested by the bullet; for the blood on examination proved to be capital 
claret, and no more.  When I came to think of these things, and also of the 
late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr Goodfellow, I 
entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it 
altogether to myself. 
</p><p>In the meantime, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse 
of Mr Shuttleworthy, and, for good reason, searched in quarters as 
divergent as possible from those to which Mr Goodfellow conducted his 
party.  The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry 
well, the mouth of which 
<pb n="484"/>  
was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the 
bottom, I discovered what I sought. 
</p><p>Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two 
cronies, when Mr Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the 
promise of a box of Chateau-Margaux.  Upon this hint I acted.  I procured a 
stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and 
deposited the latter in an old wine box &mdash; taking care so to double the body 
up as to double the whalebone with it.  In this manner I had to press 
forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I 
anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top 
would fly off and the body up. 
</p><p>Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered, and addressed it as 
already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine-merchants 
with whom Mr Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to 
wheel the box to Mr Goodfellow's door, in a barrow, at a given signal from 
myself.  For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I confidently 
depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I counted upon 
the conscience of the murderous wretch. 
</p><p>I believe there is nothing more to be explained.  Mr Pennifeather was 
released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by the 
lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever 
afterward a new life.
