</p><p><stage>Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and	others, at several doors</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Good day, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>I am glad you're well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>I have not seen you long: how goes the world?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>It wears, sir, as it grows.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Ay, that's well known:<lb/>
But what particular rarity? what strange,<lb/>
Which manifold record not matches? See,<lb/>
Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power<lb/>
Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Merchant</speaker>
<p>O, 'tis a worthy lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Jeweller</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's most fix'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Merchant</speaker>
<p>A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,<lb/>
To an untirable and continuate goodness:<lb/>
He passes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Jeweller</speaker>
<p>I have a jewel here&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Merchant</speaker>
<p>O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Jeweller</speaker>
<p>If he will touch the estimate: but, for that&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reciting to himself]</stage></p><p>  'When we for recompense have<lb/>
praised the vile,<lb/>
It stains the glory in that happy verse<lb/>
Which aptly sings the good.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Merchant</speaker>
<p>'Tis a good form.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Looking at the jewel</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Jeweller</speaker>
<p>And rich: here is a water, look ye.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication<lb/>
To the great lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>A thing slipp'd idly from me.<lb/>
Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes<lb/>
From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint<lb/>
Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame<lb/>
Provokes itself and like the current flies<lb/>
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.<lb/>
Let's see your piece.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>'Tis a good piece.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>Indifferent.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Admirable: how this grace<lb/>
Speaks his own standing! what a mental power<lb/>
This eye shoots forth! how big imagination<lb/>
Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture<lb/>
One might interpret.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>It is a pretty mocking of the life.<lb/>
Here is a touch; is't good?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>I will say of it,<lb/>
It tutors nature: artificial strife<lb/>
Lives in these touches, livelier than life.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter certain Senators, and pass over</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>How this lord is follow'd!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>The senators of Athens: happy man!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>Look, more!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>You see this confluence, this great flood<lb/>
of visitors.<lb/>
I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,<lb/>
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug<lb/>
With amplest entertainment: my free drift<lb/>
Halts not particularly, but moves itself<lb/>
In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice<lb/>
Infects one comma in the course I hold;<lb/>
But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,<lb/>
Leaving no tract behind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>How shall I understand you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>I will unbolt to you.<lb/>
You see how all conditions, how all minds,<lb/>
As well of glib and slippery creatures as<lb/>
Of grave and austere quality, tender down<lb/>
Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune<lb/>
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging<lb/>
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance<lb/>
All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer<lb/>
To Apemantus, that few things loves better<lb/>
Than to abhor himself: even he drops down<lb/>
The knee before him, and returns in peace<lb/>
Most rich in Timon's nod.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>I saw them speak together.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill<lb/>
Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount<lb/>
Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,<lb/>
That labour on the bosom of this sphere<lb/>
To propagate their states: amongst them all,<lb/>
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,<lb/>
One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,<lb/>
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;<lb/>
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants<lb/>
Translates his rivals.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>'Tis conceived to scope.<lb/>
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,<lb/>
With one man beckon'd from the rest below,<lb/>
Bowing his head against the sleepy mount<lb/>
To climb his happiness, would be well express'd<lb/>
In our condition.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Nay, sir, but hear me on.<lb/>
All those which were his fellows but of late,<lb/>
Some better than his value, on the moment<lb/>
Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,<lb/>
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,<lb/>
Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him<lb/>
Drink the free air.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>Ay, marry, what of these?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>When Fortune in her shift and change of mood<lb/>
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants<lb/>
Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top<lb/>
Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,<lb/>
Not one accompanying his declining foot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>'Tis common:<lb/>
A thousand moral paintings I can show<lb/>
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's<lb/>
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well<lb/>
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen<lb/>
The foot above the head.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself	courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from	VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other	servants following</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Imprison'd is he, say you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,<lb/>
His means most short, his creditors most strait:<lb/>
Your honourable letter he desires<lb/>
To those have shut him up; which failing,<lb/>
Periods his comfort.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Noble Ventidius! Well;<lb/>
I am not of that feather to shake off<lb/>
My friend when he must need me. I do know him<lb/>
A gentleman that well deserves a help:<lb/>
Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,<lb/>
and free him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Your lordship ever binds him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;<lb/>
And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.<lb/>
'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,<lb/>
But to support him after. Fare you well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>All happiness to your honour!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter an old Athenian</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>Lord Timon, hear me speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Freely, good father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I have so: what of him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>Here, at your lordship's service.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,<lb/>
By night frequents my house. I am a man<lb/>
That from my first have been inclined to thrift;<lb/>
And my estate deserves an heir more raised<lb/>
Than one which holds a trencher.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Well; what further?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>One only daughter have I, no kin else,<lb/>
On whom I may confer what I have got:<lb/>
The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,<lb/>
And I have bred her at my dearest cost<lb/>
In qualities of the best. This man of thine<lb/>
Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,<lb/>
Join with me to forbid him her resort;<lb/>
Myself have spoke in vain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>The man is honest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>Therefore he will be, Timon:<lb/>
His honesty rewards him in itself;<lb/>
It must not bear my daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Does she love him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>She is young and apt:<lb/>
Our own precedent passions do instruct us<lb/>
What levity's in youth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p><stage>[To LUCILIUS]</stage></p><p>           Love you the maid?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>If in her marriage my consent be missing,<lb/>
I call the gods to witness, I will choose<lb/>
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,<lb/>
And dispossess her all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>How shall she be endow'd,<lb/>
if she be mated with an equal husband?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>Three talents on the present; in future, all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>This gentleman of mine hath served me long:<lb/>
To build his fortune I will strain a little,<lb/>
For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:<lb/>
What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,<lb/>
And make him weigh with her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Athenian</speaker>
<p>Most noble lord,<lb/>
Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>Humbly I thank your lordship: never may<lb/>
The state or fortune fall into my keeping,<lb/>
Which is not owed to you!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:<lb/>
Go not away. What have you there, my friend?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>A piece of painting, which I do beseech<lb/>
Your lordship to accept.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Painting is welcome.<lb/>
The painting is almost the natural man;<lb/>
or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,<lb/>
He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are<lb/>
Even such as they give out. I like your work;<lb/>
And you shall find I like it: wait attendance<lb/>
Till you hear further from me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>The gods preserve ye!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;<lb/>
We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel<lb/>
Hath suffer'd under praise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Jeweller</speaker>
<p>What, my lord! dispraise?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>A more satiety of commendations.<lb/>
If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,<lb/>
It would unclew me quite.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Jeweller</speaker>
<p>My lord, 'tis rated<lb/>
As those which sell would give: but you well know,<lb/>
Things of like value differing in the owners<lb/>
Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,<lb/>
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Well mock'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Merchant</speaker>
<p>No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,<lb/>
Which all men speak with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Look, who comes here: will you be chid?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter APEMANTUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Merchant</speaker>
<p>He'll spare none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;<lb/>
When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Are they not Athenians?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Yes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Then I repent not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Thou art proud, Apemantus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Whither art going?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>That's a deed thou'lt die for.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>The best, for the innocence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Wrought he not well that painted it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>He wrought better that made the painter; and yet<lb/>
he's but a filthy piece of work.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>You're a dog.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>No; I eat not lords.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>That's a lascivious apprehension.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a<lb/>
man a doit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>What dost thou think 'tis worth?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>How now, philosopher!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Thou liest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Art not one?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Yes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Then I lie not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Art not a poet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Yes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou<lb/>
hast feigned him a worthy fellow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>That's not feigned; he is so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy<lb/>
labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'<lb/>
the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>What wouldst do then, Apemantus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>What, thyself?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Ay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Wherefore?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>That I had no angry wit to be a lord.<lb/>
Art not thou a merchant?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Merchant</speaker>
<p>Ay, Apemantus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Merchant</speaker>
<p>If traffic do it, the gods do it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>What trumpet's that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,<lb/>
All of companionship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt some Attendants</stage></p>


<p>
You must needs dine with me: go not you hence<lb/>
Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,<lb/>
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest</stage></p>


<p>
Most welcome, sir!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>So, so, there!<lb/>
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!<lb/>
That there should be small love 'mongst these<lb/>
sweet knaves,<lb/>
And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out<lb/>
Into baboon and monkey.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed<lb/>
Most hungerly on your sight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Right welcome, sir!<lb/>
Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time<lb/>
In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all except APEMANTUS</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter two Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>What time o' day is't, Apemantus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Time to be honest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>That time serves still.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Fare thee well, fare thee well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Why, Apemantus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to<lb/>
give thee none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Hang thyself!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy<lb/>
requests to thy friend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,<lb/>
And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes<lb/>
The very heart of kindness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,<lb/>
Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays<lb/>
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,<lb/>
But breeds the giver a return exceeding<lb/>
All use of quittance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>The noblest mind he carries<lb/>
That ever govern'd man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I'll keep you company.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>A banqueting-room in Timon's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet	served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter	TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.	Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS,	discontentedly, like himself</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>VENTIDIUS</speaker>
<p>Most honour'd Timon,<lb/>
It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,<lb/>
And call him to long peace.<lb/>
He is gone happy, and has left me rich:<lb/>
Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound<lb/>
To your free heart, I do return those talents,<lb/>
Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help<lb/>
I derived liberty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>O, by no means,<lb/>
Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:<lb/>
I gave it freely ever; and there's none<lb/>
Can truly say he gives, if he receives:<lb/>
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare<lb/>
To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VENTIDIUS</speaker>
<p>A noble spirit!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Nay, my lords,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON</stage></p>


<p>
Ceremony was but devised at first<lb/>
To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,<lb/>
Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;<lb/>
But where there is true friendship, there needs none.<lb/>
Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes<lb/>
Than my fortunes to me.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They sit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>My lord, we always have confess'd it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>O, Apemantus, you are welcome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>No;<lb/>
You shall not make me welcome:<lb/>
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there<lb/>
Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.<lb/>
They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond<lb/>
man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by<lb/>
himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is<lb/>
he fit for't, indeed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to<lb/>
observe; I give thee warning on't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,<lb/>
therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;<lb/>
prithee, let my meat make thee silent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should<lb/>
ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of<lb/>
men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me<lb/>
to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;<lb/>
and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.<lb/>
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:<lb/>
Methinks they should invite them without knives;<lb/>
Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.<lb/>
There's much example for't; the fellow that sits<lb/>
next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the<lb/>
breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest<lb/>
man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a<lb/>
huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;<lb/>
Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:<lb/>
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Let it flow this way, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides<lb/>
well. Those healths will make thee and thy state<lb/>
look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to<lb/>
be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:<lb/>
This and my food are equals; there's no odds:<lb/>
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.<lb/>

Apemantus' grace.<lb/>

Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;<lb/>
I pray for no man but myself:<lb/>
Grant I may never prove so fond,<lb/>
To trust man on his oath or bond;<lb/>
Or a harlot, for her weeping;<lb/>
Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:<lb/>
Or a keeper with my freedom;<lb/>
Or my friends, if I should need 'em.<lb/>
Amen. So fall to't:<lb/>
Rich men sin, and I eat root.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Eats and drinks</stage></p>


<p>
Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>My heart is ever at your service, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a<lb/>
dinner of friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat<lb/>
like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,<lb/>
that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you<lb/>
would once use our hearts, whereby we might express<lb/>
some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves<lb/>
for ever perfect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods<lb/>
themselves have provided that I shall have much help<lb/>
from you: how had you been my friends else? why<lb/>
have you that charitable title from thousands, did<lb/>
not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told<lb/>
more of you to myself than you can with modesty<lb/>
speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm<lb/>
you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any<lb/>
friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they<lb/>
were the most needless creatures living, should we<lb/>
ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble<lb/>
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their<lb/>
sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished<lb/>
myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We<lb/>
are born to do benefits: and what better or<lb/>
properer can we can our own than the riches of our<lb/>
friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have<lb/>
so many, like brothers, commanding one another's<lb/>
fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!<lb/>
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to<lb/>
forget their faults, I drink to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Joy had the like conception in our eyes<lb/>
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Much!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Tucket, within</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>What means that trump?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Servant</stage></p>


<p>
How now?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Please you, my lord, there are certain<lb/>
ladies most desirous of admittance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Ladies! what are their wills?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which<lb/>
bears that office, to signify their pleasures.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I pray, let them be admitted.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter Cupid</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cupid</speaker>
<p>Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all<lb/>
That of his bounties taste! The five best senses<lb/>
Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely<lb/>
To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,<lb/>
Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;<lb/>
They only now come but to feast thine eyes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:<lb/>
Music, make their welcome!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Cupid</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies	as Amazons, with lutes in their hands,	dancing and playing</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!<lb/>
They dance! they are mad women.<lb/>
Like madness is the glory of this life.<lb/>
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.<lb/>
We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;<lb/>
And spend our flatteries, to drink those men<lb/>
Upon whose age we void it up again,<lb/>
With poisonous spite and envy.<lb/>
Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?<lb/>
Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves<lb/>
Of their friends' gift?<lb/>
I should fear those that dance before me now<lb/>
Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;<lb/>
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of TIMON; and
to show their loves, each singles out an Amazon, and all dance, men with
women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,<lb/>
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,<lb/>
Which was not half so beautiful and kind;<lb/>
You have added worth unto 't and lustre,<lb/>
And entertain'd me with mine own device;<lb/>
I am to thank you for 't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lady</speaker>
<p>My lord, you take us even at the best.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold<lb/>
taking, I doubt me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:<lb/>
Please you to dispose yourselves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All Ladies</speaker>
<p>Most thankfully, my lord.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Cupid and Ladies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Flavius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>The little casket bring me hither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!<lb/>
There is no crossing him in 's humour;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
Else I should tell him,&mdash;well, i' faith I should,<lb/>
When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.<lb/>
'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,<lb/>
That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Where be our men?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Here, my lord, in readiness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Our horses!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>O my friends,<lb/>
I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,<lb/>
I must entreat you, honour me so much<lb/>
As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,<lb/>
Kind my lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I am so far already in your gifts,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>So are we all.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate<lb/>
Newly alighted, and come to visit you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>They are fairly welcome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>I beseech your honour,<lb/>
Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:<lb/>
I prithee, let's be provided to show them<lb/>
entertainment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I scarce know how.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Second Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Servant</speaker>
<p>May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,<lb/>
Out of his free love, hath presented to you<lb/>
Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I shall accept them fairly; let the presents<lb/>
Be worthily entertain'd.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a third Servant</stage></p>


<p>
How now! what news?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Servant</speaker>
<p>Please you, my lord, that honourable<lb/>
gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company<lb/>
to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour<lb/>
two brace of greyhounds.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,<lb/>
Not without fair reward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>                What will this come to?<lb/>
He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,<lb/>
And all out of an empty coffer:<lb/>
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,<lb/>
To show him what a beggar his heart is,<lb/>
Being of no power to make his wishes good:<lb/>
His promises fly so beyond his state<lb/>
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes<lb/>
For every word: he is so kind that he now<lb/>
Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.<lb/>
Well, would I were gently put out of office<lb/>
Before I were forced out!<lb/>
Happier is he that has no friend to feed<lb/>
Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.<lb/>
I bleed inwardly for my lord.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You do yourselves<lb/>
Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:<lb/>
Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>With more than common thanks I will receive it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>O, he's the very soul of bounty!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>And now I remember, my lord, you gave<lb/>
Good words the other day of a bay courser<lb/>
I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man<lb/>
Can justly praise but what he does affect:<lb/>
I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;<lb/>
I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All Lords</speaker>
<p>O, none so welcome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I take all and your several visitations<lb/>
So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;<lb/>
Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,<lb/>
And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,<lb/>
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;<lb/>
It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living<lb/>
Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast<lb/>
Lie in a pitch'd field.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Ay, defiled land, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>We are so virtuously bound&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>And so<lb/>
Am I to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>So infinitely endear'd&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>All to you. Lights, more lights!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>The best of happiness,<lb/>
Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Ready for his friends.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>What a coil's here!<lb/>
Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!<lb/>
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums<lb/>
That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:<lb/>
Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,<lb/>
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be<lb/>
good to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,<lb/>
there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then<lb/>
thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,<lb/>
Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in<lb/>
paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and<lb/>
vain-glories?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am<lb/>
sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come<lb/>
with better music.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>So:<lb/>
Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:<lb/>
I'll lock thy heaven from thee.<lb/>
O, that men's ears should be<lb/>
To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!<lb/>

But find supply immediate. Get you gone:<lb/>
Put on a most importunate aspect,<lb/>

<p><stage>The same. A hall in Timon's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter FLAVIUS, with many bills in his hand</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,<lb/>
That he will neither know how to maintain it,<lb/>
Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account<lb/>
How things go from him, nor resumes no care<lb/>
Of what is to continue: never mind<lb/>
Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.<lb/>
What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel:<lb/>
I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.<lb/>
Fie, fie, fie, fie!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPHIS</speaker>
<p>Good even, Varro: what,<lb/>
You come for money?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Varro's Servant</speaker>
<p>Is't not your business too?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPHIS</speaker>
<p>It is: and yours too, Isidore?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Isidore's Servant</speaker>
<p>It is so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPHIS</speaker>
<p>Would we were all discharged!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,<lb/>
My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPHIS</speaker>
<p>My lord, here is a note of certain dues.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Dues! Whence are you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPHIS</speaker>
<p>Of Athens here, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Go to my steward.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPHIS</speaker>
<p>Please it your lordship, he hath put me off<lb/>
To the succession of new days this month:<lb/>
My master is awaked by great occasion<lb/>
To call upon his own, and humbly prays you<lb/>
That with your other noble parts you'll suit<lb/>
In giving him his right.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Mine honest friend,<lb/>
I prithee, but repair to me next morning.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPHIS</speaker>
<p>Nay, good my lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Contain thyself, good friend.<lb/>

<p>One Varro's servant, my good lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Isidore's Servant</speaker>
<p>From Isidore;<lb/>
He humbly prays your speedy payment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPHIS</speaker>
<p>If you did know, my lord, my master's wants&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Varro's Servant</speaker>
<p>'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks And past.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Isidore's Servant</speaker>
<p>Your steward puts me off, my lord;<lb/>
And I am sent expressly to your lordship.<lb/>

Come hither: pray you,<lb/>
How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd<lb/>

And the detention of long-since-due debts,<lb/>
Against my honour?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Please you, gentlemen,<lb/>
The time is unagreeable to this business:<lb/>
Your importunacy cease till after dinner,<lb/>

<p>Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus:<lb/>
let's ha' some sport with 'em.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Varro's Servant</speaker>
<p>Hang him, he'll abuse us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Isidore's Servant</speaker>
<p>A plague upon him, dog!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Varro's Servant</speaker>
<p>How dost, fool?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Dost dialogue with thy shadow?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Varro's Servant</speaker>
<p>I speak not to thee.<lb/>

<p>No,'tis to thyself.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To the Fool</stage></p>


<p>
Come away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Isidore's Servant</speaker>
<p>There's the fool hangs on your back already.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPHIS</speaker>
<p>Where's the fool now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and<lb/>
usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All Servants</speaker>
<p>What are we, Apemantus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Asses.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All Servants</speaker>
<p>Why?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>That you ask me what you are, and do not know<lb/>
yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fool</speaker>
<p>How do you, gentlemen?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All Servants</speaker>
<p>Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fool</speaker>
<p>She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens<lb/>
as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Good! gramercy.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter Page</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fool</speaker>
<p>Look you, here comes my mistress' page.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Page</speaker>
<p><stage>[To the Fool]</stage></p><p>  Why, how now, captain! what do you<lb/>
in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer<lb/>
thee profitably.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Page</speaker>
<p>Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of<lb/>
these letters: I know not which is which.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Canst not read?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Page</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>There will little learning die then, that day thou<lb/>
art hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to<lb/>
Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard, and thou't<lb/>
die a bawd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Page</speaker>
<p>Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a<lb/>
dog's death. Answer not; I am gone.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool, I will go with<lb/>
you to Lord Timon's.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fool</speaker>
<p>Will you leave me there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All Servants</speaker>
<p>Ay; would they served us!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>So would I,&mdash;as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fool</speaker>
<p>Are you three usurers' men?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All Servants</speaker>
<p>Ay, fool.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fool</speaker>
<p>I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my<lb/>
mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come<lb/>
to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and<lb/>
go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house<lb/>
merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Varro's Servant</speaker>
<p>I could render one.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster<lb/>
and a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt be<lb/>
no less esteemed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Varro's Servant</speaker>
<p>What is a whoremaster, fool?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fool</speaker>
<p>A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.<lb/>
'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;<lb/>
sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,<lb/>
with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is<lb/>
very often like a knight; and, generally, in all<lb/>
shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore<lb/>
to thirteen, this spirit walks in.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Varro's Servant</speaker>
<p>Thou art not altogether a fool.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fool</speaker>
<p>Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as<lb/>
I have, so much wit thou lackest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>That answer might have become Apemantus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All Servants</speaker>
<p>Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Come with me, fool, come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fool</speaker>
<p>I do not always follow lover, elder brother and<lb/>
woman; sometime the philosopher.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Servants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time<lb/>
Had you not fully laid my state before me,<lb/>
That I might so have rated my expense,<lb/>
As I had leave of means?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>You would not hear me,<lb/>
At many leisures I proposed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Go to:<lb/>
Perchance some single vantages you took.<lb/>
When my indisposition put you back:<lb/>
And that unaptness made your minister,<lb/>
Thus to excuse yourself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>O my good lord,<lb/>
At many times I brought in my accounts,<lb/>
Laid them before you; you would throw them off,<lb/>
And say, you found them in mine honesty.<lb/>
When, for some trifling present, you have bid me<lb/>
Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;<lb/>
Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you<lb/>
To hold your hand more close: I did endure<lb/>
Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have<lb/>
Prompted you in the ebb of your estate<lb/>
And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,<lb/>
Though you hear now, too late&mdash;yet now's a time&mdash;<lb/>
The greatest of your having lacks a half<lb/>
To pay your present debts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Let all my land be sold.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone;<lb/>
And what remains will hardly stop the mouth<lb/>
Of present dues: the future comes apace:<lb/>
What shall defend the interim? and at length<lb/>
How goes our reckoning?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>To Lacedaemon did my land extend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>O my good lord, the world is but a word:<lb/>
Were it all yours to give it in a breath,<lb/>
How quickly were it gone!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You tell me true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,<lb/>
Call me before the exactest auditors<lb/>
And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,<lb/>
When all our offices have been oppress'd<lb/>
With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept<lb/>
With drunken spilth of wine, when every room<lb/>
Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,<lb/>
I have retired me to a wasteful cock,<lb/>
And set mine eyes at flow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Prithee, no more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!<lb/>
How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants<lb/>
This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?<lb/>
What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is<lb/>
Lord Timon's?<lb/>
Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!<lb/>
Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,<lb/>
The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:<lb/>
Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,<lb/>
These flies are couch'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Come, sermon me no further:<lb/>
No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;<lb/>
Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.<lb/>
Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,<lb/>
To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;<lb/>
If I would broach the vessels of my love,<lb/>
And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,<lb/>
Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use<lb/>
As I can bid thee speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Assurance bless your thoughts!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,<lb/>
That I account them blessings; for by these<lb/>
Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you<lb/>
Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.<lb/>
Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other Servants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servants</speaker>
<p>My lord? my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;<lb/>
to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour<lb/>
to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their<lb/>
loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have<lb/>
found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let<lb/>
the request be fifty talents.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAMINIUS</speaker>
<p>As you have said, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Go you, sir, to the senators&mdash;<lb/>
Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have<lb/>
Deserved this hearing&mdash;bid 'em send o' the instant<lb/>
A thousand talents to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>I have been bold&mdash;<lb/>
For that I knew it the most general way&mdash;<lb/>
To them to use your signet and your name;<lb/>
But they do shake their heads, and I am here<lb/>
No richer in return.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Is't true? can't be?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,<lb/>
That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot<lb/>
Do what they would; are sorry&mdash;you are honourable,&mdash;<lb/>
But yet they could have wish'd&mdash;they know not&mdash;<lb/>
Something hath been amiss&mdash;a noble nature<lb/>
May catch a wrench&mdash;would all were well&mdash;'tis pity;&mdash;<lb/>
And so, intending other serious matters,<lb/>
After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,<lb/>
With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods<lb/>
They froze me into silence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You gods, reward them!<lb/>
Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows<lb/>
Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:<lb/>
Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;<lb/>
'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;<lb/>
And nature, as it grows again toward earth,<lb/>
Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To a Servant</stage></p>


<p>
Go to Ventidius.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To FLAVIUS</stage></p>


<p>
Prithee, be not sad,<lb/>
Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.<lb/>
No blame belongs to thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To Servant</stage></p>


<p>
Ventidius lately<lb/>
Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd<lb/>
Into a great estate: when he was poor,<lb/>
Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,<lb/>
I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;<lb/>
Bid him suppose some good necessity<lb/>
Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd<lb/>
With those five talents.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Servant</stage>



</p><p><stage>To FLAVIUS</stage></p>


<p>
That had, give't these fellows<lb/>
To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,<lb/>
That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>I would I could not think it: that thought is<lb/>
bounty's foe;<lb/>
Being free itself, it thinks all others so.<lb/>

<p>I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and<lb/>
what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAMINIUS</speaker>
<p>'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my<lb/>
lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to<lb/>
supply; who, having great and instant occasion to<lb/>
use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to<lb/>
furnish him, nothing doubting your present<lb/>
assistance therein.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCULLUS</speaker>
<p>La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,<lb/>
good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not<lb/>
keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'<lb/>
dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to<lb/>
supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,<lb/>
and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning<lb/>
by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty<lb/>
is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get<lb/>
him from't.<lb/>

Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a<lb/>
bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou<lb/>
knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,<lb/>
that this is no time to lend money, especially upon<lb/>
bare friendship, without security. Here's three<lb/>
solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say<lb/>
thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and<lb/>
an honourable gentleman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Stranger</speaker>
<p>We know him for no less, though we are but strangers<lb/>
to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and<lb/>
which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's<lb/>
happy hours are done and past, and his estate<lb/>
shrinks from him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Stranger</speaker>
<p>But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,<lb/>
one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow<lb/>
so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and<lb/>
showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>How!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Stranger</speaker>
<p>I tell you, denied, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,<lb/>
I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!<lb/>
there was very little honour showed in't. For my own<lb/>
part, I must needs confess, I have received some<lb/>
small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels<lb/>
and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;<lb/>
yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should<lb/>
ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.<lb/>

him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SERVILIUS</speaker>
<p>Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;<lb/>
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use<lb/>
with so many talents.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>I know his lordship is but merry with me;<lb/>
He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SERVILIUS</speaker>
<p>But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.<lb/>
If his occasion were not virtuous,<lb/>
I should not urge it half so faithfully.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SERVILIUS</speaker>
<p>Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself<lb/>
against such a good time, when I might ha' shown<lb/>
myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I<lb/>
should purchase the day before for a little part,<lb/>
and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,<lb/>
before the gods, I am not able to do,&mdash;the more<lb/>
beast, I say:&mdash;I was sending to use Lord Timon<lb/>
myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would<lb/>
not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.<lb/>
Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I<lb/>
hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,<lb/>
because I have no power to be kind: and tell him<lb/>
this from me, I count it one of my greatest<lb/>
afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an<lb/>
honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you<lb/>
befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SERVILIUS</speaker>
<p>Yes, sir, I shall.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit SERVILIUS</stage></p>


<p>
True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;<lb/>
And he that's once denied will hardly speed.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Stranger</speaker>
<p>Do you observe this, Hostilius?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Stranger</speaker>
<p>Ay, too well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Stranger</speaker>
<p>Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the<lb/>
same piece<lb/>
Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him<lb/>
His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in<lb/>
My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,<lb/>
And kept his credit with his purse,<lb/>
Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money<lb/>
Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,<lb/>
But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;<lb/>
And yet&mdash;O, see the monstrousness of man<lb/>
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!&mdash;<lb/>
He does deny him, in respect of his,<lb/>
What charitable men afford to beggars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Stranger</speaker>
<p>Religion groans at it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Stranger</speaker>
<p>For mine own part,<lb/>
I never tasted Timon in my life,<lb/>
Nor came any of his bounties over me,<lb/>
To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,<lb/>
For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue<lb/>
And honourable carriage,<lb/>
Had his necessity made use of me,<lb/>
I would have put my wealth into donation,<lb/>
And the best half should have return'd to him,<lb/>
So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,<lb/>
Men must learn now with pity to dispense;<lb/>
For policy sits above conscience.<lb/>

<p><stage>A room in Sempronius' house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SEMPRONIUS</speaker>
<p>Must he needs trouble me in 't,&mdash;hum!&mdash;'bove<lb/>
all others?<lb/>
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;<lb/>
And now Ventidius is wealthy too,<lb/>
Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these<lb/>
Owe their estates unto him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for<lb/>
They have au denied him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SEMPRONIUS</speaker>
<p>How! have they denied him?<lb/>
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?<lb/>
And does he send to me? Three? hum!<lb/>
It shows but little love or judgment in him:<lb/>
Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like<lb/>
physicians,<lb/>
Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?<lb/>
Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,<lb/>
That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,<lb/>
But his occasion might have woo'd me first;<lb/>
For, in my conscience, I was the first man<lb/>
That e'er received gift from him:<lb/>
And does he think so backwardly of me now,<lb/>
That I'll requite its last? No:<lb/>
So it may prove an argument of laughter<lb/>
To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.<lb/>
I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,<lb/>
Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;<lb/>
I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,<lb/>
And with their faint reply this answer join;<lb/>
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The<lb/>
devil knew not what he did when he made man<lb/>
politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot<lb/>
think but, in the end, the villainies of man will<lb/>
set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to<lb/>
appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,<lb/>
like those that under hot ardent zeal would set<lb/>
whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his<lb/>
politic love.<lb/>
This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,<lb/>
Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,<lb/>
Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards<lb/>
Many a bounteous year must be employ'd<lb/>
Now to guard sure their master.<lb/>
And this is all a liberal course allows;<lb/>
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>The like to you kind Varro.<lb/>

<p>Lucius!<lb/>
What, do we meet together?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Ay, and I think<lb/>
One business does command us all; for mine Is money.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>So is theirs and ours.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PHILOTUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>And Sir Philotus too!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOTUS</speaker>
<p>Good day at once.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Welcome, good brother.<lb/>
What do you think the hour?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOTUS</speaker>
<p>Labouring for nine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>So much?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOTUS</speaker>
<p>Is not my lord seen yet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Not yet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOTUS</speaker>
<p>I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:<lb/>
You must consider that a prodigal course<lb/>
Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.<lb/>
I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;<lb/>
That is one may reach deep enough, and yet<lb/>
Find little.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILOTUS</speaker>
<p>I am of your fear for that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>I'll show you how to observe a strange event.<lb/>
Your lord sends now for money.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HORTENSIUS</speaker>
<p>Most true, he does.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,<lb/>
For which I wait for money.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HORTENSIUS</speaker>
<p>It is against my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Mark, how strange it shows,<lb/>
Timon in this should pay more than he owes:<lb/>
And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,<lb/>
And send for money for 'em.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HORTENSIUS</speaker>
<p>I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:<lb/>
I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,<lb/>
And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Five thousand mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,<lb/>
Your master's confidence was above mine;<lb/>
Else, surely, his had equall'd.<lb/>

Enter FLAMINIUS.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>One of Lord Timon's men.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready to<lb/>
come forth?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAMINIUS</speaker>
<p>No, indeed, he is not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?<lb/>
He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>Do you hear, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Servant</speaker>
<p>By your leave, sir,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>What do ye ask of me, my friend?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>We wait for certain money here, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay,<lb/>
If money were as certain as your waiting,<lb/>
'Twere sure enough.<lb/>
Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,<lb/>
When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?<lb/>
Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts<lb/>
And take down the interest into their<lb/>
gluttonous maws.<lb/>
You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;<lb/>
Let me pass quietly:<lb/>
Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;<lb/>
I have no more to reckon, he to spend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Ay, but this answer will not serve.<lb/>

<p>How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Servant</speaker>
<p>No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge<lb/>
enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no<lb/>
house to put his head in? such may rail against<lb/>
great buildings.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SERVILIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SERVILIUS</speaker>
<p>If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some<lb/>
other hour, I should derive much from't; for,<lb/>
take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to<lb/>
discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;<lb/>
he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.<lb/>


And, if it be so far beyond his health,<lb/>
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,<lb/>
And make a clear way to the gods.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SERVILIUS</speaker>
<p>Good gods!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>What, are my doors opposed against my passage?<lb/>
Have I been ever free, and must my house<lb/>
Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?<lb/>
The place which I have feasted, does it now,<lb/>
Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lucilius's Servant</speaker>
<p>Put in now, Titus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, here is my bill.<lb/>

desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.<lb/>

Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:<lb/>

You only speak from your distracted soul;<lb/>
There is not so much left, to furnish out<lb/>
A moderate table.<lb/>

<p><stage>The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.</stage>
</p><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's<lb/>
Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:<lb/>
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>Most true; the law shall bruise him.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Now, captain?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>I am an humble suitor to your virtues;<lb/>
For pity is the virtue of the law,<lb/>
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.<lb/>
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy<lb/>
Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,<lb/>
Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth<lb/>
To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.<lb/>
He is a man, setting his fate aside,<lb/>
Of comely virtues:<lb/>
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice&mdash;<lb/>
An honour in him which buys out his fault&mdash;<lb/>
But with a noble fury and fair spirit,<lb/>
Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,<lb/>
He did oppose his foe:<lb/>
And with such sober and unnoted passion<lb/>
He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,<lb/>
As if he had but proved an argument.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>You undergo too strict a paradox,<lb/>
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:<lb/>
Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd<lb/>
To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling<lb/>
Upon the head of valour; which indeed<lb/>
Is valour misbegot and came into the world<lb/>
When sects and factions were newly born:<lb/>
He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer<lb/>
The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs<lb/>
His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,<lb/>
carelessly,<lb/>
And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,<lb/>
To bring it into danger.<lb/>
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,<lb/>
What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>My lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>You cannot make gross sins look clear:<lb/>
To revenge is no valour, but to bear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,<lb/>
If I speak like a captain.<lb/>
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,<lb/>
And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,<lb/>
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,<lb/>
Without repugnancy? If there be<lb/>
Such valour in the bearing, what make we<lb/>
Abroad? why then, women are more valiant<lb/>
That stay at home, if bearing carry it,<lb/>
And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon<lb/>
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,<lb/>
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,<lb/>
As you are great, be pitifully good:<lb/>
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?<lb/>
To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;<lb/>
But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.<lb/>
To be in anger is impiety;<lb/>
But who is man that is not angry?<lb/>
Weigh but the crime with this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>You breathe in vain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>In vain! his service done<lb/>
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium<lb/>
Were a sufficient briber for his life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>What's that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>I say, my lords, he has done fair service,<lb/>
And slain in fight many of your enemies:<lb/>
How full of valour did he bear himself<lb/>
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>He has made too much plenty with 'em;<lb/>
He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often<lb/>
Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:<lb/>
If there were no foes, that were enough<lb/>
To overcome him: in that beastly fury<lb/>
He has been known to commit outrages,<lb/>
And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,<lb/>
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>He dies.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Hard fate! he might have died in war.<lb/>
My lords, if not for any parts in him&mdash;<lb/>
Though his right arm might purchase his own time<lb/>
And be in debt to none&mdash;yet, more to move you,<lb/>
Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:<lb/>
And, for I know your reverend ages love<lb/>
Security, I'll pawn my victories, all<lb/>
My honours to you, upon his good returns.<lb/>
If by this crime he owes the law his life,<lb/>
Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore<lb/>
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,<lb/>
On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,<lb/>
He forfeits his own blood that spills another.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,<lb/>
I do beseech you, know me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>How!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Call me to your remembrances.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Senator</speaker>
<p>What!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>I cannot think but your age has forgot me;<lb/>
It could not else be, I should prove so base,<lb/>
To sue, and be denied such common grace:<lb/>
My wounds ache at you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Do you dare our anger?<lb/>
'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;<lb/>
We banish thee for ever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Banish me!<lb/>
Banish your dotage; banish usury,<lb/>
That makes the senate ugly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,<lb/>
Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell<lb/>
our spirit,<lb/>
He shall be executed presently.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Senators</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live<lb/>
Only in bone, that none may look on you!<lb/>
I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,<lb/>
While they have told their money and let out<lb/>
Their coin upon large interest, I myself<lb/>
Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?<lb/>
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate<lb/>
Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!<lb/>
It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;<lb/>
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,<lb/>
That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up<lb/>
My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.<lb/>
'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;<lb/>
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>The good time of day to you, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord<lb/>
did but try us this other day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we<lb/>
encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as<lb/>
he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest<lb/>
inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me<lb/>
to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and<lb/>
I must needs appear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all<lb/>
things go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of<lb/>
you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>A thousand pieces.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>A thousand pieces!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>What of you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>He sent to me, sir,&mdash;Here he comes.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter TIMON and Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>The swallow follows not summer more willing than we<lb/>
your lordship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Nor more willingly leaves winter; such<lb/>
summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not<lb/>
recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the<lb/>
music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the<lb/>
trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship<lb/>
that I returned you an empty messenger.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>O, sir, let it not trouble you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>My noble lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Ah, my good friend, what cheer?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,<lb/>
that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,<lb/>
I was so unfortunate a beggar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Think not on 't, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>If you had sent but two hours before,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Let it not cumber your better remembrance.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>The banquet brought in</stage></p>


<p>
Come, bring in all together.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>All covered dishes!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Royal cheer, I warrant you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield<lb/>
it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>How do you? What's the news?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord, Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Alcibiades banished!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>'Tis so, be sure of it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>How! how!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I pray you, upon what?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>My worthy friends, will you draw near?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>This is the old man still.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>Will 't hold? will 't hold?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>It does: but time will&mdash;and so&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>I do conceive.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to<lb/>
the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all<lb/>
places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let<lb/>
the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:<lb/>
sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.<lb/>

You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with<lb/>
thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves<lb/>
praised: but reserve still to give, lest your<lb/>
deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that<lb/>
one need not lend to another; for, were your<lb/>
godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the<lb/>
gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man<lb/>
that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without<lb/>
a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at<lb/>
the table, let a dozen of them be&mdash;as they are. The<lb/>
rest of your fees, O gods&mdash;the senators of Athens,<lb/>
together with the common lag of people&mdash;what is<lb/>
amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for<lb/>
destruction. For these my present friends, as they<lb/>
are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to<lb/>
nothing are they welcome.<lb/>

Uncover, dogs, and lap.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of	warm water</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Some Speak</speaker>
<p>What does his lordship mean?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Some Others</speaker>
<p>I know not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>May you a better feast never behold,<lb/>
You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water<lb/>
Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;<lb/>
Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,<lb/>
Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces<lb/>
Your reeking villany.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Throwing the water in their faces</stage></p>


<p>
Live loathed and long,<lb/>
Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,<lb/>
Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,<lb/>
You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,<lb/>
Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!<lb/>
Of man and beast the infinite malady<lb/>
Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?<lb/>
Soft! take thy physic first&mdash;thou too&mdash;and thou;&mdash;<lb/>
Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out</stage></p>


<p>
What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,<lb/>
Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.<lb/>
Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be<lb/>
Of Timon man and all humanity!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter the Lords, Senators, &amp;c</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>How now, my lords!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>Push! did you see my cap?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Lord</speaker>
<p>I have lost my gown.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.<lb/>
He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has<lb/>
beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>Did you see my cap?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Here 'tis.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Lord</speaker>
<p>Here lies my gown.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Let's make no stay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Lord Timon's mad.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>I feel 't upon my bones.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,<lb/>
That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,<lb/>
And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!<lb/>
Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,<lb/>
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,<lb/>
And minister in their steads! to general filths<lb/>
Convert o' the instant, green virginity,<lb/>
Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;<lb/>
Rather than render back, out with your knives,<lb/>
And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!<lb/>
Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,<lb/>
And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;<lb/>
Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,<lb/>
pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,<lb/>
With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,<lb/>
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,<lb/>
Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,<lb/>
Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,<lb/>
Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,<lb/>
Decline to your confounding contraries,<lb/>
And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,<lb/>
Your potent and infectious fevers heap<lb/>
On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,<lb/>
Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt<lb/>
As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty<lb/>
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,<lb/>
That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,<lb/>
And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,<lb/>
Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop<lb/>
Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,<lb/>
at their society, as their friendship, may<lb/>
merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,<lb/>
But nakedness, thou detestable town!<lb/>
Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!<lb/>
Timon will to the woods; where he shall find<lb/>
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.<lb/>
The gods confound&mdash;hear me, you good gods all&mdash;<lb/>
The Athenians both within and out that wall!<lb/>
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow<lb/>
To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.<lb/>

<p><stage>Athens. A room in Timon's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>Hear you, master steward, where's our master?<lb/>
Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?<lb/>
Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,<lb/>
I am as poor as you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>Such a house broke!<lb/>
So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not<lb/>
One friend to take his fortune by the arm,<lb/>
And go along with him!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Servant</speaker>
<p>As we do turn our backs<lb/>
From our companion thrown into his grave,<lb/>
So his familiars to his buried fortunes<lb/>
Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,<lb/>
Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,<lb/>
A dedicated beggar to the air,<lb/>
With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,<lb/>
Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter other Servants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>All broken implements of a ruin'd house.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Servant</speaker>
<p>Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;<lb/>
That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,<lb/>
Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,<lb/>
And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,<lb/>
Hearing the surges threat: we must all part<lb/>
Into this sea of air.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Good fellows all,<lb/>
The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.<lb/>
Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,<lb/>
Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,<lb/>
As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,<lb/>
'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;<lb/>
Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:<lb/>
Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Servants embrace, and part several ways</stage></p>


<p>
O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!<lb/>
Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,<lb/>
Since riches point to misery and contempt?<lb/>
Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live<lb/>
But in a dream of friendship?<lb/>
To have his pomp and all what state compounds<lb/>
But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?<lb/>
Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,<lb/>
Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,<lb/>
When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!<lb/>
Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?<lb/>
For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.<lb/>
My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,<lb/>
Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes<lb/>
Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!<lb/>
He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat<lb/>
Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to<lb/>
Supply his life, or that which can command it.<lb/>
I'll follow and inquire him out:<lb/>
I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;<lb/>
Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.<lb/>

<p><stage>Woods and cave, near the seashore.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter TIMON, from the cave</stage></p>


<p>
O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth<lb/>
Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb<lb/>
Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,<lb/>
Whose procreation, residence, and birth,<lb/>
Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;<lb/>
The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,<lb/>
To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,<lb/>
But by contempt of nature.<lb/>
Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;<lb/>
The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,<lb/>
The beggar native honour.<lb/>
It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,<lb/>
The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,<lb/>
In purity of manhood stand upright,<lb/>
And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,<lb/>
So are they all; for every grise of fortune<lb/>
Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate<lb/>
Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;<lb/>
There's nothing level in our cursed natures,<lb/>
But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd<lb/>
All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!<lb/>
His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:<lb/>
Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Digging</stage></p>


<p>
Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate<lb/>
With thy most operant poison! What is here?<lb/>
Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,<lb/>
I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!<lb/>
Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,<lb/>
Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.<lb/>
Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this<lb/>
Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,<lb/>
Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:<lb/>
This yellow slave<lb/>
Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,<lb/>
Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves<lb/>
And give them title, knee and approbation<lb/>
With senators on the bench: this is it<lb/>
That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;<lb/>
She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores<lb/>
Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices<lb/>
To the April day again. Come, damned earth,<lb/>
Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds<lb/>
Among the route of nations, I will make thee<lb/>
Do thy right nature.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>March afar off</stage></p>


<p>
Ha! a drum? Thou'rt quick,<lb/>
But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,<lb/>
When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.<lb/>
Nay, stay thou out for earnest.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Keeping some gold</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in	warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>What art thou there? speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,<lb/>
For showing me again the eyes of man!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,<lb/>
That art thyself a man?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.<lb/>
For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,<lb/>
That I might love thee something.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>I know thee well;<lb/>
But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,<lb/>
I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;<lb/>
With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:<lb/>
Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;<lb/>
Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine<lb/>
Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,<lb/>
For all her cherubim look.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHRYNIA</speaker>
<p>Thy lips rot off!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns<lb/>
To thine own lips again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>How came the noble Timon to this change?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>As the moon does, by wanting light to give:<lb/>
But then renew I could not, like the moon;<lb/>
There were no suns to borrow of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Noble Timon,<lb/>
What friendship may I do thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>None, but to<lb/>
Maintain my opinion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>What is it, Timon?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou<lb/>
wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art<lb/>
a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for<lb/>
thou art a man!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>I see them now; then was a blessed time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMANDRA</speaker>
<p>Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world<lb/>
Voiced so regardfully?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Art thou Timandra?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMANDRA</speaker>
<p>Yes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;<lb/>
Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.<lb/>
Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves<lb/>
For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth<lb/>
To the tub-fast and the diet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMANDRA</speaker>
<p>Hang thee, monster!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits<lb/>
Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.<lb/>
I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,<lb/>
The want whereof doth daily make revolt<lb/>
In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,<lb/>
How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,<lb/>
Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,<lb/>
But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?<lb/>
I had rather be alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Why, fare thee well:<lb/>
Here is some gold for thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Keep it, I cannot eat it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Ay, Timon, and have cause.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>The gods confound them all in thy conquest;<lb/>
And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Why me, Timon?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>That, by killing of villains,<lb/>
Thou wast born to conquer my country.<lb/>
Put up thy gold: go on,&mdash;here's gold,&mdash;go on;<lb/>
Be as a planetary plague, when Jove<lb/>
Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison<lb/>
In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:<lb/>
Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;<lb/>
He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;<lb/>
It is her habit only that is honest,<lb/>
Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek<lb/>
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,<lb/>
That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,<lb/>
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,<lb/>
But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,<lb/>
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;<lb/>
Think it a bastard, whom the oracle<lb/>
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,<lb/>
And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;<lb/>
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;<lb/>
Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,<lb/>
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,<lb/>
Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:<lb/>
Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,<lb/>
Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou<lb/>
givest me,<lb/>
Not all thy counsel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse<lb/>
upon thee!<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHRYNIA, TIMANDRA</speaker>
<p>Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,<lb/>
And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,<lb/>
Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,<lb/>
Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear<lb/>
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues<lb/>
The immortal gods that hear you,&mdash;spare your oaths,<lb/>
I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;<lb/>
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,<lb/>
Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;<lb/>
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,<lb/>
And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,<lb/>
Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs<lb/>
With burthens of the dead;&mdash;some that were hang'd,<lb/>
No matter:&mdash;wear them, betray with them: whore still;<lb/>
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,<lb/>
A pox of wrinkles!<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHRYNIA, TIMANDRA</speaker>
<p>Well, more gold: what then?<lb/>
Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Consumptions sow<lb/>
In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,<lb/>
And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,<lb/>
That he may never more false title plead,<lb/>
Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,<lb/>
That scolds against the quality of flesh,<lb/>
And not believes himself: down with the nose,<lb/>
Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away<lb/>
Of him that, his particular to foresee,<lb/>
Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate<lb/>
ruffians bald;<lb/>
And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war<lb/>
Derive some pain from you: plague all;<lb/>
That your activity may defeat and quell<lb/>
The source of all erection. There's more gold:<lb/>
Do you damn others, and let this damn you,<lb/>
And ditches grave you all!<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHRYNIA, TIMANDRA</speaker>
<p>More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:<lb/>
If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>I never did thee harm.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Yes, thou spokest well of me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Call'st thou that harm?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,<lb/>
Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Digging</stage></p>


<p>
Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,<lb/>
Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,<lb/>
Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,<lb/>
Engenders the black toad and adder blue,<lb/>
The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,<lb/>
With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven<lb/>
Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;<lb/>
Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,<lb/>
From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!<lb/>
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,<lb/>
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!<lb/>
Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;<lb/>
Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face<lb/>
Hath to the marbled mansion all above<lb/>
Never presented!&mdash;O, a root,&mdash;dear thanks!&mdash;<lb/>
Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;<lb/>
Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts<lb/>
And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,<lb/>
That from it all consideration slips!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter APEMANTUS</stage></p>


<p>
More man? plague, plague!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>I was directed hither: men report<lb/>
Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,<lb/>
Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>This is in thee a nature but infected;<lb/>
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung<lb/>
From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?<lb/>
This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?<lb/>
Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;<lb/>
Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot<lb/>
That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,<lb/>
By putting on the cunning of a carper.<lb/>
Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive<lb/>
By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,<lb/>
And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,<lb/>
Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,<lb/>
And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;<lb/>
Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome<lb/>
To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just<lb/>
That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,<lb/>
Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;<lb/>
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st<lb/>
That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,<lb/>
Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,<lb/>
That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,<lb/>
And skip where thou point'st out? will the<lb/>
cold brook,<lb/>
Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,<lb/>
To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures<lb/>
Whose naked natures live in an the spite<lb/>
Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,<lb/>
To the conflicting elements exposed,<lb/>
Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;<lb/>
O, thou shalt find&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>A fool of thee: depart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>I love thee better now than e'er I did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I hate thee worse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Why?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Thou flatter'st misery.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Why dost thou seek me out?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>To vex thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Always a villain's office or a fool's.<lb/>
Dost please thyself in't?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Ay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>What! a knave too?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on<lb/>
To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou<lb/>
Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,<lb/>
Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery<lb/>
Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:<lb/>
The one is filling still, never complete;<lb/>
The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,<lb/>
Hath a distracted and most wretched being,<lb/>
Worse than the worst, content.<lb/>
Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Not by his breath that is more miserable.<lb/>
Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm<lb/>
With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.<lb/>
Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded<lb/>
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords<lb/>
To such as may the passive drugs of it<lb/>
Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself<lb/>
In general riot; melted down thy youth<lb/>
In different beds of lust; and never learn'd<lb/>
The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd<lb/>
The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,<lb/>
Who had the world as my confectionary,<lb/>
The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men<lb/>
At duty, more than I could frame employment,<lb/>
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves<lb/>
Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush<lb/>
Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare<lb/>
For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,<lb/>
That never knew but better, is some burden:<lb/>
Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time<lb/>
Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?<lb/>
They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?<lb/>
If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,<lb/>
Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff<lb/>
To some she beggar and compounded thee<lb/>
Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!<lb/>
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,<lb/>
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Art thou proud yet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Ay, that I am not thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>I, that I was<lb/>
No prodigal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I, that I am one now:<lb/>
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,<lb/>
I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.<lb/>
That the whole life of Athens were in this!<lb/>
Thus would I eat it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Eating a root</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Here; I will mend thy feast.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Offering him a root</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>First mend my company, take away thyself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;<lb/>
if not, I would it were.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>What wouldst thou have to Athens?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,<lb/>
Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Here is no use for gold.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>The best and truest;<lb/>
For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Where liest o' nights, Timon?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Under that's above me.<lb/>
Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat<lb/>
it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Where wouldst thou send it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>To sauce thy dishes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the<lb/>
extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt<lb/>
and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much<lb/>
curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art<lb/>
despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for<lb/>
thee, eat it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>On what I hate I feed not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Dost hate a medlar?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Ay, though it look like thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst<lb/>
have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou<lb/>
ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou<lb/>
ever know beloved?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Myself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a<lb/>
dog.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>What things in the world canst thou nearest compare<lb/>
to thy flatterers?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Women nearest; but men, men are the things<lb/>
themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,<lb/>
Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of<lb/>
men, and remain a beast with the beasts?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, Timon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'<lb/>
attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would<lb/>
beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would<lb/>
eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would<lb/>
suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by<lb/>
the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would<lb/>
torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a<lb/>
breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy<lb/>
greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst<lb/>
hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the<lb/>
unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and<lb/>
make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert<lb/>
thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:<lb/>
wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the<lb/>
leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to<lb/>
the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on<lb/>
thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy<lb/>
defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that<lb/>
were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art<lb/>
thou already, that seest not thy loss in<lb/>
transformation!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou<lb/>
mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of<lb/>
Athens is become a forest of beasts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of<lb/>
company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it<lb/>
and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll<lb/>
see thee again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be<lb/>
welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>All villains that do stand by thee are pure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>If I name thee.<lb/>
I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>I would my tongue could rot them off!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!<lb/>
Choler does kill me that thou art alive;<lb/>
I swound to see thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Would thou wouldst burst!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Away,<lb/>
Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose<lb/>
A stone by thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Rogue, rogue, rogue!<lb/>
I am sick of this false world, and will love nought<lb/>
But even the mere necessities upon 't.<lb/>
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;<lb/>
Lie where the light foam the sea may beat<lb/>
Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,<lb/>
That death in me at others' lives may laugh.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To the gold</stage></p>


<p>
O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce<lb/>
'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler<lb/>
Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!<lb/>
Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,<lb/>
Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow<lb/>
That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,<lb/>
That solder'st close impossibilities,<lb/>
And makest them kiss! that speak'st with<lb/>
every tongue,<lb/>
To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!<lb/>
Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue<lb/>
Set them into confounding odds, that beasts<lb/>
May have the world in empire!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Would 'twere so!<lb/>
But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:<lb/>
Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>APEMANTUS</speaker>
<p>Ay.<lb/>

I am quit.<lb/>
Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Banditti</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Bandit</speaker>
<p>Where should he have this gold? It is some poor<lb/>
fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the<lb/>
mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his<lb/>
friends, drove him into this melancholy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Bandit</speaker>
<p>It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Bandit</speaker>
<p>Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not<lb/>
for't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously<lb/>
reserve it, how shall's get it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Bandit</speaker>
<p>True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Bandit</speaker>
<p>Is not this he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Banditti</speaker>
<p>Where?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Bandit</speaker>
<p>'Tis his description.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Bandit</speaker>
<p>He; I know him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Banditti</speaker>
<p>Save thee, Timon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Now, thieves?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Banditti</speaker>
<p>Soldiers, not thieves.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Both too; and women's sons.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Banditti</speaker>
<p>We are not thieves, but men that much do want.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.<lb/>
Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;<lb/>
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;<lb/>
The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;<lb/>
The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush<lb/>
Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Bandit</speaker>
<p>We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,<lb/>
As beasts and birds and fishes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;<lb/>
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con<lb/>
That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not<lb/>
In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft<lb/>
In limited professions. Rascal thieves,<lb/>
Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,<lb/>
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,<lb/>
And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;<lb/>
His antidotes are poison, and he slays<lb/>
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;<lb/>
Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,<lb/>
Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.<lb/>
The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction<lb/>
Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,<lb/>
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:<lb/>
The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves<lb/>
The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,<lb/>
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen<lb/>
From general excrement: each thing's a thief:<lb/>
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power<lb/>
Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,<lb/>
Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:<lb/>
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,<lb/>
Break open shops; nothing can you steal,<lb/>
But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this<lb/>
I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Bandit</speaker>
<p>Has almost charmed me from my profession, by<lb/>
persuading me to it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Bandit</speaker>
<p>'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises<lb/>
us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Bandit</speaker>
<p>I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Bandit</speaker>
<p>Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time<lb/>
so miserable but a man may be true.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Banditti</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter FLAVIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>O you gods!<lb/>
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?<lb/>
Full of decay and failing? O monument<lb/>
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!<lb/>
What an alteration of honour<lb/>
Has desperate want made!<lb/>
What viler thing upon the earth than friends<lb/>
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!<lb/>
How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,<lb/>
When man was wish'd to love his enemies!<lb/>
Grant I may ever love, and rather woo<lb/>
Those that would mischief me than those that do!<lb/>
Has caught me in his eye: I will present<lb/>
My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,<lb/>
Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Away! what art thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Have you forgot me, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;<lb/>
Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>An honest poor servant of yours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Then I know thee not:<lb/>
I never had honest man about me, I; all<lb/>
I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>The gods are witness,<lb/>
Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief<lb/>
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I<lb/>
love thee,<lb/>
Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st<lb/>
Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give<lb/>
But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:<lb/>
Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>I beg of you to know me, good my lord,<lb/>
To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts<lb/>
To entertain me as your steward still.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Had I a steward<lb/>
So true, so just, and now so comfortable?<lb/>
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.<lb/>
Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man<lb/>
Was born of woman.<lb/>
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,<lb/>
You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim<lb/>
One honest man&mdash;mistake me not&mdash;but one;<lb/>
No more, I pray,&mdash;and he's a steward.<lb/>
How fain would I have hated all mankind!<lb/>
And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,<lb/>
I fell with curses.<lb/>
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;<lb/>
For, by oppressing and betraying me,<lb/>
Thou mightst have sooner got another service:<lb/>
For many so arrive at second masters,<lb/>
Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true&mdash;<lb/>
For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure&mdash;<lb/>
Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,<lb/>
If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,<lb/>
Expecting in return twenty for one?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>No, my most worthy master; in whose breast<lb/>
Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:<lb/>
You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:<lb/>
Suspect still comes where an estate is least.<lb/>
That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,<lb/>
Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,<lb/>
Care of your food and living; and, believe it,<lb/>
My most honour'd lord,<lb/>
For any benefit that points to me,<lb/>
Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange<lb/>
For this one wish, that you had power and wealth<lb/>
To requite me, by making rich yourself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,<lb/>
Here, take: the gods out of my misery<lb/>
Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;<lb/>
But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;<lb/>
Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,<lb/>
But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,<lb/>
Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs<lb/>
What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,<lb/>
Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like<lb/>
blasted woods,<lb/>
And may diseases lick up their false bloods!<lb/>
And so farewell and thrive.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>O, let me stay,<lb/>
And comfort you, my master.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>If thou hatest curses,<lb/>
Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:<lb/>
Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens<lb/>
again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore<lb/>
'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this<lb/>
supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in<lb/>
us; and is very likely to load our purposes with<lb/>
what they travail for, if it be a just true report<lb/>
that goes of his having.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>What have you now to present unto him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will<lb/>
promise him an excellent piece.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent<lb/>
that's coming toward him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the<lb/>
time: it opens the eyes of expectation:<lb/>
performance is ever the duller for his act; and,<lb/>
but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the<lb/>
deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is<lb/>
most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind<lb/>
of will or testament which argues a great sickness<lb/>
in his judgment that makes it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>TIMON comes from his cave, behind</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a<lb/>
man so bad as is thyself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for<lb/>
him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire<lb/>
against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery<lb/>
of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Must thou needs stand for a villain in<lb/>
thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in<lb/>
other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Nay, let's seek him:<lb/>
Then do we sin against our own estate,<lb/>
When we may profit meet, and come too late.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>True;<lb/>
When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,<lb/>
Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I'll meet you at the turn. What a<lb/>
god's gold,<lb/>
That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple<lb/>
Than where swine feed!<lb/>
'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,<lb/>
Settlest admired reverence in a slave:<lb/>
To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye<lb/>
Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!<lb/>
Fit I meet them.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Coming forward</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Hail, worthy Timon!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>Our late noble master!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Have I once lived to see two honest men?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
Having often of your open bounty tasted,<lb/>
Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,<lb/>
Whose thankless natures&mdash;O abhorred spirits!&mdash;<lb/>
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:<lb/>
What! to you,<lb/>
Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence<lb/>
To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover<lb/>
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude<lb/>
With any size of words.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Let it go naked, men may see't the better:<lb/>
You that are honest, by being what you are,<lb/>
Make them best seen and known.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>He and myself<lb/>
Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,<lb/>
And sweetly felt it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Ay, you are honest men.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>We are hither come to offer you our service.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?<lb/>
Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;<lb/>
I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore<lb/>
Came not my friend nor I.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit<lb/>
Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;<lb/>
Thou counterfeit'st most lively.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>So, so, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,<lb/>
Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth<lb/>
That thou art even natural in thine art.<lb/>
But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,<lb/>
I must needs say you have a little fault:<lb/>
Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I<lb/>
You take much pains to mend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>Beseech your honour<lb/>
To make it known to us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You'll take it ill.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>Most thankfully, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Will you, indeed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>Doubt it not, worthy lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,<lb/>
That mightily deceives you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>Do we, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,<lb/>
Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,<lb/>
Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured<lb/>
That he's a made-up villain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Painter</speaker>
<p>I know none such, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>Nor I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,<lb/>
Rid me these villains from your companies:<lb/>
Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,<lb/>
Confound them by some course, and come to me,<lb/>
I'll give you gold enough.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>Name them, my lord, let's know them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You that way and you this, but two in company;<lb/>
Each man apart, all single and alone,<lb/>
Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.<lb/>
If where thou art two villains shall not be,<lb/>
Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside<lb/>
But where one villain is, then him abandon.<lb/>
Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To Painter</stage></p>


<p>
You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To Poet</stage></p>


<p>
You are an alchemist; make gold of that.<lb/>
Out, rascal dogs!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Beats them out, and then retires to his cave</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;<lb/>
For he is set so only to himself<lb/>
That nothing but himself which looks like man<lb/>
Is friendly with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Bring us to his cave:<lb/>
It is our part and promise to the Athenians<lb/>
To speak with Timon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>At all times alike<lb/>
Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs<lb/>
That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,<lb/>
Offering the fortunes of his former days,<lb/>
The former man may make him. Bring us to him,<lb/>
And chance it as it may.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Here is his cave.<lb/>
Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!<lb/>
Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,<lb/>
By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:<lb/>
Speak to them, noble Timon.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>TIMON comes from his cave</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and<lb/>
be hang'd:<lb/>
For each true word, a blister! and each false<lb/>
Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,<lb/>
Consuming it with speaking!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Worthy Timon,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I thank them; and would send them back the plague,<lb/>
Could I but catch it for them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>O, forget<lb/>
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.<lb/>
The senators with one consent of love<lb/>
Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought<lb/>
On special dignities, which vacant lie<lb/>
For thy best use and wearing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>They confess<lb/>
Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:<lb/>
Which now the public body, which doth seldom<lb/>
Play the recanter, feeling in itself<lb/>
A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal<lb/>
Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;<lb/>
And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,<lb/>
Together with a recompense more fruitful<lb/>
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;<lb/>
Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth<lb/>
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs<lb/>
And write in thee the figures of their love,<lb/>
Ever to read them thine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>You witch me in it;<lb/>
Surprise me to the very brink of tears:<lb/>
Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,<lb/>
And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Therefore, so please thee to return with us<lb/>
And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take<lb/>
The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,<lb/>
Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name<lb/>
Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back<lb/>
Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,<lb/>
Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up<lb/>
His country's peace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>And shakes his threatening sword<lb/>
Against the walls of Athens.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Therefore, Timon,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:<lb/>
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,<lb/>
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,<lb/>
That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,<lb/>
And take our goodly aged men by the beards,<lb/>
Giving our holy virgins to the stain<lb/>
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,<lb/>
Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,<lb/>
In pity of our aged and our youth,<lb/>
I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,<lb/>
And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,<lb/>
While you have throats to answer: for myself,<lb/>
There's not a whittle in the unruly camp<lb/>
But I do prize it at my love before<lb/>
The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you<lb/>
To the protection of the prosperous gods,<lb/>
As thieves to keepers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Stay not, all's in vain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Why, I was writing of my epitaph;<lb/>
it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness<lb/>
Of health and living now begins to mend,<lb/>
And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;<lb/>
Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,<lb/>
And last so long enough!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>We speak in vain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>But yet I love my country, and am not<lb/>
One that rejoices in the common wreck,<lb/>
As common bruit doth put it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>That's well spoke.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Commend me to my loving countrymen,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>These words become your lips as they pass<lb/>
thorough them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>And enter in our ears like great triumphers<lb/>
In their applauding gates.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Commend me to them,<lb/>
And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,<lb/>
Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,<lb/>
Their pangs of love, with other incident throes<lb/>
That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain<lb/>
In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:<lb/>
I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>I like this well; he will return again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>I have a tree, which grows here in my close,<lb/>
That mine own use invites me to cut down,<lb/>
And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,<lb/>
Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree<lb/>
From high to low throughout, that whoso please<lb/>
To stop affliction, let him take his haste,<lb/>
Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,<lb/>
And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TIMON</speaker>
<p>Come not to me again: but say to Athens,<lb/>
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion<lb/>
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;<lb/>
Who once a day with his embossed froth<lb/>
The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,<lb/>
And let my grave-stone be your oracle.<lb/>
Lips, let sour words go by and language end:<lb/>
What is amiss plague and infection mend!<lb/>
Graves only be men's works and death their gain!<lb/>
Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Retires to his cave</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>His discontents are unremoveably<lb/>
Coupled to nature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>Our hope in him is dead: let us return,<lb/>
And strain what other means is left unto us<lb/>
In our dear peril.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>It requires swift foot.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<p><stage>Before the walls of Athens.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter two Senators and a Messenger</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files<lb/>
As full as thy report?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>have spoke the least:<lb/>
Besides, his expedition promises<lb/>
Present approach.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;<lb/>
Whom, though in general part we were opposed,<lb/>
Yet our old love made a particular force,<lb/>
And made us speak like friends: this man was riding<lb/>
From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,<lb/>
With letters of entreaty, which imported<lb/>
His fellowship i' the cause against your city,<lb/>
In part for his sake moved.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Here come our brothers.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter the Senators from TIMON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Senator</speaker>
<p>No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.<lb/>
The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring<lb/>
Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:<lb/>
Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Soldier</speaker>
<p>By all description this should be the place.<lb/>
Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?<lb/>
Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:<lb/>
Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.<lb/>
Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb<lb/>
I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:<lb/>
Our captain hath in every figure skill,<lb/>
An aged interpreter, though young in days:<lb/>
Before proud Athens he's set down by this,<lb/>
Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.<lb/>

<p><stage>Before the walls of Athens.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Sound to this coward and lascivious town<lb/>
Our terrible approach.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A parley sounded</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter Senators on the walls</stage></p>


<p>
Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time<lb/>
With all licentious measure, making your wills<lb/>
The scope of justice; till now myself and such<lb/>
As slept within the shadow of your power<lb/>
Have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed<lb/>
Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,<lb/>
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong<lb/>
Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong<lb/>
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,<lb/>
And pursy insolence shall break his wind<lb/>
With fear and horrid flight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>Noble and young,<lb/>
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,<lb/>
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,<lb/>
We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,<lb/>
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves<lb/>
Above their quantity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>So did we woo<lb/>
Transformed Timon to our city's love<lb/>
By humble message and by promised means:<lb/>
We were not all unkind, nor all deserve<lb/>
The common stroke of war.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>These walls of ours<lb/>
Were not erected by their hands from whom<lb/>
You have received your griefs; nor are they such<lb/>
That these great towers, trophies and schools<lb/>
should fall<lb/>
For private faults in them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>Nor are they living<lb/>
Who were the motives that you first went out;<lb/>
Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess<lb/>
Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,<lb/>
Into our city with thy banners spread:<lb/>
By decimation, and a tithed death&mdash;<lb/>
If thy revenges hunger for that food<lb/>
Which nature loathes&mdash;take thou the destined tenth,<lb/>
And by the hazard of the spotted die<lb/>
Let die the spotted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator</speaker>
<p>All have not offended;<lb/>
For those that were, it is not square to take<lb/>
On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,<lb/>
Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,<lb/>
Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:<lb/>
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin<lb/>
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall<lb/>
With those that have offended: like a shepherd,<lb/>
Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,<lb/>
But kill not all together.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>What thou wilt,<lb/>
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile<lb/>
Than hew to't with thy sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Senator </speaker>
<p>Set but thy foot<lb/>
Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;<lb/>
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,<lb/>
To say thou'lt enter friendly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Senator</speaker>
<p>Throw thy glove,<lb/>
Or any token of thine honour else,<lb/>
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress<lb/>
And not as our confusion, all thy powers<lb/>
Shall make their harbour in our town, till we<lb/>
Have seal'd thy full desire.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Then there's my glove;<lb/>
Descend, and open your uncharged ports:<lb/>
Those enemies of Timon's and mine own<lb/>
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof<lb/>
Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears<lb/>
With my more noble meaning, not a man<lb/>
Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream<lb/>
Of regular justice in your city's bounds,<lb/>
But shall be render'd to your public laws<lb/>
At heaviest answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>'Tis most nobly spoken.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p>Descend, and keep your words.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>The Senators descend, and open the gates</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter Soldier</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soldier</speaker>
<p>My noble general, Timon is dead;<lb/>
Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;<lb/>
And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which<lb/>
With wax I brought away, whose soft impression<lb/>
Interprets for my poor ignorance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALCIBIADES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads the epitaph]</stage></p><p>  'Here lies a<lb/>
wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:<lb/>
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked<lb/>
caitiffs left!<lb/>
Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:<lb/>
Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay<lb/>
not here thy gait.'<lb/>
These well express in thee thy latter spirits:<lb/>
Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,<lb/>
Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our<lb/>
droplets which<lb/>
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit<lb/>
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye<lb/>
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead<lb/>
Is noble Timon: of whose memory<lb/>
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,<lb/>
And I will use the olive with my sword,<lb/>
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each<lb/>
Prescribe to other as each other's leech.<lb/>
Let our drums strike.<lb/>
