<head>TRIFLES</head>

<stage>SCENE: <hi rend="italic">The kitchen in the now abandoned farmhouse
of</hi> JOHN WRIGHT, <hi rend="italic">a gloomy kitchen, and left
without having been put in order   &mdash;   unwashed pans
under the sink, a loaf of bread outside the bread-box,
a dish-towel on the table   &mdash;   other signs of incompleted
work.  At the rear the outer door opens and the</hi>
SHERIFF <hi rend="italic">comes in followed by the</hi> COUNTY ATTORNEY
<hi rend="italic">and</hi> HALE.  <hi rend="italic">The</hi> SHERIFF <hi rend="italic">and</hi> HALE <hi rend="italic">are men in middle
life, the</hi> COUNTY ATTORNEY <hi rend="italic">is a young man; all are
much bundled up and go at once to the stove.  They
are followed by the two women   &mdash;   the</hi> SHERIFF'S <hi rend="italic">wife
first; she is a slight wiry woman, a thin nervous face.</hi>
MRS. HALE <hi rend="italic">is larger and would ordinarily be called
more comfortable looking, but she is disturbed now
and looks fearfully about as she enters.  The women
have come in slowly, and stand close together near the
door.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Rubbing his hands.</hi>]</stage>
This feels good.  Come up to the fire, ladies.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">After taking a step forward.</hi>]</stage>
I'm not   &mdash;   cold.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Unbuttoning his overcoat and stepping away from
the stove as if to mark the beginning of official business.</hi>]</stage>
Now, Mr. Hale, before we move things about,

<pb n="4"/>

you explain to Mr. Henderson just what you saw
when you came here yesterday morning.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>By the way, has anything been moved?  Are things
just as you left them yesterday?

</l></sp><sp><speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Looking about.</hi>]</stage>
It's just the same.  When it
dropped below zero last night I thought I'd better
send Frank out this morning to make a fire for us   &mdash;
no use getting pneumonia with a big case on, but I
told him not to touch anything except the stove   &mdash;
and you know Frank.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>Somebody should have been left here yesterday.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>

<l>Oh   &mdash;   yesterday.  When I had to send Frank to
Morris Center for that man who went crazy   &mdash;   I want
you to know I had my hands full yesterday.  I knew
you could get back from Omaha by today and as
long as I went over everything here myself   &mdash;


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>Well, Mr. Hale, tell just what happened when you
came here yesterday morning.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> HALE</speaker>

<l>Harry and I had started to town with a load of
potatoes.  We came along the road from my place
and as I got here I said, "I'm going to see if I can't

<pb n="5"/>

get John Wright to go in with me on a party telephone."
I spoke to Wright about it once before and he put
me off, saying folks talked too much anyway, and all
he asked was peace and quiet   &mdash;   I guess you know
about how much he talked himself; but I thought
maybe if I went to the house and talked about it before
his wife, though I said to Harry that I didn't know
as what his wife wanted made much difference to
John   &mdash;

</l></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>Let's talk about that later, Mr. Hale.  I do want
to talk about that, but tell now just what happened
when you got to the house.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> HALE</speaker>

<l>I didn't hear or see anything; I knocked at the
door, and still it was all quiet inside.  I knew they
must be up, it was past eight o'clock.  So I knocked
again, and I thought I heard somebody say, "Come in."
I wasn't sure, I'm not sure yet, but I opened the door
   &mdash;   this door <stage>[<hi rend="italic">indicating the door by which the two
women are still standing</hi>]</stage> and there in that rocker   &mdash;
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">pointing to it</hi>]</stage> sat Mrs. Wright.
</l></sp>
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">They all look at the rocker.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>What   &mdash;   was she doing?


</l></sp><sp><speaker> HALE</speaker>

<l>She was rockin' back and forth.  She had her apron
in her hand and was kind of   &mdash;   pleating it.

<pb n="6"/>

</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>And how did she   &mdash;   look?


</l></sp><sp><speaker> HALE</speaker>

<l>Well, she looked queer.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>How do you mean   &mdash;   queer?


</l></sp><sp><speaker> HALE</speaker>

<l>Well, as if she didn't know what she was going
to do next.  And kind of done up.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>How did she seem to feel about your coming?


</l></sp><sp><speaker> HALE</speaker>

<l>Why, I don't think she minded   &mdash;   one way or other.
She didn't pay much attention.  I said, "How do,
Mrs. Wright, it's cold, ain't it?"  And she said, "Is
it?"   &mdash;   and went on kind of pleating at her apron.
Well, I was surprised; she didn't ask me to come up
to the stove, or to set down, but just sat there, not even
looking at me, so I said, "I want to see John."  And
then she   &mdash;   laughed.  I guess you would call it a laugh.
I thought of Harry and the team outside, so I said
a little sharp: "Can't I see John?"  "No," she
says, kind o' dull like.  "Ain't he home?" says I.
"Yes," says she, "he's home."  "Then why can't I
see him?" I asked her, out of patience.  "'Cause
he's dead," says she.  <hi rend="italic">"Dead?"</hi> says I.  She just
nodded her head, not getting a bit excited, but rockin'
back and forth.  "Why   &mdash;   where is he?" says I, not

<pb n="7"/>

knowing what to say.  She just pointed upstairs   &mdash;
like that <stage>[<hi rend="italic">himself pointing to the room above</hi>]</stage>.  I
got up, with the idea of going up there.  I walked
from there to here   &mdash;   then I says, "Why, what did
he die of?"  "He died of a rope round his neck,"
says she, and just went on pleatin' at her apron.  Well,
I went out and called Harry.  I thought I might   &mdash;
need help.  We went upstairs and there he was lyin'   &mdash;


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>I think I'd rather have you go into that upstairs,
where you can point it all out.  Just go on now with
the rest of the story.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> HALE</speaker>

<l>Well, my first thought was to get that rope off.  It
looked . . . <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Stops, his face twitches</hi>]</stage> . . . but Harry,
he went up to him, and he said, "No, he's dead all
right, and we'd better not touch anything."  So we
went back down stairs.  She was still sitting that same
way.  "Has anybody been notified?" I asked.  "No,"
says she, unconcerned.  "Who did this, Mrs.
Wright?" said Harry.  He said it business-like   &mdash;
and she stopped pleatin' of her apron.  "I don't
know," she says.  "You don't <hi rend="italic">know?</hi>" says Harry.
"No," says she.  "Weren't you sleepin' in the bed
with him?" says Harry.  "Yes," says she, "but I
was on the inside."  "Somebody slipped a rope round
his neck and strangled him and you didn't wake up?"
says Harry.  "I didn't wake up," she said after him.
We must 'a looked as if we didn't see how that could
be, for after a minute she said, "I sleep sound."
Harry was going to ask her more questions but I said
maybe we ought to let her tell her story first to the

<pb n="8"/>

coroner, or the sheriff, so Harry went fast as he could
to Rivers' place, where there's a telephone.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>And what did Mrs. Wright do when she knew that
you had gone for the coroner?


</l></sp><sp><speaker> HALE</speaker>

<l>She moved from that chair to this one over here
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Pointing to a small chair in the corner</hi>]</stage> and just sat
there with her hands held together and looking down.
I got a feeling that I ought to make some conversation,
so I said I had come in to see if John wanted to put
in a telephone, and at that she started to laugh, and
then she stopped and looked at me   &mdash;   scared.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">The</hi>
COUNTY ATTORNEY, <hi rend="italic">who has had his notebook out,
makes a note.</hi>]</stage>  I dunno, maybe it wasn't scared.  I
wouldn't like to say it was.  Soon Harry got back, and
then Dr. Lloyd came, and you, Mr. Peters, and so I
guess that's all I know that you don't.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Looking around.</hi>]</stage>  I guess we'll go upstairs first
   &mdash;   and then out to the barn and around there.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">To
the</hi> SHERIFF.]</stage>  You're convinced that there was nothing
important here   &mdash;   nothing that would point to any
motive.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>

<l>Nothing here but kitchen things.</l></sp>
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">The</hi> COUNTY ATTORNEY, <hi rend="italic">after again
looking around the kitchen, opens
the door of a cupboard closet.  He
gets up on a chair and looks on a
shelf.  Pulls his hand away, sticky.</hi></stage>

<pb n="9"/>

<sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>Here's a nice mess.
</l></sp>
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">The women draw nearer.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">To the other woman.</hi>]</stage>  Oh, her fruit; it did freeze.
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">To the</hi> LAWYER.]</stage>  She worried about that when it
turned so cold.  She said the fire'd go out and her
jars would break.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>

<l>Well, can you beat the women!  Held for murder
and worryin' about her preserves.

</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>I guess before we're through she may have something more serious
than preserves to worry about.

</l></sp><sp><speaker> HALE</speaker>

<l>Well, women are used to worrying over trifles.</l></sp>

<stage>[<hi rend="italic">The two women move a little closer
together.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">With the gallantry of a young politician.</hi>]</stage>  And
yet, for all their worries, what would we do without
the ladies?  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">The women do not unbend.  He goes
to the sink, takes a dipperful of water from the pail
and pouring it into a basin, washes his hands.  Starts
to wipe them on the roller-towel, turns it for a cleaner
place.</hi>]</stage>  Dirty towels!  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Kicks his foot against the
pans under the sink.</hi>]</stage>  Not much of a housekeeper,
would you say, ladies?

<pb n="10"/>

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Stiffly.</hi>]</stage>  There's a great deal of work to be done
on a farm.

</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>To be sure.  And yet <stage>[<hi rend="italic">With a little bow to her</hi>]</stage> I
know there are some Dickson county farmhouses which
do not have such roller towels.</l></sp>

<stage>[<hi rend="italic">He gives it a pull to expose its full
length again.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Those towels get dirty awful quick.  Men's hands
aren't always as clean as they might be.

</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>Ah, loyal to your sex, I see.  But you and Mrs.
Wright were neighbors.  I suppose you were friends,
too.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Shaking her head.</hi>]</stage>  I've not seen much of her of
late years.  I've not been in this house   &mdash;   it's more
than a year.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>And why was that?  You didn't like her?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>I liked her well enough.  Farmers' wives have
their hands full, Mr. Henderson.  And then   &mdash;


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>Yes   &mdash;   ?

<pb n="11"/>

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Looking about.</hi>]</stage>  It never seemed a very cheerful
place.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>No   &mdash;   it's not cheerful.  I shouldn't say she had the
homemaking instinct.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Well, I don't know as Wright had, either.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>You mean that they didn't get on very well?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>No, I don't mean anything.  But I don't think a
place'd be any cheerfuller for John Wright's being
in it.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>I'd like to talk more of that a little later.  I want
to get the lay of things upstairs now.</l></sp>

<stage>[<hi rend="italic">He goes to the left, where three steps
lead to a stair door.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>SHERIFF</speaker>

<l>I suppose anything Mrs. Peters does'll be all right.
She was to take in some clothes for her, you know,
and a few little things.  We left in such a hurry
yesterday.


</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>Yes, but I would like to see what you take, Mrs.

<pb n="12"/>

Peters, and keep an eye out for anything that might
be of use to us.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Yes, Mr. Henderson.</l></sp>

<stage>[<hi rend="italic">The women listen to the men's steps
on the stairs, then look about the
kitchen.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>I'd hate to have men coming into my kitchen, snooping
around and criticising.</l></sp>

<stage>[<hi rend="italic">She arranges the pans under sink which
the</hi> LAWYER <hi rend="italic">had shoved out of place.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Of course it's no more than their duty.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Duty's all right, but I guess that deputy sheriff that
came out to make the fire might have got a little of
this on.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Gives the roller towel a pull.</hi>]</stage>  Wish I'd
thought of that sooner.  Seems mean to talk about
her for not having things slicked up when she had
to come away in such a hurry.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Who has gone to a small table in the left rear
corner of the room, and lifted one end of a towel
that covers a pan.</hi>]</stage>  She had bread set.
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Stands still.</hi></stage>

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Eyes fixed on a loaf of bread beside the bread-box,

<pb n="13"/>

which is on a low shelf at the other side of the
room.  Moves slowly toward it.</hi>]</stage>  She was going to
put this in there.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Picks up loaf, then abruptly drops
it.  In a manner of returning to familiar things.</hi>]</stage>  It's
a shame about her fruit.  I wonder if it's all gone.
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Gets up on the chair and looks.</hi>]</stage>  I think there's
some here that's all right, Mrs. Peters.  Yes   &mdash;   here;
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Holding it toward the window</hi>]</stage> this is cherries, too.
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Looking again.</hi>]</stage>  I declare I believe that's the only
one.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Gets down, bottle in her hand.  Goes to the
sink and wipes it off on the outside.</hi>]</stage>  She'll feel
awful bad after all her hard work in the hot weather.
I remember the afternoon I put up my cherries last
summer.</l></sp>

<stage>[<hi rend="italic">She puts the bottle on the big kitchen
table, center of the room.  With a
sigh, is about to sit down in the
rocking-chair.  Before she is seated
realizes what chair it is; with a slow
look at it, steps back.  The chair
which she has touched rocks back
and forth.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Well, I must get those things from the front room
closet.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">She goes to the door at the right, but after
looking into the other room, steps back.</hi>]</stage>  You coming
with me, Mrs. Hale?  You could help me carry
them.</l></sp>

<stage>[<hi rend="italic">They go in the other room; reappear,</hi>
MRS. PETERS <hi rend="italic">carrying a dress and
skirt,</hi> MRS. HALE <hi rend="italic">following with a
pair of shoes.</hi></stage>

<pb n="14"/>

<sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>My, it's cold in there.</l>
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">She puts the clothes on the big table,
and hurries to the stove.</hi></stage>


</sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Examining the skirt.</hi>]</stage>  Wright was close.  I think
maybe that's why she kept so much to herself.  She
didn't even belong to the Ladies Aid.  I suppose she
felt she couldn't do her part, and then you don't
enjoy things when you feel shabby.  She used to wear
pretty clothes and be lively, when she was Minnie
Foster, one of the town girls singing in the choir.
But that   &mdash;   oh, that was thirty years ago.  This all
you was to take in?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>She said she wanted an apron.  Funny thing to
want, for there isn't much to get you dirty in jail,
goodness knows.  But I suppose just to make her feel
more natural.  She said they was in the top drawer in
this cupboard.  Yes, here.  And then her little shawl
that always hung behind the door.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Opens stair door
and looks.</hi>]</stage>  Yes, here it is.
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Quickly shuts door leading upstairs.</hi></stage>


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Abruptly moving toward her.</hi>]</stage>  Mrs. Peters?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Yes, Mrs. Hale?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Do you think she did it?

<pb n="15"/>

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">In a frightened voice.</hi>]</stage>  Oh, I don't know.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Well, I don't think she did.  Asking for an apron
and her little shawl.  Worrying about her fruit.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Starts to speak, glances up, where footsteps are
heard in the room above.  In a low voice.</hi>]</stage>  Mr.
Peters says it looks bad for her.  Mr. Henderson is
awful sarcastic in a speech and he'll make fun of her
sayin' she didn't wake up.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Well, I guess John Wright didn't wake when they
was slipping that rope under his neck.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>No, it's strange.  It must have been done awful
crafty and still.  They say it was such a   &mdash;   funny way
to kill a man, rigging it all up like that.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>That's just what Mr. Hale said.  There was a gun
in the house.  He says that's what he can't understand.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Mr. Henderson said coming out that what was
needed for the case was a motive; something to show
anger, or   &mdash;   sudden feeling.

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Who is standing by the table.</hi>]</stage>  Well, I don't see
any signs of anger around here.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">She puts her hand

how they are finding things upstairs.  I hope she had
it a little more red-up up there.  You know, it seems
kind of <hi rend="italic">sneaking</hi>.  Locking her up in town and then
coming out here and trying to get her own house to
turn against her!

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>But Mrs. Hale, the law is the law.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>I s'pose 'tis.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Unbuttoning her coat.</hi>]</stage>  Better

them when you go out.</l></sp>

<stage>[MRS. PETERS <hi rend="italic">takes off her fur tippet,

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Rubbing his hands over the stove.</hi>]</stage>  Frank's fire

<sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Resentfully.</hi>]</stage>  I don't know as there's anything so
strange, our takin' up our time with little things while
we're waiting for them to get the evidence.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">She sits
down at the big table smoothing out a block with decision.</hi>]
</stage>  I don't see as it's anything to laugh about.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Apologetically.</hi>]</stage>  Of course they've got awful

<pb n="18"/>

<sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Examining another block.</hi>]</stage>  Mrs. Peters, look at
this one.  Here, this is the one she was working on,
and look at the sewing!  All the rest of it has been
so nice and even.  And look at this!  It's all over
the place!  Why, it looks as if she didn't know what
she was about!</l></sp>

<stage>[<hi rend="italic">After she has said this they look at

<sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Oh, what are you doing, Mrs. Hale?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Mildly.</hi>]</stage>  Just pulling out a stitch or two that's
not sewed very good.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Threading a needle.</hi>]</stage>  Bad
sewing always made me fidgety.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Nervously.</hi>]</stage>  I don't think we ought to touch
things.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Yes, Mrs. Hale?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>What do you suppose she was so nervous about?

<pb n="19"/>

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Oh   &mdash;   I don't know.  I don't know as she was
nervous.  I sometimes sew awful queer when I'm just
tired.  <stage>[MRS. HALE <hi rend="italic">starts to say something, looks at</hi>
MRS. PETERS, <hi rend="italic">then goes on sewing.</hi>]</stage>  Well I must get
these things wrapped up.  They may be through
sooner than we think.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Putting apron and other
things together.</hi>]</stage>  I wonder where I can find a piece
of paper, and string.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>In that cupboard, maybe.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Looking in cupboard.</hi>]</stage>  Why, here's a bird-cage.
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Holds it up.</hi></stage>  Did she have a bird, Mrs. Hale?

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Why, I don't know whether she did or not   &mdash;   I've
not been here for so long.  There was a man around
last year selling canaries cheap, but I don't know as
she took one; maybe she did.  She used to sing real
pretty herself.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Glancing around.</hi>]</stage>  Seems funny to think of a bird
here.  But she must have had one, or why would
she have a cage?  I wonder what happened to it.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>I s'pose maybe the cat got it.

<pb n="20"/>

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>No, she didn't have a cat.  She's got that feeling
some people have about cats   &mdash;   being afraid of them.
My cat got in her room and she was real upset and
asked me to take it out.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>My sister Bessie was like that.  Queer, ain't it?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Examining the cage.</hi>]</stage>  Why, look at this door.
It's broke.  One hinge is pulled apart.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Looking too.</hi>]</stage>  Looks as if someone must have
been rough with it.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Why, yes.
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">She brings the cage forward and puts
it on the table.</hi></stage>


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>I wish if they're going to find any evidence they'd
be about it.  I don't like this place.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>But I'm awful glad you came with me, Mrs. Hale.
It would be lonesome for me sitting here alone.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>It would, wouldn't it?  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Dropping her sewing.</hi>]</stage>
But I tell you what I do wish, Mrs. Peters.  I wish

<pb n="21"/>

I had come over sometimes when <hi rend="italic">she</hi> was here.  I   &mdash;
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Looking around the room</hi>]</stage>   &mdash;   wish I had.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>But of course you were awful busy, Mrs. Hale   &mdash;
your house and your children.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>I could've come.  I stayed away because it weren't
cheerful   &mdash;   and that's why I ought to have come.  I   &mdash;
I've never liked this place.  Maybe because it's down
in a hollow and you don't see the road.  I dunno
what it is, but it's a lonesome place and always was.
I wish I had come over to see Minnie Foster sometimes.
I can see now   &mdash;
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Shakes her head.</hi></stage>

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Well, you mustn't reproach yourself, Mrs. Hale.
Somehow we just don't see how it is with other folks
until   &mdash;   something comes up.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Not having children makes less work   &mdash;   but it makes
a quiet house, and Wright out to work all day, and no
company when he did come in.  Did you know John
Wright, Mrs. Peters?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Not to know him; I've seen him in town.  They
say he was a good man.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Yes   &mdash;   good; he didn't drink, and kept his word as


<pb n="22"/>

well as most, I guess, and paid his debts.  But he
was a hard man, Mrs. Peters.  Just to pass the time
of day with him   &mdash;     <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Shivers.</hi>]</stage>  Like a raw wind that
gets to the bone.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Pauses, her eye falling on the
cage.</hi>]</stage>  I should think she would 'a wanted a bird.
But what do you suppose went with it?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>I don't know, unless it got sick and died.</l></sp>

<stage>[<hi rend="italic">She reaches over and swings the broken
door, swings it again, both women
watch it.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>You weren't raised round here, were you?  <stage>[MRS.
PETERS <hi rend="italic">shakes her head.</hi>]</stage>  You didn't know   &mdash;   her?


</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Not till they brought her yesterday.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>She   &mdash;   come to think of it, she was kind of like a
bird herself   &mdash;   real sweet and pretty, but kind of timid
and   &mdash;   fluttery.  How   &mdash;   she   &mdash;   did   &mdash;   change.
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">Silence; then as if struck by a happy thought and
relieved to get back to every day things.</hi>]</stage>  Tell you
what, Mrs. Peters, why don't you take the quilt in
with you?  It might take up her mind.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Why, I think that's a real nice idea, Mrs. Hale.
There couldn't possibly be any objection to it, could


<pb n="23"/>

there?  Now, just what would I take?  I wonder if
her patches are in here   &mdash;   and her things.
</l></sp>
<stage>[<hi rend="italic">They look in the sewing basket.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>Here's some red.  I expect this has got sewing
things in it.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Brings out a fancy box.</hi>]</stage>  What a
pretty box.  Looks like something somebody would
give you.  Maybe her scissors are in here.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Opens
box.  Suddenly puts her hand to her nose.</hi>]</stage>  Why   &mdash;
<stage>[MRS. PETERS <hi rend="italic">bends nearer, then turns her face away.</hi>]</stage>
There's something wrapped up in this piece of silk.

</l></sp><sp><speaker>   MRS. PETERS</speaker>

<l>Why, this isn't her scissors.


</l></sp><sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l><stage>[<hi rend="italic">Lifting the silk.</hi>]</stage>  Oh, Mrs. Peters   &mdash;   its   &mdash;

</l></sp><sp><speaker> COUNTY ATTORNEY</speaker>

<l>Well, that's interesting, I'm sure.  <stage>[<hi rend="italic">Seeing the

not help saying it.</hi></stage>

<sp><speaker>    MRS. HALE</speaker>

<l>She liked the bird.  She was going to bury it in

<l>No, Peters, it's all perfectly clear except a reason
for doing it.  But you know juries when it comes to
women.  If there was some definite thing.  Something
