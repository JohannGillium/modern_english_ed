<head>Scene 1</head><p><stage>Rome. Before the Capitol.</stage>

</p><p><stage>The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes and
Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side, SATURNINUS and his Followers;
and, from the other side, BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and
colours</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Noble patricians, patrons of my right,<lb/>
Defend the justice of my cause with arms,<lb/>
And, countrymen, my loving followers,<lb/>
Plead my successive title with your swords:<lb/>
I am his first-born son, that was the last<lb/>
That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;<lb/>
Then let my father's honours live in me,<lb/>
Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,<lb/>
If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,<lb/>
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,<lb/>
Keep then this passage to the Capitol<lb/>
And suffer not dishonour to approach<lb/>
The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,<lb/>
To justice, continence and nobility;<lb/>
But let desert in pure election shine,<lb/>
And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Princes, that strive by factions and by friends<lb/>
Ambitiously for rule and empery,<lb/>
Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand<lb/>
A special party, have, by common voice,<lb/>
In election for the Roman empery,<lb/>
Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius<lb/>
For many good and great deserts to Rome:<lb/>
A nobler man, a braver warrior,<lb/>
Lives not this day within the city walls:<lb/>
He by the senate is accit'd home<lb/>
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;<lb/>
That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,<lb/>
Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.<lb/>
Ten years are spent since first he undertook<lb/>
This cause of Rome and chastised with arms<lb/>
Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd<lb/>
Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons<lb/>
In coffins from the field;<lb/>
And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,<lb/>
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,<lb/>
Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.<lb/>
Let us entreat, by honour of his name,<lb/>
Whom worthily you would have now succeed.<lb/>
And in the Capitol and senate's right,<lb/>
Whom you pretend to honour and adore,<lb/>
That you withdraw you and abate your strength;<lb/>
Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,<lb/>
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally<lb/>
In thy uprightness and integrity,<lb/>
And so I love and honour thee and thine,<lb/>
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,<lb/>
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,<lb/>
Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,<lb/>
That I will here dismiss my loving friends,<lb/>
And to my fortunes and the people's favor<lb/>
Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,<lb/>
I thank you all and here dismiss you all,<lb/>
And to the love and favor of my country<lb/>
Commit myself, my person and the cause.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS</stage></p>


<p>
Rome, be as just and gracious unto me<lb/>
As I am confident and kind to thee.<lb/>
Open the gates, and let me in.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter a Captain</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Captain</speaker>
<p>Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.<lb/>
Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,<lb/>
Successful in the battles that he fights,<lb/>
With honour and with fortune is return'd<lb/>
From where he circumscribed with his sword,<lb/>
And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and	MUTIUS; After them, two Men bearing a coffin	covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After	them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with	ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,	p



risoners; Soldiers and people following. The	Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!<lb/>
Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,<lb/>
Returns with precious jading to the bay<lb/>
From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,<lb/>
Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,<lb/>
To re-salute his country with his tears,<lb/>
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.<lb/>
Thou great defender of this Capitol,<lb/>
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!<lb/>
Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,<lb/>
Half of the number that King Priam had,<lb/>
Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!<lb/>
These that survive let Rome reward with love;<lb/>
These that I bring unto their latest home,<lb/>
With burial amongst their ancestors:<lb/>
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.<lb/>
Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,<lb/>
Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,<lb/>
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?<lb/>
Make way to lay them by their brethren.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The tomb is opened</stage></p>


<p>
There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,<lb/>
And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!<lb/>
O sacred receptacle of my joys,<lb/>
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,<lb/>
How many sons of mine hast thou in store,<lb/>
That thou wilt never render to me more!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,<lb/>
That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile<lb/>
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,<lb/>
Before this earthy prison of their bones;<lb/>
That so the shadows be not unappeased,<lb/>
Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>I give him you, the noblest that survives,<lb/>
The eldest son of this distressed queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,<lb/>
Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,<lb/>
A mother's tears in passion for her son:<lb/>
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,<lb/>
O, think my son to be as dear to me!<lb/>
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,<lb/>
To beautify thy triumphs and return,<lb/>
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,<lb/>
But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,<lb/>
For valiant doings in their country's cause?<lb/>
O, if to fight for king and commonweal<lb/>
Were piety in thine, it is in these.<lb/>
Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:<lb/>
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?<lb/>
Draw near them then in being merciful:<lb/>
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:<lb/>
Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.<lb/>
These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld<lb/>
Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain<lb/>
Religiously they ask a sacrifice:<lb/>
To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,<lb/>
To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Away with him! and make a fire straight;<lb/>
And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,<lb/>
Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>O cruel, irreligious piety!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.<lb/>
Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive<lb/>
To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.<lb/>
Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal<lb/>
The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy<lb/>
With opportunity of sharp revenge<lb/>
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,<lb/>
May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths&mdash;<lb/>
When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen&mdash;<lb/>
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with	their swords bloody</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>See, lord and father, how we have perform'd<lb/>
Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,<lb/>
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,<lb/>
Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.<lb/>
Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,<lb/>
And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Let it be so; and let Andronicus<lb/>
Make this his latest farewell to their souls.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb</stage></p>


<p>
In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;<lb/>
Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,<lb/>
Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!<lb/>
Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,<lb/>
Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,<lb/>
No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:<lb/>
In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LAVINIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;<lb/>
My noble lord and father, live in fame!<lb/>
Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears<lb/>
I render, for my brethren's obsequies;<lb/>
And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,<lb/>
Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:<lb/>
O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,<lb/>
Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved<lb/>
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!<lb/>
Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,<lb/>
And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes;	re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS, attended</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,<lb/>
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,<lb/>
You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!<lb/>
Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,<lb/>
That in your country's service drew your swords:<lb/>
But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,<lb/>
That hath aspired to Solon's happiness<lb/>
And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.<lb/>
Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,<lb/>
Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,<lb/>
Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,<lb/>
This palliament of white and spotless hue;<lb/>
And name thee in election for the empire,<lb/>
With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:<lb/>
Be candidatus then, and put it on,<lb/>
And help to set a head on headless Rome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>A better head her glorious body fits<lb/>
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:<lb/>
What should I don this robe, and trouble you?<lb/>
Be chosen with proclamations to-day,<lb/>
To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,<lb/>
And set abroad new business for you all?<lb/>
Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,<lb/>
And led my country's strength successfully,<lb/>
And buried one and twenty valiant sons,<lb/>
Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,<lb/>
In right and service of their noble country<lb/>
Give me a staff of honour for mine age,<lb/>
But not a sceptre to control the world:<lb/>
Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Patience, Prince Saturninus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Romans, do me right:<lb/>
Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not<lb/>
Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.<lb/>
Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,<lb/>
Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good<lb/>
That noble-minded Titus means to thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee<lb/>
The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,<lb/>
But honour thee, and will do till I die:<lb/>
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,<lb/>
I will most thankful be; and thanks to men<lb/>
Of noble minds is honourable meed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,<lb/>
I ask your voices and your suffrages:<lb/>
Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tribunes</speaker>
<p>To gratify the good Andronicus,<lb/>
And gratulate his safe return to Rome,<lb/>
The people will accept whom he admits.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,<lb/>
That you create your emperor's eldest son,<lb/>
Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,<lb/>
Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,<lb/>
And ripen justice in this commonweal:<lb/>
Then, if you will elect by my advice,<lb/>
Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>With voices and applause of every sort,<lb/>
Patricians and plebeians, we create<lb/>
Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,<lb/>
And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A long flourish till they come down</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done<lb/>
To us in our election this day,<lb/>
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,<lb/>
And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:<lb/>
And, for an onset, Titus, to advance<lb/>
Thy name and honourable family,<lb/>
Lavinia will I make my empress,<lb/>
Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,<lb/>
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:<lb/>
Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match<lb/>
I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:<lb/>
And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,<lb/>
King and commander of our commonweal,<lb/>
The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate<lb/>
My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;<lb/>
Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:<lb/>
Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,<lb/>
Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!<lb/>
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts<lb/>
Rome shall record, and when I do forget<lb/>
The least of these unspeakable deserts,<lb/>
Romans, forget your fealty to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[To TAMORA]</stage></p><p>  Now, madam, are you prisoner to<lb/>
an emperor;<lb/>
To him that, for your honour and your state,<lb/>
Will use you nobly and your followers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue<lb/>
That I would choose, were I to choose anew.<lb/>
Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:<lb/>
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,<lb/>
Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:<lb/>
Princely shall be thy usage every way.<lb/>
Rest on my word, and let not discontent<lb/>
Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you<lb/>
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.<lb/>
Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>Not I, my lord; sith true nobility<lb/>
Warrants these words in princely courtesy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;<lb/>
Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:<lb/>
Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show</stage>

<p>Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal<lb/>
To do myself this reason and this right.<lb/>

<p>'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:<lb/>
This prince in justice seizeth but his own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?<lb/>
Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Surprised! by whom?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>By him that justly may<lb/>
Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter LUCIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,<lb/>
In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;<lb/>
My sons would never so dishonour me:<lb/>
Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,<lb/>
That is another's lawful promised love.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,<lb/>
Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:<lb/>
I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;<lb/>
Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,<lb/>
Confederates all thus to dishonour me.<lb/>
Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,<lb/>
But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,<lb/>
Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,<lb/>
That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece<lb/>
To him that flourish'd for her with his sword<lb/>
A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;<lb/>
One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,<lb/>
To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>These words are razors to my wounded heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,<lb/>
That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs<lb/>
Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,<lb/>
If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,<lb/>
Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,<lb/>
And will create thee empress of Rome,<lb/>
Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?<lb/>
And here I swear by all the Roman gods,<lb/>
Sith priest and holy water are so near<lb/>
And tapers burn so bright and every thing<lb/>
In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,<lb/>
I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,<lb/>
Or climb my palace, till from forth this place<lb/>
I lead espoused my bride along with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,<lb/>
If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,<lb/>
She will a handmaid be to his desires,<lb/>
A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany<lb/>
Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,<lb/>
Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,<lb/>
Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:<lb/>
There shall we consummate our spousal rites.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but TITUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>I am not bid to wait upon this bride.<lb/>
Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,<lb/>
Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!<lb/>
In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,<lb/>
Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed<lb/>
That hath dishonour'd all our family;<lb/>
Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>But let us give him burial, as becomes;<lb/>
Give Mutius burial with our brethren.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:<lb/>
This monument five hundred years hath stood,<lb/>
Which I have sumptuously re-edified:<lb/>
Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors<lb/>
Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:<lb/>
Bury him where you can; he comes not here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, this is impiety in you:<lb/>
My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him<lb/>
He must be buried with his brethren.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS, MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>And shall, or him we will accompany.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>'And shall!' what villain was it that spake<lb/>
that word?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>He that would vouch it in any place but here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>What, would you bury him in my despite?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee<lb/>
To pardon Mutius and to bury him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,<lb/>
And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:<lb/>
My foes I do repute you every one;<lb/>
So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>He is not with himself; let us withdraw.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>Father, and in that name doth nature speak,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Dear father, soul and substance of us all,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter<lb/>
His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,<lb/>
That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.<lb/>
Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:<lb/>
The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax<lb/>
That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son<lb/>
Did graciously plead for his funerals:<lb/>
Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy<lb/>
Be barr'd his entrance here.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Rise, Marcus, rise.<lb/>
The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,<lb/>
To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!<lb/>
Well, bury him, and bury me the next.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>MUTIUS is put into the tomb</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,<lb/>
Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p><stage>[Kneeling]</stage></p><p>  No man shed tears for noble Mutius;<lb/>
He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,<lb/>
How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths<lb/>
Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,<lb/>
Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:<lb/>
Is she not then beholding to the man<lb/>
That brought her for this high good turn so far?<lb/>
Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish. Re-enter, from one side, SATURNINUS attended,
TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON; from the other, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA,

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:<lb/>
God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,<lb/>
Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,<lb/>
Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,<lb/>
My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?<lb/>
But let the laws of Rome determine all;<lb/>
Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;<lb/>
But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, what I have done, as best I may,<lb/>
Answer I must and shall do with my life.<lb/>
Only thus much I give your grace to know:<lb/>
By all the duties that I owe to Rome,<lb/>
This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,<lb/>
Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;<lb/>
That in the rescue of Lavinia<lb/>
With his own hand did slay his youngest son,<lb/>
In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath<lb/>
To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:<lb/>
Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,<lb/>
That hath express'd himself in all his deeds<lb/>
A father and a friend to thee and Rome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:<lb/>
'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.<lb/>
Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,<lb/>
How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>My worthy lord, if ever Tamora<lb/>
Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,<lb/>
Then hear me speak in indifferently for all;<lb/>
And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,<lb/>
And basely put it up without revenge?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend<lb/>
I should be author to dishonour you!<lb/>
But on mine honour dare I undertake<lb/>
For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;<lb/>
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:<lb/>
Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;<lb/>
Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,<lb/>
Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.<lb/>
	</p><p><stage>[Aside to SATURNINUS]</stage></p><p>  My lord, be ruled by me,<lb/>
be won at last;<lb/>
Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:<lb/>
You are but newly planted in your throne;<lb/>
Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,<lb/>
Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,<lb/>
And so supplant you for ingratitude,<lb/>
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,<lb/>
Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:<lb/>
I'll find a day to massacre them all<lb/>
And raze their faction and their family,<lb/>
The cruel father and his traitorous sons,<lb/>
To whom I sued for my dear son's life,<lb/>
And make them know what 'tis to let a queen<lb/>
Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aloud</stage></p>


<p>
Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;<lb/>
Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart<lb/>
That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:<lb/>
These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,<lb/>
A Roman now adopted happily,<lb/>
And must advise the emperor for his good.<lb/>
This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;<lb/>
And let it be mine honour, good my lord,<lb/>
That I have reconciled your friends and you.<lb/>
For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd<lb/>
My word and promise to the emperor,<lb/>
That you will be more mild and tractable.<lb/>
And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia;<lb/>
By my advice, all humbled on your knees,<lb/>
You shall ask pardon of his majesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,<lb/>
That what we did was mildly as we might,<lb/>
Tendering our sister's honour and our own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>That, on mine honour, here I do protest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:<lb/>
The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;<lb/>
I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,<lb/>
And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,<lb/>
I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.<lb/>
Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,<lb/>
I found a friend, and sure as death I swore<lb/>
I would not part a bachelor from the priest.<lb/>
Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,<lb/>
You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.<lb/>
This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>To-morrow, an it please your majesty<lb/>
To hunt the panther and the hart with me,<lb/>
With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.<lb/>

<p>Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter AARON</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,<lb/>
Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,<lb/>
Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;<lb/>
Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.<lb/>
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,<lb/>
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,<lb/>
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,<lb/>
And overlooks the highest-peering hills;<lb/>
So Tamora:<lb/>
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,<lb/>
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.<lb/>
Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,<lb/>
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,<lb/>
And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long<lb/>
Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains<lb/>
And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes<lb/>
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.<lb/>
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!<lb/>
I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,<lb/>
To wait upon this new-made empress.<lb/>
To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,<lb/>
This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,<lb/>
This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,<lb/>
And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.<lb/>
Holloa! what storm is this?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,<lb/>
And manners, to intrude where I am graced;<lb/>
And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;<lb/>
And so in this, to bear me down with braves.<lb/>
'Tis not the difference of a year or two<lb/>
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:<lb/>
I am as able and as fit as thou<lb/>
To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;<lb/>
And that my sword upon thee shall approve,<lb/>
And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep<lb/>
the peace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,<lb/>
Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,<lb/>
Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?<lb/>
Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath<lb/>
Till you know better how to handle it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,<lb/>
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They draw</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Coming forward]</stage></p><p>  Why, how now, lords!<lb/>
So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,<lb/>
And maintain such a quarrel openly?<lb/>
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:<lb/>
I would not for a million of gold<lb/>
The cause were known to them it most concerns;<lb/>
Nor would your noble mother for much more<lb/>
Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.<lb/>
For shame, put up.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Not I, till I have sheathed<lb/>
My rapier in his bosom and withal<lb/>
Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat<lb/>
That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>For that I am prepared and full resolved.<lb/>
Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,<lb/>
And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Away, I say!<lb/>
Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,<lb/>
This petty brabble will undo us all.<lb/>
Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous<lb/>
It is to jet upon a prince's right?<lb/>
What, is Lavinia then become so loose,<lb/>
Or Bassianus so degenerate,<lb/>
That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd<lb/>
Without controlment, justice, or revenge?<lb/>
Young lords, beware! and should the empress know<lb/>
This discord's ground, the music would not please.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>I care not, I, knew she and all the world:<lb/>
I love Lavinia more than all the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:<lb/>
Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome<lb/>
How furious and impatient they be,<lb/>
And cannot brook competitors in love?<lb/>
I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths<lb/>
By this device.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Aaron, a thousand deaths<lb/>
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>To achieve her! how?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Why makest thou it so strange?<lb/>
She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;<lb/>
She is a woman, therefore may be won;<lb/>
She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.<lb/>
What, man! more water glideth by the mill<lb/>
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is<lb/>
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:<lb/>
Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.<lb/>
Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Then why should he despair that knows to court it<lb/>
With words, fair looks and liberality?<lb/>
What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,<lb/>
And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so<lb/>
Would serve your turns.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Ay, so the turn were served.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Aaron, thou hast hit it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Would you had hit it too!<lb/>
Then should not we be tired with this ado.<lb/>
Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools<lb/>
To square for this? would it offend you, then<lb/>
That both should speed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Faith, not me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Nor me, so I were one.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:<lb/>
'Tis policy and stratagem must do<lb/>
That you affect; and so must you resolve,<lb/>
That what you cannot as you would achieve,<lb/>
You must perforce accomplish as you may.<lb/>
Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste<lb/>
Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.<lb/>
A speedier course than lingering languishment<lb/>
Must we pursue, and I have found the path.<lb/>
My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;<lb/>
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:<lb/>
The forest walks are wide and spacious;<lb/>
And many unfrequented plots there are<lb/>
Fitted by kind for rape and villany:<lb/>
Single you thither then this dainty doe,<lb/>
And strike her home by force, if not by words:<lb/>
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.<lb/>
Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit<lb/>
To villany and vengeance consecrate,<lb/>
Will we acquaint with all that we intend;<lb/>
And she shall file our engines with advice,<lb/>
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,<lb/>
But to your wishes' height advance you both.<lb/>
The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,<lb/>
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:<lb/>
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;<lb/>
There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take<lb/>
your turns;<lb/>
There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,<lb/>
And revel in Lavinia's treasury.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream<lb/>
To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.<lb/>
Per Styga, per manes vehor.<lb/>

<p>
That have their alms out of the empress' chest.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter TAMORA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,<lb/>
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?<lb/>
The birds chant melody on every bush,<lb/>
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,<lb/>
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind<lb/>
And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:<lb/>
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,<lb/>
And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,<lb/>
Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,<lb/>
As if a double hunt were heard at once,<lb/>
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;<lb/>
And, after conflict such as was supposed<lb/>
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,<lb/>
When with a happy storm they were surprised<lb/>
And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,<lb/>
We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,<lb/>
Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;<lb/>
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds<lb/>
Be unto us as is a nurse's song<lb/>
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Madam, though Venus govern your desires,<lb/>
Saturn is dominator over mine:<lb/>
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,<lb/>
My silence and my cloudy melancholy,<lb/>
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls<lb/>
Even as an adder when she doth unroll<lb/>
To do some fatal execution?<lb/>
No, madam, these are no venereal signs:<lb/>
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,<lb/>
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.<lb/>
Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,<lb/>
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,<lb/>
This is the day of doom for Bassianus:<lb/>
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,<lb/>
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity<lb/>
And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.<lb/>
Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,<lb/>
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.<lb/>
Now question me no more; we are espied;<lb/>
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,<lb/>
Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:<lb/>
Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons<lb/>
To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,<lb/>
Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?<lb/>
Or is it Dian, habited like her,<lb/>
Who hath abandoned her holy groves<lb/>
To see the general hunting in this forest?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Saucy controller of our private steps!<lb/>
Had I the power that some say Dian had,<lb/>
Thy temples should be planted presently<lb/>
With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds<lb/>
Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,<lb/>
Unmannerly intruder as thou art!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>Under your patience, gentle empress,<lb/>
'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;<lb/>
And to be doubted that your Moor and you<lb/>
Are singled forth to try experiments:<lb/>
Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!<lb/>
'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian<lb/>
Doth make your honour of his body's hue,<lb/>
Spotted, detested, and abominable.<lb/>
Why are you sequester'd from all your train,<lb/>
Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.<lb/>
And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,<lb/>
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,<lb/>
If foul desire had not conducted you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>And, being intercepted in your sport,<lb/>
Great reason that my noble lord be rated<lb/>
For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,<lb/>
And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;<lb/>
This valley fits the purpose passing well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASSIANUS</speaker>
<p>The king my brother shall have note of this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:<lb/>
Good king, to be so mightily abused!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Why have I patience to endure all this?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!<lb/>
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?<lb/>
These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:<lb/>
A barren detested vale, you see it is;<lb/>
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,<lb/>
O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:<lb/>
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,<lb/>
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:<lb/>
And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,<lb/>
They told me, here, at dead time of the night,<lb/>
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,<lb/>
Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,<lb/>
Would make such fearful and confused cries<lb/>
As any mortal body hearing it<lb/>
Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.<lb/>
No sooner had they told this hellish tale,<lb/>
But straight they told me they would bind me here<lb/>
Unto the body of a dismal yew,<lb/>
And leave me to this miserable death:<lb/>
And then they call'd me foul adulteress,<lb/>
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms<lb/>
That ever ear did hear to such effect:<lb/>
And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,<lb/>
This vengeance on me had they executed.<lb/>
Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,<lb/>
Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>This is a witness that I am thy son.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Stabs BASSIANUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>And this for me, struck home to show my strength.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,<lb/>
For no name fits thy nature but thy own!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys<lb/>
Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;<lb/>
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:<lb/>
This minion stood upon her chastity,<lb/>
Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,<lb/>
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:<lb/>
And shall she carry this unto her grave?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.<lb/>
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,<lb/>
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>But when ye have the honey ye desire,<lb/>
Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.<lb/>
Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy<lb/>
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>I will not hear her speak; away with her!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory<lb/>
To see her tears; but be your heart to them<lb/>
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?<lb/>
O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;<lb/>
The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;<lb/>
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.<lb/>
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To CHIRON</stage></p>


<p>
Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:<lb/>
Yet have I heard,&mdash;O, could I find it now!&mdash;<lb/>
The lion moved with pity did endure<lb/>
To have his princely paws pared all away:<lb/>
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,<lb/>
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:<lb/>
O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,<lb/>
Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>I know not what it means; away with her!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,<lb/>
That gave thee life, when well he might have<lb/>
slain thee,<lb/>
Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,<lb/>
Even for his sake am I pitiless.<lb/>
Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,<lb/>
To save your brother from the sacrifice;<lb/>
But fierce Andronicus would not relent;<lb/>
Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,<lb/>
The worse to her, the better loved of me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,<lb/>
And with thine own hands kill me in this place!<lb/>
For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;<lb/>
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more<lb/>
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:<lb/>
O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,<lb/>
And tumble me into some loathsome pit,<lb/>
Where never man's eye may behold my body:<lb/>
Do this, and be a charitable murderer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:<lb/>
No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAVINIA</speaker>
<p>No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!<lb/>
The blot and enemy to our general name!<lb/>
Confusion fall&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:<lb/>
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the	pit; then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging	off LAVINIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.<lb/>
Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,<lb/>
Till all the Andronici be made away.<lb/>
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,<lb/>
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter AARON, with QUINTUS and MARTIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Come on, my lords, the better foot before:<lb/>
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit<lb/>
Where I espied the panther fast asleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,<lb/>
Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Falls into the pit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,<lb/>
Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,<lb/>
Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood<lb/>
As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?<lb/>
A very fatal place it seems to me.<lb/>

Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt<lb/>
That ever eye with sight made heart lament!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Now will I fetch the king to find them here,<lb/>
That he thereby may give a likely guess<lb/>
How these were they that made away his brother.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>Why dost not comfort me, and help me out<lb/>
From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>I am surprised with an uncouth fear;<lb/>
A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:<lb/>
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,<lb/>
Aaron and thou look down into this den,<lb/>
And see a fearful sight of blood and death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart<lb/>
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold<lb/>
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;<lb/>
O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now<lb/>
Was I a child to fear I know not what.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,<lb/>
All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,<lb/>
In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>Upon his bloody finger he doth wear<lb/>
A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,<lb/>
Which, like a taper in some monument,<lb/>
Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,<lb/>
And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:<lb/>
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus<lb/>
When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.<lb/>
O brother, help me with thy fainting hand&mdash;<lb/>
If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath&mdash;<lb/>
Out of this fell devouring receptacle,<lb/>
As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;<lb/>
Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,<lb/>
I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb<lb/>
Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.<lb/>
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUINTUS</speaker>
<p>Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,<lb/>
Till thou art here aloft, or I below:<lb/>
Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.<lb/>

And what he is that now is leap'd into it.<lb/>
Say who art thou that lately didst descend<lb/>
Into this gaping hollow of the earth?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>The unhappy son of old Andronicus:<lb/>
Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,<lb/>
To find thy brother Bassianus dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:<lb/>
He and his lady both are at the lodge<lb/>
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;<lb/>
'Tis not an hour since I left him there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARTIUS</speaker>
<p>We know not where you left him all alive;<lb/>
But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.<lb/>

<p>Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:<lb/>
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.<lb/>

The complot of this timeless tragedy;<lb/>

Among the nettles at the elder-tree<lb/>
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit<lb/>
Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.<lb/>
Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'<lb/>
O Tamora! was ever heard the like?<lb/>
This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.<lb/>
Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out<lb/>
That should have murdered Bassianus here.<lb/>

Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!<lb/>
How easily murder is discovered!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>High emperor, upon my feeble knee<lb/>
I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,<lb/>
That this fell fault of my accursed sons,<lb/>
Accursed if the fault be proved in them,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>If it be proved! you see it is apparent.<lb/>
Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Andronicus himself did take it up.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;<lb/>
For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow<lb/>
They shall be ready at your highness' will<lb/>
To answer their suspicion with their lives.<lb/>

<p>Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.<lb/>
Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:<lb/>
Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;<lb/>
For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,<lb/>
That end upon them should be executed.<lb/>

If I do wake, some planet strike me down,<lb/>
That I may slumber in eternal sleep!<lb/>
Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands<lb/>
Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare<lb/>
Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,<lb/>
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,<lb/>
And might not gain so great a happiness<lb/>
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?<lb/>
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,<lb/>
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,<lb/>
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,<lb/>
Coming and going with thy honey breath.<lb/>
But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,<lb/>
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.<lb/>
Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!<lb/>
And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,<lb/>
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,<lb/>
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face<lb/>
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.<lb/>
Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?<lb/>
O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,<lb/>
That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!<lb/>
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,<lb/>

Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,<lb/>

O, had the monster seen those lily hands<lb/>

He would not then have touch'd them for his life!<lb/>
Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony<lb/>

He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep<lb/>

Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;<lb/>

<p>My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,<lb/>
They would not mark me, or if they did mark,<lb/>
They would not pity me, yet plead I must;<lb/>
And bootless unto them . . . . .<lb/>
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;<lb/>
Who, though they cannot answer my distress,<lb/>
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,<lb/>
For that they will not intercept my tale:<lb/>
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet<lb/>
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;<lb/>
And, were they but attired in grave weeds,<lb/>
Rome could afford no tribune like to these.<lb/>
A stone is soft as wax,&mdash;tribunes more hard than stones;<lb/>
A stone is silent, and offendeth not,<lb/>
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Rises</stage></p>


<p>
But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>To rescue my two brothers from their death:<lb/>
For which attempt the judges have pronounced<lb/>
My everlasting doom of banishment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O happy man! they have befriended thee.<lb/>
Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive<lb/>
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?<lb/>
Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey<lb/>
But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,<lb/>
From these devourers to be banished!<lb/>
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;<lb/>
Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:<lb/>
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Will it consume me? let me see it, then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>This was thy daughter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Why, Marcus, so she is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay me, this object kills me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.<lb/>
Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand<lb/>
Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?<lb/>
What fool hath added water to the sea,<lb/>
Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?<lb/>
My grief was at the height before thou camest,<lb/>
And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.<lb/>
Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;<lb/>
For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;<lb/>
And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;<lb/>
In bootless prayer have they been held up,<lb/>
And they have served me to effectless use:<lb/>
Now all the service I require of them<lb/>
Is that the one will help to cut the other.<lb/>
'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;<lb/>
For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O, that delightful engine of her thoughts<lb/>
That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,<lb/>
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,<lb/>
Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung<lb/>
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O, thus I found her, straying in the park,<lb/>
Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer<lb/>
That hath received some unrecuring wound.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>It was my deer; and he that wounded her<lb/>
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:<lb/>
For now I stand as one upon a rock<lb/>
Environed with a wilderness of sea,<lb/>
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,<lb/>
Expecting ever when some envious surge<lb/>
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.<lb/>
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;<lb/>
Here stands my other son, a banished man,<lb/>
And here my brother, weeping at my woes.<lb/>
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,<lb/>
Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.<lb/>
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,<lb/>
It would have madded me: what shall I do<lb/>
Now I behold thy lively body so?<lb/>
Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:<lb/>
Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:<lb/>
Thy husband he is dead: and for his death<lb/>
Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.<lb/>
Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!<lb/>
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears<lb/>
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew<lb/>
Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;<lb/>
Perchance because she knows them innocent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful<lb/>
Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.<lb/>
No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;<lb/>
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.<lb/>
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.<lb/>
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:<lb/>
Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,<lb/>
And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,<lb/>
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks<lb/>
How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,<lb/>
With miry slime left on them by a flood?<lb/>
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long<lb/>
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,<lb/>
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?<lb/>
Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?<lb/>
Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows<lb/>
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?<lb/>
What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,<lb/>
Plot some deuce of further misery,<lb/>
To make us wonder'd at in time to come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,<lb/>
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot<lb/>
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,<lb/>
For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:<lb/>
Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say<lb/>
That to her brother which I said to thee:<lb/>
His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,<lb/>
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.<lb/>
O, what a sympathy of woe is this,<lb/>
As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter AARON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor<lb/>
Sends thee this word,&mdash;that, if thou love thy sons,<lb/>
Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,<lb/>
Or any one of you, chop off your hand,<lb/>
And send it to the king: he for the same<lb/>
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;<lb/>
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!<lb/>
Did ever raven sing so like a lark,<lb/>
That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?<lb/>
With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:<lb/>
Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,<lb/>
That hath thrown down so many enemies,<lb/>
Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:<lb/>
My youth can better spare my blood than you;<lb/>
And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,<lb/>
And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,<lb/>
Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?<lb/>
O, none of both but are of high desert:<lb/>
My hand hath been but idle; let it serve<lb/>
To ransom my two nephews from their death;<lb/>
Then have I kept it to a worthy end.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,<lb/>
For fear they die before their pardon come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>My hand shall go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>By heaven, it shall not go!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these<lb/>
Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,<lb/>
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>And, for our father's sake and mother's care,<lb/>
Now let me show a brother's love to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Agree between you; I will spare my hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Then I'll go fetch an axe.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>But I will use the axe.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:<lb/>
Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,<lb/>
And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:<lb/>
But I'll deceive you in another sort,<lb/>
And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Cuts off TITUS's hand</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.<lb/>
Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:<lb/>
Tell him it was a hand that warded him<lb/>
From thousand dangers; bid him bury it<lb/>
More hath it merited; that let it have.<lb/>
As for my sons, say I account of them<lb/>
As jewels purchased at an easy price;<lb/>
And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand<lb/>
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany<lb/>
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!<lb/>
Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.<lb/>
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,<lb/>
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:<lb/>
If any power pities wretched tears,<lb/>
To that I call!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To LAVINIA</stage></p>


<p>
What, wilt thou kneel with me?<lb/>
Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;<lb/>
Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,<lb/>
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds<lb/>
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O brother, speak with possibilities,<lb/>
And do not break into these deep extremes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?<lb/>
Then be my passions bottomless with them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>But yet let reason govern thy lament.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>If there were reason for these miseries,<lb/>
Then into limits could I bind my woes:<lb/>
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?<lb/>
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,<lb/>
Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?<lb/>
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?<lb/>
I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!<lb/>
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:<lb/>
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;<lb/>
Then must my earth with her continual tears<lb/>
Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;<lb/>
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,<lb/>
But like a drunkard must I vomit them.<lb/>
Then give me leave, for losers will have leave<lb/>
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger, with two heads and a hand</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid<lb/>
For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.<lb/>
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;<lb/>
And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;<lb/>
Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd;<lb/>
That woe is me to think upon thy woes<lb/>
More than remembrance of my father's death.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily,<lb/>
And be my heart an ever-burning hell!<lb/>
These miseries are more than may be borne.<lb/>
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;<lb/>
But sorrow flouted at is double death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,<lb/>
And yet detested life not shrink thereat!<lb/>
That ever death should let life bear his name,<lb/>
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>LAVINIA kisses TITUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless<lb/>
As frozen water to a starved snake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>When will this fearful slumber have an end?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;<lb/>
Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,<lb/>
Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:<lb/>
Thy other banish'd son, with this dear sight<lb/>
Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,<lb/>
Even like a stony image, cold and numb.<lb/>
Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:<lb/>
Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand<lb/>
Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight<lb/>
The closing up of our most wretched eyes;<lb/>
Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Why, I have not another tear to shed:<lb/>
Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,<lb/>
And would usurp upon my watery eyes<lb/>
And make them blind with tributary tears:<lb/>
Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?<lb/>
For these two heads do seem to speak to me,<lb/>
And threat me I shall never come to bliss<lb/>
Till all these mischiefs be return'd again<lb/>
Even in their throats that have committed them.<lb/>
Come, let me see what task I have to do.<lb/>
You heavy people, circle me about,<lb/>
That I may turn me to each one of you,<lb/>
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.<lb/>
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;<lb/>
And in this hand the other I will bear.<lb/>
Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!<lb/>
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.<lb/>
As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;<lb/>
Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:<lb/>
Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:<lb/>
And, if you love me, as I think you do,<lb/>
Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt TITUS, MARCUS, and LAVINIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Farewell Andronicus, my noble father,<lb/>
The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome:<lb/>
Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,<lb/>
He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:<lb/>
Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;<lb/>
O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!<lb/>
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives<lb/>
But in oblivion and hateful griefs.<lb/>
If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;<lb/>
And make proud Saturnine and his empress<lb/>
Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.<lb/>
Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,<lb/>
To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more<lb/>
Than will preserve just so much strength in us<lb/>
As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.<lb/>
Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:<lb/>
Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,<lb/>
And cannot passionate our tenfold grief<lb/>
With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine<lb/>
Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;<lb/>
Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,<lb/>
Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,<lb/>
Then thus I thump it down.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To LAVINIA</stage></p>


<p>
Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!<lb/>
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,<lb/>
Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.<lb/>
Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;<lb/>
Or get some little knife between thy teeth,<lb/>
And just against thy heart make thou a hole;<lb/>
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall<lb/>
May run into that sink, and soaking in<lb/>
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.<lb/>

Such violent hands upon her tender life.<lb/>

<p>How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?<lb/>
Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.<lb/>
What violent hands can she lay on her life?<lb/>
Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;<lb/>
To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,<lb/>
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?<lb/>
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,<lb/>
Lest we remember still that we have none.<lb/>
Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,<lb/>
As if we should forget we had no hands,<lb/>
If Marcus did not name the word of hands!<lb/>
Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:<lb/>
Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;<lb/>
I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;<lb/>
She says she drinks no other drink but tears,<lb/>
Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:<lb/>
Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;<lb/>
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect<lb/>
As begging hermits in their holy prayers:<lb/>
Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,<lb/>
Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,<lb/>
But I of these will wrest an alphabet<lb/>
And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.<lb/>

How would he hang his slender gilded wings,<lb/>
And buzz lamenting doings in the air!<lb/>
Poor harmless fly,<lb/>
That, with his pretty buzzing melody,<lb/>
Came here to make us merry! and thou hast<lb/>
kill'd him.<lb/>

Then pardon me for reprehending thee,<lb/>
For thou hast done a charitable deed.<lb/>

Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor<lb/>
Come hither purposely to poison me.&mdash;<lb/>
There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.<lb/>
Ah, sirrah!<lb/>
Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,<lb/>

That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.<lb/>

He takes false shadows for true substances.<lb/>

I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee<lb/>
Sad stories chanced in the times of old.<lb/>

Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.<lb/>
Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.<lb/>

<p>My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,<lb/>
Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:<lb/>
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,<lb/>
Extremity of griefs would make men mad;<lb/>

<p>Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Young LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;<lb/>
My mother gave it me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>For love of her that's gone,<lb/>
Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Helping her</stage></p>


<p>
What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?<lb/>
This is the tragic tale of Philomel,<lb/>
And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:<lb/>
And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,<lb/>
Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,<lb/>
Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!<lb/>
Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt&mdash;<lb/>
O, had we never, never hunted there!&mdash;<lb/>
Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,<lb/>
By nature made for murders and for rapes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O, why should nature build so foul a den,<lb/>
Unless the gods delight in tragedies?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none<lb/>
but friends,<lb/>
What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:<lb/>
Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,<lb/>
That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.<lb/>
Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,<lb/>
Inspire me, that I may this treason find!<lb/>
My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:<lb/>
This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst<lb/>
This after me, when I have writ my name<lb/>
Without the help of any hand at all.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He writes his name with his staff, and guides it	with feet and mouth</stage></p>


<p>
Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!<lb/>
Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,<lb/>
What God will have discover'd for revenge;<lb/>
Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,<lb/>
That we may know the traitors and the truth!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it	with her stumps, and writes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?<lb/>
'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora<lb/>
Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Magni Dominator poli,<lb/>
Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know<lb/>
There is enough written upon this earth<lb/>
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts<lb/>
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.<lb/>
My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;<lb/>
And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;<lb/>
And swear with me, as, with the woful fere<lb/>
And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,<lb/>
Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,<lb/>
That we will prosecute by good advice<lb/>
Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,<lb/>
And see their blood, or die with this reproach.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.<lb/>
But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:<lb/>
The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,<lb/>
She's with the lion deeply still in league,<lb/>
And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,<lb/>
And when he sleeps will she do what she list.<lb/>
You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;<lb/>
And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,<lb/>
And with a gad of steel will write these words,<lb/>
And lay it by: the angry northern wind<lb/>
Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,<lb/>
And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Young LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>I say, my lord, that if I were a man,<lb/>
Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe<lb/>
For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft<lb/>
For his ungrateful country done the like.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Young LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Come, go with me into mine armoury;<lb/>
Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,<lb/>
Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons<lb/>
Presents that I intend to send them both:<lb/>
Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Young LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.<lb/>
Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:<lb/>
Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:<lb/>
Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt TITUS, LAVINIA, and Young LUCIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,<lb/>
And not relent, or not compassion him?<lb/>
Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,<lb/>
That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart<lb/>
Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;<lb/>
But yet so just that he will not revenge.<lb/>
Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!<lb/>

<p>What's here? A scroll; and written round about?<lb/>
Let's see;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,<lb/>

<p>O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!<lb/>
Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;<lb/>
And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,<lb/>
That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.<lb/>
But were our witty empress well afoot,<lb/>
She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:<lb/>
But let her rest in her unrest awhile.<lb/>

And now, young lords, was't not a happy star<lb/>
Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,<lb/>
Captives, to be advanced to this height?<lb/>
It did me good, before the palace gate<lb/>
To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>But me more good, to see so great a lord<lb/>
Basely insinuate and send us gifts.<lb/>

<p>Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?<lb/>
Did you not use his daughter very friendly?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, lords:<lb/>
O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?<lb/>

<p>Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,<lb/>
Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!<lb/>
Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!<lb/>
What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,<lb/>
Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!<lb/>
She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>To whom?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>I mean, she is brought a-bed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>A devil.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:<lb/>
Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad<lb/>
Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:<lb/>
The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,<lb/>
And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?<lb/>
Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.<lb/>

<p>Villain, what hast thou done?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>That which thou canst not undo.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Thou hast undone our mother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Villain, I have done thy mother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.<lb/>
Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!<lb/>
Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>It shall not live.<lb/>

<p>Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.<lb/>

<p>What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I<lb/>
Do execution on my flesh and blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:<lb/>
Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws</stage></p>


<p>
Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?<lb/>
Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,<lb/>
That shone so brightly when this boy was got,<lb/>
He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point<lb/>
That touches this my first-born son and heir!<lb/>
I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,<lb/>
With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,<lb/>
Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,<lb/>
Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.<lb/>
What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!<lb/>
Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!<lb/>
Coal-black is better than another hue,<lb/>
In that it scorns to bear another hue;<lb/>
For all the water in the ocean<lb/>
Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,<lb/>
Although she lave them hourly in the flood.<lb/>
Tell the empress from me, I am of age<lb/>
To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>My mistress is my mistress; this myself,<lb/>
The vigour and the picture of my youth:<lb/>
This before all the world do I prefer;<lb/>
This maugre all the world will I keep safe,<lb/>
Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>By this our mother is forever shamed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Rome will despise her for this foul escape.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>I blush to think upon this ignomy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:<lb/>
Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing<lb/>
The close enacts and counsels of the heart!<lb/>
Here's a young lad framed of another leer:<lb/>
Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,<lb/>
As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'<lb/>
He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed<lb/>
Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,<lb/>
And from that womb where you imprison'd were<lb/>
He is enfranchised and come to light:<lb/>
Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,<lb/>
Although my seal be stamped in his face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,<lb/>
And we will all subscribe to thy advice:<lb/>
Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Then sit we down, and let us all consult.<lb/>
My son and I will have the wind of you:<lb/>
Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They sit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>How many women saw this child of his?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,<lb/>
I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,<lb/>
The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,<lb/>
The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.<lb/>
But say, again; how many saw the child?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Cornelia the midwife and myself;<lb/>
And no one else but the deliver'd empress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>The empress, the midwife, and yourself:<lb/>
Two may keep counsel when the third's away:<lb/>
Go to the empress, tell her this I said.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He kills the nurse</stage></p>


<p>
Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:<lb/>
Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,<lb/>
A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:<lb/>
And now be it known to you my full intent.<lb/>
Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;<lb/>
His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;<lb/>
His child is like to her, fair as you are:<lb/>
Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,<lb/>
And tell them both the circumstance of all;<lb/>
And how by this their child shall be advanced,<lb/>
And be received for the emperor's heir,<lb/>
And substituted in the place of mine,<lb/>
To calm this tempest whirling in the court;<lb/>
And let the emperor dandle him for his own.<lb/>
Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Pointing to the nurse</stage></p>


<p>
And you must needs bestow her funeral;<lb/>
The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:<lb/>
This done, see that you take no longer days,<lb/>
But send the midwife presently to me.<lb/>
The midwife and the nurse well made away,<lb/>
Then let the ladies tattle what they please.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air<lb/>
With secrets.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>For this care of Tamora,<lb/>
Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the	Nurse's body</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;<lb/>
There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,<lb/>
And secretly to greet the empress' friends.<lb/>
Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;<lb/>
For it is you that puts us to our shifts:<lb/>
I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,<lb/>
And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,<lb/>
And cabin in a cave, and bring you up<lb/>
To be a warrior, and command a camp.<lb/>

<p>Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.<lb/>
Sir boy, now let me see your archery;<lb/>
Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.<lb/>
Terras Astraea reliquit:<lb/>
Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.<lb/>
Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall<lb/>
Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;<lb/>
Happily you may catch her in the sea;<lb/>
Yet there's as little justice as at land:<lb/>
No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;<lb/>
'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,<lb/>
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:<lb/>
Then, when you come to Pluto's region,<lb/>
I pray you, deliver him this petition;<lb/>
Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,<lb/>
And that it comes from old Andronicus,<lb/>
Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.<lb/>
Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable<lb/>
What time I threw the people's suffrages<lb/>
On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.<lb/>
Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,<lb/>
And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:<lb/>
This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;<lb/>
And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>O Publius, is not this a heavy case,<lb/>
To see thy noble uncle thus distract?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUBLIUS</speaker>
<p>Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns<lb/>
By day and night to attend him carefully,<lb/>
And feed his humour kindly as we may,<lb/>
Till time beget some careful remedy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.<lb/>
Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war<lb/>
Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,<lb/>
And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Publius, how now! how now, my masters!<lb/>
What, have you met with her?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUBLIUS</speaker>
<p>No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,<lb/>
If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:<lb/>
Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,<lb/>
He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,<lb/>
So that perforce you must needs stay a time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.<lb/>
I'll dive into the burning lake below,<lb/>
And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.<lb/>
Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we<lb/>
No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;<lb/>
But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,<lb/>
Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:<lb/>
And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,<lb/>
We will solicit heaven and move the gods<lb/>
To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.<lb/>
Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;<lb/>

'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:<lb/>

To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;<lb/>
You were as good to shoot against the wind.<lb/>
To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.<lb/>
Of my word, I have written to effect;<lb/>
There's not a god left unsolicited.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha!<lb/>
Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?<lb/>
See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,<lb/>
The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock<lb/>
That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;<lb/>
And who should find them but the empress' villain?<lb/>
She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose<lb/>
But give them to his master for a present.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in	it</stage></p>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there     God<lb/>
forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my<lb/>
young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the<lb/>
tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl<lb/>
betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for<lb/>
your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to<lb/>
the emperor from you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor<lb/>
with a grace?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,<lb/>
But give your pigeons to the emperor:<lb/>
By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.<lb/>
Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.<lb/>
Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace<lb/>
deliver a supplication?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Then here is a supplication for you. And when you<lb/>
come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,<lb/>
then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and<lb/>
then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see<lb/>
you do it bravely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I warrant you, sir, let me alone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it.<lb/>
Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;<lb/>
For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.<lb/>
And when thou hast given it the emperor,<lb/>
Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>God be with you, sir; I will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>The same. Before the palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON,	Lords, and others; SATURNINUS with the arrows in	his hand that TITUS shot</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen<lb/>
An emperor in Rome thus overborne,<lb/>
Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent<lb/>
Of egal justice, used in such contempt?<lb/>
My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,<lb/>
However these disturbers of our peace<lb/>
Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,<lb/>
But even with law, against the willful sons<lb/>
Of old Andronicus. And what an if<lb/>
His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,<lb/>
Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,<lb/>
His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?<lb/>
And now he writes to heaven for his redress:<lb/>
See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;<lb/>
This to Apollo; this to the god of war;<lb/>
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!<lb/>
What's this but libelling against the senate,<lb/>
And blazoning our injustice every where?<lb/>
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?<lb/>
As who would say, in Rome no justice were.<lb/>
But if I live, his feigned ecstasies<lb/>
Shall be no shelter to these outrages:<lb/>
But he and his shall know that justice lives<lb/>
In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,<lb/>
He'll so awake as she in fury shall<lb/>
Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,<lb/>
Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,<lb/>
Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,<lb/>
The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,<lb/>
Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;<lb/>
And rather comfort his distressed plight<lb/>
Than prosecute the meanest or the best<lb/>
For these contempts.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
Why, thus it shall become<lb/>
High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:<lb/>
But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,<lb/>
Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,<lb/>
Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Clown</stage></p>


<p>
How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:<lb/>
I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>SATURNINUS reads the letter</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Go, take him away, and hang him presently.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>How much money must I have?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to<lb/>
a fair end.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit, guarded</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!<lb/>
Shall I endure this monstrous villany?<lb/>
I know from whence this same device proceeds:<lb/>
May this be borne?&mdash;as if his traitorous sons,<lb/>
That died by law for murder of our brother,<lb/>
Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!<lb/>
Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;<lb/>
Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:<lb/>
For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;<lb/>
Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,<lb/>
In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter AEMILIUS</stage></p>


<p>
What news with thee, AEmilius?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AEMILIUS</speaker>
<p>Arm, arm, my lord;&mdash;Rome never had more cause.<lb/>
The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power<lb/>
high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,<lb/>
They hither march amain, under conduct<lb/>
Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;<lb/>
Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do<lb/>
As much as ever Coriolanus did.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?<lb/>
These tidings nip me, and I hang the head<lb/>
As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:<lb/>
Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:<lb/>
'Tis he the common people love so much;<lb/>
Myself hath often over-heard them say,<lb/>
When I have walked like a private man,<lb/>
That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,<lb/>
And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Why should you fear? is not your city strong?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,<lb/>
And will revolt from me to succor him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.<lb/>
Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?<lb/>
The eagle suffers little birds to sing,<lb/>
And is not careful what they mean thereby,<lb/>
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings<lb/>
He can at pleasure stint their melody:<lb/>
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.<lb/>
Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,<lb/>
I will enchant the old Andronicus<lb/>
With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,<lb/>
Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,<lb/>
When as the one is wounded with the bait,<lb/>
The other rotted with delicious feed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>But he will not entreat his son for us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>If Tamora entreat him, then he will:<lb/>
For I can smooth and fill his aged ear<lb/>
With golden promises; that, were his heart<lb/>
Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,<lb/>
Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To AEmilius</stage></p>


<p>
Go thou before, be our ambassador:<lb/>
Say that the emperor requests a parley<lb/>
Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting<lb/>
Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>AEmilius, do this message honourably:<lb/>
And if he stand on hostage for his safety,<lb/>
Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AEMILIUS</speaker>
<p>Your bidding shall I do effectually.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Now will I to that old Andronicus;<lb/>
And temper him with all the art I have,<lb/>
To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.<lb/>
And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,<lb/>
And bury all thy fear in my devices.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Then go successantly, and plead to him.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,<lb/>
I have received letters from great Rome,<lb/>
Which signify what hate they bear their emperor<lb/>
And how desirous of our sight they are.<lb/>
Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,<lb/>
Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,<lb/>
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,<lb/>
Let him make treble satisfaction.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Goth</speaker>
<p>Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,<lb/>
Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;<lb/>
Whose high exploits and honourable deeds<lb/>
Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,<lb/>
Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,<lb/>
Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day<lb/>
Led by their master to the flowered fields,<lb/>
And be avenged on cursed Tamora.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All the Goths</speaker>
<p>And as he saith, so say we all with him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.<lb/>
But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Goth</speaker>
<p>Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd<lb/>
To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;<lb/>
And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye<lb/>
Upon the wasted building, suddenly<lb/>
I heard a child cry underneath a wall.<lb/>
I made unto the noise; when soon I heard<lb/>
The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:<lb/>
'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!<lb/>
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,<lb/>
Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,<lb/>
Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:<lb/>
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,<lb/>
They never do beget a coal-black calf.<lb/>
Peace, villain, peace!'&mdash;even thus he rates<lb/>
the babe,&mdash;<lb/>
'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;<lb/>
Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,<lb/>
Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'<lb/>
With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,<lb/>
Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,<lb/>
To use as you think needful of the man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil<lb/>
That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;<lb/>
This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,<lb/>
And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.<lb/>
Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey<lb/>
This growing image of thy fiend-like face?<lb/>
Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?<lb/>
A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.<lb/>
And by his side his fruit of bastardy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Too like the sire for ever being good.<lb/>
First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;<lb/>
A sight to vex the father's soul withal.<lb/>
Get me a ladder.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Lucius, save the child,<lb/>
And bear it from me to the empress.<lb/>
If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,<lb/>
That highly may advantage thee to hear:<lb/>
If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,<lb/>
I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st<lb/>
Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,<lb/>
'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;<lb/>
For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,<lb/>
Acts of black night, abominable deeds,<lb/>
Complots of mischief, treason, villanies<lb/>
Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:<lb/>
And this shall all be buried by my death,<lb/>
Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:<lb/>
That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;<lb/>
Yet, for I know thou art religious<lb/>
And hast a thing within thee called conscience,<lb/>
With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,<lb/>
Which I have seen thee careful to observe,<lb/>
Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know<lb/>
An idiot holds his bauble for a god<lb/>
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,<lb/>
To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow<lb/>
By that same god, what god soe'er it be,<lb/>
That thou adorest and hast in reverence,<lb/>
To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;<lb/>
Or else I will discover nought to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Even by my god I swear to thee I will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>First know thou, I begot him on the empress.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>O most insatiate and luxurious woman!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity<lb/>
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.<lb/>
'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;<lb/>
They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her<lb/>
And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas<lb/>
Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:<lb/>
That codding spirit had they from their mother,<lb/>
As sure a card as ever won the set;<lb/>
That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,<lb/>
As true a dog as ever fought at head.<lb/>
Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.<lb/>
I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole<lb/>
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:<lb/>
I wrote the letter that thy father found<lb/>
And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,<lb/>
Confederate with the queen and her two sons:<lb/>
And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,<lb/>
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?<lb/>
I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,<lb/>
And, when I had it, drew myself apart<lb/>
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:<lb/>
I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall<lb/>
When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;<lb/>
Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,<lb/>
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :<lb/>
And when I told the empress of this sport,<lb/>
She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,<lb/>
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Goth</speaker>
<p>What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.<lb/>
Even now I curse the day&mdash;and yet, I think,<lb/>
Few come within the compass of my curse,&mdash;<lb/>
Wherein I did not some notorious ill,<lb/>
As kill a man, or else devise his death,<lb/>
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,<lb/>
Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,<lb/>
Set deadly enmity between two friends,<lb/>
Make poor men's cattle break their necks;<lb/>
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,<lb/>
And bid the owners quench them with their tears.<lb/>
Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,<lb/>
And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,<lb/>
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;<lb/>
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,<lb/>
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,<lb/>
'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'<lb/>
Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things<lb/>
As willingly as one would kill a fly,<lb/>
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed<lb/>
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Bring down the devil; for he must not die<lb/>
So sweet a death as hanging presently.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>If there be devils, would I were a devil,<lb/>
To live and burn in everlasting fire,<lb/>
So I might have your company in hell,<lb/>
But to torment you with my bitter tongue!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Goth</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Goth</speaker>
<p>My lord, there is a messenger from Rome<lb/>
Desires to be admitted to your presence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Let him come near.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter AEMILIUS</stage></p>


<p>
Welcome, AEmilius	what's the news from Rome?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AEMILIUS</speaker>
<p>Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,<lb/>
The Roman emperor greets you all by me;<lb/>
And, for he understands you are in arms,<lb/>
He craves a parley at your father's house,<lb/>
Willing you to demand your hostages,<lb/>
And they shall be immediately deliver'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Goth</speaker>
<p>What says our general?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges<lb/>
Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,<lb/>
And we will come. March away.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Who doth molest my contemplation?<lb/>
Is it your trick to make me ope the door,<lb/>
That so my sad decrees may fly away,<lb/>
And all my study be to no effect?<lb/>
You are deceived: for what I mean to do<lb/>
See here in bloody lines I have set down;<lb/>
And what is written shall be executed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Titus, I am come to talk with thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,<lb/>
Wanting a hand to give it action?<lb/>
Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.<lb/>

<p>If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>I am not mad; I know thee well enough:<lb/>
Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;<lb/>
Witness these trenches made by grief and care,<lb/>
Witness the tiring day and heavy night;<lb/>
Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well<lb/>
For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:<lb/>
Is not thy coming for my other hand?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;<lb/>
She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:<lb/>
I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,<lb/>
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,<lb/>
By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.<lb/>
Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;<lb/>
Confer with me of murder and of death:<lb/>
There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,<lb/>
No vast obscurity or misty vale,<lb/>
Where bloody murder or detested rape<lb/>
Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;<lb/>
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,<lb/>
Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,<lb/>
To be a torment to mine enemies?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Do me some service, ere I come to thee.<lb/>
Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;<lb/>
Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,<lb/>
Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;<lb/>
And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,<lb/>
And whirl along with thee about the globe.<lb/>
Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,<lb/>
To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,<lb/>
And find out murderers in their guilty caves:<lb/>
And when thy car is loaden with their heads,<lb/>
I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel<lb/>
Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,<lb/>
Even from Hyperion's rising in the east<lb/>
Until his very downfall in the sea:<lb/>
And day by day I'll do this heavy task,<lb/>
So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,<lb/>
Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!<lb/>
And you, the empress! but we worldly men<lb/>
Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.<lb/>
O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;<lb/>

<p>This closing with him fits his lunacy<lb/>
Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,<lb/>
Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,<lb/>
For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;<lb/>
And, being credulous in this mad thought,<lb/>
I'll make him send for Lucius his son;<lb/>
And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,<lb/>
I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,<lb/>
To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,<lb/>
Or, at the least, make them his enemies.<lb/>
See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.<lb/>

Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.<lb/>
How like the empress and her sons you are!<lb/>
Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:<lb/>
Could not all hell afford you such a devil?<lb/>
For well I wot the empress never wags<lb/>
But in her company there is a Moor;<lb/>
And, would you represent our queen aright,<lb/>
It were convenient you had such a devil:<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Show me a villain that hath done a rape,<lb/>
And I am sent to be revenged on him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,<lb/>
And I will be revenged on them all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;<lb/>
And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.<lb/>
Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.<lb/>
Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap<lb/>
To find another that is like to thee,<lb/>
Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.<lb/>
Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court<lb/>
There is a queen, attended by a Moor;<lb/>
Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,<lb/>
for up and down she doth resemble thee:<lb/>
I pray thee, do on them some violent death;<lb/>
They have been violent to me and mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.<lb/>
But would it please thee, good Andronicus,<lb/>
To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,<lb/>
Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,<lb/>
And bid him come and banquet at thy house;<lb/>
When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,<lb/>
I will bring in the empress and her sons,<lb/>
The emperor himself and all thy foes;<lb/>
And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,<lb/>
And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.<lb/>
What says Andronicus to this device?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter MARCUS</stage></p>


<p>
Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;<lb/>
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:<lb/>
Bid him repair to me, and bring with him<lb/>
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;<lb/>
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:<lb/>
Tell him the emperor and the empress too<lb/>
Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.<lb/>
This do thou for my love; and so let him,<lb/>
As he regards his aged father's life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>This will I do, and soon return again.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Now will I hence about thy business,<lb/>
And take my ministers along with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;<lb/>
Or else I'll call my brother back again,<lb/>
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to her sons]</stage></p><p>  What say you, boys? will you<lb/>
bide with him,<lb/>
Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor<lb/>
How I have govern'd our determined jest?<lb/>
Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,<lb/>
And tarry with him till I turn again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I know them all, though they suppose me mad,<lb/>
And will o'erreach them in their own devices:<lb/>
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes<lb/>
To lay a complot to betray thy foes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit TAMORA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Tut, I have work enough for you to do.<lb/>
Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PUBLIUS and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUBLIUS</speaker>
<p>What is your will?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Know you these two?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUBLIUS</speaker>
<p>The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;<lb/>
The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;<lb/>
And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.<lb/>
Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.<lb/>
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,<lb/>
And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,<lb/>
And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>PUBLIUS, &amp;c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHIRON</speaker>
<p>Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PUBLIUS</speaker>
<p>And therefore do we what we are commanded.<lb/>
Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.<lb/>
Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter TITUS, with LAVINIA; he bearing a knife,	and she a basin</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.<lb/>
Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;<lb/>
But let them hear what fearful words I utter.<lb/>
O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!<lb/>
Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,<lb/>
This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.<lb/>
You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault<lb/>
Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,<lb/>
My hand cut off and made a merry jest;<lb/>
Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear<lb/>
Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,<lb/>
Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced.<lb/>
What would you say, if I should let you speak?<lb/>
Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.<lb/>
Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.<lb/>
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,<lb/>
Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold<lb/>
The basin that receives your guilty blood.<lb/>
You know your mother means to feast with me,<lb/>
And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:<lb/>
Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust<lb/>
And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,<lb/>
And of the paste a coffin I will rear<lb/>
And make two pasties of your shameful heads,<lb/>
And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,<lb/>
Like to the earth swallow her own increase.<lb/>
This is the feast that I have bid her to,<lb/>
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;<lb/>
For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,<lb/>
And worse than Progne I will be revenged:<lb/>
And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He cuts their throats</stage></p>


<p>
Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,<lb/>
Let me go grind their bones to powder small<lb/>
And with this hateful liquor temper it;<lb/>
And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.<lb/>
Come, come, be every one officious<lb/>
To make this banquet; which I wish may prove<lb/>
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.<lb/>
So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,<lb/>
And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies</stage>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>Court of TITUS's house. A banquet set out.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LUCIUS, MARCUS, and Goths, with AARON prisoner</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind<lb/>
That I repair to Rome, I am content.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Goth</speaker>
<p>And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,<lb/>
This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;<lb/>
Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him<lb/>
Till he be brought unto the empress' face,<lb/>
For testimony of her foul proceedings:<lb/>
And see the ambush of our friends be strong;<lb/>
I fear the emperor means no good to us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,<lb/>
And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth<lb/>
The venomous malice of my swelling heart!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!<lb/>
Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within</stage></p>


<p>
The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS,	Tribunes, Senators, and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>What, hath the firmament more suns than one?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;<lb/>
These quarrels must be quietly debated.<lb/>
The feast is ready, which the careful Titus<lb/>
Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,<lb/>
For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:<lb/>
Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Marcus, we will.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook, LAVINIA veiled,	Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes	on the table</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;<lb/>
Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;<lb/>
And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,<lb/>
'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Because I would be sure to have all well,<lb/>
To entertain your highness and your empress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>An if your highness knew my heart, you were.<lb/>
My lord the emperor, resolve me this:<lb/>
Was it well done of rash Virginius<lb/>
To slay his daughter with his own right hand,<lb/>
Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>It was, Andronicus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Your reason, mighty lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Because the girl should not survive her shame,<lb/>
And by her presence still renew his sorrows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;<lb/>
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,<lb/>
For me, most wretched, to perform the like.<lb/>
Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kills LAVINIA</stage></p>


<p>
And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.<lb/>
I am as woful as Virginius was,<lb/>
And have a thousand times more cause than he<lb/>
To do this outrage: and it now is done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Will't please you eat? will't please your<lb/>
highness feed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TAMORA</speaker>
<p>Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:<lb/>
They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;<lb/>
And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Go fetch them hither to us presently.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;<lb/>
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,<lb/>
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.<lb/>
'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kills TAMORA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SATURNINUS</speaker>
<p>Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Kills TITUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?<lb/>
There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS,	and others go up into the balcony</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,<lb/>
By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl<lb/>
Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,<lb/>
O, let me teach you how to knit again<lb/>
This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,<lb/>
These broken limbs again into one body;<lb/>
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,<lb/>
And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,<lb/>
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,<lb/>
Do shameful execution on herself.<lb/>
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,<lb/>
Grave witnesses of true experience,<lb/>
Cannot induce you to attend my words,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To LUCIUS</stage></p>


<p>
Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,<lb/>
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse<lb/>
To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear<lb/>
The story of that baleful burning night<lb/>
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,<lb/>
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,<lb/>
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in<lb/>
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.<lb/>
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;<lb/>
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,<lb/>
But floods of tears will drown my oratory,<lb/>
And break my utterance, even in the time<lb/>
When it should move you to attend me most,<lb/>
Lending your kind commiseration.<lb/>
Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;<lb/>
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,<lb/>
That cursed Chiron and Demetrius<lb/>
Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;<lb/>
And they it were that ravished our sister:<lb/>
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;<lb/>
Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd<lb/>
Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,<lb/>
And sent her enemies unto the grave.<lb/>
Lastly, myself unkindly banished,<lb/>
The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,<lb/>
To beg relief among Rome's enemies:<lb/>
Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.<lb/>
And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.<lb/>
I am the turned forth, be it known to you,<lb/>
That have preserved her welfare in my blood;<lb/>
And from her bosom took the enemy's point,<lb/>
Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.<lb/>
Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;<lb/>
My scars can witness, dumb although they are,<lb/>
That my report is just and full of truth.<lb/>
But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,<lb/>
Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;<lb/>
For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant</stage></p>


<p>
Of this was Tamora delivered;<lb/>
The issue of an irreligious Moor,<lb/>
Chief architect and plotter of these woes:<lb/>
The villain is alive in Titus' house,<lb/>
And as he is, to witness this is true.<lb/>
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge<lb/>
These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,<lb/>
Or more than any living man could bear.<lb/>
Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?<lb/>
Have we done aught amiss,&mdash;show us wherein,<lb/>
And, from the place where you behold us now,<lb/>
The poor remainder of Andronici<lb/>
Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.<lb/>
And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,<lb/>
And make a mutual closure of our house.<lb/>
Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,<lb/>
Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AEMILIUS</speaker>
<p>Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,<lb/>
And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,<lb/>
Lucius our emperor; for well I know<lb/>
The common voice do cry it shall be so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To Attendants</stage></p>


<p>
And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,<lb/>
To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,<lb/>
As punishment for his most wicked life.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Attendants</stage>



</p><p><stage>LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,<lb/>
To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!<lb/>
But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,<lb/>
For nature puts me to a heavy task:<lb/>
Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,<lb/>
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.<lb/>
O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kissing TITUS</stage></p>


<p>
These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,<lb/>
The last true duties of thy noble son!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARCUS ANDRONICUS</speaker>
<p>Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,<lb/>
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:<lb/>
O were the sum of these that I should pay<lb/>
Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us<lb/>
To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:<lb/>
Many a time he danced thee on his knee,<lb/>
Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:<lb/>
Many a matter hath he told to thee,<lb/>
Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;<lb/>
In that respect, then, like a loving child,<lb/>
Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,<lb/>
Because kind nature doth require it so:<lb/>
Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:<lb/>
Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;<lb/>
Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Young LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart<lb/>
Would I were dead, so you did live again!<lb/>
O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;<lb/>
My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Attendants with AARON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AEMILIUS</speaker>
<p>You sad Andronici, have done with woes:<lb/>
Give sentence on this execrable wretch,<lb/>
That hath been breeder of these dire events.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;<lb/>
There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;<lb/>
If any one relieves or pities him,<lb/>
For the offence he dies. This is our doom:<lb/>
Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AARON</speaker>
<p>O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?<lb/>
I am no baby, I, that with base prayers<lb/>
I should repent the evils I have done:<lb/>
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did<lb/>
Would I perform, if I might have my will;<lb/>
If one good deed in all my life I did,<lb/>
I do repent it from my very soul.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,<lb/>
And give him burial in his father's grave:<lb/>
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith<lb/>
Be closed in our household's monument.<lb/>
As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,<lb/>
No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,<lb/>
No mournful bell shall ring her burial;<lb/>
But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:<lb/>
Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;<lb/>
And, being so, shall have like want of pity.<lb/>
See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,<lb/>
By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:<lb/>
Then, afterwards, to order well the state,<lb/>
That like events may ne'er it ruinate.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>
