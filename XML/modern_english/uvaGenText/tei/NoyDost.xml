By G. R. Noyes.</head>

<div2 type="part" n="1" id="d4">

<p>
Fedor Dostoevski <ref target="n1.a">[*]</ref> was born in 1821 and died in 1881, so that he
was an exact contemporary of George Eliot (1820-1821).  During his
lifetime none of his writings seem to have been translated into English;
of the half-dozen books that were translated in the thirteen years
following his death, only his masterpiece, "Crime and Punishment," won
sufficient popular success to remain in print.  Dostoevski's power was
recognized by a few critics and persons of literary tastes, but he was
almost unknown to the general public.  Recently there has been a great
increase of interest in him, and writers who speak with real knowledge of
their topic have termed Dostoevski one of the two great masters of
Russian literature, far superior to Turgenev, and, to quote directly from
Mr. Baring, "a unique product, a more startling revelation and
embodiment of genius, a greater elemental force, than Tolstoy or any
other Russian writer of fiction."

</p><p>
This superlative praise has had at least one excellent result, if we
may regard it as the impulse to the new translation of Dostoevski by Mrs.
Garnett.  Mrs. Garnett's skill both in Russian and in English has steadily
increased, and no versions from the Russian deserve more unstinted
commendation than her rendering of Dostoevski: one may say that the
author loses nothing essential in her translation.  The numbers of
Everyman's Library that include writings not yet translated by her are
unfortunately of inferior workmanship.  The volume of Dostoevski's
letters is welcome in that it allows English readers to derive a direct
impression of his personality.  But one regrets that Miss Mayne has
translated at second-hand, from German and French; in this respect her
book is a reversion to the methods of a time that one fancied had passed
forever.
</p>

</div2>
<div2 type="part" n="2" id="d5">
<head>I.</head>

<p>
English enthusiasm for Dostoevski is in no small degree merely a
reflection of his increased popularity in his own country.  In Russia his
present fame may partly be accounted for by transitory, accidental
circumstances.  Dostoevski alone of the great Russian writers since the
time of Gogol was an ardent Russian patriot and a devoted admirer of the
Russian State Church.  His peculiar blend of chauvinism with mystical
religiosity has appealed to the imagination of Russians like
Merezhkovski, who believe that their country has a mysterious national
destiny, as the successor of Rome and Byzantium, and who look upon the
differing cosmopolitanisms of Turgenev and Tolstoy as each a proof of
indifference to the national cause.  Dostoevski is the greatest literary
figure of the Slavophile movement, which, particularly in these last years,
as a reaction from the revolutionary period of 1905-7, has become a
really potent force in Russian life, and is in part responsible for Russia's
share in the present war.

</p><p>
Again, Dostoevski is vague, cloudy, suggestive, symbolic, in
contrast to the crystal simplicity of Turgenev, the apparent
commonplaceness of Tolstoy's fiction, and the Biblical directness of
Tolstoy's religious writings.  He thus has something in common with
modern Russian writers as different as Morezhkovski and Andreev.  His
grewsomeness, his emphasis on suffering, horror, crime, and cruelty, are
once more features in which he anticipated contemporary writers.

</p><p>
These factors, however potent in Russia, certainly can have had
small effect in accomplishing Dostoevski's fame abroad.  What, then, are
the great qualities that Dostoevski's English admirers find in him?  One
above all others: he is, they allege, the most truly national Russian writer,
and his very nationality makes him a world writer; he reveals to the world
the mysterious Russian soul, while Turgenev and Tolstoy, confining
themselves to externals, show us a society that is not essentially different
from our own.  Now one must cheerfully admit that the men and women
whom one meets in "The Brothers Karamazov" are much more unlike our
personal acquaintances than are the heroes and heroines of "Fathers and
Children" or "Anna Karenin"; but to jump from this to the conclusion
that they are therefore more representative of the Russian nation is to
reason in a somewhat girlish fashion.

</p><p>
Of the three greatest Russian novelists of the mid-nineteenth
century, Dostoevski was by the external circumstances of his life the least
representative of the Russian people as a whole.  Russia was in his day
(and so it remains, with slight modification) a country of peasants and
landed proprietors; in 1897 the urban classes numbered only 13 per cent.
of the population.  Dostoevski, however, was a child of the city; born in
Moscow, he spent a comparatively small portion of his life in the
country.  City life dominates his books.  Not one of the prominent
characters in his novels is a peasant, or even of peasant origin; nearly all
of them, like the author himself, belong to the minor nobility.
Dostoevski did, however, have one chance to become intimately
acquainted with the plain people of his country; he spent more than three
years in a Siberian prison as a "political," along with murderers and
ruffians of all sorts.  When released, he proudly proclaimed: "I have
learned to know the Russian people as only a few know them.  I am a
little vain of it.  I hope that such vanity is pardonable."  One may question whether his education was not marked by undue specialization.

</p><p>
When discharged from prison, Dostoevski spent five years in the
army before, in 1859, he was allowed to return to Russia.  He promptly
resumed his trade of writer, and was henceforth dependent on his pen for
support.  Unpractical in his habits, at times a gambler, he suffered from
chronic poverty until the last years of his life.  It was his habit to receive
an advance from a periodical for a novel as yet unwritten, and then work
feverishly to discharge the debt.  He solicited money from a new
periodical, the <hi rend="italic">Zarya</hi>, while still under obligations to the
<hi rend="italic">Russki Viestnik</hi>.  Except perhaps during his closing years, he
seems never to have been in free, wholesome relations with his fellow-men.  Though he had warm friends, his personality was unattractive to
most men and women.  His life, like his works, was unhealthy and
abnormal.

</p><p>
A man of pre&euml;minently literary temperament, Dostoevski
read widely from his youth up in imaginative literature; his letters are full
of enthusiasm for such heterogeneous authors as Homer, Racine,
Corneille, Victor Hugo, Balzac, Sterne, Shakespeare, Scott, Dickens,
Schiller, Goethe, Hoffmann, George Sand, not to mention the writers of
his native country.  Of Kant and Hegel he knew something, though he
does not seem to have been strongly influenced by them.  In science,
despite his attendance at a school of engineering, he apparently had no
interest; scientific materialism and the socialism with which it was
associated in Russia he hated with his whole soul.  Though exiled for
membership in a socialistic circle, even in his youth he seems to have
condemned socialistic speculation as idle dreaming.  His momentary
opposition to the Government was mere indignation against
administrative abuses, from which he fully recovered during his period of
Siberian exile.  His thought in his later years was dominated by a blind,
unreasoning, patriotic enthusiasm for Russia and everything connected
with it; for the Slavophile trinity, autocracy, orthodoxy, and nationality.
His very religion was founded on patriotism; he apparently believed in
God and the Saviour because the Russian people believed in them.
While still in Siberia he rarely went to church, and could not endure
priests.  In his later years the Russian Church appeared to him
surrounded with a halo of sanctity; it was destined to reveal a new
religion to humanity.  Everything that came from the West he despised,
Catholicism as well as skepticism.  The Liberals as well as the Socialists
deserved the knout.  Practical, utilitarian knowledge might be borrowed
from the West, but the Russian soul must be preserved from
contamination.  Unlike Turgenev and Tolstoy, Dostoevski had
   <pb n="382"/>
no international sympathies; to understand his type of thought one must
temporarily lay aside one's attachment to European civilization.  And,
quite otherwise than with Tolstoy, the sacrifice is not in the name of any
general understandable ideals of universal love and toleration, but of a
faith in the mystic destiny of Russia.

</p><p>
Though he has been called the greatest of Russian realists,
Dostoevski is not, except for "The House of the Dead," in any ordinary
sense of the word, a realist at all.  His great novels, "Crime and
Punishment," "The Idiot," "The Possessed," "The Brothers Karamazov,"
are each primarily a series of conversations.  But these conversations are
often, or generally, such as could no more occur in actual life than could
those of "Comus" or "Paradise Lost."  The important characters are for
the most part criminals, epileptics, prostitutes, voluptuaries of various
types, mentally deranged persons of numerous and interesting ailments.
Murder is a central and controlling interest in each of these novels.  The
few normal, conventional persons who occur are uninteresting to a
degree.  Now, a novelist may be privileged to choose what material he
will for his work, but if he prefers to select no material from ordinary,
normal existence one may at least suspect a certain weakness in his
talent, one may doubt whether he deserves to be placed at the head of the
literature of any country.  One refuses to believe that such a writer is the
best revelation of the Russian soul.  To do so would be to draw up a
severe indictment against a great nation.
</p>

</div2>
<div2 type="part" n="3" id="d6">
<head>II.</head>

<p>What, then, are the qualities on account of which Dostoevski really
deserves fame?  First of all, he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a realist in one book.  In "The
House of the Dead" he has given a picture of life in his Siberian prison
that will always remain a great classic.  Here he is concrete, vivid,
truthful, in the same way as Tolstoy in his "Sevastopol."  Turgenev, who
was by temperament no admirer of Dostoevski, said truly that the
description of the bath was worthy of Dante.  Dozens of wretches, clad
only in chains, are crowded into the hot, steaming room; humanity at its
lowest terms, but still humanity vigorous, buoyant, and eager to be clean.
Quite as powerful, and more touching, is the account of the Christmas
theatricals, where the artistic sense of the convicts, cramped as it has
been by their life, at last finds expression.  The atmosphere is that of a
children's party, where bad boys forget their depravity in keen enjoyment
of funny charades.  Strangely enough, of all Dostoevski's writings this
book of the prison is the least harrowing to the reader's nerves.  Here he
does not draw his material from his diseased imagination, but describes
what he has actually seen and transfigures it by his sympathy.

</p><p>
And what of Dostoevski's works of fiction?  What qualities does he
show in them so preeminent [sic] that they compensate for his evident
shortcomings?  First of all, one may say, a wonderful command of
pathos, a boundless sympathy for suffering humanity; and in the second
place, a marvellous power of psychological analysis.  To these one may
add, with some reserves, a peculiar skill in literary construction.

</p><p>
Pathos is the central element in all Dostoevski's early work.  Few
more affecting stories have been written than "Poor Folk," the short novel
by which, at the age of twenty-four, Dostoevski suddenly became
famous.  A middle-aged government clerk, poor in brains as in pocket,
sacrifices himself to the support of a girl distantly related to him, with
whom he is secretly in love.  Pretty Varvara accepts his devotion with the
same spirit, and with the same fidelity, with which a kitten welcomes
caresses; and, when the opportunity offers, promptly marries a wealthy
suitor, moves away, and leaves her unprepossessing kinsman broken-hearted.  A similar pathos reappears by fits and starts in the later works,
above all in the description of poor and helpless children.  Almost at
random one may cite the scene in which little Polenka, in "Crime and
Punishment," kisses the murderer Raskolnikov, and promises to pray for
him all her life.  Occasionally, as with Dickens, this pathos passes into
downright sentimentality.  One may term the death of Ilusha, in "The
Brothers Karamazov," either sublime or ridiculous.

</p><p>
As time passed, Dostoevski's power of sympathy gradually yielded
to a quite different feeling, an absolute delight in the portrayal of
suffering, a triumphant teasing of his reader's nerves.  This he
accomplishes by the masterly exhibition of the feelings of the tortured
victims, and, quite as important, of the feelings of their skilled and
artistic torturers.  In "Crime and Punishment" Raskolnikov commits a
murder on page 72 and, aided by a talented detective, proceeds to
meditate on his crime for some 400 pages.  A reader follows the different
stages of his agony with keen intellectual interest rather than with mere
sympathy.  When Ivan Karamazov dilates on the tortures administered to
young children by certain degenerates, he emphasizes &mdash; and a reader, if
disgust allows him to meditate at all, is obliged to follow him &mdash; quite as
much the workings of the mind of the persecutor as the sufferings of the
victim.  No author arouses in his reader such poignant recollections of
their own "little, nameless, unremembered acts" of meanness and of
spite.  The Russian critic Mikhailovski well expresses the change in
Dostoevski's methods when he says that Dostoevski's subject is always a
wolf eating a lamb: in his earlier books he is more interested in the lamb
and in his later in the wolf.  In this portrayal of wolfish and lamblike
feelings Dostoevski's conversations are his chief tool.  They may be
compared to the soliloquies and asides in Shakespeare's dramas; in
themselves they are unreal and unbelievable, but as aids in the drawing of
character they are true works of art.

</p><p>
As a master of narrative, Dostoevski has received high praise,
which is justified if one considers only his best work.  A reader of
"Crime and Punishment" may be impelled to skip some tiresome piece of
mental analysis; fifty pages later he suddenly finds that he has missed an
essential point in the narrative, and is compelled to retrace his steps.  The
cunning master has wasted no words even when he seemed most
prodigal.  But no such praise can be given to "The Idiot" or "The
Possessed," where long blocks of rigmarole now serve no purpose &mdash;
once they helped Dostoevski draw pay from his publishers.  In "The
Brothers Karamazov" there are whole chapters of moralizing that have no
bearing on the story; critics who say that Dostoevski, unlike Tolstoy, is
not a preacher, simply ignore obvious facts.
</p>

</div2>
<div2 type="part" n="4" id="d7">
<head>III.</head>

<p>Dostoevski's preaching is composed of three main doctrines, one of
which enjoins infinite charity, all-embracing forgiveness, another
absolute submission to the existing order of things here on earth, and the
third a mystic salvation through suffering.  The greatest of these is
charity, which Dostoevski extends to all inmates of prisons, to say
nothing of persons who are on their way to alms-houses or insane
asylums, and which he refuses only to keen, enterprising, successful
persons who themselves lack this tolerantly all-human spirit that is the
greatest of virtues.  Charity in Dostoevski is apt to degenerate into
maudlin sentimentality that an American may misinterpret as
intentionally comic: witness the drunken harangue of Marmeladov near
the opening of "Crime and Punishment."  Dostoevski's doctrine of
submission arises from his faith in his native Russia, from his hatred of
socialistic rebels and Westernizing Liberals.  His submission is at the
other pole from Tolstoy's aggressive anarchistic doctrine of non-resistance to evil; for Dostoevski the state order is sacred, while for
Tolstoy it is a negligible trifle.  Dostoevski's insistence on suffering as a
means of moral regeneration was a comparatively late discovery; he gives
no suggestion of it before his exile, and in "The House of the Dead" he
confesses that among his fellow convicts he never detected any signs of
repentance.  Yet in "Crime and Punishment" (1866) the doctrine of
salvation through suffering suddenly appears in full vigor: Sonia, the
submissive, eternally miserable outcast, furnishes the religious
inspiration needed by Raskolnikov in order to cast out the mutinous and
rebellious spirit that has made him a murderer.  Sonia bids him take up
his cross, or, in plain language, confess his crime and submit to exile in
Siberia.  The same mystic faith in suffering again dominates "The
Brothers Karamazov," written just before the author's death; it may be
called his characteristic, individual doctrine.

</p><p>
One inquires how far in all this Dostoevski may really interpret the
Russian soul.  His all-embracing charity, one must agree, is a trait more
typical of the Russian temperament than of the Anglo-Saxon.  The
instinctive moral test applied by a Russian is apt to be kindness of heart,
while that of an Anglo-Saxon is self-command, self-restraint.  This
distinction naturally cannot be pushed
   <pb n="383"/>
to an extreme: kindness of heart and personal amiability are not frowned
on in England.  Shakespeare certainly shows no lack of appreciation and
sympathy for Falstaff, nor are Tom Jones and Clive Newcome quite
models of Philistine propriety.  But Shakespeare and Fielding and
Thackeray, after all, have in them something of the Lord Chief Justice,
who laughs at Falstaff's impudence while retaining a strong conviction of
the utility of human judgments; charity is good, but in the long run it is
best to have some standards of respectability and propriety.  In
Dostoevski, standards of propriety vanish: his ideal Russian, Prince
Myshkin (in "The Idiot"), behaves to good and bad with equal sympathy
and never thinks of judging another's conduct.  Tom Jones, after reaping
and burning his wild oats, will become a conventional English squire.
Alyosha (in "Injury and Insult") can never by any chance develop any
notions of self-restraint or moral responsibility, and just because of his
thoughtless, childish nature Dostoevski makes a high-minded girl
sacrifice herself to become his life companion.  Shakespeare wins our
sympathy for Macbeth by endowing that murderer with a poetic
imagination and by showing the conflict between his ambition and his
conscience; Dostoevski makes his murderer, Raskolnikov, win our regard
by his sentimental kindliness to children and beggars.  All this is an
exaggeration of Russian charity rather than a true representation of it.
Tolstoy, with his scorn of Philistine respectability, combined with a
burning faith in the categorical imperative, and Turgenev, with his gentle
kindliness, mixed with a certain admiration for the homespun virtues of
respectability and thrift, are the true representatives of the Russian
temperament.

</p><p>
If hardness of heart be Dostoevski's cardinal sin, rebellion against
Russia is for him the most serious act of criminality.  For the Russian
people love their Country, their Tsar, and their Church.  Any one who
revolts against the existing order thereby separates himself from the
Russian people and commits apostasy.  Such is the sin of the Socialists
and the Liberals.  An exhibition of the self-conceit, emptiness, futility,
and criminality of these rebels fills "The Possessed" and plays no small
part in other novels.  Whether Dostoevski was right or wrong in this
particular interpretation of the Russian soul is a question that time alone
can answer.  An outsider is loath to believe that the only true Russian is
the submissive Russian, and that all attempts to overthrow or modify the
rule of the Russian autocracy and the Russian Church are the work of
men possessed by unclean spirits.

</p><p>
The rebels against Russia are, however, not necessarily lost souls.
They may be redeemed and purified through suffering.  In this peculiar
exaltation of the value of suffering here on earth one may politely protest,
along with Mikhailovski, that Dostoevski does not represent truly the
Russian temperament, which is no more fond of suffering than any other.
In his doctrine of submission, Dostoevski may find support in millions of
Russian peasants who do not meditate, and in a party whose meditations
are not always free from interested motives; in this last doctrine he is
original and alone.  Other Russians have believed that man's true work
lies not in submitting to injustice and oppression, and in suffering
because of them, but in struggling manfully against them; in laboring for
the improvement of material Russian conditions rather than in
speculating vaporously about the destiny of Russia.  One may hope that
they, rather than the eccentric Dostoevski, are truly representative of the
Russian soul.

</p><p>
To conclude, Dostoevski is less typical of Russia than either
Tolstoy or Turgenev, or perhaps one may add, even than Gorki.  His
range is narrow, his types of character abnormal, his plots fantastic, his
methods of telling a story as far from realism as those of Victor Hugo.
Yet he is the greatest novelist of the world in some things.  No man, once
we come within his power, can hold our minds with more intense
interest.  No man can make us more fully understand the hidden springs
of human action under certain circumstances.  No man can make us so
completely forget the absurdity of a situation as we follow the minds of
the men who find themselves in that situation.  Dostoevski is a novelist
of special cases.  If one must characterize him in a single phrase, there is
none better than that discovered long ago by Vog&uuml;&eacute;, "the
Shakespeare of the madhouse."
