<head>MY KINSMAN, MAJOR MOLINEUX</head>

<p>AFTER the kings of Great Britain had assumed the right of
appointing
the colonial governors, the measures of the latter seldom met with
the
ready and generous approbation which had been paid to those of
their
predecessors, under the original charters. The people looked with
most
jealous scrutiny to the exercise of power which did not emanate
from
themselves, and they usually rewarded their rulers with slender
gratitude for the compliances by which, in softening their
instructions
from
beyond the sea, they had incurred the reprehension of those who
gave
them. The annals of Massachusetts Bay will inform us, that of six
governors in the space of about forty years from the surrender of
the
old
charter, under James II., two were imprisoned by a popular
insurrection; a third, as Hutchinson inclines to believe, was
driven from
the
province by the whizzing of a musket-ball; a fourth, in the opinion
of
the same historian, was hastened to his grave by continual
bickerings
with the House of Representatives; and the remaining two, as well
as
their successors, till the Revolution, were favored with few and
brief intervals of peaceful sway. The inferior members of the court
party,
in
times of high political excitement, led scarcely a more desirable
life.
These remarks may serve as a preface to the following adventures,
which chanced upon a summer night, not far from a hundred years
ago.
The reader, in order to avoid a long and dry detail of colonial
affairs, is
requested to dispense with an account of the train of circumstances
that
had caused much temporary inflammation of the popular mind.
</p><p>It was near nine o'clock of a moonlight evening, when a boat
crossed
the ferry with a single passenger, who had obtained his conveyance
at
that unusual hour by the promise of an extra fare. While he stood
on
the landing-place, searching in either pocket for the means of
fulfilling
his agreement, the ferryman lifted a lantern, by the aid of which,
and
the newly risen moon, he took a very accurate survey of the
stranger's
figure. He was a youth of barely eighteen years, evidently
country-bred,
and now, as it should seem, upon his first visit to town. He was
clad in
a coarse gray coat, well worn, but in excellent repair; his under
garments were durably constructed of leather, and fitted tight to
a
pair of
   <pb n="1210"/>
serviceable and well-shaped limbs; his stockings of blue yarn were
the
incontrovertible work of a mother or a sister; and on his head was
a
three-cornered hat, which in its better days had perhaps sheltered
the
graver brow of the lad's father. Under his left arm was a heavy
cudgel
formed of an oak sapling, and retaining a part of the hardened
root;
and his equipment was completed by a wallet, not so abundantly
stocked
as to incommode the vigorous shoulders on which it hung. Brown,
curly
hair, well-shaped features, and bright, cheerful eyes were nature's
gifts,
and worth all that art could have done for his adornment.
</p><p>The youth, one of whose names was Robin, finally drew from
his
pocket the half of a little province bill of five shillings, which,
in the
depreciation in that sort of currency, did but satisfy the
ferryman's demand, with the surplus of a sexangular piece of
parchment, valued
at
three pence. He then walked forward into the town, with as light a
step
as if his day's journey had not already exceeded thirty miles, and
with
as eager an eye as if he were entering London city, instead of the
little
metropolis of a New England colony. Before Robin had proceeded far,
however, it occurred to him that he knew not whither to direct his
steps;
so he paused, and looked up and down the narrow street,
scrutinizing the
small and mean wooden buildings that were scattered on either side.
</p><p>``This low hovel cannot be my kinsman's dwelling,'' thought
he, ``nor
yonder old house, where the moonlight enters at the broken
casement;
and truly I see none hereabouts that might be worthy of him. It
would
have been wise to inquire my way of the ferryman, and doubtless he
would have gone with me, and earned a shilling from the Major for
his
pains. But the next man I meet will do as well.''
</p><p>He resumed his walk, and was glad to perceive that the
street now
became wider, and the houses more respectable in their appearance.
He
soon discerned a figure moving on moderately in advance, and
hastened
his steps to overtake it. As Robin drew nigh, he saw that the
passenger
was a man in years, with a full periwig of gray hair, a
wide-skirted coat
of dark cloth, and silk stockings rolled above his knees. He
carried a
long and polished cane, which he struck down perpendicularly before
him at every step; and at regular intervals he uttered two
successive
hems, of a peculiarly solemn and sepulchral intonation. Having made
these observations, Robin laid hold of the skirt of the old man's
coat
just when the light from the open door and windows of a barber's
shop
fell upon both their figures.
</p><p>``Good evening to you, honored sir,'' said he, making a low
bow, and
still retaining his hold of the skirt. ``I pray you tell me
whereabouts is
the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux.''
</p><p>The youth's question was uttered very loudly; and one of the
barbers, whose razor was descending on a well-soaped chin, and
another
who was dressing a Ramillies wig, left their occupations, and came
to the
door. The citizen, in the mean time, turned a long-favored
countenance
upon Robin, and answered him in a tone of excessive anger and
annoyance. His two sepulchral hems, however, broke into the very
centre
of
   <pb n="1211"/>
his rebuke, with most singular effect, like a thought of the cold
grave
obtruding among wrathful passions.
</p><p>``Let go my garment, fellow! I tell you, I know not the man
you
speak of. What! I have authority, I have&mdash;hem, hem&mdash;authority; and
if
this be the respect you show for your betters, your feet shall be
brought
acquainted with the stocks by daylight, tomorrow morning!''
</p><p>Robin released the old man's skirt, and hastened away,
pursued by an
ill-mannered roar of laughter from the barber's shop. He was at
first
considerably surprised by the result of his question, but, being a
shrewd
youth, soon thought himself able to account for the mystery.
</p><p>``This is some country representative,'' was his conclusion,
``who has
never seen the inside of my kinsman's door, and lacks the breeding
to
answer a stranger civilly. The man is old, or verily&mdash;I might be
tempted
to turn back and smite him on the nose. Ah, Robin, Robin! even the
barber's boys laugh at you for choosing such a guide! You will be
wiser
in time, friend Robin.''
</p><p>He now became entangled in a succession of crooked and
narrow
streets, which crossed each other, and meandered at no great
distance
from the water-side. The smell of tar was obvious to his nostrils,
the
masts of vessels pierced the moonlight above the tops of the
buildings,
and the numerous signs, which Robin paused to read, informed him
that
he was near the centre of business. But the streets were empty, the
shops
were closed, and lights were visible only in the second stories of
a few
dwelling-houses. At length, on the corner of a narrow lane, through
which he was passing, he beheld the broad countenance of a British
hero
swinging before the door of an inn, whence proceeded the voices of
many
guests. The casement of one of the lower windows was thrown back,
and
a very thin curtain permitted Robin to distinguish a party at
supper,
round a well-furnished table. The fragrance of the good cheer
steamed
forth into the outer air, and the youth could not fail to recollect
that the
last remnant of his travelling stock of provision had yielded to
his morning appetite, and that noon had found and left him
dinnerless.
</p><p>``Oh, that a parchment three-penny might give me a right to
sit down
at yonder table!'' said Robin, with a sigh. ``But the Major will
make
me welcome to the best of his victuals; so I will even step boldly
in, and
inquire my way to his dwelling.''
</p><p>He entered the tavern, and was guided by the murmur of
voices and
the fumes of tobacco to the public-room. It was a long and low
apartment, with oaken walls, grown dark in the continual smoke, and
a
floor
which was thickly sanded, but of no immaculate purity. A number of
persons&mdash;the larger part of whom appeared to be mariners, or in
some
way connected with the sea&mdash;occupied the wooden benches, or
leather-bottomed chairs, conversing on various matters, and
occasionally
lending
their attention to some topic of general interest. Three or four
little
groups were draining as many bowls of punch, which the West India
trade had long since made a familiar drink in the colony. Others,
who
had the appearance of men who lived by regular and laborious
handicraft,
   <pb n="1212"/>
preferred the insulated bliss of an unshared potation, and
became
more taciturn under its influence. Nearly all, in short, evinced a
predilection for the Good Creature in some of its various shapes,
for
this is a
vice to which, as Fast Day sermons of a hundred years ago will
testify,
we have a long hereditary claim. The only guests to whom Robin's
sympathies inclined him were two or three sheepish countrymen, who
were
using the inn somewhat after the fashion of a Turkish caravansary;
they
had gotten themselves into the darkest corner of the room, and
heedless
of the Nicotian atmosphere, were supping on the bread of their own
ovens, and the bacon cured in their own chimney-smoke. But though
Robin felt a sort of brotherhood with these strangers, his eyes
were attracted from them to a person who stood near the door,
holding
whispered conversation with a group of ill-dressed associates. His
features
were separately striking almost to grotesqueness, and the whole
face left
a deep impression on the memory. The forehead bulged out into a
double prominence, with a vale between; the nose came boldly forth
in
an irregular curve, and its bridge was of more than a finger's
breadth;
the eyebrows were deep and shaggy, and the eyes glowed beneath them
like fire in a cave.
</p><p>While Robin deliberated of whom to inquire respecting his
kinsman's
dwelling, he was accosted by the innkeeper, a little man in a
stained
white apron, who had come to pay his professional welcome to the
stranger. Being in the second generation from a French Protestant,
he
seemed to have inherited the courtesy of his parent nation; but no
variety of circumstances was ever known to change his voice from
the
one
shrill note in which he now addressed Robin.
</p><p>``From the country, I presume, sir?'' said he, with a
profound bow.
``Beg leave to congratulate you on your arrival, and trust you
intend a
long stay with us. Fine town here, sir, beautiful buildings, and
much
that may interest a stranger. May I hope for the honor of your
commands in respect to supper?''
</p><p>``The man sees a family likeness! the rogue has guessed that
I am related to the Major!'' thought Robin, who had hitherto
experienced
little superfluous civility.
</p><p>All eyes were now turned on the country lad, standing at the
door, in
his worn three-cornered hat, gray coat, leather breeches, and blue
yarn
stockings, leaning on an oaken cudgel, and bearing a wallet on his
back.
</p><p>Robin replied to the courteous innkeeper, with such an
assumption
of confidence as befitted the Major's relative. ``My honest
friend,'' he
said, ``I shall make it a point to patronize your house on some
occasion,
when''&mdash;here he could not help lowering his voice&mdash;``when I may
have
more than a parchment three-pence in my pocket. My present
business,''
continued he, speaking with lofty confidence, ``is merely to
inquire my
way to the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux.''
</p><p>There was a sudden and general movement in the room, which
Robin
interpreted as expressing the eagerness of each individual to
become
his guide. But the innkeeper turned his eyes to a written paper on
the
   <pb n="1213"/>
wall, which he read, or seemed to read, with occasional recurrences
to
the young man's figure.
</p><p>``What have we here?'' said he, breaking his speech into
little dry fragments. `` `Left the house of the subscriber, bounden
servant,
Hezekiah
Mudge,&mdash;had on, when he went away, gray coat, leather breeches,
master's third-best hat. One pound currency reward to whosoever
shall
lodge
him in any jail of the providence.' Better trudge, boy; better
trudge!''
</p><p>Robin had begun to draw his hand towards the lighter end of
the oak
cudgel, but a strange hostility in every countenance induced him to
relinquish his purpose of breaking the courteous innkeeper's head.
As
he
turned to leave the room, he encountered a sneering glance from the
bold-featured personage whom he had before noticed; and no sooner
was
he beyond the door, than he heard a general laugh, in which the
innkeeper's voice might be distinguished, like the dropping of
small
stones
into a kettle.
</p><p>``Now, is it not strange,'' thought Robin, with his usual
shrewdness,&mdash;
``is it not strange that the confession of an empty pocket should
outweigh the name of my kinsman, Major Molineux? Oh, if I had one
of
those grinning rascals in the woods, where I and my oak sapling
grew up
together, I would teach him that my arm is heavy though my purse be
light!''
</p><p>On turning the corner of the narrow lane, Robin found
himself in a
spacious street, with an unbroken line of lofty houses on each
side, and a
steepled building at the upper end, whence the ringing of a bell
announced
the hour of nine. The light of the moon, and the lamps from the
numerous
shop-windows, discovered people promenading on the pavement, and
amongst them Robin had hoped to recognize his hitherto inscrutable
relative. The result of his former inquiries made him unwilling to
hazard
another, in a scene of such publicity, and he determined to walk
slowly and silently up the street, thrusting his face close to that
of
every
elderly gentleman, in search of the Major's lineaments. In his
progress,
Robin encountered many gay and gallant figures. Embroidered
garments
of showy colors, enormous periwigs, gold-laced hats, and
silver-hilted
swords glided past him and dazzled his optics. Travelled youths,
imitators of the European fine gentlemen of the period, trod
jauntily
along, half dancing to the fashionable tunes which they hummed, and
making poor Robin ashamed of his quiet and natural gait. At length,
after many pauses to examine the gorgeous display of goods in the
shop-windows, and after suffering some rebukes for the impertinence
of
his scrutiny into people's faces, the Major's kinsman found himself
near
the steepled building, still unsuccessful in his search. As yet,
however,
he had seen only one side of the thronged street; so Robin crossed,
and continued the same sort of inquisition down the opposite
pavement,
with stronger hopes than the philosopher seeking an honest man, but
with no better fortune. He had arrived about midway towards the
lower
end, from which his course began, when he overheard the approach of
   <pb n="1214"/>
some one who struck down a cane on the flag-stones at every step,
uttering at regular intervals, two sepulchral hems.
</p><p>``Mercy on us!'' quoth Robin, recognizing the sound.
</p><p>Turning a corner, which chanced to be close at his right
hand, he
hastened to pursue his researches in some other part of the town.
His
patience now was wearing low, and he seemed to feel more fatigue
from
his rambles since he crossed the ferry, than from his journey of
several
days on the other side. Hunger also pleaded loudly within him, and
Robin began to balance the propriety of demanding, violently, and
with lifted cudgel, the necessary guidance from the first solitary
passenger whom he should meet. While a resolution to this effect
was
gaining
strength, he entered a street of mean appearance, on either side of
which
a row of ill-built houses was straggling towards the harbor. The
moonlight fell upon no passenger along the whole extent, but in the
third
domicile which Robin passed there was a half-opened door, and his
keen glance detected a woman's garment within.
</p><p>``My luck may be better here,'' said he to himself.
</p><p>Accordingly, he approached the doors and beheld it shut
closer as he
did so; yet an open space remained, sufficing for the fair occupant
to
observe the stranger, without a corresponding display on her part.
All
that Robin could discern was a strip of scarlet petticoat, and the
occasional sparkle of an eye, as if the moonbeams were trembling on
some
bright thing.
</p><p>``Pretty mistress,'' for I may call her so with a good
conscience
thought the shrewd youth, since I know nothing to the
contrary,&mdash;``my
sweet pretty mistress, will you be kind enough to tell me
whereabouts
I must seek the dwelling of my kinsman, Major Molineux?''
</p><p>Robin's voice was plaintive and winning, and the female,
seeing
nothing to be shunned in the handsome country youth, thrust open
the
door, and came forth into the moonlight. She was a dainty little
figure
with a white neck, round arms, and a slender waist, at the
extremity of
which her scarlet petticoat jutted out over a hoop, as if she were
standing
in a balloon. Moreover, her face was oval and pretty, her hair dark
beneath the little cap, and her bright eyes possessed a sly
freedom,
which
triumphed over those of Robin.
</p><p>``Major Molineux dwells here,'' said this fair woman.
</p><p>Now, her voice was the sweetest Robin had heard that night,
yet he
could not help doubting whether that sweet voice spoke Gospel
truth.
He looked up and down the mean street, and then surveyed the house
before which they stood. It was a small, dark edifice of two
stories, the
second of which projected over the lower floor, and the front
apartment
had the aspect of a shop for petty commodities.
</p><p>``Now, truly, I am in luck,'' replied Robin, cunningly,
``and so indeed
is my kinsman, the Major, in having so pretty a housekeeper. But I
prithee trouble him to step to the door; I will deliver him a
message
from his friends in the country, and then go back to my lodgings at
the
inn.''
   <pb n="1215"/>
</p><p>``Nay, the Major has been abed this hour or more,'' said the
lady of
the scarlet petticoat; ``and it would be to little purpose to
disturb him
to-night, seeing his evening draught was of the strongest. But he
is a
kind-hearted man, and it would be as much as my life's worth to let
a
kinsman of his turn away from the door. You are the good old
gentleman's
very picture, and I could swear that was his rainy-weather hat.
Also he
has garments very much resembling those leather small-clothes. But
come in, I pray, for I bid you hearty welcome in his name.
</p><p>So saying, the fair and hospitable dame took our hero by the
hand;
and the touch was light, and the force was gentleness, and though
Robin
read in her eyes what he did not hear in her words, yet the
slender-waisted woman in the scarlet petticoat proved stronger than
the athletic
country youth. She had drawn his half-willing footsteps nearly to
the
threshold, when the opening of a door in the neighborhood startled
the
Major's
housekeeper, and, leaving the Major's kinsman, she vanished
speedily
into her own domicile. A heavy yawn preceded the appearance of a
man,
who, like the Moonshine of Pyramus and Thisbe, carried a lantern,
needlessly aiding his sister luminary in the heavens. As he walked
sleepily
up the street, he turned his broad, dull face on Robin, and
displayed a
long staff, spiked at the end.
</p><p>``Home, vagabond, home!'' said the watchman, in accents that
seemed
to fall asleep as soon as they were uttered. ``Home, or we'll set
you in the
stocks by peep of day!''
</p><p>``This is the second hint of the kind,'' thought Robin. ``I
wish they
would end my difficulties, by setting me there to-night.''
</p><p>Nevertheless, the youth felt an instinctive antipathy
towards the guardian of midnight order, which at first prevented
him from asking his
usual question. But just when the man was about to vanish behind
the
corner, Robin resolved not to lose the opportunity, and shouted
lustily
after him,&mdash;
</p><p>``I say, friend! will you guide me to the house of my
kinsman, Major
Molineux?''
</p><p>The watchman made no reply, but turned the corner and was
gone;
yet Robin seemed to hear the sound of drowsy laughter stealing
along
the solitary street. At that moment, also, a pleasant titter
saluted him
from the open window above his head; he looked up, and caught the
sparkle of a saucy eye; a round arm beckoned to him, and next he
heard
light footsteps descending the staircase within. But Robin, being
of
the household of a New England clergyman, was a good youth, as well
as a shrewd one; so he resisted temptation, and fled away.
</p><p>He now roamed desperately, and at random, through the town,
almost
ready to believe that a spell was on him, like that by which a
wizard of
his country had once kept three pursuers wandering, a whole winter
night, within twenty paces of the cottage which they sought. The
streets
lay before him, strange and desolate, and the lights were
extinguished
in almost every house. Twice, however, little parties of men, among
whom Robin distinguished individuals in outlandish attire, came
hurrying
   <pb n="1216"/>
along; but, though on both occasions, they paused to address
him
such intercourse did not at all enlighten his perplexity. They did
but utter
a few words in some language of which Robin knew nothing, and
perceiving his inability to answer, bestowed a curse upon him in
plain
English and hastened away. Finally, the lad determined to knock at
the
door of every mansion that might appear worthy to be occupied by
his
kinsman, trusting that perseverance would overcome the fatality
that
had hitherto thwarted him. Firm in this resolve, he was passing
beneath
the walls of a church, which formed the corner of two streets,
when, as
he turned into the shade of its steeple, he encountered a bulky
stranger
muffled in a cloak. The man was proceeding with the speed of
earnest
business, but Robin planted himself full before him, holding the
oak
cudgel with both hands across his body as a bar to further passage
</p><p>``Halt, honest man, and answer me a question,'' said he,
very resolutely
Tell me, this instant, whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman,
Major
Molineux!''
</p><p>``Keep your tongue between your teeth, fool, and let me
pass!'' said a
deep, gruff voice, which Robin partly remembered. ``Let me pass, or
I'll
strike you to the earth!''
</p><p>``No, no, neighbor!'' cried Robin, flourishing his cudgel,
and then
thrusting its larger end close to the man's muffled face. ``No, no,
I'm not
the fool you take me for, nor do you pass till I have an answer to
my
question. Whereabouts is the dwelling of my kinsman, Major
Molineux?''
The stranger, instead of attempting to force his passage, stepped
back
into the moonlight, unmuffled his face, and stared full into that
of Robin.
</p><p>``Watch here an hour, and Major Molineux will pass by,''
said he.
</p><p>Robin gazed with dismay and astonishment on the
unprecedented
physiognomy of the speaker. The forehead with its double prominence
the broad hooked nose, the shaggy eyebrows, and fiery eyes were
those
which he had noticed at the inn, but the man's complexion had
undergone a singular, or, more properly, a twofold change. One side
of
the
face blazed an intense red, while the other was black as midnight,
the
division line being in the broad bridge of the nose; and a mouth
which
seemed to extend from ear to ear was black or red, in contrast to
the
color of the cheek. The effect was as if two individual devils, a
fiend of
fire and a fiend of darkness, had united themselves to form this
infernal
visage. The stranger grinned in Robin's face, muffled his
party-colored
features, and was out of sight in a moment.
</p><p>``Strange things we travellers see!'' ejaculated Robin.
</p><p>He seated himself, however, upon the steps of the
church-door, resolving to wait the appointed time for his kinsman.
A few moments were
consumed in philosophical speculations upon the species of man who
had just left him; but having settled this point shrewdly,
rationally, and
satisfactorily, he was compelled to look elsewhere for his
amusement.
And first he threw his eyes along the street. It was of more
respectable
appearance than most of those into which he had wandered, and the
moon, creating, like the imaginative power, a beautiful strangeness
in
   <pb n="1217"/>
familiar objects, gave something of romance to a scene that might
not
have possessed it in the light of day. The irregular and often
quaint architecture of the houses, some of whose roofs were broken
into
numerous
little peaks, while others ascended, steep and narrow, into a
single point,
and others again were square; the pure snow-white of some of their
complexions, the aged darkness of others, and the thousand
sparklings,
reflected from bright substances in the walls of many; these
matters
engaged Robin's attention for a while, and then began to grow
wearisome.
Next he endeavored to define the forms of distant objects, starting
away,
with almost ghostly indistinctness, just as his eye appeared to
grasp
them, and finally he took a minute survey of an edifice which stood
on
the opposite side of the street, directly in front of the
church-door, where
he was stationed. It was a large, square mansion, distinguished
from its
neighbors by a balcony, which rested on tall pillars, and by an
elaborate
Gothic window, communicating therewith.
</p><p>``Perhaps this is the very house I have been seeking,''
thought Robin.
</p><p>Then he strove to speed away the time, by listening to a
murmur which
swept continually along the street, yet was scarcely audible,
except to an
unaccustomed ear like his; it was a low, dull, dreamy sound,
compounded
of many noises, each of which was at too great a distance to be
separately
heard. Robin marvelled at this snore of a sleeping town, and
marvelled
more whenever its continuity was broken by now and then a distant
shout, apparently loud where it originated. But altogether it was
a sleep-inspiring sound, and, to shake off its drowsy influence,
Robin
arose, and
climbed a window-frame, that he might view the interior of the
church.
There the moonbeams came trembling in, and fell down upon the
deserted pews, and extended along the quiet aisles. A fainter yet
more awful radiance was hovering around the pulpit, and one
solitary ray
had
dared to rest upon the open page of the great Bible. Had nature, in
that
deep hour, become a worshipper in the house which man had builded?
Or was that heavenly light the visible sanctity of the
place,&mdash;visible because no earthly and impure feet were within the
walls? The scene
made
Robin's heart shiver with a sensation of loneliness stronger than
he had
ever felt in the remotest depths of his native woods; so he turned
away
and sat down again before the door. There were graves around the
church, and now an uneasy thought obtruded into Robin's breast.
What
if the object of his search, which had been so often and so
strangely
thwarted, were all the time mouldering in his shroud? What if his
kinsman should glide through yonder gate, and nod and smile to him
in
dimly
passing by?
</p><p>``Oh that any breathing thing were here with me!'' said
Robin.
</p><p>Recalling his thoughts from this uncomfortable track, he
sent them
over forest, hill, and stream, and attempted to imagine how that
evening
of ambiguity and weariness had been spent by his father's
household. He
pictured them assembled at the door, beneath the tree, the great
old
tree, which had been spared for its huge twisted trunk and
venerable
shade, when a thousand leafy brethren fell. There, at the going
down of
   <pb n="1218"/>
the summer sun, it was his father's custom to perform domestic
worship
that the neighbors might come and join with him like brothers of
the
family, and that the wayfaring man might pause to drink at that
fountain, and keep his heart pure by freshening the memory of home.
Robin
distinguished the seat of every individual of the little audience;
he saw
the good man in the midst, holding the Scriptures in the golden
light that
fell from the western clouds; he beheld him close the book and all
rise up
to pray. He heard the old thanksgivings for daily mercies, the old
supplications for their continuance to which he had so often
listened
in
weariness, but which were now among his dear remembrances. He
perceived the slight inequality of his father's voice when he came
to
speak
of the absent one; he noted how his mother turned her face to the
broad
and knotted trunk; how his elder brother scorned, because the beard
was
rough upon his upper lip; to permit his features to be moved; how
the
younger sister drew down a low hanging branch before her eyes; and
how the little one of all, whose sports had hitherto broken the
decorum
of the scene, understood the prayer for her playmate, and burst
into
clamorous grief. Then he saw them go in at the door; and when Robin
would have entered also, the latch tinkled into its place, and he
was excluded from his home.
</p><p>``Am I here, or there?'' cried Robin, starting; for all at
once, when his
thoughts had become visible and audible in a dream, the long, wide,
solitary street shone out before him.
</p><p>He aroused himself, and endeavored to fix his attention
steadily upon
the large edifice which he had surveyed before. But still his mind
kept
vibrating between fancy and reality; by turns, the pillars of the
balcony
lengthened into the tall, bare stems of pines, dwindled down to
human
figures, settled again into their true shape and size, and then
commenced
a new succession of changes. For a single moment, when he deemed
himself awake, he could have sworn that a visage&mdash;one which he
seemed
to
remember, yet could not absolutely name as his kinsman's&mdash;was
looking
towards him from the Gothic window. A deeper sleep wrestled with
and
nearly overcame him, but fled at the sound of footsteps along the
opposite pavement. Robin rubbed his eyes, discerned a man passing
at
the
foot of the balcony, and addressed him in a loud, peevish, and
lamentable
cry.
</p><p>``Hallo, friend! must I wait here all night for my kinsman,
Major
Molineux?''
</p><p>The sleeping echoes awoke, and answered the voice; and the
passenger, barely able to discern a figure sitting in the oblique
shade
of the
steeple, traversed the street to obtain a nearer view. He was
himself a
gentleman in his prime, of open, intelligent, cheerful, and
altogether pre-possessing countenance. Perceiving a country youth,
apparently
homeless
and without friends, he accosted him in a tone of real kindness,
which
had become strange to Robin's ears.
</p><p>``Well, my good lad, why are you sitting here?'' inquired
he. ``Can I be
of service to you in any way?''
   <pb n="1219"/>
</p><p>``I am afraid not, sir,'' replied Robin, despondingly; ``yet
I shall take
it kindly, if you'll answer me a single question. I've been
searching, half
the night, for one Major Molineux, now, sir, is there really such
a person
in these parts, or am I dreaming?''
</p><p>``Major Molineux! The name is not altogether strange to
me,'' said the
gentleman, smiling. ``Have you any objection to telling me the
nature of
your business with him?''
</p><p>Then Robin briefly related that his father was a clergyman,
settled on
a small salary, at a long distance back in the country, and that he
and
Major Molineux were brothers' children. The Major, having inherited
riches, and acquired civil and military rank, had visited his
cousin, in
great pomp, a year or two before; had manifested much interest in
Robin
and an elder brother, and, being childless himself, had thrown out
hints
respecting the future establishment of one of them in life. The
elder
brother was destined to succeed to the farm which his father
cultivated in
the interval of sacred duties; it was therefore determined that
Robin
should profit by his kinsman's generous intentions, especially as
he
seemed to be rather the favorite, and was thought to possess other
necessary endowments.
</p><p>``For I have the name of being a shrewd youth,'' observed
Robin, in
this part of his story.
</p><p>``I doubt not you deserve it,'' replied his new friend,
good-naturedly;
``but pray proceed.''
</p><p>``Well, sir, being nearly eighteen years old, and well
grown, as you
see,'' continued Robin, drawing himself up to his full height, ``I
thought
it high time to begin in the world. So my mother and sister put me
in
handsome trim, and my father gave me half the remnant of his last
year's
salary, and five days ago I started for this place, to pay the
Major a visit.
But, would you believe it, sir! I crossed the ferry a little after
dark, and
have yet found nobody that would show me the way to his dwelling;
only, an hour or two since, I was told to wait here, and Major
Molineux
would pass by.''
</p><p>``Can you describe the man who told you this?'' inquired the
gentleman.
</p><p>``Oh, he was a very ill-favored fellow, sir,'' replied
Robin, ``with two
great bumps on his forehead, a hook nose, fiery eyes; and, what
struck
me as the strangest, his face was of two different colors. Do you
happen
to know such a man, sir?''
</p><p>``Not intimately,'' answered the stranger, ``but I chanced
to meet him
a little time previous to your stopping me. I believe you may trust
his
word, and that the Major will very shortly pass through this
street. In
the mean time, as I have a singular curiosity to witness your
meeting, I
will sit down here upon the steps and bear you company.''
</p><p>He seated himself accordingly, and soon engaged his
companion in animated discourse. It was but of brief continuance,
however, for a
noise of
shouting, which had long been remotely audible, drew so much nearer
that Robin inquired its cause.
   <pb n="1220"/>
</p><p>``What may be the meaning of this uproar?'' asked he.
``Truly, if your
town be always as noisy, I shall find little sleep while I am an
inhabitant.''
</p><p>``Why, indeed, friend Robin, there do appear to be three or
four riotous fellows abroad to-night,'' replied the gentleman.
``You must
not expect all the stillness of your native woods here in our
streets.
But the
watch will shortly be at the heels of these lads and''&mdash;
</p><p>``Ay, and set them in the stocks by peep of day,''
interrupted Robin
recollecting his own encounter with the drowsy lantern-bearer.
``But, dear
sir, if I may trust my ears, an army of watchmen would never make
head
against such a multitude of rioters. There were at least a thousand
voices
went up to make that one shout.''
</p><p>``May not a man have several voices, Robin, as well as two
complexions? said his friend.
</p><p>``Perhaps a man may; but Heaven forbid that a woman
should!'' responded the shrewd youth, thinking of the seductive
tones of the
Major's
housekeeper.
</p><p>The sounds of a trumpet in some neighboring street now
became so evident and continual, that Robin's curiosity was
strongly excited.
In addition to the shouts, he heard frequent bursts from many
instruments
of
discord, and a wild and confused laughter filled up the intervals.
Robin
rose from the steps, and looked wistfully towards a point whither
people
seemed to be hastening
</p><p>``Surely some prodigious merry-making is going on,''
exclaimed he ``I
have laughed very little since I left home, sir, and should be
sorry to lose
an opportunity. Shall we step round the corner by that darkish
house
and take our share of the fun?''
</p><p>``Sit down again, sit down, good Robin,'' replied the
gentleman, laying
his hand on the skirt of the gray coat. ``You forget that we must
wait here
for your kinsman; and there is reason to believe that he will pass
by, in
the course of a very few moments.''
</p><p>The near approach of the uproar had now disturbed the
neighborhood; windows flew open on all sides; and many heads, in
the attire of
the pillow, and confused by sleep suddenly broken, were protruded
to the
gaze
of whoever had leisure to observe them. Eager voices hailed each
other
from house to house, all demanding the explanation, which not a
soul
could give. Half-dressed men hurried towards the unknown commotion
stumbling as they went over the stone steps that thrust themselves
into
the narrow foot-walk. The shouts, the laughter, and the tuneless
bray
the antipodes of music, came onwards with increasing din, till
scattered
individuals, and then denser bodies, began to appear round a corner
at
the distance of a hundred yards
</p><p>``Will you recognize your kinsman, if he passes in this
crowd?'' inquired the gentleman
</p><p>``Indeed, I can't warrant it, sir; but I'll take my stand
here, and keep
a bright lookout,'' answered Robin, descending to the outer edge of
the
   <pb n="1221"/>
</p><p>A mighty stream of people now emptied into the street, and
came rollmg slowly towards the church. A single horseman wheeled
the corner
in
the midst of them, and close behind him came a band of fearful
wind-instruments, sending forth a fresher discord now that no
intervening
buildings kept it from the ear. Then a redder light disturbed the
moonbeams, and a dense multitude of torches shone along the street,
concealing, by their glare, whatever object they illuminated. The
single
horseman, clad in a military dress, and bearing a drawn sword, rode
onward
as the leader, and, by his fierce and variegated countenance,
appeared
like war personified; the red of one cheek was an emblem of fire
and
sword; the blackness of the other betokened the mourning that
attends
them. In his train were wild figures in the Indian dress, and many
fantastic shapes without a model, giving the whole march a
visionary
air, as
if a dream had broken forth from some feverish brain, and were
sweeping visibly through the midnight streets. A mass of people,
inactive, except as applauding spectators, hemmed the procession
in; and
several
women ran along the sidewalk, piercing the confusion of heavier
sounds
with their shrill voices of mirth or terror.
</p><p>``The double-faced fellow has his eye upon me,'' muttered
Robin, with
an indefinite but an uncomfortable idea that he was himself to bear
a
part in the pageantry.
</p><p>The leader turned himself in the saddle, and fixed his
glance full upon
the country youth, as the steed went slowly by. When Robin had
freed
his eyes from those fiery ones, the musicians were passing before
him,
and the torches were close at hand; but the unsteady brightness of
the
latter formed a veil which he could not penetrate. The rattling of
wheels
over the stones sometimes found its way to his ear, and confused
traces
of a human form appeared at intervals, and then melted into the
vivid
light. A moment more, and the leader thundered a command to halt:
the
trumpets vomited a horrid breath, and then held their peace; the
shouts
and laughter of the people died away, and there remained only a
universal hum, allied to silence. Right before Robin's eyes was an
uncovered
cart. There the torches blazed the brightest, there the moon shone
out
like day, and there, in tar-and-feathery dignity, sat his kinsman,
Major
Molineux!
</p><p>He was an elderly man, of large and majestic person, and
strong,
square features, betokening a steady soul; but steady as it was,
his enemies had found means to shake it. His face was pale as
death, and
far
more ghastly; the broad forehead was contracted in his agony, so
that
his eyebrows formed one grizzled line; his eyes were red and wild,
and
the foam hung white upon his quivering lip. His whole frame was
agitated by a quick and continual tremor, which his pride strove to
quell,
even in those circumstances of overwhelming humiliation. But
perhaps
the bitterest pang of all was when his eyes met those of Robin; for
he
evidently knew him on the instant, as the youth stood witnessing
the foul
disgrace of a head grown gray in honor. They stared at each other
in
silence, and Robin's knees shook, and his hair bristled, with a
mixture of
   <pb n="1222"/>
pity and terror. Soon, however, a bewildering excitement began to
seize
upon his mind; the preceding adventures of the night, the
unexpected
appearance of the crowd, the torches, the confused din and the hush
that
followed, the spectre of his kinsman reviled by that great
multitude,&mdash;all this, and, more than all, a perception of
tremendous ridicule
in the
whole scene, affected him with a sort of mental inebriety. At that
moment
a voice of sluggish merriment saluted Robin's ears; he turned
instinctively, and just behind the corner of the church stood the
lantern-bearer,
rubbing his eyes, and drowsily enjoying the lad's amazement. Then
he
heard a peal of laughter like the ringing of silvery bells; a woman
twitched his arm, a saucy eye met his, and he saw the lady of the
scarlet petticoat. A sharp, dry cachinnation appealed to his
memory,
and,
standing on tiptoe in the crowd, with his white apron over his
head, he
beheld the courteous little innkeeper. And lastly, there sailed
over the
heads of the multitude a great, broad laugh, broken in the midst by
two
sepulchral hems; thus, ``Haw, haw, haw,&mdash;hem, hem,&mdash;haw, haw, haw,
haw!''
</p><p>The sound proceeded from the balcony of the opposite
edifice, and
thither Robin turned his eyes. In front of the Gothic window stood
the
old citizen, wrapped in a wide gown, his gray periwig exchanged for
a
nightcap, which was thrust back from his forehead, and his silk
stockings
hanging about his legs. He supported himself on his polished cane
in a fit
of convulsive merriment, which manifested itself on his solemn old
features like a funny inscription on a tombstone. Then Robin seemed
to
hear
the voices of the barbers, of the guests of the inn, and of all who
had
made sport of him that night. The contagion was spreading among the
multitude, when all at once, it seized upon Robin, and he sent
forth a
shout of laughter that echoed through the street,&mdash;every man shook
his
sides, every man emptied his lungs, but Robin's shout was the
loudest
there. The cloud-spirits peeped from their silvery islands, as the
congregated mirth went roaring up the sky! The Man in the Moon
heard the
far bellow. ``Oho,'' quoth he, ``the old earth is frolicsome
to-night!''
</p><p>When there was a momentary calm in that tempestuous sea of
sound,
the leader gave the sign, the procession resumed its march. On they
went,
like fiends that throng in mockery around some dead potentate,
mighty
no more, but majestic still in his agony. On they went, in
counterfeited
pomp, in senseless uproar, in frenzied merriment, trampling all on
an old
man's heart. On swept the tumult, and left a silent street behind.

</p><p>       .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .
</p><p>``Well, Robin, are you dreaming?'' inquired the gentleman,
laying his
hand on the youth's shoulder.
</p><p>Robin started, and withdrew his arm from the stone post to
which he
had instinctively clung, as the living stream rolled by him. His
cheek was
somewhat pale, and his eye not quite as lively as in the earlier
part of the
evening.
   <pb n="1223"/>
</p><p>``Will you be kind enough to show me the way to the ferry?''
said he,
after a moment's pause.
</p><p>``You have, then, adopted a new subject of inquiry?''
observed his
companion, with a smile.
</p><p>``Why, yes, sir,'' replied Robin, rather dryly. ``Thanks to
you, and to
my other friends, I have at last met my kinsman, and he will scarce
desire to see my face again. I begin to grow weary of a town life,
sir. Will
you show me the way to the ferry?''
</p><p>``No, my good friend Robin,&mdash;not to-night, at least,'' said
the gentleman. ``Some few days hence, if you wish it, I will speed
you on
your journey. Or, if you prefer to remain with us, perhaps, as you
are a
shrewd
youth, you may rise in the world without the help of your kinsman,
Major Molineux.''</p>
