<head type="main"> THE LAND OF RED APPLES.</head>
 
<p>THERE were eight in our party of bronzed children who were 
going East with the missionaries.  Among us were three young 
braves, two tall girls, and we three little ones, Judewin, Thowin, 
and I. 
</p><p>We had been very impatient to start on our journey to the Red 
Apple Country, which, we were told, lay a little beyond the great 
circular horizon of the Western prairie.  Under a sky of rosy 
apples we dreamt of roaming as freely and happily as we had chased 
the cloud shadows on the Dakota plains.  We had anticipated much 
pleasure from a ride on the iron horse, but the throngs of staring 
palefaces disturbed and troubled us. 
</p><p>On the train, fair women, with tottering babies on each arm, 
stopped their haste and scrutinized the children of absent mothers.  
Large men, with heavy bundles in their hands, halted near by, and 
riveted their glassy blue eyes upon us. 
</p><p>I sank deep into the corner of my seat, for I resented being 
watched.  Directly in front of me, children who were no larger than 
I hung themselves upon the backs of their seats, with their bold 
white faces toward me.  Sometimes they took their forefingers out 
of their mouths and pointed at my moccasined feet.  Their mothers, 
instead of reproving such rude curiosity, looked closely at me, and 
attracted their children's further notice to my blanket.  This 
embarrassed me, and kept me constantly on the verge of tears. 
</p><p>I sat perfectly still, with my eyes downcast, daring only now 
and then to shoot long glances around me.  Chancing to turn to the 
window at my side, I was quite breathless upon seeing one familiar 
object.  It was the telegraph pole which strode by at short paces.  
Very near my mother's dwelling, along the edge of a road thickly 
bordered with wild sunflowers, some poles like these had been 
planted by white men.  Often I had stopped, on my way down the 
road, to hold my ear against the pole, and, hearing its low 
moaning, I used to wonder what the paleface had done to hurt it.  
Now I sat watching for each pole that glided by to be the last one. 
</p><p>In this way I had forgotten my uncomfortable surroundings, 
when I heard one of my comrades call out my name.  I saw the 
missionary standing very near, tossing candies and gums into our 
midst.  This amused us all, and we tried to see who could catch the 
most of the sweetmeats.  The missionary's generous distribution of 
candies was impressed upon my memory by a disastrous result which 
followed.  I had caught more than my share of candies and gums, and 
soon after our arrival at the school I had a chance to disgrace 
myself, which, I am ashamed to say, I did. 
</p><p>Though we rode several days inside of the iron horse, I do not 
recall a single thing about our luncheons. 
</p><p>It was night when we reached the school grounds.  The lights 
from the windows of the large buildings fell upon some of the 
icicled trees that stood beneath them.  We were led toward an open 
door, where the brightness of the lights within flooded out over 
the heads of the excited palefaces who blocked the way.  My body 
trembled more from fear than from the snow I trod upon. 
</p><p>Entering the house, I stood close against the wall.  The 
strong glaring light in the large whitewashed room dazzled my eyes.  
The noisy hurrying of hard shoes upon a bare wooden floor <pb n="186"/>  
increased the whirring in my ears.  My only safety seemed to be in 
keeping next to the wall.  As I was wondering in which direction to 
escape from all this confusion, two warm hands grasped me firmly, 
and in the same moment I was tossed high in midair.  A rosy-cheeked 
paleface woman caught me in her arms.  I was both frightened and 
insulted by such trifling.  I stared into her eyes, wishing her to 
let me stand on my own feet, but she jumped me up and down with 
increasing enthusiasm.  My mother had never made a plaything of her 
wee daughter.  Remembering this I began to cry aloud. 
</p><p>They misunderstood the cause of my tears, and placed me at a 
white table loaded with food.  There our party were united again.  
As I did not hush my crying, one of the older ones whispered to me, 
"Wait until you are alone in the night." 
</p><p>It was very little I could swallow besides my sobs, that 
evening. 
</p><p>"Oh, I want my mother and my brother Dawee!  I want to go to 
my aunt!" I pleaded; but the ears of the palefaces could not hear 
me. 
</p><p>From the table we were taken along an upward incline of wooden 
boxes, which I learned afterward to call a stairway.  At the top 
was a quiet hall, dimly lighted.  Many narrow beds were in one 
straight line down the entire length of the wall.  In them lay 
sleeping brown faces, which peeped just out of the coverings.  I 
was tucked into bed with one of the tall girls, because she talked 
to me in my mother tongue and seemed to soothe me. 
</p><p>I had arrived in the wonderful land of rosy skies, but I was 
not happy, as I had thought I should be.  My long travel and the 
bewildering sights had exhausted me.  I fell asleep, heaving deep, 
tired sobs.  My tears were left to dry themselves in streaks, 
because neither my aunt nor my mother was near to wipe them away. 
 
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="II" id="d4"> 
<head> THE CUTTING OF MY LONG HAIR.</head> 
 
<p>The first day in the land of apples was a bitter-cold one; for 
the snow still covered the ground, and the trees were bare.  A 
large bell rang for breakfast, its loud metallic voice crashing 
through the belfry overhead and into our sensitive ears.  The 
annoying clatter of shoes on bare floors gave us no peace.  The 
constant clash of harsh noises, with an undercurrent of many voices 
murmuring an unknown tongue, made a bedlam within which I was 
securely tied.  And though my spirit tore itself in struggling for 
its lost freedom, all was useless. 
</p><p>A paleface woman, with white hair, came up after us.  We were 
placed in a line of girls who were marching into the dining room.  
These were Indian girls, in stiff shoes and closely clinging 
dresses.  The small girls wore sleeved aprons and shingled hair.  
As I walked noiselessly in my soft moccasins, I felt like sinking 
to the floor, for my blanket had been stripped from my shoulders.  
I looked hard at the Indian girls, who seemed not to care that they 
were even more immodestly dressed than I, in their tightly fitting 
clothes.  While we marched in, the boys entered at an opposite 
door.  I watched for the three young braves who came in our party.  
I spied them in the rear ranks, looking as uncomfortable as I felt. 
</p><p>A small bell was tapped, and each of the pupils drew a chair 
from under the table.  Supposing this act meant they were to be 
seated, I pulled out mine and at once slipped into it from one 
side.  But when I turned my head, I saw that I was the only one 
seated, and all the rest at our table remained standing.  Just as 
I began to rise, looking shyly around to see how chairs were to be 
used, a second bell was sounded.  All were seated at last, and I 
had to crawl 
<pb n="187"/>  
back into my chair again.  I heard a man's 
voice at one end of the hall, and I looked around to see him.  But 
all the others hung their heads over their plates.  As I glanced at 
the long chain of tables, I caught the eyes of a paleface woman 
upon me.  Immediately I dropped my eyes, wondering why I was so 
keenly watched by the strange woman.  The man ceased his 
mutterings, and then a third bell was tapped.  Every one picked up 
his knife and fork and began eating.  I began crying instead, for 
by this time I was afraid to venture anything more. 
</p><p>But this eating by formula was not the hardest trial in that 
first day.  Late in the morning, my friend Judewin gave me a 
terrible warning.  Judewin knew a few words of English, and she had 
overheard the paleface woman talk about cutting our long, heavy 
hair.  Our mothers had taught us that only unskilled warriors who 
were captured had their hair shingled by the enemy.  Among our 
people, short hair was worn by mourners, and shingled hair by 
cowards! 
</p><p>We discussed our fate some moments, and when Judewin said, "We 
have to submit, because they are strong," I rebelled. 
</p><p>"No, I will not submit!  I will struggle first!" I answered. 
</p><p>I watched my chance, and when no one noticed I disappeared.  
I crept up the stairs as quietly as I could in my squeaking shoes,--my moccasins had been exchanged for shoes.  Along the hall I 
passed, without knowing whither I was going.  Turning aside to an 
open door, I found a large room with three white beds in it.  The 
windows were covered with dark green curtains, which made the room 
very dim.  Thankful that no one was there, I directed my steps 
toward the corner farthest from the door.  On my hands and knees I 
crawled under the bed, and cuddled myself in the dark corner. 
</p><p>From my hiding place I peered out, shuddering with fear 
whenever I heard footsteps near by.  Though in the hall loud voices 
were calling my name, and I knew that even Judewin was searching 
for me, I did not open my mouth to answer.  Then the steps were 
quickened and the voices became excited.  The sounds came nearer 
and nearer.  Women and girls entered the room.  I held my breath, 
and watched them open closet doors and peep behind large trunks.  
Some one threw up the curtains, and the room was filled with sudden 
light.  What caused them to stoop and look under the bed I do not 
know.  I remember being dragged out, though I resisted by kicking 
and scratching wildly.  In spite of myself, I was carried 
downstairs and tied fast in a chair. 
</p><p>I cried aloud, shaking my head all the while until I felt the 
cold blades of the scissors against my neck, and heard them gnaw 
off one of my thick braids.  Then I lost my spirit.  Since the day 
I was taken from my mother I had suffered extreme indignities.  
People had stared at me.  I had been tossed about in the air like 
a wooden puppet.  And now my long hair was shingled like a 
coward's!  In my anguish I moaned for my mother, but no one came to 
comfort me.  Not a soul reasoned quietly with me, as my own mother 
used to do; for now I was only one of many little animals driven by 
a herder. 
 
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="III" id="d5"> 
<head> THE SNOW EPISODE.</head> 
 
<p>A short time after our arrival we three Dakotas were playing 
in the snowdrifts.  We were all still deaf to the English language, 
excepting Judewin, who always heard such puzzling things.  One 
morning we learned through her ears that we were forbidden to fall 
lengthwise in the snow, as we had been doing, to see our own 
impressions.  However, 
<pb n="188"/>  before many hours we had forgotten 
the order, and were having great sport in the snow, when a shrill 
voice called us.  Looking up, we saw an imperative hand beckoning 
us into the house.  We shook the snow off ourselves, and started 
toward the woman as slowly as we dared. 
</p><p>Judewin said: "Now the paleface is angry with us.  She is 
going to punish us for falling into the snow.  If she looks 
straight into your eyes and talks loudly, you must wait until she 
stops.  Then, after a tiny pause, say, 'No.'"  The rest of the way 
we practiced upon the little word "no." 
</p><p>As it happened, Thowin was summoned to judgment first.  The 
door shut behind her with a click. 
</p><p>Judewin and I stood silently listening at the keyhole.  The 
paleface woman talked in very severe tones.  Her words fell from 
her lips like crackling embers, and her inflection ran up like the 
small end of a switch.  I understood her voice better than the 
things she was saying.  I was certain we had made her very 
impatient with us.  Judewin heard enough of the words to realize 
all too late that she had taught us the wrong reply. 
</p><p>"Oh, poor Thowin!" she gasped, as she put both hands over her 
ears. 
</p><p>Just then I heard Thowin's tremulous answer, "No." 
</p><p>With an angry exclamation, the woman gave her a hard spanking.  
Then she stopped to say something.  Judewin said it was this: "Are 
you going to obey my word the next time?" 
</p><p>Thowin answered again with the only word at her command, "No." 
</p><p>This time the woman meant her blows to smart, for the poor 
frightened girl shrieked at the top of her voice.  In the midst of 
the whipping the blows ceased abruptly, and the woman asked another 
question: "Are you going to fall in the snow again?" 
</p><p>Thowin gave her bad password another trial.  We heard her say 
feebly, "No!  No!" 
</p><p>With this the woman hid away her half-worn slipper, and led 
the child out, stroking her black shorn head.  Perhaps it occurred 
to her that brute force is not the solution for such a problem.  
She did nothing to Judewin nor to me.  She only returned to us our 
unhappy comrade, and left us alone in the room. 
</p><p>During the first two or three seasons misunderstandings as 
ridiculous as this one of the snow episode frequently took place, 
bringing unjustifiable frights and punishments into our little 
lives. 
</p><p>Within a year I was able to express myself somewhat in broken 
English.  As soon as I comprehended a part of what was said and 
done, a mischievous spirit of revenge possessed me.  One day I was 
called in from my play for some misconduct.  I had disregarded a 
rule which seemed to me very needlessly binding.  I was sent into 
the kitchen to mash the turnips for dinner.  It was noon, and 
steaming dishes were hastily carried into the dining room.  I hated 
turnips, and their odor which came from the brown jar was offensive 
to me.  With fire in my heart, I took the wooden tool that the 
paleface woman held out to me.  I stood upon a step, and, grasping 
the handle with both hands, I bent in hot rage over the turnips.  
I worked my vengeance upon them.  All were so busily occupied that 
no one noticed me.  I saw that the turnips were in a pulp, and that 
further beating could not improve them; but the order was, "Mash 
these turnips," and mash them I would!  I renewed my energy; and as 
I sent the masher into the bottom of the jar, I felt a satisfying 
sensation that the weight of my body had gone into it. 
</p><p>Just here a paleface woman came up to my table.  As she looked 
into the jar she shoved my hands roughly aside.  I stood fearless 
and angry.  She placed her red hands upon the rim of the jar.  Then 
she gave one lift and a stride away from the table.  But lo! the 
pulpy contents fell through the crumbled bottom 
<pb n="189"/>  to the 
floor!  She spared me no scolding phrases that I had earned.  I did 
not heed them.  I felt triumphant in my revenge, though deep within 
me I was a wee bit sorry to have broken the jar. 
</p><p>As I sat eating my dinner, and saw that no turnips were 
served, I whooped in my heart for having once asserted the 
rebellion within me. 
 
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="IV" id="d6"> 
<head> THE DEVIL.</head> 
 
<p>Among the legends the old warriors used to tell me were many 
stories of evil spirits.  But I was taught to fear them no more 
than those who stalked about in material guise.  I never knew there 
was an insolent chieftain among the bad spirits, who dared to array 
his forces against the Great Spirit, until I heard this white man's 
legend from a paleface woman. 
</p><p>Out of a large book she showed me a picture of the white man's 
devil.  I looked in horror upon the strong claws that grew out of 
his fur-covered fingers.  His feet were like his hands.  Trailing 
at his heels was a scaly tail tipped with a serpent's open jaws.  
His face was a patchwork: he had bearded cheeks, like some I had 
seen palefaces wear; his nose was an eagle's bill, and his sharp-pointed ears were pricked up like those of a sly fox.  Above them 
a pair of cow's horns curved upward.  I trembled with awe, and my 
heart throbbed in my throat, as I looked at the king of evil 
spirits.  Then I heard the paleface woman say that this terrible 
creature roamed loose in the world, and that little girls who 
disobeyed school regulations were to be tortured by him. 
</p><p>That night I dreamt about this evil divinity.  Once again I 
seemed to be in my mother's cottage.  An Indian woman had come to 
visit my mother.  On opposite sides of the kitchen stove, which 
stood in the centre of the small house, my mother and her guest 
were seated in straight-backed chairs.  I played with a train of 
empty spools hitched together on a string.  It was night, and the 
wick burned feebly.  Suddenly I heard some one turn our door-knob 
from without. 
</p><p>My mother and the woman hushed their talk, and both looked 
toward the door.  It opened gradually.  I waited behind the stove.  
The hinges squeaked as the door was slowly, very slowly pushed 
inward. 
</p><p>Then in rushed the devil!  He was tall!  He looked exactly 
like the picture I had seen of him in the white man's papers.  he 
did not speak to my mother, because he did not know the Indian 
language, but his glittering yellow eyes were fastened upon me.  He 
took long strides around the stove, passing behind the woman's 
chair.  I threw down my spools, and ran to my mother.  He did not 
fear her, but followed closely after me.  Then I ran round and 
round the stove, crying aloud for help.  But my mother and the 
woman seemed not to know my danger.  They sat still, looking 
quietly upon the devil's chase after me.  At last I grew dizzy.  My 
head revolved as on a hidden pivot.  My knees became numb, and 
doubled under my weight like a pair of knife blades without a 
spring.  Beside my mother's chair I fell in a heap.  Just as the 
devil stooped over me with outstretched claws my mother awoke from 
her quiet indifference, and lifted me on her lap.  Whereupon the 
devil vanished, and I was awake. 
</p><p>On the following morning I took my revenge upon the devil.  
Stealing into the room where a wall of shelves was filled with 
books, I drew forth The Stories of the Bible.  With a broken slate 
pencil I carried in my apron pocket, I began by scratching out his 
wicked eyes.  A few moments later, when I was ready to leave the 
room, there was a ragged hole in the page where the picture of the 
devil had once been. </p>
</div1>

 
 
<div1 type="section" n="V" id="d7"> 
<head> IRON ROUTINE.</head> <pb n="190"/> 
 
<p>A loud-clamoring bell awakened us at half past six in the cold 
winter mornings.  From happy dreams of Western rolling lands and 
unlassoed freedom we tumbled out upon chilly bare floors back again 
into a paleface day.  We had short time to jump into our shoes and 
clothes, and wet our eyes with icy water, before a small hand bell 
was vigorously rung for roll call. 
</p><p>There were too many drowsy children and too numerous orders 
for the day to waste a moment in any apology to nature for giving 
her children such a shock in the early morning.  We rushed 
downstairs, bounding over two high steps at a time, to land in the 
assembly room. 
</p><p>A paleface woman, with a yellow-covered roll book open on her 
arm and a gnawed pencil in her hand, appeared at the door.  Her 
small, tired face was coldly lighted with a pair of large gray 
eyes. 
</p><p>She stood still in a halo of authority, while over the rim of 
her spectacles her eyes pried nervously about the room.  Having 
glanced at her long list of names and called out the first one, she 
tossed up her chin and peered through the crystals of her 
spectacles to make sure of the answer "Here." 
</p><p>Relentlessly her pencil black-marked our daily records if we 
were not present to respond to our names, and no chum of ours had 
done it successfully for us.  No matter if a dull headache or the 
painful cough of slow consumption had delayed the absentee, there 
was only time enough to mark the tardiness.  It was next to 
impossible to leave the iron routine after the civilizing machine 
had once begun its day's buzzing; and as it was inbred in me to 
suffer in silence rather than to appeal to the ears of one whose 
open eyes could not see my pain, I have many times trudged in the 
day's harness heavy-footed, like a dumb sick brute. 
</p><p>Once I lost a dear classmate.  I remember well how she used to 
mope along at my side, until one morning she could not raise her 
head from her pillow.  At her deathbed I stood weeping, as the 
paleface woman sat near her moistening the dry lips.  Among the 
folds of the bedclothes I saw the open pages of the white man's 
Bible.  The dying Indian girl talked disconnectedly of Jesus the 
Christ and the paleface who was cooling her swollen hands and feet. 
</p><p>I grew bitter, and censured the woman for cruel neglect of our 
physical ills.  I despised the pencils that moved automatically, 
and the one teaspoon which dealt out, from a large bottle, healing 
to a row of variously ailing Indian children.  I blamed the hard-working, well-meaning, ignorant woman who was inculcating in our 
hearts her superstitious ideas.  Though I was sullen in all my 
little troubles, as soon as I felt better I was ready again to 
smile upon the cruel woman.  Within a week I was again actively 
testing the chains which tightly bound my individuality like a 
mummy for burial. 
</p><p>The melancholy of those black days has left so long a shadow 
that it darkens the path of years that have since gone by.  These 
sad memories rise above those of smoothly grinding school days.  
Perhaps my Indian nature is the moaning wind which stirs them now 
for their present record.  But, however tempestuous this is within 
me, it comes out as the low voice of a curiously colored sea-shell, 
which is only for those ears that are bent with compassion to hear 
it. 
 
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="VI" id="d8"> 
<head> FOUR STRANGE SUMMERS.</head> 
 
<p>After my first three years of school, I roamed again in the 
Western country through four strange summers. </p>

<pb n="191"/>  

<p>During this time I seemed to hang in the heart of chaos, 
beyond the touch or voice of human aid.  My brother, being almost 
ten years my senior, did not quite understand my feelings.  My 
mother had never gone inside of a schoolhouse, and so she was not 
capable of comforting her daughter who could read and write.  Even 
nature seemed to have no place for me.  I was neither a wee girl 
nor a tall one; neither a wild Indian nor a tame one.  This 
deplorable situation was the effect of my brief course in the East, 
and the unsatisfactory "teenth" in a girl's years. 
</p><p>It was under these trying conditions that, one bright 
afternoon, as I sat restless and unhappy in my brother's cabin, I 
caught the sound of the spirited step of my brother's pony on the 
road which passed by our dwelling.  Soon I heard the wheels of a 
light buckboard, and Dawee's familiar "Ho!" to his pony.  He 
alighted upon the bare ground in front of our house.  Tying his 
pony to one of the projecting corner logs of the low-roofed 
cottage, he stepped upon the wooden doorstep. 
</p><p>I met him there with a hurried greeting, and as I passed by, 
he looked a quiet "What?" into my eyes. 
</p><p>When he began talking with my mother, I slipped the rope from 
the pony's bridle.  Seizing the reins and bracing my feet against 
the dashboard, I wheeled around in an instant.  The pony was ever 
ready to try his speed.  Looking backward, I saw Dawee waving his 
hand to me.  I turned with the curve in the road and disappeared.  
I followed the winding road which crawled upward between the bases 
of little hillocks.  Deep water-worn ditches ran parallel on either 
side.  A strong wind blew against my cheeks and fluttered my 
sleeves.  The pony reached the top of the highest hill, and began 
an even race on the level lands.  There was nothing moving within 
that great circular horizon of the Dakota prairies save the tall 
grasses, over which the wind blew and rolled off in long, shadowy 
waves. 
</p><p>Within this vast wigwam of blue and green I rode reckless and 
insignificant.  It satisfied my small consciousness to see the 
white foam fly from the pony's mouth. 
</p><p>Suddenly, out of the earth a coyote came forth at a swinging 
trot that was taking the cunning thief toward the hills and the 
village beyond.  Upon the moment's impulse, I gave him a long chase 
and a wholesome fright.  As I turned away to go back to the 
village, the wolf sank down upon his haunches for rest, for it was 
a hot summer day; and as I drove slowly homeward, I saw his sharp 
nose still pointed at me, until I vanished below the margin of the 
hilltops. 
</p><p>In a little while I came in sight of my mother's house.  Dawee 
stood in the yard, laughing at an old warrior who was pointing his 
forefinger, and again waving his whole hand, toward the hills.  
With his blanket drawn over one shoulder, he talked and motioned 
excitedly.  Dawee turned the old man by the shoulder and pointed me 
out to him. 
</p><p>"Oh han!" (Oh yes) the warrior muttered, and went his way.  He 
had climbed the top of his favorite barren hill to survey the 
surrounding prairies, when he spied my chase after the coyote.  His 
keen eyes recognized the pony and driver.  At once uneasy for my 
safety, he had come running to my mother's cabin to give her 
warning.  I did not appreciate his kindly interest, for there was 
an unrest gnawing at my heart. 
</p><p>As soon as he went away, I asked Dawee about something else. 
</p><p>"No, my baby sister, I cannot take you with me to the party 
to-night," he replied.  Though I was not far from fifteen, and I 
felt that before long I should enjoy all the privileges of my tall 
cousin, Dawee persisted in calling me his baby sister. 
</p><p>That moonlight night, I cried in my mother's presence when I 
heard the jolly young people pass by our cottage.  They 
<pb n="192"/>  
were no more young braves in blankets and eagle plumes, nor Indian 
maids with prettily painted cheeks.  They had gone three years to 
school in the East, and had become civilized.  The young men wore 
the white man's coat and trousers, with bright neckties.  The girls 
wore tight muslin dresses, with ribbons at neck and waist.  At 
these gatherings they talked English.  I could speak English almost 
as well as my brother, but I was not properly dressed to be taken 
along.  I had no hat, no ribbons, and no close-fitting gown.  Since 
my return from school I had thrown away my shoes, and wore again 
the soft moccasins. 
</p><p>While Dawee was busily preparing to go I controlled my tears.  
But when I heard him bounding away on his pony, I buried my face in 
my arms and cried hot tears. 
</p><p>My mother was troubled by my unhappiness.  Coming to my side, 
she offered me the only printed matter we had in our home.  It was 
an Indian Bible, given her some years ago by a missionary.  She 
tried to console me.  "Here, my child, are the white man's papers.  
Read a little from them," she said most piously. 
</p><p>I took it from her hand, for her sake; but my enraged spirit 
felt more like burning the book, which afforded me no help, and was 
a perfect delusion to my mother.  I did not read it, but laid it 
unopened on the floor, where I sat on my feet.  The dim yellow 
light of the braided muslin burning in a small vessel of oil 
flickered and sizzled in the awful silent storm which followed my 
rejection of the Bible. 
</p><p>Now my wrath against the fates consumed my tears before they 
reached my eyes.  I sat stony, with a bowed head.  My mother threw 
a shawl over her head and shoulders, and stepped out into the 
night. 
</p><p>After an uncertain solitude, I was suddenly aroused by a loud 
cry piercing the night.  It was my mother's voice wailing among the 
barren hills which held the bones of buried warriors.  She called 
aloud for her brothers' spirits to support her in her helpless 
misery.  My fingers grew icy cold, as I realized that my 
unrestrained tears had betrayed my suffering to her, and she was 
grieving for me. 
</p><p>Before she returned, though I knew she was on her way, for she 
had ceased her weeping, I extinguished the light, and leaned my 
head on the window sill. 
</p><p>Many schemes of running away from my surroundings hovered 
about in my mind.  A few more moons of such a turmoil drove me away 
to the Eastern school.  I rode on the white man's iron steed, 
thinking it would bring me back to my mother in a few winters, when 
I should be grown tall, and there would be congenial friends 
awaiting me.

<head> INCURRING MY MOTHER'S DISPLEASURE.</head> 
 
<p>In the second journey to the East I had not come without some 
precautions.  I had a secret interview with one of our best 
medicine men, and when I left his wigwam I carried securely in my 
sleeve a tiny bunch of magic roots.  This possession assured me of 
friends wherever I should go.  So absolutely did I believe in its 
charms that I wore it through all the school routine for more than 
a year.  Then, before I lost my faith in the dead roots, I lost the 
little buckskin bag containing all my good luck. 
</p><p>At the close of this second term of three years I was the 
proud owner of my first diploma.  The following autumn I ventured 
upon a college career against my mother's will. 
</p><p>I had written for her approval, but in her reply I found no 
encouragement.  She called my notice to her neighbors' children, 
who had completed their education in three years.  They had  

<pb n="193"/>  
returned to their homes, and were then talking English with the 
frontier settlers.  Her few words hinted that I had better give up 
my slow attempt to learn the white man's ways, and be content to 
roam over the prairies and find my living upon wild roots.  I 
silenced her by deliberate disobedience. 
</p><p>Thus, homeless and heavy-hearted, I began anew my life among 
strangers. 
</p><p>As I hid myself in my little room in the college dormitory, 
away from the scornful and yet curious eyes of the students, I 
pined for sympathy.  Often I wept in secret, wishing I had gone 
West, to be nourished by my mother's love, instead of remaining 
among a cold race whose hearts were frozen hard with prejudice. 
</p><p>During the fall and winter seasons I scarcely had a real 
friend, though by that time several of my classmates were courteous 
to me at a safe distance. 
</p><p>My mother had not yet forgiven my rudeness to her, and I had 
no moment for letter-writing.  By daylight and lamplight, I spun 
with reeds and thistles, until my hands were tired from their 
weaving, the magic design which promised me the white man's 
respect. 
</p><p>At length, in the spring term, I entered an oratorical contest 
among the various classes.  As the day of competition approached, 
it did not seem possible that the event was so near at hand, but it 
came.  In the chapel the classes assembled together, with their 
invited guests.  The high platform was carpeted, and gayly 
festooned with college colors.  A bright white light illumined the 
room, and outlined clearly the great polished beams that arched the 
domed ceiling.  The assembled crowds filled the air with pulsating 
murmurs.  When the hour for speaking arrived all were hushed.  But 
on the wall the old clock which pointed out the trying moment 
ticked calmly on. 
</p><p>One after another I saw and heard the orators.  Still, I could 
not realize that they longed for the favorable decision of the 
judges as much as I did.  Each contestant received a loud burst of 
applause, and some were cheered heartily.  Too soon my turn came, 
and I paused a moment behind the curtains for a deep breath.  After 
my concluding words, I heard the same applause that the others had 
called out. 
</p><p>Upon my retreating steps, I was astounded to receive from my 
fellow students a large bouquet of roses tied with flowing ribbons.  
With the lovely flowers I fled from the stage.  This friendly token 
was a rebuke to me for the hard feelings I had borne them. 
</p><p>Later, the decision of the judges awarded me the first place.  
Then there was a mad uproar in the hall, where my classmates sang 
and shouted my name at the top of their lungs; and the disappointed 
students howled and brayed in fearfully dissonant tin trumpets.  In 
this excitement, happy students rushed forward to offer their 
congratulations.  And I could not conceal a smile when they wished 
to escort me in a procession to the students' parlor, where all 
were going to calm themselves.  Thanking them for the kind spirit 
which prompted them to make such a proposition, I walked alone with 
the night to my own little room. 
</p><p>A few weeks afterward, I appeared as the college 
representative in another contest.  This time the competition was 
among orators from different colleges in our state.  It was held at 
the state capital, in one of the largest opera houses. 
</p><p>Here again was a strong prejudice against my people.  In the 
evening, as the great audience filled the house, the student bodies 
began warring among themselves.  Fortunately, I was spared 
witnessing any of the noisy wrangling before the contest began.  
The slurs against the Indian that stained the lips of our opponents 
were already burning like a dry fever within my breast. 
</p><p>But after the orations were delivered a deeper burn awaited 
me.  There, 

<pb n="194"/> 
before that vast ocean of eyes, some college 
rowdies threw out a large white flag, with a drawing of a most 
forlorn Indian girl on it.  Under this they had printed in bold 
black letters words that ridiculed the college which was 
represented by a "squaw."  Such worse than barbarian rudeness 
embittered me.  While we waited for the verdict of the judges, I 
gleamed fiercely upon the throngs of palefaces.  My teeth were hard 
set, as I saw the white flag still floating insolently in the air. 
</p><p>Then anxiously we watched the man carry toward the stage the 
envelope containing the final decision. 
</p><p>There were two prizes given, that night, and one of them was 
mine! 
</p><p>The evil spirit laughed within me when the white flag dropped 
out of sight, and the hands which furled it hung limp in defeat. 
</p><p>Leaving the crowd as quickly as possible, I was soon in my 
room.  The rest of the night I sat in an armchair and gazed into 
the crackling fire.  I laughed no more in triumph when thus alone.  
The little taste of victory did not satisfy a hunger in my heart.  
In my mind I saw my mother far away on the Western plains, and she 
was holding a charge against me.</p>
