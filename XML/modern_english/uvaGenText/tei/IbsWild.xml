<head>ACT I</head>

<stage><p>
At WERLE'S house.  A richly and comfortably furnished
study; bookcases and upholstered furniture; a writing-table, with papers and documents, in the centre of the
room; lighted lamps with green shades, giving a subdued
light.  At the back, open folding-doors with curtains
drawn back.  Within is seen a large and handsome room,
brilliantly lighted with lamps and branching candle-sticks.  In front, on the right (in the study), a small
baize door leads into WERLE'S Office.  On the left, in
front, a fireplace with a glowing coal fire, and farther
back a double door leading into the dining-room.
</p><p>WERLE'S servant, PETTERSEN, in livery, and JENSEN, the
hired waiter, in black, are putting the study in order.
In the large room, two or three other hired waiters are
moving about, arranging things and lighting more candles.
From the dining-room, the hum of conversation
and laughter of many voices are heard; a glass is tapped
with a knife; silence follows, and a toast is proposed;
shouts of "Bravo!" and then again a buzz of conversation.
</p><p>Pettersen (lights a lamp on the chimney-place and places
a shade over it).  Hark to them, Jensen! now the old man's
on his legs holding a long palaver about Mrs. Sorby.</p></stage>

<sp><speaker>Jensen</speaker> <stage>(pushing forward an arm-chair).</stage>  <p>Is it true, what
folks say, that they're &mdash; very good friends, eh?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Petterson.</speaker><p>  Lord knows.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Jensen.</speaker><p>  I've heard tell as he's been a lively customer in
his day.

<pb n="4"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Petterson.</speaker><p>  May be.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Jensen.</speaker><p>  And he's giving this spread in honour of his son,
they say.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  Yes.  His son came home yesterday.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Jensen.</speaker><p>  This is the first time I ever heard as Mr. Werle
had a son.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  Oh yes, he has a son, right enough.  But he's
a fixture, as you might say, up at the Hoidal works.  He's
never once come to town all the years I've been in service
here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A Waiter</speaker><stage>(in the doorway of the other room).</stage><p>  Pettersen,
here's an old fellow wanting &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen</speaker><stage> (mutters).</stage><p> The devil &mdash; who's this now?</p></sp>
<stage><p>
OLD EKDAL appears from the right, in the inner room.  He
is dressed in a threadbare overcoat with a high collar;
he wears woollen mittens, and carries in his hand a stick
and a fur cap.  Under his arm, a brown paper parcel.
Dirty red-brown wig and small grey moustache.
</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen</speaker><stage> (goes towards him).</stage><p> Good Lord &mdash; what do you
want here?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (in the doorway).</stage><p>  Must get into the office, Pettersen.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Petterson.</speaker><p>  The office was closed an hour ago, and &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  So they told me at the front door.  But Graberg's
in there still.  Let me slip in this way, Pettersen; there's a
good fellow. (Points towards the baize door.) It's not the
first time I've come this way.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  Well, you may pass. (Opens the door.) But
mind you go out again the proper way, for we've got company.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  I know, I know &mdash; h'm! Thanks, Pettersen, good
old friend!  Thanks!  <stage>(Mutters softly.)</stage>  Ass!</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[He goes into the Office; PETTERSEN shuts the
door after him.
</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Jensen.</speaker><p>  Is he one of the office people?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  No he's only an outside hand that does odd

<pb n="5"/>
jobs of copying.  But he's been a tip-topper in his day, has
old Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Jensen.</speaker><p>  You can see he's been through a lot.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  Yes; he was an army officer, you know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Jensen.</speaker><p>  You don't say so?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  No mistake about it.  But then he went into
the timber trade or something of the sort.  They say he
once played Mr. Werle a very nasty trick.  They were partners
in the Hoidal works at the time.  Oh, I know old Ekdal
well, I do.  Many a nip of bitters and bottle of ale we two
have drunk at Madam Eriksen's.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Jensen.</speaker><p>  He don't look as if held much to stand treat with.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  Why, bless you, Jensen, it's me that stands
treat.  I always think there's no harm in being a bit civil
to folks that have seen better days.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Jensen.</speaker><p>  Did he go bankrupt then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  Worse than that.  He went to prison.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Jensen.</speaker><p>  To prison!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  Or perhaps it was the Penitentiary. <stage> (Listens.)</stage>
Sh!  They're leaving the table.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
The dining-room door is thrown open from within, by a
couple of waiters.  MRS. SORBY comes out conversing
with two gentlemen.  Gradually the whole company follows,
amongst them WERLE.  Last come HIALMAR
EKDAL and GREGERS WERLE.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby</speaker><stage>(in passing, to the servant).</stage><p> Tell them to
serve the coffee in the music-room, Pettersen.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  Very well, Madam.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[She goes with the two Gentlemen into the inner
room, and thence out to the right. PETTERSEN
and JENSEN go out the same way.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>A Flabby Gentleman</speaker><stage>(to a THIN-HAIRED  GENTLEMAN).</stage><p>
Whew!  What a dinner! &mdash; It was no joke to do it justice!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Oh, with a little good-will
one can get through a lot in three hours.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Yes, but afterwards, afterwards,
my dear Chamberlain!

<pb n="6"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>A Third Gentleman.</speaker><p>  I hear the coffee and maraschino are
to be served in the music-room.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Bravo!  Then perhaps Mrs.
Sorby will play us something.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman</speaker><stage> (in a low voice).</stage><p>  I hope
Mrs. Sorby mayn't play us a tune we don't like, one of these
days!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Oh no, not she!  Bertha will
never turn against her old friends.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[They laugh and pass into the inner room.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Werle</speaker><stage> (in a low voice, dejectedly).</stage><p>  I don't think anybody
noticed it, Gregers.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looks at him).</stage><p>  Noticed what?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Did you not notice it either?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What do you mean?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  We were thirteen at table.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Indeed?  Were there thirteen of us?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle</speaker><stage> (glances towards HIALMAR EKDAL).</stage><p>  Our usual
party is twleve. (To the others.)  This way, gentlemen!</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[WERLE and the others, all except HIALMAR and
GREGERS, go out by the back, to the right.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (who has overheard the conversation).</stage><p>  You
ought not to have invited me, Gregers.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What!  Not ask my best and only friend to a
party supposed to be in my honour &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  But I don't think your father likes it.  You
see I am quite outside his circle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  So I hear.  But I wanted to see you and have
a talk with you, and I certainly shan't be staying long. &mdash; Ah,
we two old schoolfellows have drifted far apart from each
other.  It must be sixteen or seventeen years since we met.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Is it so long?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  It is indeed.  Well, how goes it with you?
You look well.  You have put on flesh, and grown almost
stout.

<pb n="7"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, "stout" is scarcely the word; but I daresay
I look a little more of a man than I used to.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, you do; your outer man is in first-rate condition.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (in a tone of gloom).</stage><p>  Ah, but the inner man!
That is a very different matter, I can tell you!  Of course
you know of the terrible catastrophe that has befallen me
and mine since last we met.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (more softly).</stage><p>  How are things going with your
father now?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Don't let us talk of it, old fellow.  Of course
my poor unhappy father lives with me.  He hasn't another
soul in the world to care for him.  But you can understand
that this is a miserable subject for me. &mdash; Tell me, rather,
how you have been getting on up at the works.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I have had a delightfully lonely time of it &mdash;
plenty of leisure to think and think about things.  Come
over here; we may as well make ourselves comfortable.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[He seats himself in an arm-chair by the fire and
draws HIALMAR down into another alongside
of it.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (sentimentally).</stage><p>  After all, Gregers, I thank you
for inviting me to your father's table; for I take it as a sign
that you have got over your feeling against me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (surprised).</stage><p>  How could you imagine I had any
feeling against you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  You had at first, you know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  How at first?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  After the great misfortune.  It was natural
enough that you should.  Your father was within an ace of
being drawn into that &mdash; well, that terrible business.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Why should that give me any feeling against
you?  Who can have put that into your head?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I know it did, Gregers; your father told me so
himself.

<pb n="8"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (starts).</stage><p>  My father!  Oh indeed.  H'm. &mdash; Was
that why you never let me hear from you? &mdash; not a single
word.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Not even when you made up your mind to become
a photographer?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Your father said I had better not write to you
at all, about anything.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looking straight before him).</stage><p>  Well well, perhaps
he was right. &mdash; But tell me now, Hialmar: are you pretty
well satisfied with your present position?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (with a little sigh).</stage><p>  Oh yes, I am; I have really
no cause to complain.  At first, as you may guess, I felt it a
little strange.  It was such a totally new state of things for
me.  But of course my whole circumstances were totally
changed.  Father's utter, irretrievable ruin, &mdash; the shame and
disgrace of it, Gregers
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (affected).</stage><p>  Yes, yes; I understand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I couldn't think of remaining at college; there
wasn't a shilling to spare; on the contrary, there were debts
&mdash; mainly to your father I believe &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  H'm &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  In short, I thought it best to break, once for
all, with my old surroundings and associations.  It was your
father that specially urged me to it; and since he interested
himself so much in me
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  My father did?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, you surely knew that, didn't you?  Where
do you suppose I found the money to learn photography, and
to furnish a studio and make a start?  All that costs a pretty
penny, I can tell you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And my father provided the money?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, my dear fellow, didn't you know?  I understood
him to say he had written to you about it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Not a word about his part in the business.  He
must have forgotten it.  Our correspondence has always

<pb n="9"/>
been purely a business one.  So it was my father that &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, certainly.  He didn't wish it to be generally
known; but he it was.  And of course it was he, too,
that put me in a position to marry.  Don't you &mdash; don't you
know about that either?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No, I haven't heard a word of it. <stage>(Shakes him
by the arm).</stage>  But, my dear Hialmar, I can't tell you what
pleasure all this gives me &mdash; pleasure, and self-reproach.  I
have perhaps done my father injustice after all &mdash; in some
things.  This proves that he has a heart.  It shows a sort of
compunction &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Compunction &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, yes &mdash; whatever you like to call it.  Oh, I
can't tell you how glad I am to hear this of father. &mdash; So you
are a married man, Hialmar!  That is further than I shall
ever get.  Well, I hope you are happy in your married life?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, thoroughly happy.  She is as good and
capable a wife as any man could wish for.  And she is by no
means without culture.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (rather surprised).</stage><p>  No, of course not.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  You see, life is itself an education.  Her daily
intercourse with me &mdash;  And then we know one or two
rather remarkable men, who come a good deal about us.  I
assure you, you would hardly know Gina again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Gina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes; had you forgotten that her name was
Gina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Whose name? I haven't the slightest idea &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Don't you remember that she used to be in
service here?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looks at him.)</stage><p>  Is it Gina Hansen &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, of course it is Gina Hansen.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  &mdash;who kept house for us during the last year
of my mother's illness?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, exactly.  But, my dear friend, I'm quite
sure your father told you that I was married.

<pb n="10"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (who has risen).</stage><p>  Oh yes, he mentioned it; but
not that &mdash;  <stage>(Walking about the room.)</stage>  Stay &mdash; perhaps
he did &mdash; now that I think of it.  My father always writes
such short letters.  <stage>(Half seats himself on the arm of the
chair.)</stage>  Now, tell me, Hialmar &mdash; this is interesting &mdash; how did
you come to know Gina &mdash; your wife?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  The simplest thing in the world.  You know
Gina did not stay here long, everything was so much upset
at that time, owing to your mother's illness and so forth,
that Gina was not equal to it all; so she gave notice and left.
That was the year before your mother died &mdash; or it may have
been the same year.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  It was the same year.  I was up at the works
then.  But afterwards &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, Gina lived at home with her mother,
Madam Hansen, an excellent hard-working woman, who
kept a little eating-house.  She had a room to let too; a very
nice comfortable room.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And I suppose you were lucky enough to secure
it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes; in fact, it was your father that recommended
it to me.  So it was there, you see, that I really
came to know Gina.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And then you got engaged?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes.  It doesn't take young people long to fall
in love &mdash; ; h'm &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (rises and moves about a little).</stage><p>  Tell me: was
it after your engagement &mdash; was it then that my father &mdash; I
mean was it then that you began to take up photography?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, precisely.  I wanted to make a start, and
to set up house as soon as possible; and your father and I
agreed that this photography business was the readiest way.
Gina thought so too.  Oh, and there was another thing in
its favour, by-the-bye: it happened, luckily, that Gina had
learnt to retouch.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  That chimed in marvellously.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (pleased, rises).</stage><p>  Yes, didn't it?  Don't you
think it was a marvellous piece of luck?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, unquestionably.  My father seems to have
been almost a kind of providence for you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (with emotion).</stage><p>  He did not forsake his old
friend's son in the hour of his need.  For he has a heart.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby</speaker><stage>(enters, arm-in-arm with WERLE).</stage><p> Nonsense,
my dear Mr. Werle; you mustn't stop there any longer staring
at all the lights.  It's very bad for you.

<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman</speaker><stage> (comes up to MRS. SORBY).</stage><p>
Surely, it isn't possible that you have suspended our cherished
right to smoke?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Yes.  No smoking here, in Mr. Werle's
sanctum, Chamberlain.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman.</speaker><p>  When did you enact these
stringent amendments on the cigar law, Mrs. Sorby?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  After the last dinner, Chamberlain, when certain
persons permitted themselves to overstep the mark.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman.</speaker><p>  And may one never overstep
the mark a little bit, Madame Bertha?  Not the least
little bit?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Not in any respect whatsoever, Mr. Balle.</p></sp>

[Most of the Guests have assembled in the study;

What are you studying so intently, Ekdal?

<pb n="12"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Only an album, Mr. Werle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman</speaker><stage> (who is wandering about).</stage><p>
Ah, photographs!  They are quite in your line of course.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman</speaker><stage> (in an arm-chair).</stage><p>  Haven't you
brought any of your own with you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, I haven't.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman.</speaker><p>  You ought to have; it's very
good for the digestion to sit and look at pictures.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman.</speaker><p>  And it contributes to the
entertainment, you know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Short-sighted Gentleman.</speaker><p>  And all contributions are
thankfully received.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  The Chamberlains think that when one is
invited out to dinner, one ought to exert oneself a little in
return, Mr. Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Where one dines so well, that
duty becomes a pleasure.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman.</speaker><p>  And when it's a case of the
struggle for existence, you know &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  I quite agree with you!</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[They continue the conversation, with laughter and
joking.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (softly).</stage><p>  You must join in, Hialmar.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (writhing).</stage><p>  What am I to talk about?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Don't you think, Mr. Werle,
that Tokay may be considered one of the more wholesome
sorts of wine?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle</speaker><stage> (by the fire).</stage><p>  I can answer for the Tokay you
had to-day, at any rate; it's one of the very finest seasons.
Of course you would notice that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Yes, it had a remarkably delicate
flavour.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (shyly).</stage><p>  Is there any difference between the
seasons?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman</speaker><stage> (laughs).</stage><p>  Come!  That's good!

<pb n="13"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle</speaker><stage> (smiles).</stage><p>  It really doesn't pay to set fine wine
before you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Tokay is like photographs,
Mr. Ekdal: they both need sunshine.  Am I not right?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, light is important no doubt.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  And it's exactly the same with Chamberlains &mdash;
they, too, depend very much on sunshine,<ref target="note1">*</ref> as the
saying is.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Oh fie!  That's a very
threadbare sarcasm!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Short-sighted Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Mrs. Sorby is coming
out &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman.</speaker><p>  &mdash; and at our expense, too.
<stage>(Holds up his finger reprovingly.)</stage> Oh, Madame Bertha,
Madame Bertha!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Yes, and there's not the least doubt that
the seasons differ greatly.  The old vintages are the finest.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Short-sighted Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Do you reckon me among
the old vintages?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Oh, far from it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Thin-haired Gentleman.</speaker><p>  There now!  But me, dear
Mrs. Sorby &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>The Flabby Gentleman.</speaker><p>  Yes, and me?  What vintage
should you say that we belong to?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Why, to the sweet vintages, gentlemen.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[She sips a glass of punch.  The gentlemen laugh
and flirt with her.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Mrs. Sorby can always find a loop-hole &mdash; when
she wants to.  Fill your glasses, gentlemen!  Pettersen, will
you see to it &mdash; !  Gregers, suppose we have a glass together.
<stage>(Gregers does not move.)</stage>  Won't you join us,

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Graberg.</speaker><p>  Yes, and Flakstad has carried off the keys.

later.

<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, you mustn't do that.  You must not come
to my home.  Mine is a melancholy abode, Gregers; especially
after a splendid banquet like this.  We can always
arrange to meet somewhere in the town.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Pettersen.</speaker><p>  Yes; I sent him off with a bottle of cognac.

better than that.

alone together.

<stage><p>
[During what follows, the pianoforte is faintly

<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  How has that family been allowed to go so
miserably to the wall?

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  You mean the Ekdals, I suppose.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, I mean the Ekdals.  Lieutenant Ekdal was
once so closely associated with you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Much too closely; I have felt that to my cost
for many a year.  It is thanks to him that I &mdash; yes I &mdash; have
had a kind of slur cast upon my reputation.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (softly).</stage><p>  Are you sure that he alone was to
blame?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Who else do you suppose &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You and he acted together in that affair of the
forests &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  But was it not Ekdal that drew the map of the
tracts we had bought &mdash; that fraudulent map!  It was he who
felled all that timber illegally on Government ground.  In
fact, the whole management was in his hands.  I was quite
in the dark as to what Lieutenant Ekdal was doing.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Lieutenant Ekdal himself seems to have been
very much in the dark as to what he was doing.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  That may be.  But the fact remains that he was
found guilty and I acquitted.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, I know that nothing was proved against
you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Acquittal is acquittal.  Why do you rake up these
old miseries that turned my hair grey before its time?  Is
that the sort of thing you have been brooding over up there,
all these years?  I can assure you, Gregers, here in the town
the whole story has been forgotten long ago &mdash; so far as I am
concerned.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But that unhappy Ekdal family &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  What would you have had me do for the people?
</p><p>
When Ekdal came out of prison he was a broken-down being,
past all help.  There are people in the world who dive to
the bottom the moment they get a couple of slugs in their
body, and never come to the surface again.  You may take
my word for it, Gregers, I have done all I could without

<pb n="18"/>
positively laying myself open to all sorts of suspicion and
gossip &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Suspicion &mdash; ?  Oh, I see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  I have given Ekdal copying to do for the office,
and I pay him far, far more for it than his work is worth &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (without looking at him).</stage><p>  H'm; that I don't
doubt.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  You laugh?  Do you think I am not telling you
the truth?  Well, I certainly can't refer you to my books,
for I never enter payments of that sort.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (smiles coldly).</stage><p>  No, there are certain payments
it is best to keep no account of.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle</speaker><stage> (taken aback).</stage><p>  What do you mean by that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (mustering up courage).</stage><p>  Have you entered what
it cost you to have Hialmar Ekdal taught photography?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  I?  How "entered" it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I have learnt that it was you who paid for his
training.  And I have learnt, too, that it was you who enabled
him to set up house so comfortably.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Well, and yet you talk as though I had done
nothing for the Ekdals!  I can assure you these people have
cost me enough in all conscience.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Have you entered any of these expenses in your
books?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Why do you ask?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, I have my reasons.  Now tell me: when
you interested yourself so warmly in your old friend's son &mdash;
it was just before his marriage, was it not?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Why, deuce take it &mdash; after all these years, how
can I &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You wrote me a Ietter about that time &mdash; a business
letter, of course; and in a postscript you mentioned &mdash;
quite briefly &mdash; that Hialmar Ekdal had married a Miss
Hansen.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Yes, that was quite right.  That was her name.

<pb n="19"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But you did not mention that this Miss Hansen
was Gina Hansen &mdash; our former housekeeper.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle</speaker><stage> (with a forced laugh of derision).</stage><p>  No; to tell the
truth, it didn't occur to me that you were so particularly
interested in our former housekeeper.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No more I was.  But <stage>(lowers his voice)</stage> there
were others in this house who were particularly interested
in her.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  What do you mean by that?  <stage>(Flaring up.)</stage>  You
are not alluding to me, I hope?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (softly but firmly).</stage><p>  Yes, I am alluding to you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  And you dare &mdash; !  You presume to &mdash; !  How
can that ungrateful hound &mdash; that photographer fellow &mdash; how
dare he go making such insinuations!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Hialmar has never breathed a word about this.
I don't believe he has the faintest suspicion of such a thing.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Then where have you got it from?  Who can
have put such notions in your head?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  My poor unhappy mother told me; and that the
very last time I saw her.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Your mother!  I might have known as much!
You and she &mdash; you always held together.  It was she who
turned you against me, from the first.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No, it was all that she had to suffer and submit
to, until she broke down and came to such a pitiful end.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Oh, she had nothing to suffer or submit to; not
more than most people, at all events.  But there's no getting
on with morbid, overstrained creatures &mdash; that I have
learnt to my cost. &mdash; And you could go on nursing such a
suspicion &mdash; burrowing into all sorts of old rumours and
slanders against your own father!  I must say, Gregers, I
really think that at your age you might find something
more useful to do.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, it is high time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Then perhaps your mind would be easier than
it seems to be now.  What can be your object in remaining

<pb n="20"/>
up at the works, year out and year in, drudging away like
a common clerk, and not drawing a farthing more than the
ordinary monthly wage?  It is downright folly.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Ah, if I were only sure of that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  I understand you well enough.  You want to be
independent; you won't be beholden to me for anything.
Well, now there happens to be an opportunity for you to
become independent, your own master in everything.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Indeed?  In what way &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  When I wrote you insisting on your coming to
town at once &mdash; h'm &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, what is it you really want of me?  I have
been waiting all day to know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  I want to propose that you should enter the firm,
as partner.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I!  Join your firm?  As partner?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Yes.  It would not involve our being constantly
together.  You could take over the business here in town,
and I should move up to the works.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You would?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  The fact is, I am not so fit for work as I once
was.  I am obliged to spare my eyes, Gregers; they have
begun to trouble me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  They have always been weak.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Not as they are now.  And, besides, circumstances
might possibly make it desirable for me to live up
there &mdash; for a time, at any rate.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  That is certainly quite a new idea to me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Listen, Gregers: there are many things that
stand between us; but we are father and son after all.  We
ought surely to be able to come to some sort of understanding
with each other.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Outwardly, you mean, of course?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Well, even that would be something.  Think it
over, Gregers.  Don't you think it ought to be possible?
Eh?

<pb n="21"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looking at him coldly).</stage><p>  There is something
behind all this.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  How so?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You want to make use of me in some way.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  In such a close relationship as ours, the one can
always be useful to the other.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, so people say.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  I want very much to have you at home with me
for a time.  I am a lonely man, Gregers; I have always
felt lonely, all my life through; but most of all now that I
am getting up in years.  I feel the need of some one about
me &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You have Mrs. Sorby.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Yes, I have her; and she has become, I may say,
almost indispensable to me.  She is lively and even-tempered;
she brightens up the house; and that is a very great
thing for me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Well then, you have everything just as you
wish it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Yes, but I am afraid it can't last.  A woman so
situated may easily find herself in a false position, in the
eyes of the world.  For that matter it does a man no good,
either.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, when a man gives such dinners as you give,
he can risk a great deal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Yes, but how about the woman, Gregers?  I fear
she won't accept the situation much longer; and even if
she did &mdash; even if, out of attachment to me, she were to take
her chance of gossip and scandal and all that &mdash; ?  Do
you think, Gregers &mdash; you with your strong sense of justice &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (interrupts him).</stage><p>  Tell me in one word: are you
thinking of marrying her?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Suppose I were thinking of it?  What then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  That's what I say: what then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Should you be inflexibly opposed to it!

<pb n="22"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>   &mdash; Not at all.  Not by any means.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  I was not sure whether your devotion to your
mother's memory &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I am not overstrained.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Well, whatever you may or may not be, at all
events you have lifted a great weight from my mind.  I
am extremely pleased that I can reckon on your concurrence
in this matter.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looking intently at him).</stage><p>  Now I see the use
you want to put me to.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Use to put you to?  What an expression!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, don't let us be nice in our choice of words
&mdash; not when we are alone together, at any rate.  <stage>(With a
short laugh.)</stage>  Well well.  So this is what made it absolutely
essential that I should come to town in person.  For the
sake of Mrs. Sorby, we are to get up a pretence at family
life in the house &mdash; a tableau of filial affection!  That will be
something new indeed.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  How dare you speak in that tone!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Was there ever any family life here?  Never
since I can remember.  But now, forsooth, your plans demand
something of the sort.  No doubt it will have an
excellent effect when it is reported that the son has hastened
home, on the wings of filial piety, to the grey-haired father's
wedding-feast.  What will then remain of all the rumours
as to the wrongs the poor dead mother had to submit to?
Not a vestige.  Her son annihilates them at one stroke.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Gregers &mdash; I believe there is no one in the world
you detest as you do me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (softly).</stage><p>  I have seen you at too close quarters.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  You have seen me with your mother's eyes.
<stage>(Lowers his voice a little.)</stage> But you should remember that
her eyes were &mdash; clouded now and then.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (quivering).</stage><p>  I see what you are hinting at.  But
who was to blame for mother's unfortunate weakness?  Why
you, and all those &mdash; !  The last of them was this woman

<pb n="23"/>
that you palmed off upon Hialmar Ekdal, when you were &mdash;
Ugh!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle</speaker><stage> (shrugs his shoulders).</stage><p>  Word for word as if it
were your mother speaking!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (without heeding).</stage><p>  And there he is now, with
his great, confiding, childlike mind, compassed about with
all this treachery &mdash; living under the same roof with such a
creature, and never dreaming that what he calls his home is
built upon a lie!  <stage>(Comes a step nearer.)</stage>  When I look back
upon your past, I seem to see a battle-field with shattered
lives on every hand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  I begin to think the chasm that divides us is too
wide.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (bowing, with self-command).</stage><p>  So I have observed;
and therefore I take my hat and go.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  You are going!  Out of the house?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes.  For at last I see my mission in life.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  What mission?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You would only laugh if I told you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  A lonely man doesn't laugh so easily, Gregers.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (pointing towards the background).</stage><p>  Look, father,
&mdash; the Chamberlains are playing blind-man's-buff with Mrs.
Sorby. &mdash; Good-night and good-bye.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
He goes out by the back to the right.  Sounds
of laughter and merriment from the Company,
who are now visible in the outer room.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Werle</speaker><stage> (muttering contemptuously after GREGERS).</stage><p>  Ha
&mdash; ! Poor wretch &mdash; and he says he is not overstrained!

<head>ACT SECOND</head>

<stage><p>
HIALMAR EKDAL'S studio, a good-sized room, evidently in the
top storey of the building.  On the right, a sloping roof
of large panes of glass, half-covered by a blue curtain.
In the right-hand corner, at the back, the entrance door;
farther forward, on the same side, a door leading to the
sitting-room.  Two doors on the opposite side, and between
them an iron stove.  At the back, a wide double
sliding-door.   The studio is plainly but comfortably
fitted up and furnished.  Between the doors on the
right, standing out a little from the wall, a sofa with
a table and some chairs; on the table a lighted lamp with
a shade; beside the stove an old arm-chair.  Photographic
instruments and apparatus of different kinds
lying about the room.  Against the back wall, to the
left of the double door, stands a bookcase containing a
few books, boxes, and bottles of chemicals, instruments,
tools, and other objects. Photographs and small articles,
such as camel's-hair pencils, paper, and so forth, lie on
the table.
</p><p>GINA EKDAL sits on a chair by the table, sewing. HEDVIG
is sitting on the sofa, with her hands shading her eyes
and her thumbs in her ears, reading a book.</p></stage>

<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (glances once or twice at HEDVIG, as if with secret
anxiety; then says):</stage><p> Hedvig!</p></sp>
<stage><p>     Hedvig (does not hear).</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (repeats more loudly).</stage><p>  Hedvig!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (takes away her hands and looks up).</stage><p>  Yes,
mother?

<pb n="25"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Hedvig dear, you mustn't sit reading any longer
now.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh mother, mayn't I read a little more?  Just
a little bit?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, no, you must put away your book now.
Father doesn't like it; he never reads hisself in the evening.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (shuts the book).</stage><p>  No, father doesn't care much
about reading.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (puts aside her sewing and takes up a lead pencil
and a little account-book from the table).</stage><p>  Can you remember
how much we paid for the butter to-day?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  It was one crown sixty-five.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  That's right. <stage> (Puts it down.)</stage>  It's terrible what
a lot of butter we get through in this house.  Then there
was the smoked sausage, and the cheese &mdash; let me see &mdash;
<stage>(Writes)</stage> &mdash; and the ham &mdash; <stage>(Adds up.)</stage> Yes, that makes
just &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  And then the beer.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, to be sure.  <stage>(Writes.)</stage>  How it do mount up!
But we can't manage with no less.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  And then you and I didn't need anything hot
for dinner, as father was out.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No; that was so much to the good.  And then I
took eight crowns fifty for the photographs.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Really!  So much as that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Exactly eight crowns fifty.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[Silence. GINA takes up her sewing again,  HEDVIG
takes paper and pencil and begins to draw, shading
her eyes with her left hand.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Isn't it jolly to think that father is at Mr.
Werle's big dinner-party?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  You know he's not really Mr. Werle's guest.  It
was the son invited him.  (After a pause.)  We have nothing
to do with that Mr. Werle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I'm longing for father to come home.  He
promised to ask Mrs. Sorby for something nice for me.

<pb n="26"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, there's plenty of good things going in that
house, I can tell you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (goes on drawing).</stage><p>  And I believe I'm a little
hungry too.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[OLD EKDAL, with the paper parcel under his arm
and another parcel in his coat pocket, comes in
by the entrance door.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  How late you are to-day, grandfather!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  They had locked the office door.  Had to wait in
Graberg's room.  And then they let me through &mdash; h'm.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Did you get some more copying to do, grandfather?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  This whole packet.  Just look.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  That's capital.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  And you have another parcel in your pocket.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Eh?  Oh never mind, that's nothing. <stage>(Puts his
stick away in a corner.)</stage>  This work will keep me going a
long time, Gina.  <stage>(Opens one of the sliding-doors in the back
wall a little.)</stage>  Hush! <stage> (Peeps into the room for a moment,
then pushes the door carefully to again.)</stage>  Hee-hee!  They're
fast asleep, all the lot of them.  And she's gone into the
basket herself.  Hee-hee!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Are you sure she isn't cold in that basket,
grandfather?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Not a bit of it!  Cold?  With all that straw?
<stage>(Goes towards the farther door on the left.)</stage> There are
matches in here, I suppose.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  The matches is on the drawers.</p></sp>
<stage><p>                         [EKDAL goes into  his  room.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  It's nice that grandfather has got all that copying.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, poor old father; it means a bit of pocket-money for him.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  And he won't be able to sit the whole forenoon
down at that horrid Madam Eriksen's.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No more he won't.</p></sp>
            <stage> [Short silence.</stage>

<pb n="27"/>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Do you suppose they are still at the dinner-table?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Goodness knows; as like as not.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Think of all the delicious things father is having
to eat!   I'm certain he'll be in splendid spirits when he
comes.  Don't you think so, mother?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes; and if only we could tell him that we'd got
the room let &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  But we don't need that this evening.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, we'd be none the worst of it, I can tell you.
It's no use to us as it is.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I mean we don't need it this evening, for father
will be in a good humour at any rate.  It is best to keep
the letting of the room for another time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (looks across at her).</stage><p>  You like having some good
news to tell father when he comes home in the evening?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes; for then things are pleasanter somehow.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (thinking to herself).</stage><p>  Yes, yes, there's something
in that.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[OLD EKDAL comes in again and is going out by
the foremost door to the left.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (half turning in her chair).</stage><p>  Do you want something
out of the kitchen, grandfather?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Yes, yes, I do.  Don't you trouble.</p></sp>
 <stage> (Goes out.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  He's not poking away at the fire, is he? <stage> (Waits
a moment.)</stage>  Hedvig, go and see what he's about.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[EKDAL comes in again with a small jug of steaming
hot water.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Have you been getting some hot water, grandfather?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Yes, hot water.  Want it for something.  Want
to write, and the ink has got as thick as porridge &mdash; h'm.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But you'd best have your supper, first, grandfather.
It's laid in there.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Can't be bothered with supper, Gina.  Very

busy, I tell you.  No one's to come to my room.  No one
&mdash; h'm.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[He goes into his room; GINA and HEDVIG look
at each other.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (softly).</stage><p>  Can you imagine where he's got money
from?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  From Graberg, perhaps.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Not a bit of it.  Graberg always sends the money
to me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Then he must have got a bottle on credit somewhere.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Poor grandfather, who'd give him credit?</p></sp>
<stage><p>
HIALMAR EKDAL, in an overcoat and grey felt hat, comes in
from the right.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (throws down her sewing and rises).</stage><p>  Why, Ekdal,
Is that you already?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (at the same time jumping up).</stage><p>  Fancy your coming
so soon, father!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (taking off his hat).</stage><p>  Yes, most of the people
were coming away.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  So early?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, it was a dinner-party, you know.</p></sp>

[They draw off his coat; GINA hangs it up on the
back wall.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Were there many people there, father?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh no, not many.  We were about twelve or
fourteen at table.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  And you had some talk with them all?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh yes, a little; but Gregers took me up most
of the time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Is Gregers as ugly as ever?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, he's not very much to look at.  Hasn't

Hedvig  Yes, grandfather is in his room, writing.
</p></sp>

something about his having been with Graberg.  I'll go in
and see him for a moment.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, no, better not.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Why not?  Did he say he didn't want me to go

[OLD EKDAL, in an indoor coat and with a lighted

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, I have just come.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  You didn't see me, did you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, but they told me you had passed through

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  H'm, good of you, Hialmar. &mdash; Who were they,
all those fellows?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p> &mdash; Oh, all sorts of people.  There was Chamberlain
Flor, and Chamberlain Balle, and Chamberlain Kaspersen,

know who all &mdash;

<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (nodding).</stage><p>  Hear that, Gina!  Chamberlains every
one of them!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, I hear as they're terrible genteel in that house
nowadays.

<pb n="30"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Did the Chamberlains sing, father?  Or did
they read aloud?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, they only talked nonsense.  They wanted
me to recite something for them; but I knew better than
that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  You weren't to be persuaded, eh?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, you might have done it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No; one mustn't be at everybody's beck and
call.  (Walks about the room.)  That's not my way, at any
rate.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  No, no; Hialmar's not to be had for the asking,
he isn't.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I don't see why I should bother myself to
entertain people on the rare occasions when I go into society.
Let the others exert themselves.  These fellows go from one
great dinner-table to the next and gorge and guzzle day out
and day in.  It's for them to bestir themselves and do something
in return for all the good feeding they get.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But you didn't say that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (humming).</stage><p>  Ho-ho-ho &mdash; ; faith, I gave them
a bit of my mind.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Not the Chamberlains?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, why not?  (Lightly.)  After that, we had
a little discussion about Tokay.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Tokay!  There's a fine wine for you!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (comes to a standstill).</stage><p>  It may be a fine wine.
But of course you know the vintages differ; it all depends
on how much sunshine the grapes have had.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Why, you know everything, Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  And did they dispute that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  They tried to; but they were requested to
observe that it was just the same with Chamberlains &mdash; that
with them, too, different batches were of different qualities.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  What things you do think of!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Hee-hee!  So they got that in their pipes too?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Right in their teeth.

<pb n="31"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Do you hear that, Gina?  He said it right in
the very teeth of all the Chamberlains.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Fancy &mdash; !  Right in their teeth!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, but I don't want it talked about.  One
doesn't speak of such things.  The whole affair passed off
quite amicably of course.  They were nice, genial fellows;
I didn't want to wound them &mdash; not I!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Right in their teeth, though &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (caressingly).</stage><p>  How nice it is to see you in a
dress-coat!  It suits you so well, father.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, don't you think so?  And this one really
sits to perfection.  It fits almost as if it had been made
for me; &mdash; a little tight in the arm-holes perhaps; &mdash; help me,
Hedvig <stage>(takes off the coat).</stage>  I think I'll put on my
jacket.  Where is my jacket, Gina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Here it is. <stage> (Brings the jacket and helps  him.)</stage>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  That's it!  Don't forget to send the coat back
to Molvik first thing to-morrow morning.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (laying it away).</stage><p>  I'll be sure and see to it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (stretching himself).</stage><p>  After all, there's a more
homely feeling about this.  A free-and-easy indoor costume
suits my whole personality better.  Don't you think so,
Hedvig?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, father.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  When I loosen my necktie into a pair of flowing
ends &mdash; like this?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, that goes so well with your moustache and
the sweep of your curls.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I should not call them curls exactly; I should
rather say locks.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, they are too big for curls.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Locks describes them better.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (after a pause, twitching his jacket).</stage><p>  Father!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, what is it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, you know very well.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, really I don't &mdash;

<pb n="32"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (half laughing, half whispering).</stage><p>  Oh, yes, father;
now don't tease me any longer!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Why, what do you mean?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (shaking him).</stage><p>  Oh what nonsense; come, where
are they, father?  All the good things you promised me, you
know?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh &mdash; if I haven't forgotten all about them!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Now you're only teasing me, father!  Oh, it's
too bad of you!  Where have you put them?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, I positively forgot to get anything.  But
wait a little!  I have something else for you, Hedvig.</p></sp>
<stage>          [Goes and searches in the pockets of the coat.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (skipping and clapping her hands).</stage><p>  Oh mother,
mother!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  There, you see; if you only give him time &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (with a paper).</stage><p>  Look, here it is.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  That?  Why, that's only a paper.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  That is the bill of fare, my dear; the whole bill
of fare.  Here you see: "Menu" &mdash; that means bill of fare.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Haven't you anything else?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I forgot the other things, I tell you.  But you
may take my word for it, these dainties are very unsatisfying.
Sit down at the table and read the bill of fare, and
then I'll describe to you how the dishes taste.  Here you
are, Hedvig.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (gulping down her tears).</stage><p>  Thank you.</p></sp>
 <stage><p>(She
seats herself, but does not read; GINA makes signs to her;
HIALMAR notices it.)</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (pacing up and down the room).</stage><p>  It's monstrous
what absurd things the father of a family is expected to
think of; and if he forgets the smallest trifle, he is treated
to sour faces at once.  Well, well, one gets used to that too.
<stage>(Stops near the stove, by the old man's chair.)</stage>  Have you
peeped in there this evening, father?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Yes, to be sure I have.  She's gone into the
basket.

<pb n="33"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Ah, she has gone into the basket.  Then she's
beginning to get used to it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Yes; just as I prophesied.  But you know there
are still a few little things &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  A few improvements, yes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  They've got to be made, you know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, let us have a talk about the improvements,
father.  Come, let us sit on the sofa.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  All right.  H'm &mdash; think I'll just fill my pipe first.
Must clean it out, too.  H'm.</p></sp>
        <stage> [He goes into his room.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (smiling to HIALMAR).</stage><p>  His pipe!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh yes yes, Gina; let him alone &mdash; the poor
shipwrecked old man. &mdash; Yes, these improvements &mdash; we had
better get them out of hand to-morrow.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  You'll hardly have time to-morrow, Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (interposing).</stage><p>  Oh yes he will, mother!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  &mdash; for remember them prints that has to be
retouched; they've sent for them time after time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  There now!  those prints again!  I shall get
them finished all right!  Have any new orders come in?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, worse luck; to-morrow I have nothing but
those two sittings, you know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Nothing else?  Oh no, if people won't set about
things with a will &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But what more can I do?  Don't I advertise in
the papers as much as we can afford?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, the papers, the papers; you see how much
good they do.  And I suppose no one has been to look at the
room either?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, not yet.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  That was only to be expected.  If people won't
keep their eyes open &mdash; .  Nothing can be done without a
real effort, Gina!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (going towards him).</stage><p>  Shall I fetch you the flute,
father?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No; no flute for me; I want no pleasures in

<pb n="34"/>
this world. <stage> (Pacing about.)</stage>  Yes, indeed I will work to-morrow; you shall see if I don't.  You may be sure I shall
work as long as my strength holds out.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But my dear good Ekdal, I didn't mean it in that
way.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Father, mayn't I bring in a bottle of beer?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, certainly not.  I require nothing, nothing &mdash;
<stage>(Comes to a standstill.)</stage>  Beer?  Was it beer you
were talking about?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (cheerfully).</stage><p>  Yes, father; beautiful fresh beer.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well &mdash; since you insist upon it, you may bring
in a bottle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, do; and we'll be nice and cosy.</p></sp>
<stage>               [HEDVIG runs towards the kitchen door.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (by the stove, stops her, looks at her, puts his
arm round her neck and presses her to him).</stage><p>  Hedvig, Hedvig!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (with tears of joy).</stage><p>  My dear, kind father!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, don't call me that.  Here have I been
feasting at the rich man's table, &mdash; battening at the groaning
board &mdash; !  And I couldn't even &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (sitting at the table).</stage><p>  Oh, nonsense, nonsense, Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  It's not nonsense!  And yet you mustn't be too
hard upon me.  You know that I love you for all that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (throwing her arms round him).</stage><p>  And we love
you, oh, so dearly, father!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And if I am unreasonable once in a while, &mdash;
why then &mdash; you must remember that I am a man beset by a
host of cares.  There, there! <stage> (Dries his eyes.)</stage>  No beer at
such a moment as this.  Give me the flute.</p></sp>
<stage>               [HEDVIG runs to the bookcase and fetches it.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Thanks!  That's right.  With my flute in my
hand and you two at my side &mdash; ah &mdash; !</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HEDVIG seats herself at the table near GINA; HIALMAR
paces backwards and forwards, pipes up vigorously,

<pb n="35"/>
and plays a Bohemian peasant-dance, but
in a slow plaintive tempo, and with sentimental
expression.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (breaking off the melody, holds out his left hand
to GINA, and says with emotion):</stage><p> Our roof may be poor
and humble, Gina; but it is home.  And with all my heart
I say: here dwells my happiness.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[He begins to play again; almost immediately
after, a knocking is heard at the entrance door.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (rising).</stage><p>  Hush, Ekdal, &mdash; I think there's some one at
the door.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (laying the flute on the bookcase).</stage><p>  There!
Again!</p></sp>
                    <stage> [GINA goes and opens the door.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers Werle</speaker><stage> (in the passage).</stage><p>  Excuse me &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (starting back slightly).</stage><p>  Oh!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  &mdash; does not Mr. Ekdal, the photographer,
live here?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, he does.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (going towards the door).</stage><p>  Gregers!  You here
after all?  Well, come in then.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (coming in).</stage><p>  I told you I would come and look
you up.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  But this evening &mdash; ?  Have you left the
party?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I have left both the party and my father's
house. &mdash; Good evening, Mrs. Ekdal.  I don't know whether
you recognise me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh yes; it's not difficult to know young Mr. Werle
again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No, I am like my mother; and no doubt you
remember her.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Left your father's house, did you say?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, I have gone to a hotel.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Indeed.  Well, since you're here, take off your
coat and sit down.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Thanks.</p></sp>

<pb n="36"/>
<stage><p>
[He takes off his overcoat.  He is now dressed in a
plain grey suit of a countrified cut.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Here, on the sofa.  Make yourself comfortable.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[GREGERS seats himself on the sofa; HIALMAR
takes a chair at the table.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looking around him).</stage><p>  So these are your quarters,
Hialmar &mdash; this is your home.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  This is the studio, as you see &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But it's the largest of our rooms, so we generally
sit here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  We used to live in a better place; but this flat
has one great advantage: there are such capital outer
rooms
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  And we have a room on the other side of the
passage that we can let.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (to HIALMAR).</stage><p>  Ah &mdash; so you have lodgers too?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, not yet.  They're not so easy to find, you
see; you have to keep your eyes open.<stage> (To  HEDVIG.)</stage>
What about that beer, eh?</p></sp>
<stage>          [HEDVIG nods and goes out into the kitchen.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  So that is your daughter?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, that is Hedvig.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And she is your only child?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, the only one.  She is the joy of our lives,
and &mdash; <stage>(lowering his voice)</stage> &mdash; at the same time our deepest
sorrow, Gregers.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What do you mean?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  She is in serious danger oflosing her eyesight.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Becoming blind?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p> Yes. Only the first symptoms have appeared
as yet, and she may not feel it much for some time.  But
the doctor has warned us.  It is coming, inexorably.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What a terrible misfortune!  How do you
account for it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (sighs).</stage><p>  Hereditary, no doubt.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (starting).</stage><p>  Hereditary?

<pb n="37"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Ekdal's mother had weak eyes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, so my father says; I can't remember her.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Poor child!  And how does she take it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, you can imagine we haven't the heart to
tell her of it.  She dreams of no danger.  Gay and careless
and chirping like a little bird, she flutters onward into a
life of endless night. <stage> (Overcome.)</stage>  Oh, it is cruelly hard
on me, Gregers.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HEDVIG brings a tray with beer and glasses, which
she sets upon the table.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (stroking her hair).</stage><p>  Thanks, thanks, Hedvig.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HEDVIG puts her arm round his neck and whispers
in his ear.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>HIALMAR.</speaker><p>  No, no bread and butter just now. <stage> (Looks
up).</stage>  But perhaps you would like some, Gregers.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (with a gesture of refusal).</stage><p>  No, no thank you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (still melancholy).</stage><p>  Well, you can bring in a
little all the same.  If you have a crust, that is all I want.
And plenty of butter on it, mind.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HEDVIG nods gaily and goes out into the kitchen
again.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (who has been following her with his eyes).</stage><p>  She
seems quite strong and healthy otherwise.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes.  In other ways there's nothing amiss with
her, thank goodness.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  She promises to be very like you, Mrs. Ekdal.
How old is she now?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Hedvig is close on fourteen; her birthday is the
day after to-morrow.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  She is pretty tall for her age, then.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, she's shot up wonderful this last year.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  It makes one realise one's own age to see these
young people growing up. &mdash; How long is it now since you
were married?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  We've been married &mdash; let me see &mdash; just on fifteen
years.

<pb n="38"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Is it so long as that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (becomes attentive; looks at him).</stage><p>  Yes, it is
indeed.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, so it is.  Fifteen years all but a few
months.  (Changing his tone.)  They must have been long
years for you, up at the works, Gregers.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  They seemed long &mdash; while I was living them;
now they are over, I hardly know how the time has gone.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[OLD  EKDAL comes from his room without his
pipe, but with his old-fashioned uniform cap on
his head; his gait is somewhat unsteady.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Come now, Hialmar, let's sit down and have a
good talk about this &mdash; h'm &mdash; what was it again?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (going towards him).</stage><p>  Father, we have a visitor
here &mdash; Gregers Werle. &mdash; I don't know if you remember him.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (looking at GREGERS, who has risen).</stage><p>  Werle?  Is
that the son?  What does he want with me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Nothing; it's me he has come to see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Oh!  Then there's nothing wrong?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, no, of course not.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (with a large gesture).</stage><p>  Not that I'm afraid, you
know; but &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (goes over to him).</stage><p>  I bring you a greeting from
your old hunting-grounds, Lieutenant Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Hunting-grounds?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, up in Hoidal, about the works, you know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Oh, up there.  Yes, I knew all those places well
in the old days.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You were a great sportsman then.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  So I was, I don't deny it.  You're looking at my
uniform cap.  I don't ask anybody's leave to wear it in the
house.  So long as I don't go out in the streets with it &mdash; </p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HEDVIG brings a plate of bread and butter, which
she puts upon the table.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Sit down, father, and have a glass of beer.
Help yourself, Gregers.</p></sp>

<pb n="39"/>
<stage><p>
[EKDAL mutters and stumbles over to the sofa.
GREGERS seats himself on the chair nearest to
him, HIALMAR on the other side of GREGERS.
GINA sits a little way from the table, sewing;
HEDVIG stands beside her father.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Can you remember, Lieutenant Ekdal, how
Hialmar and I used to come up and visit you in the summer
and at Christmas?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Did you?  No, no, no; I don't remember it.
But sure enough I've been a tidy bit of a sportsman in my
day.  I've shot bears too.  I've shot nine of 'em, no less.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looking sympathetically at him).</stage><p>  And now you
never get any shooting?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Can't just say that, sir.  Get a shot now and
then perhaps.  Of course not in the old way.  For the
woods you see &mdash; the woods, the woods &mdash; !  <stage>(Drinks.)</stage>
Are the woods fine up there now?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Not so fine as in your time.  They have been
thinned a good deal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Thinned?  (More softly, and as if afraid.)  It's
dangerous work that.  Bad things come of it.  The woods
revenge themselves.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (filling up his glass).</stage><p>  Come &mdash; a little more,
father.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  How can a man like you &mdash; such a man for the
open air &mdash; live in the midst of a stuffy town, boxed within
four walls?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (laughs quietly and glances at HIALMAR).</stage><p>  Oh, it's
not so bad here.  Not at all so bad.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But don't you miss all the things that used to
be a part of your very being &mdash; the cool sweeping breezes,
the free life in the woods and on the uplands, among beasts
and birds &mdash; ?

</p></sp>

father; not this evening.

<pb n="40"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What does he want to show me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, it's only something &mdash; you can see it another
time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (continues, to the old man).</stage><p>  You see I have been
thinking, Lieutenant Ekdal, that you should come up with
me to the works; I am sure to be going back soon.  No
doubt you could get some copying there too.  And here,
you have nothing on earth to interest you &mdash; nothing to liven
you up.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (stares in astonishment at him).</stage><p>  Have I nothing
on earth to &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Of course you have Hialmar; but then he has
his own family.  And a man like you, who has always had
such a passion for what is free and wild &mdash;

<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (thumps the table).</stage><p>  Hialmar, he shall see it!

<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, do you think it's worth while, father?  It's
all dark.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Nonsense; it's moonlight. <stage> (Rises).</stage>  He shall see
it, I tell you.  Let me pass!  Come and help me, Hialmar.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh yes, do, father!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (rising).</stage><p>  Very well then.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (to GINA).</stage><p>  What is it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, nothing so very wonderful, after all.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[EKDAL and HIALMAR have gone to the back wall
and are each pushing back a side of the sliding
door; HEDVIG helps the old man; GREGERS remains
standing by the sofa; GINA sits still and
sews.  Through the open doorway a large, deep
irregular garret is seen with odd nooks and corners;
a couple of stove-pipes running through it,
from rooms below.  There are skylights through
which clear moonbeams shine in on some parts
of the great room; others lie in deep shadow.</p></stage>

like.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (going over to them).</stage><p>  Why, what is it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Look for yourself.  H'm.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (somewhat embarrassed).</stage><p>  This belongs to father,
you understand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (at the door, looks into the garret).</stage><p>  Why, you
keep poultry, Lieutenant Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Should think we did keep poultry.  They've gone
to roost now.  But you should just see our fowls by daylight,
sir!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  And there's a &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Sh &mdash; sh! don't say anything about it yet.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And you have pigeons too, I see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Oh yes, haven't we just got pigeons!  They have
their nest-boxes up there under the roof-tree; for pigeons
like to roost high, you see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  They aren't all common pigeons.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Common!  Should think not indeed!  We have
tumblers, and a pair of pouters, too.  But come here!  Can
you see that hutch down there by the wall?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes; what do you use it for?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  That's where the rabbits sleep, sir.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Dear me; so you have rabbits too?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Yes, you may take my word for it, we have
rabbits!  He wants to know if we have rabbits, Hialmar!
H'm!  But now comes the thing, let me tell you!  Here
we have it!  Move away, Hedvig.  Stand here; that's right,
&mdash; and now look down there. &mdash; Don't you see a basket with
straw in it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes.  And I can see a fowl lying in the basket.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  H'm &mdash; "a fowl"
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Isn't it a duck?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (hurt).</stage><p>  Why, of course it's a duck.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  But what kind of duck, do you think?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  It's not just a common duck &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Sh!

<pb n="42"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And it's not a Muscovy duck either.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  No, Mr. &mdash; Werle; it's not a Muscovy duck; for
it's a wild duck!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Is it really?  A wild duck?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Yes, that's what it is.  That  "fowl" as you call
it &mdash; is the wild duck.  It's our wild duck, sir.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  My wild duck.  It belongs to me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And can it live up here in the garret?  Does
it thrive?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Of course it has a trough of water to splash
about in, you know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Fresh water every other day.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (turning towards HIALMAR).</stage><p>  But my dear Ekdal,
it's getting icy cold here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  H'm, we had better shut up then.  It's as well
not to disturb their night's rest, too.  Close up, Hedvig.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HIALMAR and HEDVIG push the garret doors together.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Another time you shall see her properly.<stage> (Seats
himself in the arm-chair by the stove.)</stage>  Oh, they're curious
things, these wild ducks, I can tell you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  How did you manage to catch it, Lieutenant
Ekdal?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  I didn't catch it.  There's a certain man in this
town whom we have to thank for it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (starts slightly).</stage><p>  That man was not my father,
was he?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  You've hit it.  Your father and no one else.
H'm.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Strange that you should guess that, Gregers.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You were telling me that you owed so many
things to my father; and so I thought perhaps &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But we didn't get the duck from Mr. Werle himself &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  It's Hakon Werle we have to thank for her, all

<pb n="43"/>
the same, Gina.<stage> (To GREGERS.)</stage> He was shooting from a
boat, you see, and he brought her down.  But your father's
sight is not very good now.  H'm; she was only wounded.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Ah! She got a couple of slugs in her body, I
suppose.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, two or three.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  She was hit under the wing, so that she couldn't
fly.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And I suppose she dived to the bottom, eh?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (sleepily, in a thick voice).</stage><p>  Of course.  Always
do that, wild ducks do.  They shoot to the bottom as deep
as they can get, sir &mdash; and bite themselves fast in the tangle
and seaweed &mdash; and all the devil's own mess that grows down
there.  And they never come up again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But your wild duck came up again, Lieutenant
Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  He had such an amazingly clever dog, your
father had.  And that dog &mdash; he dived in after the duck and
fetched her up again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (who has turned to  HIALMAR).</stage><p>  And then she
was sent to you here?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Not at once; at first your father took her
home.  But she wouldn't thrive there; so Pettersen was told
to put an end to her &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (half asleep).</stage><p>  H'm &mdash; yes &mdash; Pettersen &mdash; that ass &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (speaking more softly).</stage><p>  That was how we got
her, you see; for father knows Pettersen a little; and when
he heard about the wild duck he got him to hand her over
to us.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And now she thrives as well as possible in the
garret there?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, wonderfully well.  She has got fat.  You
see, she has lived in there so long now that she has forgotten
her natural wild life; and it all depends on that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You are right there, Hialmar.  Be sure you

<pb n="44"/>
never let her get a glimpse of the sky and the sea &mdash; .
But I mustn't stay any longer; I think your father is
asleep.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, as for that &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But, by-the-bye &mdash; you said you had a room to
let &mdash; a spare room?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes; what then?  Do you know of anybody &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Can I have that room?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  You?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh no, Mr. Werle, you &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  May I have the room?  If so, I'll take possession
first thing to-morrow morning.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, with the greatest pleasure &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But, Mr. Werle, I'm sure it's not at all the sort
of room for you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Why, Gina! how can you say that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Why, because the room's neither large enough
nor light enough, and &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  That really doesn't matter, Mrs. Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I call it quite a nice room, and not at all badly
furnished either.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But remember the pair of them underneath.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What pair?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Well, there's one as has been a tutor &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  That's Molvik &mdash; Mr.  Molvik, B.A.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  And then there's a doctor, by the name of Relling.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Relling?  I know him a little; he practised for
a time up in Hoidal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  They're a regular rackety pair, they are.  As often
as not, they're out on the loose in the evenings; and then
they come home at all hours, and they're not always just &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  One soon gets used to that sort of thing.  I daresay
I shall be like the wild duck &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  H'm; I think you ought to sleep upon it first, anyway.

<pb n="45"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You seem very unwilling to have me in the
house, Mrs. Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, no!  What makes you think that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, you really behave strangely about it,
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p> <stage>(To GREGERS.)</stage> Then I suppose you intend to remain
in the town for the present?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (putting on his overcoat).</stage><p>  Yes, now I intend to
remain here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And yet not at your father's?  What do you
propose to do, then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Ah, if I only knew that, Hialmar, I shouldn't
be so badly off!  But when one has the misfortune to be
called Gregers &mdash; !  "Gregers" &mdash; and then "Werle" after it;
did you ever hear anything so hideous?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, I don't think so at all.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Ugh!  Bah!  I feel I should like to spit upon
the fellow that answers to such a name.  But when a man
is once for all doomed to be Gregers &mdash; Werle in this world,
as I am &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (laughs).</stage><p>  Ha, ha!  If you weren't Gregers
Werle, what would you like to be?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  If I should choose, I should like best to be a
clever dog.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  A dog!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (involuntarily).</stage><p>  Oh, no!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, an amazingly clever dog; one that goes to
the bottom after wild ducks when they dive and bite themselves
fast in tangle and sea-weed, down among the ooze.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Upon my word now, Gregers &mdash; I don't in the
least know what you're driving at.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, well, you might not be much the wiser if
you did.  It's understood, then, that I move in early to-morrow morning. <stage> (To GINA.)</stage>  I won't give you any
trouble; I do everything for myself. <stage> (To HIALMAR.)</stage>  We
can talk about the rest to-morrow. &mdash; Good-night, Mrs. Ekdal.
<stage>(Nods to HEDVIG.)</stage> Good-night.

<pb n="46"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Good-night, Mr. Werle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Good-night.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (who has lighted a candle).</stage><p>  Wait a moment, I
must show you a light; the stairs are sure to be dark.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[GREGERS and HIALMAR go out by the passage
door.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (looking straight before her, with her sewing in her
lap).</stage><p>  Wasn't that queer-like talk about wanting to be a
dog?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Do you know, mother &mdash; I believe he meant something
quite different by that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Why, what should he mean?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, I don't know; but it seemed to me he meant
something different from what he said &mdash; all the time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Do you think so?  Yes, it was sort of queer.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (comes back).</stage><p>  The lamp was still burning.
<stage>(Puts out the candle and sets it down).</stage>  Ah, now one can get
a mouthful of food at last. <stage> (Begins to eat the bread and
butter.)</stage>  Well, you see, Gina &mdash; if only you keep your eyes
open &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  How, keep your eyes open &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Why, haven't we at last had the luck to get the
room let?  And just think &mdash; to a person like Gregers &mdash; a good
old friend.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Well, I don't know what to say about it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, mother, you'll see; it'll be such fun!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  You're very strange.  You were so bent upon
getting the room let before; and now you don't like it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes I do, Ekdal; if it had only been to some one
else &mdash;  But what do you suppose Mr. Werle will say?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Old Werle?  It doesn't concern him.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But surely you can see that there's something amiss
between them again, or the young man wouldn't be leaving
home.  You know very well those two can't get on with each
other.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Very likely not, but &mdash;

<pb n="47"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  And now Mr. Werle may fancy it's you that has
egged him on &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Let him fancy so, then!  Mr. Werle has done a
great deal for me; far be it from me to deny it.  But that
doesn't make me everlastingly dependent upon him.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But, my dear Ekdal, maybe grandfather'll suffer
for it.  He may lose the little bit of work he gets from
Graberg.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I could almost say: so much the better!  Is it
not humiliating for a man like me to see his grey-haired father
treated as a pariah?  But now I believe the fulness of time
is at hand. <stage> (Takes a fresh piece of bread and butter.)</stage>  As
sure as I have a mission in life, I mean to fulfil it now!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, yes, father, do!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Hush!  Don't wake him!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (more softly).</stage><p>  I will fulfil it, I say.  The day
shall come when &mdash;  And that is why I say it's a good thing
we have let the room; for that makes me more independent,
The man who has a mission in life must be independent.
<stage>(By the arm-chair, with emotion.)</stage> Poor old white-haired
father!  Rely on your Hialmar.  He has broad shoulders &mdash;
strong shoulders, at any rate.  You shall yet wake up some
fine day and &mdash; <stage> (To GINA.)</stage>  Do you not believe it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (rising).</stage><p>  Yes, of course I do; but in the meantime
suppose we see about getting him to bed.

<stage><p>
HIALMAR EKDAL'S studio.  It is morning: the daylight shines
through the large window in the slanting roof; the curtain
is drawn back.
</p><p>HIALMAR is sitting at the table, busy retouching a photograph;
several others lie before him.  Presently GINA,
wearing her hat and cloak, enters by the passage door;
she has a covered basket on her arm.</p></stage>

<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Back already, Gina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, yes, one can't let the grass grow under one's
feet.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[Sets her basket on a chair, and takes off her
things.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Did you look in at Gregers' room?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, that I did.  It's a rare sight, I can tell you;
he's made a pretty mess to start off with.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  How so?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  He was determined to do everything for himself,
he said; so he sets to work to light the stove, and what must
he do but screw down the damper till the whole room is full
of smoke.  Ugh!  There was a smell fit to &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, really!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But that's not the worst of it; for then he thinks
he'll put out the fire, and goes and empties his water-jug
into the stove, and so makes the whole floor one filthy puddle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  How annoying!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I've got the porter's wife to clear up after him, pig

<pb n="49"/>
that he is!  But the room won't be fit to live in till the
afternoon.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What's he doing with himself in the meantime?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  He said he was going out for a little while.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I looked in upon him, too, for a moment &mdash; after
you had gone.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  So I heard.  You've asked him to lunch.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Just to a little bit of early lunch, you know.
It's his first day &mdash; we can hardly do less.  You've got something
in the house, I suppose?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I shall have to find something or other.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And don't cut it too fine, for I fancy Relling
and Molvik are coming up, too.  I just happened to meet
Relling on the stairs, you see; so I had to &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, are we to have those two as well?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Good Lord &mdash; a couple more or less can't make
any difference.
Old Ekdal (opens his door and looks in).  I say, Hialmar &mdash;
<stage> (Sees GINA.)</stage>  Oh!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Do you want anything, grandfather?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p> Oh, no, it doesn't matter.

doesn't go out.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  All right, all right.  And, Gina, a little herring-salad wouldn't be a bad idea; Relling and Molvik were out
on the loose again last night.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  If only they don't come before I'm ready for
them &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, of course they won't; take your own time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Very well; and meanwhile you can be working a
bit.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I thought you were writing.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Oh, devil take it! can't Graberg wait a day or
two?  After all, it's not a matter of life and death.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No; and you're not his slave either.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  And about that other business in there &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Just what I was thinking of.  Do you want to
go in?  Shall I open the door for you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Well, it wouldn't be a bad notion.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (rises).</stage><p>  Then we'd have that off our hands.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Yes, exactly.  It's got to be ready first thing to-morrow.  It is to-morrow, isn't it?  H'm?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p> Yes, of course it's to-morrow.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HIALMAR and EKDAL push aside each his half of
the sliding door.  The morning sun is shining in
through the skylights; some doves are flying
about; others sit cooing, upon the perches; the
hens are heard clucking now and then, further
back in the garret.</p></stage>

<pb n="51"/>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  There; now you can get to work, father.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (goes in).</stage><p>  Aren't you coming, too?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, really, do you know &mdash; ; I almost
think &mdash; <stage> (Sees GINA at the kitchen door.)</stage>  I?  No; I
haven't time; I must work. &mdash; But now for our new contrivance &mdash; </p></sp>
<stage><p>
[He pulls a cord, a curtain slips down inside, the
lower part consisting of a piece of old sailcloth,
the upper part of a stretched fishing net.  The
floor of the garret is thus no longer visible.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (goes to the table).</stage><p>  So!  Now, perhaps I can
sit in peace for a little while.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Is he rampaging in there again?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Would you rather have had him slip down to
Madam Eriksen's? <stage> (Seats himself.)</stage>  Do you want anything?
You know you said &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I only wanted to ask if you think we can lay the
table for lunch here?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes; we have no early appointment, I suppose?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, I expect no one to-day except those two sweethearts
that are to be taken together.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Why the deuce couldn't they be taken together
another day!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Don't you know, I told them to come in the
afternoon, when you are having your nap.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, that's capital.  Very well, let us have lunch
here then.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  All right; but there's no hurry about laying the
cloth; you can have the table for a good while yet.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Do you think I am not sticking at my work?
I'm at it as hard as I can!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Then you'll be free later on, you know.</p></sp>
<stage>          [Goes out into the kitchen again.  Short pause.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (in the garret doorway, behind the net).</stage><p>  Hialmar!

<pb n="52"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Afraid we shall have to move the water-trough,
after all.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What else have I been saying all along?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  H'm &mdash; h'm &mdash; h'm.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[Goes away from the door again.  HIALMAR goes
on working a little; glances towards the garret
and half rises.  HEDVIG comes in from the
kitchen.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (sits down again hurriedly).</stage><p>  What do you
want?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I only wanted to come in beside you, father.
Hialmar(after a pause).  What makes you go prying
around like that?  Perhaps you are told off to watch me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, no.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What is your mother doing out there?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, mother's in the middle of making the herring-salad.  (Goes to the table).  Isn't there any little thing
I could help you with, father?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, no.  It is right that I should bear the
whole burden &mdash; so long as my strength holds out.  Set your
mind at rest, Hedvig; if only your father keeps his
health &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, no, father!  You mustn't talk in that horrid
way.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[She wanders about a little, stops by the doorway
and looks into the garret.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Tell me, what is he doing?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I think he's making a new path to the water-trough.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  He can never manage that by himself!  And
here am I doomed to sit &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (goes to him).</stage><p>  Let me take the brush, father;
I can do it, quite well.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, nonsense; you will only hurt your eyes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Not a bit.  Give me the brush.

<pb n="53"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (rising).</stage><p>  Well, it won't take more than a minute
or two.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Pooh, what harm can it do then? <stage> (Takes the
brush.)</stage>  There! <stage> (Seats herself.)</stage> I can begin upon this
one.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  But mind you don't hurt your eyes!  Do you
hear?  I won't be answerable; you do it on your own responsibility &mdash;
understand that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (retouching).</stage><p>  Yes, yes, I understand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  You are quite clever at it, Hedvig.  Only a
minute or two, you know.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[He slips through by the edge of the curtain into
the garret. HEDVIG sits at her work. HIALMAR
and EKDAL are heard disputing inside.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (appears behind the net).</stage><p>  I say, Hedvig &mdash; give
me those pincers that are lying on the shelf.  And the chisel.
<stage>(Turns away inside.)</stage> Now you shall see, father.  Just let
me show you first what I mean!</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HEDVIG  has fetched the required tools from the
shelf, and hands them to him through the net.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Ah, thanks.  I didn't come a moment too soon.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[Goes back from the curtain again; they are heard
carpentering and talking inside.  HEDVIG stands
looking in at them.  A moment later there is a
knock at the passage door; she does not notice it.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers Werle</speaker><stage> (bareheaded, in indoor dress, enters and
stops near the door).</stage><p>  H'm &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (turns and goes towards him).</stage><p>  Good morning.
Please come in.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Thank you. <stage> (Looking towards the garret.)</stage>
You seem to have workpeople in the house.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, it is only father and grandfather.  I'll tell
them you are here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No, no, don't do that; I would rather wait a
little.</p></sp>
                          <stage>  [Seats himself on the sofa.</stage>

<pb n="54"/>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  It looks so untidy here &mdash; </p></sp>
<stage>          [Begins to clear away the photographs.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, don't take them away.  Are those prints
that have to be finished off?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, they are a few I was helping father with.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Please don't let me disturb you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, no.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[She gathers the things to her and sits down to
work; GREGERS looks at her, meanwhile, in silence.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Did the wild duck sleep well last night?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, I think so, thanks.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (turning towards the garret).</stage><p>  It looks quite different
by day from what it did last night in the moonlight.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, it changes ever so much.  It looks different
in the morning and in the afternoon; and it's different on
rainy days from what it is in fine weather.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Have you noticed that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, how could I help it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Are you, too, fond of being in there with the
wild duck?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, when I can manage it &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But I suppose you haven't much spare time;
you go to school, no doubt.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, not now; father is afraid of my hurting my
eyes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh; then he reads with you himself?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Father has promised to read with me; but he has
never had time yet.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Then is there nobody else to give you a little
help?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, there is Mr. Molvik; but he is not always
exactly &mdash; quite &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Sober?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, I suppose that's it!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Why, then you must have any amount of time

<pb n="55"/>
on your hands.  And in there I suppose it is a sort      world
by itself?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, yes, quite.  And there are such lots of wonderful
things.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Indeed?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, there are big cupboards full of books; and
a great many of the books have pictures in them.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Aha!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  And there's an old bureau with drawers and
flaps, and a big clock with figures that go out and in.  But
the clock isn't going now.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  So time has come to a standstill in there &mdash; in
the wild duck's domain.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes.  And then there's an old paint-box and
things of that sort; and all the books.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And you read the books, I suppose?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, yes, when I get the chance.  Most of them
are English though, and I don't understand English.  But
then I look at the pictures. &mdash; There is one great big book
called "Harrison's History of London."<ref target="note2">*</ref>  It must be a hundred
years old; and there are such heaps of pictures in it.
At the beginning there is Death with an hour-glass and a
woman.  I think that is horrid.  But then there are all the
other pictures of churches, and castles, and streets, and great
ships sailing on the sea.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But tell me, where did all those wonderful things
come from?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, an old sea captain once lived here, and he
brought them home with him.  They used to call him "The
Flying Dutchman."  That was curious, because he wasn't
a Dutchman at all.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Was he not?</p></sp>

<p>*</p><note place="foot" id="note2"><seg type="note-symbol">A</seg> <p>New and Universal History of the Cities of London and

<pb n="56"/>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No. But at last he was drowned at sea; and so
he left all those things behind him.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Tell me now &mdash; when you are sitting in there
looking at the pictures, don't you wish you could travel and
see the real world for yourself?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, no!  I mean always to stay at home and
help father and mother.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  To retouch photographs?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, not only that.  I should love above everything
to learn to engrave pictures like those in the English
books.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  H'm.  What does your father say to that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I don't think father likes it; father is strange
about such things.  Only think, he talks of my learning
basket-making, and straw-plaiting!  But I don't think that
would be much good.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, no, I don't think so either.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  But father was right in saying that if I had
learnt basket-making I could have made the new basket
for the wild duck.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  So you could; and it was you that ought to
have done it, wasn't it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, for it's my wild duck.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Of course it is.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, it belongs to me.  But I lend it to father
and grandfather as often as they please.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Indeed?  What do they do with it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, they look after it, and build places for it,
and so on.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I see; for no doubt the wild duck is by far the
most distinguished inhabitant of the garret?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, indeed she is; for she is a real wild fowl,
you know.  And then she is so much to be pitied; she has no
one to care for, poor thing.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  She has no family, as the rabbits have &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No. The hens too, many of them, were chickens

<pb n="57"/>
together; but she has been taken right away from all her
friends.  And then there is so much that is strange about the
wild duck.  Nobody knows her, and nobody knows where
she came from either.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And she has been down in the depths of the
sea.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (with a quick glance at him, represses a smile and
asks):</stage><p> Why do you say "depths of the sea"?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What else should I say?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  You could say "the bottom of the sea."<ref target="note3">*</ref>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, mayn't I just as well say the depths of the
sea?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes; but it sounds so strange to me when other
people speak of the depths of the sea.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Why so?  Tell me why?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, I won't; it's so stupid.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, no, I am sure it's not.  Do tell me why you
smiled.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Well, this is the reason: whenever I come to
realise suddenly &mdash; in a flash &mdash; what is in there, it always
seems to me that the whole room and everything in it should
be called "the depths of the sea."  But that is so stupid.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You mustn't say that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, yes, for you know it is only a garret.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looks fixedly at her).</stage><p>  Are you so sure of that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (astonished).</stage><p>  That it's a garret?

<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Are you quite certain of it?</p></sp>

things.</p></stage>

the cloth during what follows. GREGERS seats
himself in the arm-chair, and turns over an album.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I hear you can retouch, Mrs. Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (with a side glance).</stage><p>  Yes, I can.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  That was exceedingly lucky.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  How &mdash; lucky?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Since Ekdal took to photography, I mean.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Mother can take photographs, too.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, yes; I was bound to learn that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  So it is really you that carry on the business, I
suppose?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, when Ekdal hasn't time himself &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  He is a great deal taken up with his old father,
I daresay.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes; and then you can't expect a man like Ekdal
to do nothing but take car-de-visits of Dick, Tom and
Harry.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I quite agree with you; but having once gone
in for the thing &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  You can surely understand, Mr. Werle, that Ekdal's
not like one of your common photographers.
</p></sp>

let us know? </p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (showing a double-barrelled pistol).</stage><p>  Oh, only
with this thing.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, you and grandfather will do yourselves a
mischief some day with that there pigstol.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (with irritation).</stage><p>  I believe I have told you that
this kind of firearm is called a pistol.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, that doesn't make it much better, that I can
see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  So you have become a sportsman, too, Hialmar?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Only a little rabbit-shooting now and then.
Mostly to please father, you understand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Men are strange beings; they must always have
something to pervert theirselves with.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (snappishly).</stage><p>  Just so; we must always have
something to divert ourselves with.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, that's just what I say.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  H'm. <stage> (To GREGERS).</stage>  You see the garret is
fortunately so situated that no one can hear us shooting.
<stage>(Lays the pistol on the top shelf of the bookcase.)</stage>  Don't
touch the pistol, Hedvig!  One of the barrels is loaded; remember
that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looking through the net).</stage><p>  You have a fowling-piece too, I see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  That is father's old gun.  It's of no use now;
something has gone wrong with the lock.  But it's fun to
have it all the same; for we can take it to pieces now and
then, and clean and grease it, and screw it together again. &mdash;
Of course, it's mostly father that fiddle-faddles with all that
sort of thing.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (beside GREGERS).</stage><p>  Now you can see the wild
duck properly.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I was just looking at her.  One of her wings
seems to me to droop a bit.

<pb n="60"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Well, no wonder; her wing was broken, you
know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And she trails one foot a little.  Isn't that so?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Perhaps a very little bit.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, it was by that foot the dog took hold of
her.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  But otherwise she hasn't the least thing the
matter with her; and that is simply marvellous for a creature
that has a charge of shot in her body, and has been between
a dog's teeth &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (with a glance at HEDVIG) &mdash; and</stage><p> that has lain
in the depths of the sea &mdash; so long.

a lot of fuss you do make over her.

<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  H'm; &mdash; will lunch soon be ready?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, directly.  Hedvig, you must come and help
me now.</p></sp>
<stage>          [GINA and HEDVIG go out into the kitchen.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (in a low voice).</stage><p>  I think you had better not
stand there looking in at father; he doesn't like it.<stage> (GREGERS
moves away from the garret door.)</stage>  Besides, I may as well
shut up before the others come. <stage> (Claps his hands to drive
the fowls back.)</stage>  Shh &mdash; shh, in with you! <stage> (Draws up the
curtain and pulls the doors together.)</stage>  All the contrivances
are my own invention.  It's really quite amusing to have
things of this sort to potter with, and to put to rights when
they get out of order.  And it's absolutely necessary, too;
for Gina objects to having rabbits and fowls in the studio.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  To be sure; and I suppose the studio is your
wife's special department?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  As a rule, I leave the everyday details of busihess
to her; for then I can take refuge in the parlour and
give my mind to more important things.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What things may they be, Hialmar?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I wonder you have not asked that question

<pb n="61"/>
sooner.  But perhaps you haven't heard of the invention?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  The invention?  No.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Really?  Have you not?  Oh, no, out there in
the wilds &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  So you have invented something, have you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  It is not quite completed yet; but I am working
at it.  You can easily imagine that when I resolved to devote
myself to photography, it wasn't simply with the idea
of taking likenesses of all sorts of commonplace people.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No; your wife was saying the same thing just
now.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I swore that if I consecrated my powers to this
handicraft, I would so exalt it that it should become both
an art and a science.  And to that end I determined to make
this great invention.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And what is the nature of the invention?  What
purpose does it serve?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, my dear fellow, you mustn't ask for details
yet.  It takes time, you see.  And you must not think that
my motive is vanity.  It is not for my own sake that I am
working.  Oh, no; it is my life's mission that stands before
me night and day.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What is your life's mission?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Do you forget the old man with the silver hair?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Your poor father?  Well, but what can you do
for him?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I can raise up his self-respect from the dead,
by restoring the name of Ekdal to honour and dignity.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Then that is your life's mission?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes.  I will rescue the shipwrecked man.  For
shipwrecked he was, by the very first blast of the storm.
Even while those terrible investigations were going on, he
was no longer himself.  That pistol there &mdash; the one we use
to shoot rabbits with &mdash; has played its part in the tragedy of
the house of Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  The pistol?  Indeed?

<pb n="62"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  When the sentence of imprisonment was passed
&mdash; he had the pistol in his hand &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Had he &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes; but he dared not use it.  His courage
failed him.  So broken, so demoralised was he even then!
Oh, can you understand it?  He, a soldier; he, who had shot
nine bears, and who was descended from two lieutenant-colonels &mdash; one after the other, of course.  Can you understand
it, Gregers?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, I understand it well enough.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I cannot.  And once more the pistol played a
part in the history of our house.  When he had put on the
grey clothes and was under lock and key &mdash; oh, that was a
terrible time for me, I can tell you.  I kept the blinds drawn
down over both my windows.  When I peeped out, I saw
the sun shining as if nothing had happened.  I could not
understand it.  I saw people going along the street, laughing
and talking about indifferent things.  I could not understand
it.  It seemed to me that the whole of existence must be at
a standstill &mdash; as if under an eclipse.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I felt that, too, when my mother died.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  It was in such an hour that Hialmar Ekdal
pointed the pistol at his own breast.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You, too, thought of &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But you did not fire?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No. At the decisive moment I won the victory
over myself.  I remained in life.  But I can assure you it
takes some courage to choose life under circumstances like
those.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Well, that depends on how you look at it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, indeed, it takes courage.  But I am glad
I was firm: for now I shall soon perfect my invention; and
Dr. Relling thinks, as I do myself, that father may be allowed
to wear his uniform again.  I will demand that as
my sole reward.

<pb n="63"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  So that is what he meant about his uniform &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, that is what he most yearns for.  You
can't think how my heart bleeds for him.  Every time we
celebrate any little family festival &mdash; Gina's and my wedding-day, or whatever it may be &mdash; in comes the old man in the
lieutenant's uniform of happier days.  But if he only hears
a knock at the door &mdash; for he daren't show himself to
strangers, you know &mdash; he hurries back to his room again as
fast as his old legs can carry him.  Oh, it's heart-rending
for a son to see such things!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  How long do you think it will take you to finish
your invention?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Come now, you mustn't expect me to enter into
particulars like that.  An invention is not a thing completely
under one's own control.  It depends largely on inspiration
&mdash; on intuition &mdash; and it is almost impossible to predict when
the inspiration may come.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But it's advancing?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, certainly, it is advancing.  I turn it over in
my mind every day; I am full of it.  Every afternoon, when
I have had my dinner, I shut myself up in the parlour, where
I can ponder undisturbed.  But I can't be goaded to it;
it's not a bit of good; Relling says so, too.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And you don't think that all that business in
the garret draws you off and distracts you too much?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, no, no; quite the contrary.  You mustn't
say that.  I cannot be everlastingly absorbed in the same
laborious train of thought.  I must have something alongside
of it to fill up the time of waiting.  The inspiration, the intuition,
you see &mdash; when it comes, it comes, and there's an
end of it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  My dear Hialmar, I almost think you have
something of the wild duck in you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Something of the wild duck?  How do you
mean?

<pb n="64"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You have dived down and bitten yourself fast
in the undergrowth.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Are you alluding to the well-nigh fatal shot
that has broken my father's wing &mdash; and mine, too?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Not exactly to that.  I don't say that your wing
has been broken; but you have strayed into a poisonous
marsh, Hialmar; an insidious disease has taken hold of you,
and you have sunk down to die in the dark.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I?  To die in the dark?  Look here, Gregers,
you must really leave off talking such nonsense.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Don't be afraid; I shall find a way to help you
up again.  I, too, have a mission in life now; I found it
yesterday.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  That's all very well; but you will please leave
me out of it.  I can assure you that &mdash; apart from my very
natural melancholy, of course &mdash; I am as contented as any one
can wish to be.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Your contentment is an effect of the marsh
poison.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Now, my dear Gregers, pray do not go on
about disease and poison; I am not used to that sort of talk.
In my house nobody ever speaks to me about unpleasant
things.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Ah, that I can easily believe.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  It's not good for me, you see.  And there are
no marsh poisons here, as you express it.  The poor photographer's
roof is lowly, I know &mdash; and my circumstances
are narrow.  But I am an inventor, and I am the bread-winner of a family.  That exalts me above my mean surroundings. &mdash;
Ah, here comes lunch!</p></sp>
<stage><p>
GINA and HEDVIG bring bottles of ale, a decanter of brandy,
glasses, etc.  At the same time, RELLING and MOLVIK
enter from the passage; they are both without hat or
overcoat.  MOLVIK is dressed in black.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (placing the things upon the table).</stage><p>  Ah, you two
have come in the nick of time.

<pb n="65"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Molvik got it into his head that he could smell
herring-salad, and then there was no holding him. &mdash; Good
morning again, Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Gregers, let me introduce you to Mr. Molvik.
Doctor &mdash;  Oh, you know Relling, don't you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, slightly.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Oh, Mr. Werle, junior!  Yes, we two have had
one or two little skirmishes up at the Hoidal works.  You've
just moved in?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I moved in this morning.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Molvik and I live right under you; so you
haven't far to go for the doctor and the clergyman, if you
should need anything in that line.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Thanks, it's not quite unlikely; for yesterday
we were thirteen at table.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, come now, don't let us get upon unpleasant
subjects again!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  You may make your mind easy, Ekdal; I'll be
hanged if the finger of fate points to you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I should hope not, for the sake of my family.
But let us sit down now, and eat and drink and be merry.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Shall we not wait for your father?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, his lunch will be taken in to him later.
Come along!</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[The men seat themselves at table, and eat and
drink.  GINA and HEDVIG go in and out and
wait upon them.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Molvik was frightfully screwed yesterday, Mrs.
Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Really?  Yesterday again?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Didn't you hear him when I brought him home
last night?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, I can't say I did.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  That was a good thing, for Molvik was disgusting
last night.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Is that true, Molvik?

<pb n="66"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Molvik.</speaker><p>  Let us draw a veil over last night's proceedings.
That sort of thing is totally foreign to my better self.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling</speaker><stage> (to GREGERS).</stage><p>  It comes over him like a sort of
possession, and then I have to go out on the loose with him.
Mr. Molvik is daemonic, you see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Daemonic?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Molvik is daemonic, yes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  H'm.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  And daemonic natures are not made to walk
straight through the world; they must meander a little now
and then. &mdash; Well, so you still stick up there at those horrible
grimy works?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I have stuck there until now.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  And did you ever manage to collect that claim
you went about presenting?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Claim? <stage> (Understands him.)</stage>  Ah, I see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Have you been presenting claims, Gregers?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, nonsense.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Faith, but he has, though!  He went round to
all the cotters' cabins presenting something he called "the
claim of the ideal."
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I was young then.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  You're right; you were very young.  And as for
the claim of the ideal &mdash; you never got it honoured while I
was up there.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Nor since either.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Ah, then you've learnt to knock a little discount
off, I expect.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Never, when I have a true man to deal with.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, I should think not, indeed.  A little butter,
Gina.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  And a slice of bacon for Molvik.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Molvik.</speaker><p>  Ugh; not bacon!</p></sp>
<stage>                         [A knock at the garret door.</stage>

Shot a big one.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And you've gone and skinned it without waiting
for me &mdash; !
</p></sp>

<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  To the grey-haired &mdash; <stage> (Drinks.)</stage>  By-the-bye,
is his hair grey or white?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Something between the two, I fancy; for that
matter, he has very few hairs left of any colour.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Well, well, one can get through the world with
a wig.  After all, you are a happy man, Ekdal; you have
your noble mission to labour for &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And I do labour, I can tell you.

quietly in and out in her felt slippers, with that see-saw walk
of hers, and making everything cosy and comfortable about
you &mdash;

helpmate on the path of life.

poor affair it will be; only a little festivity in the garret &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, but that's just what I like!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p> Just you wait till the wonderful invention sees
the light, Hedvig!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, indeed &mdash; then you shall see &mdash; !  Hedvig,
I have resolved to make your future secure.  You shall live
in comfort all your days.  I will demand &mdash; something or
other &mdash; on your behalf.  That shall be the poor inventor's
sole reward.

pleasant, for once in a way, to sit at a well-spread table in
a happy family circle?

is it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I ought to have taken a stand against you when
the trap was set for Lieutenant Ekdal.  I ought to have cautioned
him; for I had a misgiving as to what was in the
wind.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Yes, that was the time to have spoken.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I did not dare to, I was so cowed and spiritless.
I was mortally afraid of you &mdash; not only then, but long afterwards.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  You have got over that fear now, it appears.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, fortunately.  The wrong done to old Ekdal,
both by me and by &mdash; others, can never be undone; but
Hialmar I can rescue from all the falsehood and deception
that are bringing him to ruin.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Do you think that will be doing him a kindness?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I have not the least doubt of it.

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  You think our worthy photographer is the sort of
man to appreciate such friendly offices?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, I do.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  H'm &mdash; we shall see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Besides, if I am to go on living, I must try to
find some cure for my sick conscience.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  It will never be sound.  Your conscience has been
sickly from childhood.  That is a legacy from your mother,
Gregers &mdash; the only one she left you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (with a scornful half-smile).</stage><p>  Have you not yet
forgiven her for the mistake you made in supposing she
would bring you a fortune?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Don't let us wander from the point. &mdash; Then you
hold to your purpose of setting young Ekdal upon what you
imagine to be the right scent?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, that is my fixed resolve.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Well, in that case I might have spared myself this
visit; for, of course, it is useless to ask whether you will return
home with me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Quite useless.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  And I suppose you won't enter the firm either?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  Very good.  But as I am thinking of marrying
again, your share in the property will fall to you at once.<ref target="note4">*</ref>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (quickly).</stage><p>  No, I do not want that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  You don't want it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No, I dare not take it, for conscience' sake.

<sp><speaker>Werle</speaker><stage> (after a pause).</stage><p>  Are you going up to the works
again?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No; I consider myself released from your service.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Werle.</speaker><p>  But what are you going to do?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Only to fulfil my mission; nothing more.</p></sp>

<stage><p>
HIALMAR EKDAL'S studio.  A photograph has just been
taken; a camera with the cloth over it, a pedestal, two
chairs, a folding table, etc., are standing out in the
room.  Afternoon light; the sun is going down; a little
later it begins to grow dusk.
</p><p>GINA stands in the passage doorway, with a little box and
a wet glass plate in her hand, and is speaking to somebody
outside.</p></stage>

<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, certainly.  When I make a promise I keep
it.  The first dozen shall be ready on Monday.  Good afternoon.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[Someone is heard going downstairs.  GINA shuts
the door, slips the plate into the box, and puts
it into the covered camera.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (comes in from the kitchen).</stage><p>  Are they gone?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (tidying up).</stage><p>  Yes, thank goodness, I've got rid of
them at last.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  But can you imagine why father hasn't come
home yet?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Are you sure he's not down in Relling's room?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, he's not; I ran down the kitchen stair just
now and asked.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  And his dinner standing and getting cold, too.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, I can't understand it.  Father's always so
careful to be home to dinner!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, he'll be here directly, you'll see.

<pb n="75"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I wish he would come; everything seems so queer
to-day.

<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (calls out).</stage><p>  Here he is!</p></sp>
<stage>          HIALMAR EKDAL comes in at the passage door.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (going to him).</stage><p>  Father!  Oh, what a time we've
been waiting for you!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (glancing sidelong at him).</stage><p>  You've been out a long
time, Ekdal.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (without looking at her).</stage><p>  Rather long, yes.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[He takes off his overcoat; GINA and HEDVIG go

<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (hanging up his coat).</stage><p>  No.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (going towards the kitchen door).</stage><p>  Then I'll bring
some in for you.

<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No; let the dinner alone.  I want nothing to

<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (going nearer to him).</stage><p>  Are you not well, father?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well?  Oh, yes, well enough.  We have had a
tiring walk, Gregers and I.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  You didn't ought to have gone so far, Ekdal;
you're not used to it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  H'm; there's many a thing a man must get used
to in this world. <stage> (Wanders about the room.)</stage>  Has any one
been here whilst I was out?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Nobody but the two sweethearts.

<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No new orders?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, not to-day.

<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  To-morrow!  Don't you remember what day it
is to-morrow?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, yes, by-the-bye &mdash; .  Well, the day after,

<pb n="76"/>
then.  Henceforth I mean to do everything myself; I shall
take all the work into my own hands.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Why, what can be the good of that, Ekdal?  It'll
only make your life a burden to you.  I can manage the
photography all right; and you can go on working at your
invention.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  And think of the wild duck, father, &mdash; and all the
hens and rabbits and &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Don't talk to me of all that trash!  From to-morrow I will never set foot in the garret again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, but father, you promised that we should
have a little party &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  H'm, true.  Well, then, from the day after to-morrow.  I should almost like to wring that cursed wild
duck's neck!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (shrieks).</stage><p>  The wild duck!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Well I never!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (shaking him).</stage><p>  Oh, no, father; you know it's my
wild duck!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  That is why I don't do it.  I haven't the heart
to &mdash; for your sake, Hedvig.  But in my inmost soul I feel
that I ought to do it.  I ought not to tolerate under my
roof a creature that has been through those hands.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Why, good gracious, even if grandfather did get
it from that poor creature, Pettersen &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (wandering about).</stage><p>  There are certain claims &mdash;
what shall I call them? &mdash; let me say claims of the ideal &mdash;
certain obligations, which a man cannot disregard without
injury to his soul.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (going after him).</stage><p>  But think of the wild duck,
&mdash; the poor wild duck!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (stops).</stage><p>  I tell you I will spare it &mdash; for your sake.
Not a hair of its head shall be &mdash; I mean, it shall be spared.
There are greater problems than that to be dealt with.  But
you should go out a little now, Hedvig, as usual; it is getting
dusk enough for you now.

<pb n="77"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, I don't care about going out now.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, do; it seems to me your eyes are blinking a
great deal; all these vapours in here are bad for you.  The
air is heavy under this roof.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Very well, then, I'll run down the kitchen stair
and go for a little walk.  My cloak and hat? &mdash; oh, they're in
my own room.  Father &mdash; be sure you don't do the wild duck
any harm whilst I'm out.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Not a feather of its head shall be touched.
<stage>(Draws her to him.)</stage> You and I, Hedvig &mdash; we two &mdash; !

<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  From to-morrow &mdash; or, say, from the day after
to-morrow &mdash; I should like to keep the household account-book
myself.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Do you want to keep the accounts too, now?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes; or to check the receipts at any rate.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Lord help us! that's soon done.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  One would hardly think so; at any rate you
seem to make the money go a very long way. <stage> (Stops and
looks at her.)</stage>  How do you manage it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  It's because me and Hedvig, we need so little.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Is it the case that father is very liberally paid
for the copying he does for Mr. Werle?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I don't know as he gets anything out of the way.
I don't know the rates for that sort of work.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, what does he get, about?  Let me hear!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, it varies; I daresay it'll come to about as much
as he costs us, with a little pocket-money over.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  As much as he costs us!  And you have never
told me this before!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, how could I tell you?  It pleased you so much
to think he got everything from you.

<pb n="78"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And he gets it from Mr. Werle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, well, he has plenty and to spare, he has.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Light the lamp for me, please!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (lighting the lamp).</stage><p>  And, of course, we don't know
as it's Mr. Werle himself; it may be Graberg &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Why attempt such an evasion?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I don't know; I only thought &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  H'm!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  It wasn't me that got grandfather that copying.
It was Bertha, when she used to come about us.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  It seems to me your voice is trembling.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (putting the lamp-shade on).</stage><p>  Is it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And your hands are shaking, are they not?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (firmly).</stage><p>  Come right out with it, Ekdal.  What
has he been saying about me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Is it true &mdash; can it be true that &mdash; that there was
an &mdash; an understanding between you and Mr. Werle, while
you were in service there?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  That's not true.  Not at that time.  Mr. Werle did
come after me, that's a fact.  And his wife thought there
was something in it, and then she made such a hocus-pocus
and hurly-burly, and she hustled me and bustled me about so
that I left her service.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  But afterwards, then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Well, then I went home.  And mother &mdash; well, she
wasn't the woman you took her for, Ekdal; she kept on
worrying and worrying at me about one thing and another &mdash;
for Mr. Werle was a widower by that time.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, and then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I suppose you've got to know it.  He gave me
no peace until he'd had his way.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (striking his hands together).</stage><p>  And this is the
mother of my child!  How could you hide this from me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, it was wrong of me; I ought certainly to have
told you long ago.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  You should have told me at the very first; &mdash;

<pb n="79"/>
then I should have known the sort of woman you were.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But would you have married me all the same?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  How can you dream that I would?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  That's just why I didn't dare tell you anything,
then.  For I'd come to care for you so much, you see; and
I couldn't go and make myself utterly miserable &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (walks about).</stage><p>  And this is my Hedvig's mother.
And to know that all I see before me &mdash; <stage>(kicks at a chair)</stage> &mdash;
all that I call my home &mdash; I owe to a favoured predecessor!
Oh, that scoundrel Werle!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Do you repent of the fourteen &mdash; the fifteen years
we've lived together?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (placing himself in front of her).</stage><p>  Have you not
every day, every hour, repented of the spider's-web of deceit
you have spun around me?  Answer me that!  How could
you help writhing with penitence and remorse?
Gina  Oh, my dear Ekdal, I've had all I could do to
look after the house and get through the day's work &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Then you never think of reviewing your past?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No; Heaven knows I'd almost forgotten those old
stories.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, this dull, callous contentment!  To me
there is something revolting about it.  Think of it &mdash; never
so much as a twinge of remorse!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But tell me, Ekdal &mdash; what would have become of
you if you hadn't had a wife like me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Like you &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes; for you know I've always been a bit more
practical and wide-awake than you.  Of course I'm a year
or two older.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What would have become of me!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  You'd got into all sorts of bad ways when first
you met me; that you can't deny.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  "Bad ways" do you call them?  Little do you
know what a man goes through when he is in grief and despair &mdash;
especially a man of my fiery temperament.

<pb n="80"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Well, well, that may be so.  And I've no reason
to crow over you, neither; for you turned a moral of a husband,
that you did, as soon as ever you had a house and
home of your own. &mdash; And now we'd got everything so nice
and cosy about us; and me and Hedvig was just thinking
we'd soon be able to let ourselves go a bit, in the way of
both food and clothes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  In the swamp of deceit, yes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I wish to goodness that detestable thing had never
set his foot inside our doors!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And I, too, thought my home such a pleasant
one.  That was a delusion.  Where shall I now find the
elasticity of spirit to bring my invention into the world of
reality?  Perhaps it will die with me; and then it will be your
past, Gina, that will have killed it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (nearly crying).</stage><p>  You mustn't say such things,
Ekdal.  Me, that has only wanted to do the best I could for
you, all my days!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I ask you, what becomes of the breadwinner's
dream?  When I used to lie in there on the sofa and brood
over my invention, I had a clear enough presentiment that
it would sap my vitality to the last drop.  I felt even then
that the day when I held the patent in my hand &mdash; that day &mdash;
would bring my &mdash; release.  And then it was my dream that
you should live on after me, the dead inventor's well-to-do
widow.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (drying her tears).</stage><p>  No, you mustn't talk like that,
Ekdal.  May the Lord never let me see the day I am left a
widow!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, the whole dream has vanished.  It is all

looks in.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  May I come in?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, come in.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (comes forward, his face beaming with satisfaction,

<pb n="81"/>
and holds out both his hands to them).</stage><p>  Well, dear
friends &mdash; ! <stage> (Looks from one to the other, and whispers
to HIALMAR.)</stage>  Have you not done it yet?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (aloud).</stage><p>  It is done.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  It is?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I have passed through the bitterest moments of
my life.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>    But also, I trust, the most ennobling.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, at any rate, we have got through it for
the present.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  God forgive you, Mr. Werle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (in great surprise).</stage><p>  But I don't understand this.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What don't you understand?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  After so great a crisis &mdash; a crisis that is to be the
starting-point of an entirely new life &mdash; of a communion
founded on truth, and free from all taint of deception &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, yes, I know; I know that quite well.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I confidently expected, when I entered the room,
to find the light of transfiguration shining upon me from both
husband and wife.  And now I see nothing but dulness,
oppression, gloom &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, is that it?</p></sp>
      <stage>  [Takes off the lamp-shade.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You will not understand me, Mrs. Ekdal.  Ah,
well, you, I suppose, need time to &mdash; .  But you, Hialmar?
Surely you feel a new consecration after the great crisis.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, of course I do.  That is &mdash; in a sort of way.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  For surely nothing in the world can compare
with the joy of forgiving one who has erred, and raising her
up to oneself in love.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Do you think a man can so easily throw off the
bitter cup I have drained?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No, not a common man, perhaps.  But a man
like you &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Good God!  I know that well enough.  But
you must keep me up to it, Gregers.  It takes time, you
know.

<pb n="82"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You have much of the wild duck in you, Hialmar.</p></sp>
<stage>          RELLING has come in at the passage door.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Oho! is the wild duck to the fore again?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes; Mr. Werle's wing-broken victim.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Mr. Werle's &mdash; ?  So it's him you are talking
about?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Him and &mdash; ourselves.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling</speaker><stage> (in an undertone to  GREGERS).</stage><p>  May the devil fly
away with you!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What is that you are saying?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Only uttering a heartfelt wish that this quacksalver
would take himself off.  If he stays here, he is quite
equal to making an utter mess of life, for both of you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  These two will not make a mess of life, Mr.
Relling.  Of course I won't speak of Hialmar &mdash; him we know.
But she, too, in her innermost heart, has certainly something
loyal and sincere &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (almost crying).</stage><p>  You might have let me alone for
what I was, then.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling</speaker><stage> (to GREGERS).</stage><p>  Is it rude to ask what you really
want in this house?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  To lay the foundations of a true marriage.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  So you don't think Ekdal's marriage is good
enough as it is?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No doubt it is as good a marriage as most others,
worse luck.  But a true marriage it has yet to become.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  You have never had eyes for the claims of the
ideal, Relling.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Rubbish, my boy! &mdash; but excuse me, Mr. Werle:
how many &mdash; in round numbers &mdash; how many true marriages
have you seen in the course of your life?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Scarcely a single one.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Nor I either.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But I have seen innumerable marriages of the
opposite kind.  And it has been my fate to see at close

<pb n="83"/>
quarters what ruin such a marriage can work in two human
souls.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  A man's whole moral basis may give away beneath
his feet; that is the terrible part of it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Well, I can't say I've ever been exactly married,
so I don't pretend to speak with authority.  But this I know,
that the child enters into the marriage problem.  And you
must leave the child in peace.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh &mdash; Hedvig! my poor Hedvig!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Yes, you must be good enough to keep Hedvig
outside of all this.  You two are grown-up people; you are
free, in God's name, to make what mess and muddle you
please of your life.  But you must deal cautiously with Hedvig,
I tell you; else you may do her a great injury.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  An injury!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Yes, or she may do herself an injury &mdash; and perhaps
others, too.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  How can you know that, Relling?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Her sight is in no immediate danger, is it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  I am not talking about her sight.  Hedvig is at
a critical age.  She may be getting all sorts of mischief into
her head.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  That's true &mdash; I've noticed it already!  She's taken
to carrying on with the fire, out in the kitchen.  She calls
it playing at house-on-fire.  I'm often scared for fear she
really sets fire to the house.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  You see; I thought as much.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (to RELLING).</stage><p> But how do you account for that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling</speaker><stage> (sullenly).</stage><p>  Her constitution's changing, sir.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  So long as the child has me &mdash; !  So long as I
am above ground &mdash; !</p></sp>
                    <stage>  [A knock at the door.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Hush, Ekdal; there's some one in the passage.
<stage>(Calls out.)</stage> Come in!</p></sp>
<stage>          [MRS. SORBY, in walking dress, comes in.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Good evening.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (going towards her).</stage><p>  Is it really you, Bertha?

<pb n="84"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Yes, of course it is.  But I'm disturbing you,
I'm afraid?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  No, not at all; an emissary from that house &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby</speaker><stage>(to GINA).</stage><p> To tell the truth, I hoped your
men-folk would be out at this time.  I just ran up to have
a little chat with you, and to say good-bye.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Good-bye?  Are you going away, then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Yes, to-morrow morning, &mdash; up to Hoidal.
Mr. Werle started this afternoon.<stage> (Lightly to GREGERS.)</stage>
He asked me to say good-bye for him.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Only fancy &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  So Mr. Werle has gone?  And now you are
going after him?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Yes, what do you say to that, Ekdal?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I say: beware!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I must explain the situation.  My father and
Mrs. Sorby are going to be married.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Going to be married!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, Bertha!  So it's come to that at last!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling</speaker><stage> (his voice quivering a little).</stage><p>  This is surely not
true?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Yes, my dear Relling, it's true enough.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  You are going to marry again?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Yes, it looks like it.  Werle has got a special
licence, and we are going to be married quite quietly, up at
the works.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Then I must wish you all happiness, like a dutiful
stepson.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Thank you very much &mdash; if you mean what
you say.  I certainly hope it will lead to happiness, both for
Werle and for me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  You have every reason to hope that.  Mr. Werle
never gets drunk &mdash; so far as I know; and I don't suppose
he's in the habit of thrashing his wives, like the late lamented
horse-doctor.

<pb n="85"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Come now, let Sorby rest in peace.  He had
his good points, too.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Mr. Werle has better ones, I have no doubt.
Mrs.  Sorby.  He hasn't frittered away all that was good
in him, at any rate.  The man who does that must take the
consequences.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  I shall go out with Molvik this evening.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  You mustn't do that, Relling.  Don't do it &mdash;
for my sake.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  There's nothing else for it.<stage> (To HIALMAR.)</stage>
If you're going with us, come along.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, thank you.  Ekdal doesn't go in for that sort
of dissertation.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (half aloud, in vexation).</stage><p>  Oh, do hold your
tongue!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Good-bye, Mrs. &mdash; Werle.</p></sp>
<stage>                         [Goes out through the passage door.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (to MRS. SORBY).</stage><p>  You seem to know Dr. Relling
pretty intimately.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Yes, we have known each other for many
years.  At one time it seemed as if things might have gone
further between us.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  It was surely lucky for you that they did not.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  You may well say that.  But I have always
been wary of acting on impulse.  A woman can't afford absolutely
to throw herself away.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Are you not in the least afraid that I may let
my father know about this old friendship?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Why, of course, I have told him all about it
myself.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Indeed?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Your father knows every single thing that
can, with any truth, be said about me.  I have told him all;
it was the first thing I did when I saw what was in his mind.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Then you have been franker than most people,
I think.

<pb n="86"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  I have always been frank.  We women find
that the best policy.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What do you say to that, Gina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, we're not all alike, us women aren't.  Some
are made one way, some another.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Well, for my part, Gina, I believe it's wisest
to do as I've done.  And Werle has no secrets either, on his
side.  That's really the great bond between us, you see.
Now he can talk to me as openly as a child.  He has never
had the chance to do that before.  Fancy a man like him,
full of health and vigour, passing his whole youth and the
best years of his life in listening to nothing but penitential
sermons!  And very often the sermons had for their text the
most imaginary offences &mdash; at least so I understand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  That's true enough.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  If you ladies are going to follow up this topic,
I had better withdraw.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  You can stay as far as that's concerned.  I
shan't say a word more.  But I wanted you to know that I
had done nothing secretly or in an underhand way.  I
may seem to have come in for a great piece of luck; and
so I have, in a sense.  But after all, I don't think I am getting
any more than I am giving.  I shall stand by him always,
and I can tend and care for him as no one else can,
now that he is getting helpless.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Getting helpless?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (to MRS. SORBY).</stage><p>  Hush, don't speak of that
here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  There is no disguising it any longer, however
much he would like to.  He is going blind.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (starts).</stage><p>  Going blind?  That's strange.  He,
too, going blind!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Lots of people do.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  And you can imagine what that means to a
business man.  Well, I shall try as well as I can to make my
eyes take the place of his.  But I mustn't stay any longer; I

<pb n="87"/>
have heaps of things to do. &mdash; Oh, by-the-bye, Ekdal, I was
to tell you that if there is anything Werle can do for you,
you must just apply to Graberg.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  That offer I am sure Hialmar Ekdal will decline
with thanks.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Indeed?  I don't think he used to be so &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, Bertha, Ekdal doesn't need anything from
Mr. Werle now.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (slowly, and with emphasis).</stage><p>  Will you present
my compliments to your future husband, and say that I
intend very shortly to call upon Mr. Graberg &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What!  You don't really mean that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  To call upon Mr. Graberg, I say, and obtain an
account of the sum I owe his principal.  I will pay that debt
of honour &mdash; ha ha ha! a debt of honour, let us call it!  In
any case, I will pay the whole with five per cent. interest.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But, my dear Ekdal, God knows we haven't got
the money to do it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Be good enough to tell your future husband
that I am working assiduously at my invention.  Please tell
him that what sustains me in this laborious task is the wish
to free myself from a torturing burden of debt.  That is my
reason for proceeding with the invention.  The entire profits
shall be devoted to releasing me from my pecuniary obligations
to your future husband.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Something has happened here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, you are right.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Mrs. Sorby.</speaker><p>  Well, good-bye.  I had something else to
speak to you about, Gina; but it must keep till another time.
Good-bye.</p></sp>

[HIALMAR and GREGERS bow silently.  GINA follows
MRS. SORBY to the door.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Not beyond the threshold, Gina!</p></sp>
<stage>          [MRS. SORBY goes; GINA shuts the door after her.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  There now, Gregers; I have got that burden of
debt off my mind.

<pb n="88"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You soon will, at all events.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I think my attitude may be called correct.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You are the man I have always taken you
for.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  In certain cases, it is impossible to disregard
the claim of the ideal.  Yet, as the breadwinner of a family,
I cannot but writhe and groan under it.  I can tell you it is
no joke for a man without capital to attempt the repayment
of a long-standing obligation, over which, so to speak, the
dust of oblivion had gathered.  But it cannot be helped: the
Man in me demands his rights.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (laying his hand on HIALMAR'S shoulder).</stage><p>  My
dear Hialmar &mdash; was it not a good thing I came?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Are you not glad to have had your true position
made clear to you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (somewhat impatiently).</stage><p>  Yes, of course I am.
But there is one thing that is revolting to my sense of justice.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And what is that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  It is that &mdash; but I don't know, whether I ought to
express myself so unreservedly about your father.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Say what you please, so far as I am concerned.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, then, is it not exasperating to think that
it is not I, but he, who will realise the true marriage?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  How can you say such a thing?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Because it is clearly the case.  Isn't the marriage
between your father and Mrs. Sorby founded upon complete
confidence, upon entire and unreserved candour on
both sides?  They hide nothing from each other, they keep
no secrets in the background; their relation is based, if I
may put it so, on mutual confession and absolution.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Well, what then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, is not that the whole thing?  Did you not
yourself say that this was precisely the difficulty that had to
be overcome in order to found a true marriage?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But this is a totally different matter, Hialmar.

<pb n="89"/>
You surely don't compare either yourself or your wife with
those two &mdash; ?  Oh, you understand me well enough.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Say what you like, there is something in all this
that hurts and offends my sense of justice.  It really looks
as if there were no just providence to rule the world.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, no, Ekdal; for God's sake don't say such
things.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  H'm; don't let us get upon those questions.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And yet, after all, I cannot but recognise the
guiding finger of fate.  He is going blind.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, you can't be sure of that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  There is no doubt about it.  At all events there
ought not to be; for in that very fact lies the righteous retribution.
He has hoodwinked a confiding fellow creature in
days gone by &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I fear he has hoodwinked many.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And now comes inexorable, mysterious Fate,
and demands Werle's own eyes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, how dare you say such dreadful things!  You
make me quite scared.

<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  That is Mr. Werle's hand.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Are you sure of that, Ekdal?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Look for yourself.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, what do I know about such-like things?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Hedvig, may I open the letter &mdash; and read it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, of course you may, if you want to.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, not to-night, Ekdal; it's to be kept till to-morrow.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (softly).</stage><p>  Oh, can't you let him read it!  It's sure
to be something good; and then father will be glad, and
everything will be nice again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I may open it then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, do, father.  I'm so anxious to know what
it is.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well and good. <stage> (Opens the letter, takes out

<pb n="91"/>
a paper, reads it through, and appears bewildered.)</stage>  What is
this &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  What does it say?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh, yes, father &mdash; tell us!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Be quiet. <stage> (Reads it through again; he has
turned pale, but says with self-control:)</stage> It is a deed of gift,
Hedvig.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Is it?  What sort of gift am I to have?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Read for yourself.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HEDVIG goes over and reads for a time by the
lamp.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (half-aloud, clenching his hands).</stage><p>  The eyes!
The eyes &mdash; and then that letter!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (leaves off reading).</stage><p>  Yes, but it seems to me
that it's grandfather that's to have it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (takes letter from her).</stage><p>  Gina &mdash; can you understand
this?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I know nothing whatever about it; tell me what's
the matter.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Mr. Werle writes to Hedvig that her old grandfather
need not trouble himself any longer with the copying,
but that he can henceforth draw on the office for a
hundred crowns a month
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Aha!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  A hundred crowns, mother!  I read that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  What a good thing for grandfather!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>   &mdash; a hundred crowns a month so long as he
needs it &mdash; that means, of course, so long as he lives.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Well, so he's provided for, poor dear.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  But there is more to come.  You didn't read
that, Hedvig.  Afterwards this gift is to pass on to you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  To me!  The whole of it?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  He says that the same amount is assured to
you for the whole of your life.  Do you hear that, Gina?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, I hear.

<pb n="92"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Fancy &mdash; all that money for me! <stage> (Shakes him.)</stage>
Father, father, aren't you glad &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (eluding her).</stage><p>  Glad! <stage> (Walks about.)</stage>  Oh
what vistas &mdash; what perspectives open up before me!  It is
Hedvig, Hedvig that he showers these benefactions upon!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, because it's Hedvig's birthday &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  And you'll get it all the same, father!  You
know quite well I shall give all the money to you and
mother.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  To mother, yes!  There we have it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Hialmar, this is a trap he is setting for you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Do you think it's another trap?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  When he was here this morning he said: Hialmar
Ekdal is not the man you imagine him to be.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Not the man &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  That you shall see, he said.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  He meant you should see that I would let myself
be bought off &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Oh mother, what does all this mean?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Go and take off your things.</p></sp>
<stage>          [HEDVIG goes out by the kitchen door, half-crying.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, Hialmar &mdash; now is the time to show who
was right, he or I.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (slowly tears the paper across, lays both pieces
on the table, and says):</stage><p> Here is my answer.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Just what I expected.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (goes over to GINA, who stands by the stove, and
says in a low voice):</stage><p> Now please make a clean breast of it.
If the connection between you and him was quite over when
you &mdash; came to care for me, as you call it &mdash; why did he place
us in a position to marry?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I suppose he thought as he could come and go in
our house.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Only that?  Was not he afraid of a possible
contingency?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I don't know what you mean.

<pb n="93"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I want to know whether &mdash; your child has the
right to live under my roof.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (draws herself up; her eyes flash).</stage><p>  You ask that!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  You shall answer me this one question: Does
Hedvig belong to me &mdash; or &mdash; ?  Well!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (looking at him with cold defiance).</stage><p>  I don't know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (quivering a little).</stage><p>  You don't know!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  How should I know.  A creature like me &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (quietly turning away from her).</stage><p>  Then I have
nothing more to do in this house.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Take care, Hialmar!  Think what you are
doing!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (puts on his overcoat).</stage><p>  In this case, there is
nothing for a man like me to think twice about.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes indeed, there are endless things to be considered.
You three must be together if you are to attain the
true frame of mind for self-sacrifice and forgiveness.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I don't want to attain it.  Never, never!  My
hat!  (Takes his hat.)  My home has fallen in ruins about
me. <stage> (Bursts into tears.)</stage>  Gregers, I have no child!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (who has opened the kitchen door).</stage><p>  What is that
you're saying? <stage> (Coming to him.)</stage>  Father, father!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  There, you see!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Don't come near me, Hedvig!  Keep far away.

come back again!

again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (throws herself sobbing on the sofa).</stage><p>  No, no, he'll
never come home to us any more.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Do you believe I meant all for the best, Mrs.
Ekdal?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, I daresay you did; but God forgive you, all
the same.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (lying on the sofa).</stage><p>  Oh, this will kill me!  What
have I done to him?  Mother, you must fetch him home
again!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes yes yes; only be quiet, and I'll go out and
look for him. <stage> (Puts on her outdoor things.)</stage>  Perhaps he's
gone in to Relling's.  But you mustn't lie there and cry.
Promise me!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (weeping convulsively).</stage><p>  Yes, I'll stop, I'll stop;
if only father comes back!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (to GINA, who is going).</stage><p>  After all, had you not
better leave him to fight out his bitter fight to the end?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, he can do that afterwards.  First of all, we
must get the child quieted.</p></sp>
 <stage> (Goes out by the passage door.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (sits up and dries her tears).</stage><p>  Now you must
tell me what all this means.  Why doesn't father want me
any more?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You mustn't ask that till you are a big girl &mdash;
quite grown-up.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (sobs).</stage><p>  But I can't go on being as miserable as
this till I'm grown-up. &mdash; I think I know what it is. &mdash; Perhaps
I'm not really father's child.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (uneasily).</stage><p>  How could that be?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Mother might have found me.  And perhaps
father has just got to know it; I've read of such things.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Well, but if it were so &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I think he might be just as fond of me for all

<pb n="95"/>
that.  Yes, fonder almost.  We got the wild duck in a
present, you know, and I love it so dearly all the same.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (turning the conversation).</stage><p>  Ah, the wild duck,
by-tbe-bye!  Let us talk about the wild duck a little, Hedvig.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  The poor wild duck!  He doesn't want to see
it any more either.  Only think, he wanted to wring its
neck!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, he won't do that.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No; but he said he would like to.  And I think
it was horrid of father to say it; for I pray for the wild
duck every night, and ask that it may be preserved from
death and all that is evil.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (looking at her).</stage><p>  Do you say your prayers every
night?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Who taught you to do that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I myself; one time when father was very ill,
and had leeches on his neck, and said that death was staring
him in the face.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Well?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Then I prayed for him as I lay in bed; and
since then I have always kept it up.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And now you pray for the wild duck too?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I thought it was best to bring in the wild duck;
for she was so weakly at first.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Do you pray in the morning, too?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, of course not.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Why not in the morning as well?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  In the morning it's light, you know, and there's
nothing in particular to be afraid of.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And your father was going to wring the neck
of the wild duck that you love so dearly?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No; he said he ought to wring its neck, but he
would spare it for my sake; and that was kind of father.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (coming a little nearer).</stage><p>  But suppose you were
to sacrifice the wild duck of your own free will for his sake.

<pb n="96"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (rising).</stage><p>  The wild duck!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Suppose you were to make a free-will offering,
for his sake, of the dearest treasure you have in the world!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Do you think that would do any good?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Try it, Hedvig.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (softly, with flashing eyes).</stage><p>  Yes, I will try it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Have you really the courage for it, do you
think?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I'll ask grandfather to shoot the wild duck for
me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, do.  &mdash; But not a word to your mother about
it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Why not?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  She doesn't understand us.

<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (going towards her).</stage><p>  Did you find him, mother?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, but I heard as he had called and taken Relling
with him.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Are you sure of that?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, the porter's wife said so.  Molvik went with
them,too, she said.

wrestle in solitude &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (takes off her things).</stage><p>  Yes, men are strange creatures,
so they are.  The Lord only knows where Relling has
dragged him to!   I ran over to Madam Eriksen's, but they
weren't there.

<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (struggling to keep back her tears).</stage><p>  Oh, if he
should never come home any more!
</p></sp>

to give him to-morrow; and then you shall see how he comes
home.  You may rely upon that, Hedvig, and sleep in peace.

home last night.

to look after the other brute; I mean our daemonic friend, of
course; and then I fell so dead asleep that &mdash;

rent him &mdash;

out of doors at night.

mother.

<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (turning to RELLING).</stage><p> What is your explanation
of the spiritual tumult that is now going on in Hialmar
Ekdal?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Devil a bit of a spiritual tumult have I noticed
in him.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What!  Not at such a crisis, when his whole
life has been placed on a new foundation &mdash; ?  How can
you think that such an individuality as Hialmar's &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Oh, individuality &mdash; he!  If he ever had any
tendency to the abnormal developments you call individuality,
I can assure you it was rooted out of him while he was
still in his teens.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  That would be strange indeed, &mdash; considering the
loving care with which he was brought up.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  By those two high-flown, hysterical maiden
aunts, you mean?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Let me tell you that they were women who
never forgot the claim of the ideal &mdash; but of course you will
only jeer at me again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  No, I'm in no humour for that.  I know all
about those ladies; for he has ladled out no end of rhetoric
on the subject of his "two soul-mothers."  But I don't
think he has much to thank them for.  Ekdal's misfortune
is that in his own circle he has always been looked upon as a
shining light &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Not without reason, surely.  Look at the depth
of his mind!

<pb n="101"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  I have never discovered it.  That his father believed
in it I don't so much wonder; the old lieutenant has
been an ass all his days.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  He has had a child-like mind all his days; that
is what you cannot understand.

<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Well, so be it.  But then, when our dear, sweet
Hialmar went to college, he at once passed for the great
light of the future amongst his comrades too.  He was handsome,
the rascal &mdash; red and white &mdash; a shop-girl's dream of
manly beauty; and with his superficially emotional temperament,
and his sympathetic voice, and his talent for declaiming
other people's verses and other people's thoughts &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (indignantly).</stage><p>  Is it Hialmar Ekdal you are talking
about in this strain?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Yes, with your permission; I am simply giving
you an inside view of the idol you are grovelling before.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I should hardly have thought I was quite stone
blind.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Yes you are &mdash; or not far from it.  You are a sick
man, too, you see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You are right there.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Yes.  Yours is a complicated case.  First of all,
there is that plaguy integrity-fever; and then &mdash; what's worse
&mdash; you are always in a delirium of hero-worship; you must
always have something to adore, outside yourself.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Yes, I must certainly seek it outside myself.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  But you make such shocking mistakes about
every new phoenix you think you have discovered.  Here
again you have come to a cotter's cabin with your claim of
the ideal; and the people of the house are insolvent.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  If you don't think better than that of Hialmar
Ekdal, what pleasure can you find in being everlastingly with
him?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Well, you see, I'm supposed to be a sort of a
doctor &mdash; save the mark!  I can't but give a hand to the
poor sick folk who live under the same roof with me.

<pb n="102"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, indeed!  Hialmar Ekdal is sick too, is he!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Most people are, worse luck.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And what remedy are you applying in Hialmar's
case?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  My usual one.  I am cultivating the life-illusion<ref target="note5">*</ref>
in him.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Life-illusion?  I didn't catch what you said.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Yes, I said illusion.  For illusion, you know, is
the stimulating principle.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  May I ask with what illusion Hialmar is inoculated?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  No, thank you; I don't betray professional
secrets to quacksalvers.  You would probably go and muddle
his case still more than you have already.  But my
method is infallible.  I have applied it to Molvik as well.
I have made him "daemonic."  That's the blister I have to
put on his neck.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Is he not really daemonic then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  What the devil do you mean by daemonic!  It's
only a piece of gibberish I've invented to keep up a spark
of life in him.  But for that, the poor harmless creature
would have succumbed to self-contempt and despair many a
long year ago.  And then the old lieutenant!  But he has
hit upon his own cure, you see.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Lieutenant Ekdal?  What of him?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Just think of the old bear-hunter shutting himself
up in that dark garret to shoot rabbits!  I tell you
there is not a happier sportsman in the world than that old
man pottering about in there among all that rubbish.  The
four or five withered Christmas-trees he has saved up are
the same to him as the whole great fresh Hoidal forest; the
cock and the hens are big game-birds in the fir-tops; and
the rabbits that flop about the garret floor are the bears

*<note place="foot" id="note5"><seg type="note-symbol">"Livslognen,"</seg> <p>literally "the life-lie."</p></note>

<pb n="103"/>
he has to battle with &mdash; the mighty hunter of the mountains!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Poor unfortunate old man!  Yes; he has indeed
had to narrow the ideals of his youth.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  While I think of it, Mr. Werle, junior &mdash; don't
use that foreign word: ideals.  We have the excellent native
word: lies.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Do you think the two things are related?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Yes, just about as closely as typhus and putrid
fever.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Dr. Relling, I shall not give up the struggle
until I have rescued Hialmar from your clutches!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  So much the worse for him.  Rob the average
man of his life-illusion, and you rob him of his happiness at
the same stroke. <stage> (To HEDVIG, who comes in from the
sitting-room.)</stage>  Well, little wild-duck-mother, I'm just going
down to see whether papa is still lying meditating upon that
wonderful invention of his.</p></sp>
       <stage>  [Goes out by passage door.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (approaches HEDVIG).</stage><p>  I can see by your face
that you have not yet done it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  What?  Oh, that about the wild duck!  No.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  I suppose your courage failed when the time
came.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, that wasn't it.  But when I awoke this
morning and remembered what we had been talking about,
it seemed so strange.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Strange?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, I don't know &mdash;  Yesterday evening, at
the moment, I thought there was something so delightful
about it; but since I have slept and thought of it again,
it somehow doesn't seem worth while.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Ah, I thought you could not have grown up
quite unharmed in this house.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  I don't care about that, if only father would
come up &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Oh, if only your eyes had been opened to that

<pb n="104"/>
which gives life its value &mdash; if you possessed the true, joyous,
fearless spirit of sacrifice, you would soon see how he
would come up to you. &mdash; But I believe in you still, Hedvig.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[He goes out by the passage door.  HEDVIG wanders
about the room for a time; she is on the
point of going into the kitchen when a knock is
heard at the garret door.  HEDVIG goes over and
opens it a little; old EKDAL comes out; she pushes
the door to again.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  H'm, it's not much fun to take one's morning
walk alone.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Wouldn't you like to go shooting, grandfather?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  It's not the weather for it to-day.  It's so dark
there, you can scarcely see where you're going.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Do you never want to shoot anything besides
the rabbits?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Do you think the rabbits aren't good enough?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Yes, but what about the wild duck?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Ho-ho! are you afraid I shall shoot your wild
duck?  Never in the world.  Never.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  No, I suppose you couldn't; they say it's very
difficult to shoot wild ducks.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Couldn't!  Should rather think I could.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  How would you set about it, grandfather? &mdash; I
don't mean with my wild duck, but with others?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  I should take care to shoot them in the breast,
you know; that's the surest place.  And then you must
shoot against the feathers, you see &mdash; not the way of the
feathers.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig.</speaker><p>  Do they die then, grandfather?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Yes, they die right enough &mdash; when you shoot
properly. &mdash; Well, I must go and brush up a bit.  H'm &mdash;
understand &mdash; h'm.</p></sp>
                   <stage>  [Goes into his room.</stage>
<stage><p>
[HEDVIG waits a little, glances towards the sitting-room door, goes over to the book-case, stands on
tip-toe, takes the double-barrelled pistol down

<pb n="105"/>
from the shelf, and looks at it.  GINA, with
brush and duster, comes from the sitting-room.
HEDVIG hastily lays down the pistol, unobserved.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Don't stand raking amongst father's things,
Hedvig.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (goes away from the bookcase).</stage><p>  I was only going
to tidy up a little.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  You'd better go into the kitchen, and see if the
coffee's keeping hot; I'll take his breakfast on a tray, when
I go down to him.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[HEDVIG goes out. GINA begins to sweep and
clean up the studio.  Presently the passage door
is opened with hesitation, and HIALMAR EKDAL
looks in.  He has on his overcoat, but not his
hat; he is unwashed, and his hair is dishevelled
and unkempt.  His eyes are dull and heavy.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (standing with the brush in her hand, and looking
at him).</stage><p>  Oh, there now, Ekdal &mdash; so you've come after all?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (comes in and answers in a toneless voice).</stage><p>  I
come only to depart again immediately.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, yes, I suppose so.  But, Lord help us! what
a sight you are!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  A sight?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  And your nice winter coat too!  Well, that's done
for.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hedvig</speaker><stage> (at the kitchen door).</stage><p>  Mother, hadn't I better &mdash; ?
<stage> (Sees HIALMAR, gives a loud scream of joy, and
runs to him.)</stage>  Oh, father, father!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (turns away and makes a gesture of repulsion).
Away,</stage><p> away, away! <stage> (To GINA.)</stage>  Keep her away from me,
I say!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (in a low tone).</stage><p>  Go into the sitting-room, Hedvig.</p></sp>
<stage>                          [HEDVIG does so without a word.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (fussily pulls out the table-drawer).</stage><p>  I must have
my books with me.  Where are my books?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Which books?

<pb n="106"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  My scientific books, of course; the technical
magazines I require for my invention.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (searches in the bookcase).</stage><p>  Is it these here paper-covered ones?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, of course.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (lays a heap of magazines on the table).</stage><p>  Shan't I
get Hedvig to cut them for you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I don't require to have them cut for me.</p></sp>
<stage>                                   [Short silence.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Then you're still set on leaving us, Ekdal?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (rummaging amongst the books).</stage><p>  Yes, that is a
matter of course, I should think.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Well, well.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (vehemently).</stage><p>  How can I live here, to be stabbed
to the heart every hour of the day?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  God forgive you for thinking such vile things of
me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Prove &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  I think it's you as has got to prove.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  After a past like yours?  There are certain
claims &mdash; I may almost call them claims of the ideal &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  But what about grandfather?  What's to become
of him, poor dear?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I know my duty; my helpless father will come
with me.  I am going out into the town to make arrangements &mdash;  H'm &mdash; <stage>(hesitatingly)</stage> &mdash; has any one found my
hat on the stairs?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No.  Have you lost your hat?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Of course I had it on when I came in last
night; there's no doubt about that; but I couldn't find it
this morning.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Lord help us! where have you been to with those
two ne'er-do-weels?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, don't bother me about trifles.  Do you suppose
I am in the mood to remember details?

whilst he empties the table-drawer).</stage><p>  You're a scoundrel,
Relling!  &mdash; You're a low fellow!  &mdash; Ah, you shameless tempter!

torn document of yesterday, takes it up and
looks at the pieces; puts it down hurriedly as
GINA enters.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (sets a tray with coffee, etc., on the table).</stage><p>  Here's
a drop of something hot, if you'd fancy it.  And there's
some bread and butter and a snack of salt meat.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (glancing at the tray).</stage><p>  Salt meat?  Never under
this roof!  It's true I have not had a mouthful of solid food
for nearly twenty-four hours; but no matter. &mdash; My memoranda!
The commencement of my autobiography!  What
has become of my diary, and all my important papers?

there too!

studio.</p></stage>

home, I wish to be spared from interlopers &mdash; </p></sp>

best go into your own room.<stage> (Speaks to HIALMAR as she
goes in to him.)</stage>  Wait a bit, Ekdal; don't rummage so in
the drawers; I know where everything is.

in, and draws the door to after her.

loose papers, which he lays upon the table).</stage><p>  That portmanteau

his rabbits.

<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What have you decided to do?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  For a man like me, there is only one course
possible.  I am just putting my most important things together.
But it takes time, you know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (with a touch of impatience).</stage><p>  Am I to get the room
ready for you, or am I to pack your portmanteau?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (after a glance of annoyance at GREGERS).</stage><p>  Pack
&mdash; and get the room ready!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (takes the portmanteau).</stage><p>  Very well; then I'll put
in the shirt and the other things.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
[Goes into the sitting-room and draws the door to
after her.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (after a short silence).</stage><p>  I never dreamed that this
would be the end of it.  Do you really feel it a necessity to
leave house and home?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (wanders about restlessly).</stage><p>  What would you
have me do? &mdash; I am not fitted to bear unhappiness, Gregers.
I must feel secure and at peace in my surroundings.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  But can you not feel that here?  Just try it.  I
should have thought you had firm ground to build upon
now &mdash; if only you start afresh.  And, remember, you have
your invention to live for.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh don't talk about my invention.  It's perhaps
still in the dim distance.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Indeed!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Why, great heavens, what would you have me

<pb n="112"/>
invent?  Other people have invented almost everything already.
It becomes more and more dffficult every day &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  And you have devoted so much labour to it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  It was that blackguard Relling that urged me
to it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Relling?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, it was he that first made me realise my
aptitude for making some notable discovery in photography.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Aha &mdash; it was Relling!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, I have been so truly happy over it!  Not
so much for the sake of the invention itself, as because
Hedvig believed in it &mdash; believed in it with a child's whole
eagerness of faith. &mdash; At least, I have been fool enough to go
and imagine that she believed in it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Can you really think Hedvig has been false
towards you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I can think anything now.  It is Hedvig that
stands in my way.  She will blot out the sunlight from my
whole life.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Hedvig!  Is it Hedvig you are talking of?
How should she blot out your sunlight?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (without answering).</stage><p>  How unutterably I have
loved that child!  How unutterably happy I have felt every
time I came home to my humble room, and she flew to meet
me, with her sweet little blinking eyes.  Oh, confiding fool
that I have been!  I loved her unutterably; &mdash; and I yielded
myself up to the dream, the delusion, that she loved me
unutterably in return.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Do you call that a delusion?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  How should I know?  I can get nothing out of
Gina; and besides, she is totally blind to the ideal side of
these complications.  But to you I feel impelled to open my
mind, Gregers.  I cannot shake off this frightful doubt &mdash;
perhaps Hedvig has never really and honestly loved me.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What would you say if she were to give you a

<pb n="113"/>
proof of her love?  (Listens.)  What's that?  I thought I
heard the wild duck &mdash; ?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  It's the wild duck quacking.  Father's in the
garret.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Is he? <stage> (His face lights up with joy.)</stage>  I say you
may yet have proof that your poor misunderstood Hedvig
loves you!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, what proof can she give me?  I dare not
believe in any assurance from that quarter.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Hedvig does not know what deceit means.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh Gregers, that is just what I cannot be sure
of.  Who knows what Gina and that Mrs. Sorby may many
a time have sat here whispering and tattling about?  And
Hedvig usually has her ears open, I can tell you.  Perhaps
the deed of gift was not such a surprise to her, after all.
In fact, I'm not sure but that I noticed something of the
sort.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  What spirit is this that has taken possession of
you?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I have had my eyes opened.  Just you notice;
&mdash; you'll see, the deed of gift is only a beginning.  Mrs.
Sorby has always been a good deal taken up with Hedvig;
and now she has the power to do whatever she likes for the
child.  They can take her from me whenever they please.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Hedvig will never, never leave you.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Don't be so sure of that.  If only they beckon
to her and throw out a golden bait &mdash; !  And oh! I have
loved her so unspeakably!  I would have counted it my
highest happiness to take her tenderly by the hand and
lead her, as one leads a timid child through a great dark
empty room! &mdash; I am cruelly certain now that the poor photographer
in his humble attic has never really and truly
been anything to her.  She has only cunningly contrived to
keep on a good footing with him until the time came.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  You don't believe that yourself, Hialmar.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  That is just the terrible part of it &mdash; I don't

<pb n="114"/>
know what to believe, &mdash; I never can know it.  But can you
really doubt that it must be as I say?  Ho-ho, you have far
too much faith in the claim of the ideal, my good Gregers!
If those others came, with the glamour of wealth about them,
and called to the child: &mdash; "Leave him: come to us: here life
awaits you &mdash; !"
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (quickly).</stage><p>  Well, what then?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  If I then asked her: Hedvig, are you willing
to renounce that life for me? <stage> (Laughs scornfully.)</stage>  No
thank you!  You would soon hear what answer I should
get.</p></sp>
       <stage> [A pistol shot is heard from within the  garret.</stage>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (loudly and joyfully).</stage><p>  Hialmar!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  There now; he must needs go shooting too.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (comes in).</stage><p>  Oh Ekdal, I can hear grandfather
blazing away in the garret by himself.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  I'll look in &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (eagerly, with emotion).</stage><p>  Wait a moment!  Do
you know what that was?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, of course I know.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  No you don't know.  But I do.  That was the
proof!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What proof?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  It was a child's free-will offering.  She has got
your father to shoot the wild duck.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  To shoot the wild duck!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Oh, think of that &mdash; !
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What was that for?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  She wanted to sacrifice to you her most cherished
possession; for then she thought you would surely
come to love her again.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (tenderly, with emotion).</stage><p>  Oh, poor child!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  What things she does think of!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  She only wanted your love again, Hialmar.  She
could not live without it.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (struggling with her tears).</stage><p>  There, you can see for
yourself, Ekdal.

<pb n="115"/>
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Gina, where is she?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (sniffs).</stage><p>  Poor dear, she's sitting out in the kitchen,
I dare say.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (goes over, tears open the kitchen door, and
says):</stage><p> Hedvig, come, come in to me! <stage> (Looks around.)</stage>
No, she's not here.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Then she must be in her own little room.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (without).</stage><p>  No, she's not here either. <stage> (Comes
in.)</stage>  She must have gone out.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, you wouldn't have her anywheres in the
house.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, if she would only come home quickly, so
that I can tell her &mdash; Everything will come right now,
Gregers; now I believe we can begin life afresh.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (quietly).</stage><p>  I knew it; I knew the child would
make amends.</p></sp>
<stage><p>
OLD EKDAL appears at the door of his room; he is in full
uniform, and is busy buckling on his sword.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (astonished).</stage><p>  Father!  Are you there?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Have you been firing in your room?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal</speaker><stage> (resentfully, approaching).</stage><p>  So you go shooting
alone, do you, Hialmar?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (excited and confused).</stage><p>  Then it wasn't you
that fired that shot in the garret?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  Me that fired?  H'm.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (calls out to HIALMAR).</stage><p>  She has shot the wild
duck herself!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  What can it mean? <stage> (Hastens to the garret
door, tears it aside, looks in and calls loudly):</stage> Hedvig!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (runs to the door).</stage><p>  Good God, what's that!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (goes in).</stage><p>  She's lying on the floor!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Hedvig! lying on the floor!</p></sp>

No, no, no!

[HIALMAR, GINA and GREGERS carry HEDVIG into
the studio; in her dangling right hand she holds
the pistol fast clasped in her fingers.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (distracted).</stage><p>  The pistol has gone off.  She has
wounded herself.  Call for help!  Help!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (runs into the passage and calls down).</stage><p>  Relling!
Relling!  Doctor Relling; come up as quick as you can!</p></sp>

sofa.</p></stage>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (on his knees beside HEDVIG).</stage><p>  She'll soon come
to now.  She's coming to &mdash; ; yes, yes, yes.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (who has come in again).</stage><p>  Where has she hurt
herself?  I can't see anything &mdash; </p></sp>

[RELLING comes hurriedly, and immediately after
him MOLVIK; the latter without his waistcoat
and necktie, and with his coat open.</p></stage>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  What's the matter here?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  They say Hedvig has shot herself.
</p></sp>

her.</p></stage>

can't be dangerous?  Speak, Relling!  She is scarcely bleeding
at all.  It can't be dangerous?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  How did it happen?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Oh, we don't know &mdash;
</p></sp>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  The wild duck?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  The pistol must have gone off.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  H'm.  Indeed.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Ekdal.</speaker><p>  The woods avenge themselves.  But I'm not
afraid, all the same.</p></sp>

him.</p></stage>

<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Well, Relling, &mdash; why don't you say something?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  The ball has entered the breast.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  Yes, but she's coming to!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Surely you can see that Hedvig is dead.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina</speaker><stage> (bursts into tears).</stage><p>  Oh my child, my child &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers</speaker><stage> (huskily).</stage><p>  In the depths of the sea &mdash;
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (jumps up).</stage><p>  No, no, she must live!  Oh, for
God's sake, Relling &mdash; only a moment &mdash; only just till I can
tell her how unspeakably I loved her all the time!
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  The bullet has gone through her heart.  Internal
hemorrhage.  Death must have been instantaneous.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  And I!  I hunted her from me like an animal!
And she crept terrified into the garret and died for love of
me! <stage> (Sobbing.)</stage>  I can never atone to her!  I can never
tell her &mdash; ! <stage> (Clenches his hands and cries, upwards.)</stage>
O thou above &mdash; !  If thou be indeed!  Why hast thou
done this thing to me?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Hush, hush, you mustn't go on that awful way.
We had no right to keep her, I suppose.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Molvik.</speaker><p>  The child is not dead, but sleepeth.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Bosh.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar</speaker><stage> (becomes calm, goes over to the sofa, folds his
arms, and looks at HEDVIG.).</stage><p> There she lies so stiff and
still.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling</speaker><stage> (tries to loosen the pistol).</stage><p>  She's holding it so
tight, so tight.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  No, no, Relling, don't break her fingers; let the
pigstol be.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Hialmar.</speaker><p>  She shall take it with her.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gina.</speaker><p>  Yes, let her.  But the child mustn't lie here for
a show.  She shall go to her own room, so she shall.  Help
me, Ekdal.</p></sp>

you survive this!

<p>  Who can say how the dreadful thing happened?

<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  The powder has burnt the body of her dress.
She must have pressed the pistol right against her breast
and fired.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Hedvig has not died in vain.  Did you not see
how sorrow set free what is noble in him?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Most people are ennobled by the actual presence
of death.  But how long do you suppose this nobility will
last in him?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  Why should it not endure and increase
throughout his life?
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Before a year is over, little Hedvig will be nothing
to him but a pretty theme for declamation.
</p></sp>

</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  We will talk of this again, when the grass has
first withered on her grave.  Then you'll hear him spouting
about "the child too early torn from her father's heart;"
then you'll see him steep himself in a syrup of sentiment and
self-admiration and self-pity.  Just you wait!

<sp><speaker>Gregers.</speaker><p>  If you are right and I am wrong, then life is not
worth living.
</p></sp>
<sp><speaker>Relling.</speaker><p>  Oh, life would be quite tolerable, after all, if
only we could be rid of the confounded duns that keep on
pestering us, in our poverty, with the claim of the ideal.
