</p><p><stage>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion<lb/>
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,<lb/>
and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his<lb/>
blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my<lb/>
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and<lb/>
report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,<lb/>
he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more<lb/>
properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you<lb/>
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that<lb/>
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses<lb/>
are bred better; for, besides that they are fair<lb/>
with their feeding, they are taught their manage,<lb/>
and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his<lb/>
brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the<lb/>
which his animals on his dunghills are as much<lb/>
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so<lb/>
plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave<lb/>
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets<lb/>
me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a<lb/>
brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my<lb/>
gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that<lb/>
grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I<lb/>
think is within me, begins to mutiny against this<lb/>
servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I<lb/>
know no wise remedy how to avoid it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADAM</speaker>
<p>Yonder comes my master, your brother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will<lb/>
shake me up.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter OLIVER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Now, sir! what make you here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>What mar you then, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God<lb/>
made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?<lb/>
What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should<lb/>
come to such penury?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Know you where your are, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Know you before whom, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know<lb/>
you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle<lb/>
condition of blood, you should so know me. The<lb/>
courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that<lb/>
you are the first-born; but the same tradition<lb/>
takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers<lb/>
betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as<lb/>
you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is<lb/>
nearer to his reverence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>What, boy!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir<lb/>
Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice<lb/>
a villain that says such a father begot villains.<lb/>
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand<lb/>
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy<lb/>
tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADAM</speaker>
<p>Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's<lb/>
remembrance, be at accord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Let me go, I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My<lb/>
father charged you in his will to give me good<lb/>
education: you have trained me like a peasant,<lb/>
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like<lb/>
qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in<lb/>
me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow<lb/>
me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or<lb/>
give me the poor allottery my father left me by<lb/>
testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?<lb/>
Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled<lb/>
with you; you shall have some part of your will: I<lb/>
pray you, leave me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Get you with him, you old dog.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADAM</speaker>
<p>Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my<lb/>
teeth in your service. God be with my old master!<lb/>
he would not have spoke such a word.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will<lb/>
physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand<lb/>
crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DENNIS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
<p>Calls your worship?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DENNIS</speaker>
<p>So please you, he is here at the door and importunes<lb/>
access to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Call him in.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit DENNIS</stage></p>


<p>
'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CHARLES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Good morrow to your worship.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the<lb/>
new court?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:<lb/>
that is, the old duke is banished by his younger<lb/>
brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords<lb/>
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,<lb/>
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;<lb/>
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be<lb/>
banished with her father?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves<lb/>
her, being ever from their cradles bred together,<lb/>
that she would have followed her exile, or have died<lb/>
to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no<lb/>
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and<lb/>
never two ladies loved as they do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Where will the old duke live?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and<lb/>
a many merry men with him; and there they live like<lb/>
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young<lb/>
gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time<lb/>
carelessly, as they did in the golden world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a<lb/>
matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand<lb/>
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition<lb/>
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.<lb/>
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that<lb/>
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him<lb/>
well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,<lb/>
for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I<lb/>
must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,<lb/>
out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you<lb/>
withal, that either you might stay him from his<lb/>
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall<lb/>
run into, in that it is a thing of his own search<lb/>
and altogether against my will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which<lb/>
thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had<lb/>
myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and<lb/>
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from<lb/>
it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:<lb/>
it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full<lb/>
of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's<lb/>
good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against<lb/>
me his natural brother: therefore use thy<lb/>
discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck<lb/>
as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if<lb/>
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not<lb/>
mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise<lb/>
against thee by poison, entrap thee by some<lb/>
treacherous device and never leave thee till he<lb/>
hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;<lb/>
for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak<lb/>
it, there is not one so young and so villanous this<lb/>
day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but<lb/>
should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must<lb/>
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come<lb/>
to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go<lb/>
alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and<lb/>
so God keep your worship!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Farewell, good Charles.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit CHARLES</stage></p>


<p>
Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see<lb/>
an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,<lb/>
hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never<lb/>
schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of<lb/>
all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much<lb/>
in the heart of the world, and especially of my own<lb/>
people, who best know him, that I am altogether<lb/>
misprised: but it shall not be so long; this<lb/>
wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that<lb/>
I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.<lb/>

<p><stage>Lawn before the Duke's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;<lb/>
and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could<lb/>
teach me to forget a banished father, you must not<lb/>
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight<lb/>
that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,<lb/>
had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou<lb/>
hadst been still with me, I could have taught my<lb/>
love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,<lb/>
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously<lb/>
tempered as mine is to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to<lb/>
rejoice in yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is<lb/>
like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt<lb/>
be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy<lb/>
father perforce, I will render thee again in<lb/>
affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break<lb/>
that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my<lb/>
sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let<lb/>
me see; what think you of falling in love?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but<lb/>
love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport<lb/>
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst<lb/>
in honour come off again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>What shall be our sport, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from<lb/>
her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I would we could do so, for her benefits are<lb/>
mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman<lb/>
doth most mistake in her gifts to women.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce<lb/>
makes honest, and those that she makes honest she<lb/>
makes very ill-favouredly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to<lb/>
Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,<lb/>
not in the lineaments of Nature.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter TOUCHSTONE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she<lb/>
not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature<lb/>
hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not<lb/>
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when<lb/>
Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of<lb/>
Nature's wit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but<lb/>
Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull<lb/>
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this<lb/>
natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of<lb/>
the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,<lb/>
wit! whither wander you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Mistress, you must come away to your father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Were you made the messenger?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Where learned you that oath, fool?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they<lb/>
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the<lb/>
mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the<lb/>
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and<lb/>
yet was not the knight forsworn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>How prove you that, in the great heap of your<lb/>
knowledge?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and<lb/>
swear by your beards that I am a knave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>By our beards, if we had them, thou art.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you<lb/>
swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no<lb/>
more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he<lb/>
never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away<lb/>
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>One that old Frederick, your father, loves.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!<lb/>
speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation<lb/>
one of these days.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what<lb/>
wise men do foolishly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little<lb/>
wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery<lb/>
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes<lb/>
Monsieur Le Beau.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>With his mouth full of news.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Then shall we be news-crammed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>All the better; we shall be the more marketable.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter LE BEAU</stage></p>


<p>
Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Sport! of what colour?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>As wit and fortune will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Or as the Destinies decree.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Nay, if I keep not my rank,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Thou losest thy old smell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good<lb/>
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>You tell us the manner of the wrestling.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please<lb/>
your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is<lb/>
yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming<lb/>
to perform it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>There comes an old man and his three sons,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I could match this beginning with an old tale.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men<lb/>
by these presents.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the<lb/>
duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him<lb/>
and broke three of his ribs, that there is little<lb/>
hope of life in him: so he served the second, and<lb/>
so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,<lb/>
their father, making such pitiful dole over them<lb/>
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Alas!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies<lb/>
have lost?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>Why, this that I speak of.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first<lb/>
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport<lb/>
for ladies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Or I, I promise thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>But is there any else longs to see this broken music<lb/>
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon<lb/>
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>You must, if you stay here; for here is the place<lb/>
appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to<lb/>
perform it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO,	CHARLES, and Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his<lb/>
own peril on his forwardness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Is yonder the man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>Even he, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither<lb/>
to see the wrestling?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;<lb/>
there is such odds in the man. In pity of the<lb/>
challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he<lb/>
will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if<lb/>
you can move him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>Do so: I'll not be by.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I attend them with all respect and duty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I<lb/>
come but in, as others do, to try with him the<lb/>
strength of my youth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your<lb/>
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's<lb/>
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or<lb/>
knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your<lb/>
adventure would counsel you to a more equal<lb/>
enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to<lb/>
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore<lb/>
be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke<lb/>
that the wrestling might not go forward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I beseech you, punish me not with your hard<lb/>
thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny<lb/>
so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let<lb/>
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my<lb/>
trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one<lb/>
shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one<lb/>
dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my<lb/>
friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the<lb/>
world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in<lb/>
the world I fill up a place, which may be better<lb/>
supplied when I have made it empty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>And mine, to eke out hers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Your heart's desires be with you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>Come, where is this young gallant that is so<lb/>
desirous to lie with his mother earth?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>You shall try but one fall.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARLES</speaker>
<p>No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him<lb/>
to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him<lb/>
from a first.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>An you mean to mock me after, you should not have<lb/>
mocked me before: but come your ways.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I would I were invisible, to catch the strong<lb/>
fellow by the leg.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They wrestle</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O excellent young man!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who<lb/>
should down.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Shout. CHARLES is thrown</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>No more, no more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>How dost thou, Charles?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>He cannot speak, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>I would thou hadst been son to some man else:<lb/>
The world esteem'd thy father honourable,<lb/>
But I did find him still mine enemy:<lb/>
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,<lb/>
Hadst thou descended from another house.<lb/>
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:<lb/>
I would thou hadst told me of another father.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Were I my father, coz, would I do this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,<lb/>
His youngest son; and would not change that calling,<lb/>
To be adopted heir to Frederick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,<lb/>
And all the world was of my father's mind:<lb/>
Had I before known this young man his son,<lb/>
I should have given him tears unto entreaties,<lb/>
Ere he should thus have ventured.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Gentle cousin,<lb/>
Let us go thank him and encourage him:<lb/>
My father's rough and envious disposition<lb/>
Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:<lb/>
If you do keep your promises in love<lb/>
But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,<lb/>
Your mistress shall be happy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Gentleman,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Giving him a chain from her neck</stage></p>


<p>
Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,<lb/>
That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.<lb/>
Shall we go, coz?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts<lb/>
Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up<lb/>
Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;<lb/>
I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?<lb/>
Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown<lb/>
More than your enemies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Will you go, coz?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Have with you. Fare you well.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?<lb/>
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.<lb/>
O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!<lb/>
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter LE BEAU</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you<lb/>
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved<lb/>
High commendation, true applause and love,<lb/>
Yet such is now the duke's condition<lb/>
That he misconstrues all that you have done.<lb/>
The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,<lb/>
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:<lb/>
Which of the two was daughter of the duke<lb/>
That here was at the wrestling?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LE BEAU</speaker>
<p>Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;<lb/>
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter<lb/>
The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,<lb/>
And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,<lb/>
To keep his daughter company; whose loves<lb/>
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.<lb/>
But I can tell you that of late this duke<lb/>
Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,<lb/>
Grounded upon no other argument<lb/>
But that the people praise her for her virtues<lb/>
And pity her for her good father's sake;<lb/>
And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady<lb/>
Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:<lb/>
Hereafter, in a better world than this,<lb/>
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit LE BEAU</stage></p>


<p>
Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;<lb/>
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:<lb/>
But heavenly Rosalind!<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exit</stage>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>A room in the palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CELIA and ROSALIND</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Not one to throw at a dog.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon<lb/>
curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one<lb/>
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad<lb/>
without any.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>But is all this for your father?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how<lb/>
full of briers is this working-day world!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in<lb/>
holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden<lb/>
paths our very petticoats will catch them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Hem them away.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in<lb/>
despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of<lb/>
service, let us talk in good earnest: is it<lb/>
possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so<lb/>
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>The duke my father loved his father dearly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son<lb/>
dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,<lb/>
for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate<lb/>
not Orlando.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Let me love him for that, and do you love him<lb/>
because I do. Look, here comes the duke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>With his eyes full of anger.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste<lb/>
And get you from our court.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Me, uncle?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>You, cousin<lb/>
Within these ten days if that thou be'st found<lb/>
So near our public court as twenty miles,<lb/>
Thou diest for it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I do beseech your grace,<lb/>
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:<lb/>
If with myself I hold intelligence<lb/>
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,<lb/>
If that I do not dream or be not frantic,&mdash;<lb/>
As I do trust I am not&mdash;then, dear uncle,<lb/>
Never so much as in a thought unborn<lb/>
Did I offend your highness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>Thus do all traitors:<lb/>
If their purgation did consist in words,<lb/>
They are as innocent as grace itself:<lb/>
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:<lb/>
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>So was I when your highness took his dukedom;<lb/>
So was I when your highness banish'd him:<lb/>
Treason is not inherited, my lord;<lb/>
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,<lb/>
What's that to me? my father was no traitor:<lb/>
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much<lb/>
To think my poverty is treacherous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Dear sovereign, hear me speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,<lb/>
Else had she with her father ranged along.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I did not then entreat to have her stay;<lb/>
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:<lb/>
I was too young that time to value her;<lb/>
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,<lb/>
Why so am I; we still have slept together,<lb/>
Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,<lb/>
And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,<lb/>
Still we went coupled and inseparable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,<lb/>
Her very silence and her patience<lb/>
Speak to the people, and they pity her.<lb/>
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;<lb/>
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous<lb/>
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:<lb/>
Firm and irrevocable is my doom<lb/>
Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:<lb/>
I cannot live out of her company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:<lb/>
If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,<lb/>
And in the greatness of my word, you die.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?<lb/>
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.<lb/>
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I have more cause.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Thou hast not, cousin;<lb/>
Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke<lb/>
Hath banish'd me, his daughter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>That he hath not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love<lb/>
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:<lb/>
Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?<lb/>
No: let my father seek another heir.<lb/>
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,<lb/>
Whither to go and what to bear with us;<lb/>
And do not seek to take your change upon you,<lb/>
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;<lb/>
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,<lb/>
Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Why, whither shall we go?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Alas, what danger will it be to us,<lb/>
Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!<lb/>
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I'll put myself in poor and mean attire<lb/>
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;<lb/>
The like do you: so shall we pass along<lb/>
And never stir assailants.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Were it not better,<lb/>
Because that I am more than common tall,<lb/>
That I did suit me all points like a man?<lb/>
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,<lb/>
A boar-spear in my hand; and&mdash;in my heart<lb/>
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will&mdash;<lb/>
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,<lb/>
As many other mannish cowards have<lb/>
That do outface it with their semblances.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>What shall I call thee when thou art a man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;<lb/>
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.<lb/>
But what will you be call'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Something that hath a reference to my state<lb/>
No longer Celia, but Aliena.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal<lb/>
The clownish fool out of your father's court?<lb/>
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;<lb/>
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,<lb/>
And get our jewels and our wealth together,<lb/>
Devise the fittest time and safest way<lb/>
To hide us from pursuit that will be made<lb/>
After my flight. Now go we in content<lb/>
To liberty and not to banishment.<lb/>

<p><stage>The Forest of Arden.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,	like foresters</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,<lb/>
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet<lb/>
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods<lb/>
More free from peril than the envious court?<lb/>
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,<lb/>
The seasons' difference, as the icy fang<lb/>
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,<lb/>
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,<lb/>
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say<lb/>
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors<lb/>
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'<lb/>
Sweet are the uses of adversity,<lb/>
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,<lb/>
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;<lb/>
And this our life exempt from public haunt<lb/>
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,<lb/>
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.<lb/>
I would not change it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AMIENS</speaker>
<p>Happy is your grace,<lb/>
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune<lb/>
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Come, shall we go and kill us venison?<lb/>
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,<lb/>
Being native burghers of this desert city,<lb/>
Should in their own confines with forked heads<lb/>
Have their round haunches gored.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Indeed, my lord,<lb/>
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,<lb/>
And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp<lb/>
Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.<lb/>
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself<lb/>
Did steal behind him as he lay along<lb/>
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out<lb/>
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:<lb/>
To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,<lb/>
That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,<lb/>
Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,<lb/>
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans<lb/>
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat<lb/>
Almost to bursting, and the big round tears<lb/>
Coursed one another down his innocent nose<lb/>
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool<lb/>
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,<lb/>
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,<lb/>
Augmenting it with tears.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>But what said Jaques?<lb/>
Did he not moralize this spectacle?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>O, yes, into a thousand similes.<lb/>
First, for his weeping into the needless stream;<lb/>
'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament<lb/>
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more<lb/>
To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,<lb/>
Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,<lb/>
''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part<lb/>
The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,<lb/>
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him<lb/>
And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,<lb/>
'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;<lb/>
'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look<lb/>
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'<lb/>
Thus most invectively he pierceth through<lb/>
The body of the country, city, court,<lb/>
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we<lb/>
Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,<lb/>
To fright the animals and to kill them up<lb/>
In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>And did you leave him in this contemplation?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>We did, my lord, weeping and commenting<lb/>
Upon the sobbing deer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Show me the place:<lb/>
I love to cope him in these sullen fits,<lb/>
For then he's full of matter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>

</p><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>Can it be possible that no man saw them?<lb/>
It cannot be: some villains of my court<lb/>
Are of consent and sufferance in this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I cannot hear of any that did see her.<lb/>
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,<lb/>
Saw her abed, and in the morning early<lb/>
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft<lb/>
Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.<lb/>
Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,<lb/>
Confesses that she secretly o'erheard<lb/>
Your daughter and her cousin much commend<lb/>
The parts and graces of the wrestler<lb/>
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;<lb/>
And she believes, wherever they are gone,<lb/>
That youth is surely in their company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE FREDERICK</speaker>
<p>Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;<lb/>
If he be absent, bring his brother to me;<lb/>
I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Who's there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADAM</speaker>
<p>What, my young master? O, my gentle master!<lb/>
O my sweet master! O you memory<lb/>
Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?<lb/>
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?<lb/>
And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?<lb/>
Why would you be so fond to overcome<lb/>
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?<lb/>
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.<lb/>
Know you not, master, to some kind of men<lb/>
Their graces serve them but as enemies?<lb/>
No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,<lb/>
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.<lb/>
O, what a world is this, when what is comely<lb/>
Envenoms him that bears it!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Why, what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADAM</speaker>
<p>O unhappy youth!<lb/>
Come not within these doors; within this roof<lb/>
The enemy of all your graces lives:<lb/>
Your brother&mdash;no, no brother; yet the son&mdash;<lb/>
Yet not the son, I will not call him son<lb/>
Of him I was about to call his father&mdash;<lb/>
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means<lb/>
To burn the lodging where you use to lie<lb/>
And you within it: if he fail of that,<lb/>
He will have other means to cut you off.<lb/>
I overheard him and his practises.<lb/>
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:<lb/>
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADAM</speaker>
<p>No matter whither, so you come not here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?<lb/>
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce<lb/>
A thievish living on the common road?<lb/>
This I must do, or know not what to do:<lb/>
Yet this I will not do, do how I can;<lb/>
I rather will subject me to the malice<lb/>
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADAM</speaker>
<p>But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,<lb/>
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,<lb/>
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse<lb/>
When service should in my old limbs lie lame<lb/>
And unregarded age in corners thrown:<lb/>
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,<lb/>
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,<lb/>
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;<lb/>
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:<lb/>
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;<lb/>
For in my youth I never did apply<lb/>
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,<lb/>
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo<lb/>
The means of weakness and debility;<lb/>
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,<lb/>
Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;<lb/>
I'll do the service of a younger man<lb/>
In all your business and necessities.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>O good old man, how well in thee appears<lb/>
The constant service of the antique world,<lb/>
When service sweat for duty, not for meed!<lb/>
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,<lb/>
Where none will sweat but for promotion,<lb/>
And having that, do choke their service up<lb/>
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.<lb/>
But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,<lb/>
That cannot so much as a blossom yield<lb/>
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry<lb/>
But come thy ways; well go along together,<lb/>
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,<lb/>
We'll light upon some settled low content.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADAM</speaker>
<p>Master, go on, and I will follow thee,<lb/>
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.<lb/>
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore<lb/>
Here lived I, but now live here no more.<lb/>
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;<lb/>
But at fourscore it is too late a week:<lb/>
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better<lb/>
Than to die well and not my master's debtor.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's<lb/>
apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort<lb/>
the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show<lb/>
itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,<lb/>
good Aliena!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear<lb/>
you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,<lb/>
for I think you have no money in your purse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Well, this is the forest of Arden.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was<lb/>
at home, I was in a better place: but travellers<lb/>

<p>
Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>That is the way to make her scorn you still.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,<lb/>
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover<lb/>
As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:<lb/>
But if thy love were ever like to mine&mdash;<lb/>
As sure I think did never man love so&mdash;<lb/>
How many actions most ridiculous<lb/>
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Into a thousand that I have forgotten.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!<lb/>
If thou remember'st not the slightest folly<lb/>
That ever love did make thee run into,<lb/>
Thou hast not loved:<lb/>
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,<lb/>
Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,<lb/>
Thou hast not loved:<lb/>
Or if thou hast not broke from company<lb/>
Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,<lb/>
Thou hast not loved.<lb/>
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,<lb/>
I have by hard adventure found mine own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke<lb/>
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for<lb/>
coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the<lb/>
kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her<lb/>
pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the<lb/>
wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took<lb/>
two cods and, giving her them again, said with<lb/>
weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are<lb/>
true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is<lb/>
mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I<lb/>
break my shins against it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion<lb/>
Is much upon my fashion.<lb/>

<p>And mine; but it grows something stale with me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I pray you, one of you question yond man<lb/>
If he for gold will give us any food:<lb/>
I faint almost to death.<lb/>

<p>Your betters, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Else are they very wretched.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold<lb/>
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,<lb/>
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:<lb/>
Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd<lb/>
And faints for succor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Fair sir, I pity her<lb/>
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,<lb/>
My fortunes were more able to relieve her;<lb/>
But I am shepherd to another man<lb/>
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:<lb/>
My master is of churlish disposition<lb/>
And little recks to find the way to heaven<lb/>
By doing deeds of hospitality:<lb/>
Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed<lb/>
Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,<lb/>
By reason of his absence, there is nothing<lb/>
That you will feed on; but what is, come see.<lb/>
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,<lb/>
That little cares for buying any thing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,<lb/>
Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,<lb/>
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.<lb/>
And willingly could waste my time in it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Assuredly the thing is to be sold:<lb/>
Go with me: if you like upon report<lb/>
The soil, the profit and this kind of life,<lb/>
I will your very faithful feeder be<lb/>
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.<lb/>

<p><stage>SONG.</stage></p>

<sp><speaker>AMIENS</speaker>
<p>Under the greenwood tree<lb/>
Who loves to lie with me,<lb/>
And turn his merry note<lb/>
Unto the sweet bird's throat,<lb/>
Come hither, come hither, come hither:<lb/>
Here shall he see No enemy<lb/>
But winter and rough weather.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>More, more, I prithee, more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AMIENS</speaker>
<p>It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck<lb/>
melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.<lb/>
More, I prithee, more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AMIENS</speaker>
<p>My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to<lb/>
sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AMIENS</speaker>
<p>What you will, Monsieur Jaques.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me<lb/>
nothing. Will you sing?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AMIENS</speaker>
<p>More at your request than to please myself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;<lb/>
but that they call compliment is like the encounter<lb/>
of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,<lb/>
methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me<lb/>
the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will<lb/>
not, hold your tongues.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AMIENS</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the<lb/>
duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all<lb/>
this day to look you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is<lb/>
too disputable for my company: I think of as many<lb/>
matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no<lb/>
boast of them. Come, warble, come.<lb/>

And loves to live i' the sun,<lb/>

<p>I'll give you a verse to this note that I made<lb/>
yesterday in despite of my invention.<lb/>

For I can no where find him like a man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>My lord, he is but even now gone hence:<lb/>

<p>He saves my labour by his own approach.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,<lb/>
That your poor friends must woo your company?<lb/>
What, you look merrily!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,<lb/>
A motley fool; a miserable world!<lb/>
As I do live by food, I met a fool<lb/>
Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,<lb/>
And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,<lb/>
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.<lb/>
'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,<lb/>
'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'<lb/>
And then he drew a dial from his poke,<lb/>
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,<lb/>
Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:<lb/>
Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:<lb/>
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,<lb/>
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;<lb/>
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,<lb/>
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;<lb/>
And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear<lb/>
The motley fool thus moral on the time,<lb/>
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,<lb/>
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,<lb/>
And I did laugh sans intermission<lb/>
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!<lb/>
A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>What fool is this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,<lb/>
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,<lb/>
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,<lb/>
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit<lb/>
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd<lb/>
With observation, the which he vents<lb/>
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!<lb/>
I am ambitious for a motley coat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt have one.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>It is my only suit;<lb/>
Provided that you weed your better judgments<lb/>
Of all opinion that grows rank in them<lb/>
That I am wise. I must have liberty<lb/>
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,<lb/>
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;<lb/>
And they that are most galled with my folly,<lb/>
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?<lb/>
The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:<lb/>
He that a fool doth very wisely hit<lb/>
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,<lb/>
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,<lb/>
The wise man's folly is anatomized<lb/>
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.<lb/>
Invest me in my motley; give me leave<lb/>
To speak my mind, and I will through and through<lb/>
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,<lb/>
If they will patiently receive my medicine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>What, for a counter, would I do but good?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:<lb/>
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,<lb/>
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;<lb/>
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,<lb/>
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,<lb/>
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Why, who cries out on pride,<lb/>
That can therein tax any private party?<lb/>
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,<lb/>
Till that the weary very means do ebb?<lb/>
What woman in the city do I name,<lb/>
When that I say the city-woman bears<lb/>
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?<lb/>
Who can come in and say that I mean her,<lb/>
When such a one as she such is her neighbour?<lb/>
Or what is he of basest function<lb/>
That says his bravery is not of my cost,<lb/>
Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits<lb/>
His folly to the mettle of my speech?<lb/>
There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein<lb/>
My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,<lb/>
Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,<lb/>
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,<lb/>
Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point<lb/>
Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show<lb/>
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred<lb/>

He dies that touches any of this fruit<lb/>
Till I and my affairs are answered.<lb/>

I thought that all things had been savage here;<lb/>
And therefore put I on the countenance<lb/>
Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are<lb/>
That in this desert inaccessible,<lb/>
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,<lb/>
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time<lb/>
If ever you have look'd on better days,<lb/>
If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,<lb/>
If ever sat at any good man's feast,<lb/>
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear<lb/>
And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,<lb/>
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:<lb/>
In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>True is it that we have seen better days,<lb/>
And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church<lb/>
And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes<lb/>
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:<lb/>
And therefore sit you down in gentleness<lb/>
And take upon command what help we have<lb/>
That to your wanting may be minister'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Then but forbear your food a little while,<lb/>
Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn<lb/>
And give it food. There is an old poor man,<lb/>
Who after me hath many a weary step<lb/>
Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,<lb/>
Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,<lb/>
I will not touch a bit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Go find him out,<lb/>
And we will nothing waste till you return.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:<lb/>
This wide and universal theatre<lb/>
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene<lb/>
Wherein we play in.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>All the world's a stage,<lb/>
And all the men and women merely players:<lb/>
They have their exits and their entrances;<lb/>
And one man in his time plays many parts,<lb/>
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<lb/>
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.<lb/>
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel<lb/>
And shining morning face, creeping like snail<lb/>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<lb/>
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<lb/>
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,<lb/>
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<lb/>
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,<lb/>
Seeking the bubble reputation<lb/>
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,<lb/>
In fair round belly with good capon lined,<lb/>
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<lb/>
Full of wise saws and modern instances;<lb/>
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<lb/>
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,<lb/>
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,<lb/>
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<lb/>
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<lb/>
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<lb/>
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<lb/>
That ends this strange eventful history,<lb/>
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,<lb/>
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.<lb/>

<p>Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,<lb/>

SONG.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AMIENS</speaker>
<p>Blow, blow, thou winter wind.<lb/>
Thou art not so unkind<lb/>
As man's ingratitude;<lb/>
Thy tooth is not so keen,<lb/>
Because thou art not seen,<lb/>
Although thy breath be rude.<lb/>
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:<lb/>
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:<lb/>
Then, heigh-ho, the holly!<lb/>
This life is most jolly.<lb/>
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,<lb/>
That dost not bite so nigh<lb/>
As benefits forgot:<lb/>
Though thou the waters warp,<lb/>
Thy sting is not so sharp<lb/>
As friend remember'd not.<lb/>
Heigh-ho! sing, &amp;c.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,<lb/>
As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,<lb/>
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness<lb/>
Most truly limn'd and living in your face,<lb/>
Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke<lb/>
That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,<lb/>
Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,<lb/>
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.<lb/>
Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,<lb/>
And let me all your fortunes understand.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good<lb/>
life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,<lb/>
it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I<lb/>
like it very well; but in respect that it is<lb/>
private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it<lb/>
is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in<lb/>
respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As<lb/>
is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;<lb/>
but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much<lb/>
against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>No more but that I know the more one sickens the<lb/>
worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,<lb/>
means and content is without three good friends;<lb/>
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to<lb/>
burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a<lb/>
great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that<lb/>
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may<lb/>
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in<lb/>
court, shepherd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>No, truly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Then thou art damned.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Nay, I hope.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all<lb/>
on one side.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>For not being at court? Your reason.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest<lb/>
good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,<lb/>
then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is<lb/>
sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous<lb/>
state, shepherd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners<lb/>
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the<lb/>
behavior of the country is most mockable at the<lb/>
court. You told me you salute not at the court, but<lb/>
you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be<lb/>
uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Instance, briefly; come, instance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their<lb/>
fells, you know, are greasy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not<lb/>
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of<lb/>
a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Besides, our hands are hard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.<lb/>
A more sounder instance, come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>And they are often tarred over with the surgery of<lb/>
our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The<lb/>
courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a<lb/>
good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and<lb/>
perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the<lb/>
very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!<lb/>
God make incision in thee! thou art raw.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get<lb/>
that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's<lb/>
happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my<lb/>
harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes<lb/>
graze and my lambs suck.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes<lb/>
and the rams together and to offer to get your<lb/>
living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a<lb/>
bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a<lb/>
twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,<lb/>
out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not<lb/>
damned for this, the devil himself will have no<lb/>
shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst<lb/>
'scape.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>From the east to western Ind,<lb/>
No jewel is like Rosalind.<lb/>
Her worth, being mounted on the wind,<lb/>
Through all the world bears Rosalind.<lb/>
All the pictures fairest lined<lb/>
Are but black to Rosalind.<lb/>
Let no fair be kept in mind<lb/>
But the fair of Rosalind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and<lb/>
suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the<lb/>
right butter-women's rank to market.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Out, fool!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>For a taste:<lb/>
If a hart do lack a hind,<lb/>
Let him seek out Rosalind.<lb/>
If the cat will after kind,<lb/>
So be sure will Rosalind.<lb/>
Winter garments must be lined,<lb/>
So must slender Rosalind.<lb/>
They that reap must sheaf and bind;<lb/>
Then to cart with Rosalind.<lb/>
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,<lb/>
Such a nut is Rosalind.<lb/>
He that sweetest rose will find<lb/>
Must find love's prick and Rosalind.<lb/>
This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you<lb/>
infect yourself with them?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it<lb/>
with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit<lb/>
i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half<lb/>
ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the<lb/>
forest judge.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CELIA, with a writing</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>
Why should this a desert be?<lb/>
For it is unpeopled? No:<lb/>
Tongues I'll hang on every tree,<lb/>
That shall civil sayings show:<lb/>
Some, how brief the life of man<lb/>
Runs his erring pilgrimage,<lb/>
That the stretching of a span<lb/>
Buckles in his sum of age;<lb/>
Some, of violated vows<lb/>
'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:<lb/>
But upon the fairest boughs,<lb/>
Or at every sentence end,<lb/>
Will I Rosalinda write,<lb/>
Teaching all that read to know<lb/>
The quintessence of every sprite<lb/>
Heaven would in little show.<lb/>
Therefore Heaven Nature charged<lb/>
That one body should be fill'd<lb/>
With all graces wide-enlarged:<lb/>
Nature presently distill'd<lb/>
Helen's cheek, but not her heart,<lb/>
Cleopatra's majesty,<lb/>
Atalanta's better part,<lb/>
Sad Lucretia's modesty.<lb/>
Thus Rosalind of many parts<lb/>
By heavenly synod was devised,<lb/>
Of many faces, eyes and hearts,<lb/>
To have the touches dearest prized.<lb/>
Heaven would that she these gifts should have,<lb/>
And I to live and die her slave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love<lb/>
have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never<lb/>
cried 'Have patience, good people!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.<lb/>
Go with him, sirrah.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;<lb/>
though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Didst thou hear these verses?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of<lb/>
them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear<lb/>
themselves without the verse and therefore stood<lb/>
lamely in the verse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name<lb/>
should be hanged and carved upon these trees?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder<lb/>
before you came; for look here what I found on a<lb/>
palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since<lb/>
Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I<lb/>
can hardly remember.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Trow you who hath done this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Is it a man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.<lb/>
Change you colour?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I prithee, who?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to<lb/>
meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes<lb/>
and so encounter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Nay, but who is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Is it possible?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,<lb/>
tell me who it is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful<lb/>
wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,<lb/>
out of all hooping!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am<lb/>
caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in<lb/>
my disposition? One inch of delay more is a<lb/>
South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it<lb/>
quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst<lb/>
stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man<lb/>
out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-<lb/>
mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at<lb/>
all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that<lb/>
may drink thy tidings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>So you may put a man in your belly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his<lb/>
head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Nay, he hath but a little beard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Why, God will send more, if the man will be<lb/>
thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if<lb/>
thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's<lb/>
heels and your heart both in an instant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and<lb/>
true maid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I' faith, coz, 'tis he.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Orlando?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Orlando.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and<lb/>
hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said<lb/>
he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes<lb/>
him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?<lb/>
How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see<lb/>
him again? Answer me in one word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a<lb/>
word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To<lb/>
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to<lb/>
answer in a catechism.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>But doth he know that I am in this forest and in<lb/>
man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the<lb/>
day he wrestled?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the<lb/>
propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my<lb/>
finding him, and relish it with good observance.<lb/>
I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops<lb/>
forth such fruit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Give me audience, good madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Proceed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well<lb/>
becomes the ground.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets<lb/>
unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest<lb/>
me out of tune.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must<lb/>
speak. Sweet, say on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>'Tis he: slink by, and note him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had<lb/>
as lief have been myself alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you<lb/>
too for your society.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I do desire we may be better strangers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>I pray you, mar no more trees with writing<lb/>
love-songs in their barks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading<lb/>
them ill-favouredly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Rosalind is your love's name?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Yes, just.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>I do not like her name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>There was no thought of pleasing you when she was<lb/>
christened.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>What stature is she of?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Just as high as my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been<lb/>
acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them<lb/>
out of rings?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from<lb/>
whence you have studied your questions.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of<lb/>
Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and<lb/>
we two will rail against our mistress the world and<lb/>
all our misery.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I will chide no breather in the world but myself,<lb/>
against whom I know most faults.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>The worst fault you have is to be in love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.<lb/>
I am weary of you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found<lb/>
you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you<lb/>
shall see him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>There I shall see mine own figure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good<lb/>
Signior Love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur<lb/>
Melancholy.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit JAQUES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to CELIA]</stage></p><p>  I will speak to him, like a saucy<lb/>
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.<lb/>
Do you hear, forester?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Very well: what would you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I pray you, what is't o'clock?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock<lb/>
in the forest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Then there is no true lover in the forest; else<lb/>
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would<lb/>
detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that<lb/>
been as proper?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with<lb/>
divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles<lb/>
withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops<lb/>
withal and who he stands still withal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I prithee, who doth he trot withal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the<lb/>
contract of her marriage and the day it is<lb/>
solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,<lb/>
Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of<lb/>
seven year.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Who ambles Time withal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that<lb/>
hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because<lb/>
he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because<lb/>
he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean<lb/>
and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden<lb/>
of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Who doth he gallop withal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as<lb/>
softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Who stays it still withal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between<lb/>
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Where dwell you, pretty youth?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the<lb/>
skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Are you native of this place?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Your accent is something finer than you could<lb/>
purchase in so removed a dwelling.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I have been told so of many: but indeed an old<lb/>
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was<lb/>
in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship<lb/>
too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard<lb/>
him read many lectures against it, and I thank God<lb/>
I am not a woman, to be touched with so many<lb/>
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their<lb/>
whole sex withal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Can you remember any of the principal evils that he<lb/>
laid to the charge of women?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>There were none principal; they were all like one<lb/>
another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming<lb/>
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I prithee, recount some of them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that<lb/>
are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that<lb/>
abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on<lb/>
their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies<lb/>
on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of<lb/>
Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would<lb/>
give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the<lb/>
quotidian of love upon him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me<lb/>
your remedy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he<lb/>
taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage<lb/>
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>What were his marks?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and<lb/>
sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable<lb/>
spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,<lb/>
which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for<lb/>
simply your having in beard is a younger brother's<lb/>
revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your<lb/>
bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe<lb/>
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a<lb/>
careless desolation; but you are no such man; you<lb/>
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as<lb/>
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you<lb/>
love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to<lb/>
do than to confess she does: that is one of the<lb/>
points in the which women still give the lie to<lb/>
their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he<lb/>
that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind<lb/>
is so admired?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of<lb/>
Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves<lb/>
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and<lb/>
the reason why they are not so punished and cured<lb/>
is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers<lb/>
are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Did you ever cure any so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me<lb/>
his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to<lb/>
woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish<lb/>
youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing<lb/>
and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,<lb/>
inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every<lb/>
passion something and for no passion truly any<lb/>
thing, as boys and women are for the most part<lb/>
cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe<lb/>
him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep<lb/>
for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor<lb/>
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of<lb/>
madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of<lb/>
the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.<lb/>
And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon<lb/>
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's<lb/>
heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I would not be cured, youth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind<lb/>
and come every day to my cote and woo me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me<lb/>
where it is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way<lb/>
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.<lb/>
Will you go?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>With all my heart, good youth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?<lb/>

<p><stage>The forest.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your<lb/>
goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?<lb/>
doth my simple feature content you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUDREY</speaker>
<p>Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most<lb/>
capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove<lb/>
in a thatched house!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a<lb/>
man's good wit seconded with the forward child<lb/>
Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a<lb/>
great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would<lb/>
the gods had made thee poetical.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUDREY</speaker>
<p>I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in<lb/>
deed and word? is it a true thing?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most<lb/>
feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what<lb/>
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUDREY</speaker>
<p>Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art<lb/>
honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some<lb/>
hope thou didst feign.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUDREY</speaker>
<p>Would you not have me honest?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for<lb/>
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  A material fool!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUDREY</speaker>
<p>Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods<lb/>
make me honest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut<lb/>
were to put good meat into an unclean dish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUDREY</speaker>
<p>I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!<lb/>
sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may<lb/>
be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been<lb/>
with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next<lb/>
village, who hath promised to meet me in this place<lb/>
of the forest and to couple us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I would fain see this meeting.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUDREY</speaker>
<p>Well, the gods give us joy!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,<lb/>
stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple<lb/>
but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what<lb/>
though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are<lb/>
necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of<lb/>
his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and<lb/>
knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of<lb/>
his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?<lb/>
Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer<lb/>
hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man<lb/>
therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more<lb/>
worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a<lb/>
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a<lb/>
bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no<lb/>
skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to<lb/>
want. Here comes Sir Oliver.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</stage></p>


<p>
Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you<lb/>
dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go<lb/>
with you to your chapel?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</speaker>
<p>Is there none here to give the woman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>I will not take her on gift of any man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR OLIVER MARTEXT</speaker>
<p>Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Advancing]</stage></p><p>
Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,<lb/>
sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your<lb/>
last company: I am very glad to see you: even a<lb/>
toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Will you be married, motley?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and<lb/>
the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and<lb/>
as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>And will you, being a man of your breeding, be<lb/>
married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to<lb/>
church, and have a good priest that can tell you<lb/>
what marriage is: this fellow will but join you<lb/>
together as they join wainscot; then one of you will<lb/>
prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I am not in the mind but I were better to be<lb/>
married of him than of another: for he is not like<lb/>
to marry me well; and not being well married, it<lb/>
will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>'Come, sweet Audrey:<lb/>
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.<lb/>
Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,&mdash;<lb/>
O sweet Oliver,<lb/>
O brave Oliver,<lb/>
Leave me not behind thee: but,&mdash;<lb/>
Wind away,<lb/>
Begone, I say,<lb/>
I will not to wedding with thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY</stage>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>The forest.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter ROSALIND and CELIA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Never talk to me; I will weep.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider<lb/>
that tears do not become a man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>But have I not cause to weep?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>His very hair is of the dissembling colour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are<lb/>
Judas's own children.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch<lb/>
of holy bread.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun<lb/>
of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;<lb/>
the very ice of chastity is in them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>But why did he swear he would come this morning, and<lb/>
comes not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Do you think so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a<lb/>
horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do<lb/>
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a<lb/>
worm-eaten nut.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Not true in love?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>You have heard him swear downright he was.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is<lb/>
no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are<lb/>
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends<lb/>
here in the forest on the duke your father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I met the duke yesterday and had much question with<lb/>
him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told<lb/>
him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.<lb/>
But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a<lb/>
man as Orlando?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,<lb/>
speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks<lb/>
them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of<lb/>
his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse<lb/>
but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble<lb/>
goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly<lb/>
guides. Who comes here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CORIN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>Mistress and master, you have oft inquired<lb/>
After the shepherd that complain'd of love,<lb/>
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,<lb/>
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess<lb/>
That was his mistress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Well, and what of him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CORIN</speaker>
<p>If you will see a pageant truly play'd,<lb/>
Between the pale complexion of true love<lb/>
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,<lb/>
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,<lb/>
If you will mark it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O, come, let us remove:<lb/>
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.<lb/>
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say<lb/>
I'll prove a busy actor in their play.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;<lb/>
Say that you love me not, but say not so<lb/>
In bitterness. The common executioner,<lb/>
Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,<lb/>
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck<lb/>
But first begs pardon: will you sterner be<lb/>
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>I would not be thy executioner:<lb/>
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.<lb/>
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:<lb/>
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,<lb/>
That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,<lb/>
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,<lb/>
Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!<lb/>
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;<lb/>
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:<lb/>
Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;<lb/>
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,<lb/>
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!<lb/>
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:<lb/>
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains<lb/>
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,<lb/>
The cicatrice and capable impressure<lb/>
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,<lb/>
Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,<lb/>
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes<lb/>
That can do hurt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>O dear Phebe,<lb/>
If ever,&mdash;as that ever may be near,&mdash;<lb/>
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,<lb/>
Then shall you know the wounds invisible<lb/>
That love's keen arrows make.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>But till that time<lb/>
Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,<lb/>
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;<lb/>
As till that time I shall not pity thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,<lb/>
That you insult, exult, and all at once,<lb/>
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,&mdash;<lb/>
As, by my faith, I see no more in you<lb/>
Than without candle may go dark to bed&mdash;<lb/>
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?<lb/>
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?<lb/>
I see no more in you than in the ordinary<lb/>
Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,<lb/>
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!<lb/>
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:<lb/>
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,<lb/>
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,<lb/>
That can entame my spirits to your worship.<lb/>
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,<lb/>
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?<lb/>
You are a thousand times a properer man<lb/>
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you<lb/>
That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:<lb/>
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;<lb/>
And out of you she sees herself more proper<lb/>
Than any of her lineaments can show her.<lb/>
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,<lb/>
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:<lb/>
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,<lb/>
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:<lb/>
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:<lb/>
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.<lb/>
So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:<lb/>
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll<lb/>
fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as<lb/>
she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her<lb/>
with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>For no ill will I bear you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I pray you, do not fall in love with me,<lb/>
For I am falser than vows made in wine:<lb/>
Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,<lb/>
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.<lb/>
Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.<lb/>
Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,<lb/>
And be not proud: though all the world could see,<lb/>
None could be so abused in sight as he.<lb/>
Come, to our flock.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,<lb/>
'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>Sweet Phebe,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>Sweet Phebe, pity me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:<lb/>
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,<lb/>
By giving love your sorrow and my grief<lb/>
Were both extermined.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>I would have you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Why, that were covetousness.<lb/>
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,<lb/>
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;<lb/>
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,<lb/>
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,<lb/>
I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:<lb/>
But do not look for further recompense<lb/>
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>So holy and so perfect is my love,<lb/>
And I in such a poverty of grace,<lb/>
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop<lb/>
To glean the broken ears after the man<lb/>
That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then<lb/>
A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>Not very well, but I have met him oft;<lb/>
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds<lb/>
That the old carlot once was master of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Think not I love him, though I ask for him:<lb/>
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;<lb/>
But what care I for words? yet words do well<lb/>
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.<lb/>
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:<lb/>
But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:<lb/>
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him<lb/>
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue<lb/>
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.<lb/>
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:<lb/>
His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:<lb/>
There was a pretty redness in his lip,<lb/>
A little riper and more lusty red<lb/>
Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference<lb/>
Between the constant red and mingled damask.<lb/>
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him<lb/>
In parcels as I did, would have gone near<lb/>
To fall in love with him; but, for my part,<lb/>
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet<lb/>
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:<lb/>
For what had he to do to chide at me?<lb/>
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:<lb/>
And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:<lb/>
I marvel why I answer'd not again:<lb/>
But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.<lb/>
I'll write to him a very taunting letter,<lb/>
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>Phebe, with all my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>I'll write it straight;<lb/>
The matter's in my head and in my heart:<lb/>
I will be bitter with him and passing short.<lb/>
Go with me, Silvius.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted<lb/>
with thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>They say you are a melancholy fellow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>I am so; I do love it better than laughing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Those that are in extremity of either are abominable<lb/>
fellows and betray themselves to every modern<lb/>
censure worse than drunkards.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Why then, 'tis good to be a post.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is<lb/>
emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,<lb/>
nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the<lb/>
soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,<lb/>
which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor<lb/>
the lover's, which is all these: but it is a<lb/>
melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,<lb/>
extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's<lb/>
contemplation of my travels, in which my often<lb/>
rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to<lb/>
be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see<lb/>
other men's; then, to have seen much and to have<lb/>
nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Yes, I have gained my experience.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have<lb/>
a fool to make me merry than experience to make me<lb/>
sad; and to travel for it too!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ORLANDO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and<lb/>
wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your<lb/>
own country, be out of love with your nativity and<lb/>
almost chide God for making you that countenance you<lb/>
are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a<lb/>
gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been<lb/>
all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such<lb/>
another trick, never come in my sight more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Break an hour's promise in love! He that will<lb/>
divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but<lb/>
a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the<lb/>
affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid<lb/>
hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant<lb/>
him heart-whole.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, dear Rosalind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I<lb/>
had as lief be wooed of a snail.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Of a snail?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he<lb/>
carries his house on his head; a better jointure,<lb/>
I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings<lb/>
his destiny with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>What's that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be<lb/>
beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in<lb/>
his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>And I am your Rosalind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a<lb/>
Rosalind of a better leer than you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday<lb/>
humour and like enough to consent. What would you<lb/>
say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I would kiss before I spoke.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were<lb/>
gravelled for lack of matter, you might take<lb/>
occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are<lb/>
out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking&mdash;God<lb/>
warn us!&mdash;matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>How if the kiss be denied?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or<lb/>
I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>What, of my suit?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.<lb/>
Am not I your Rosalind?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I take some joy to say you are, because I would be<lb/>
talking of her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Well in her person I say I will not have you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Then in mine own person I die.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is<lb/>
almost six thousand years old, and in all this time<lb/>
there was not any man died in his own person,<lb/>
videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains<lb/>
dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he<lb/>
could to die before, and he is one of the patterns<lb/>
of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair<lb/>
year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been<lb/>
for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went<lb/>
but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being<lb/>
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish<lb/>
coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'<lb/>
But these are all lies: men have died from time to<lb/>
time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,<lb/>
for, I protest, her frown might kill me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now<lb/>
I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on<lb/>
disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant<lb/>
it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Then love me, Rosalind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>And wilt thou have me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Ay, and twenty such.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>What sayest thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Are you not good?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I hope so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?<lb/>
Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.<lb/>
Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Pray thee, marry us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I cannot say the words.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando&mdash;'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Ay, but when?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Why now; as fast as she can marry us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I might ask you for your commission; but I do take<lb/>
thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes<lb/>
before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought<lb/>
runs before her actions.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>So do all thoughts; they are winged.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Now tell me how long you would have her after you<lb/>
have possessed her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>For ever and a day.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;<lb/>
men are April when they woo, December when they wed:<lb/>
maids are May when they are maids, but the sky<lb/>
changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous<lb/>
of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,<lb/>
more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more<lb/>
new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires<lb/>
than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana<lb/>
in the fountain, and I will do that when you are<lb/>
disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and<lb/>
that when thou art inclined to sleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>But will my Rosalind do so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>By my life, she will do as I do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>O, but she is wise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the<lb/>
wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's<lb/>
wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and<lb/>
'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly<lb/>
with the smoke out at the chimney.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say<lb/>
'Wit, whither wilt?'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met<lb/>
your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>And what wit could wit have to excuse that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall<lb/>
never take her without her answer, unless you take<lb/>
her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot<lb/>
make her fault her husband's occasion, let her<lb/>
never nurse her child herself, for she will breed<lb/>
it like a fool!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I<lb/>
will be with thee again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you<lb/>
would prove: my friends told me as much, and I<lb/>
thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours<lb/>
won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,<lb/>
death! Two o'clock is your hour?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Ay, sweet Rosalind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend<lb/>
me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,<lb/>
if you break one jot of your promise or come one<lb/>
minute behind your hour, I will think you the most<lb/>
pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover<lb/>
and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that<lb/>
may be chosen out of the gross band of the<lb/>
unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep<lb/>
your promise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my<lb/>
Rosalind: so adieu.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such<lb/>
offenders, and let Time try: adieu.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit ORLANDO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:<lb/>
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your<lb/>
head, and show the world what the bird hath done to<lb/>
her own nest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou<lb/>
didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But<lb/>
it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown<lb/>
bottom, like the bay of Portugal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour<lb/>
affection in, it runs out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot<lb/>
of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,<lb/>
that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes<lb/>
because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I<lb/>
am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out<lb/>
of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and<lb/>
sigh till he come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>And I'll sleep.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>My errand is to you, fair youth;<lb/>
My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:<lb/>
I know not the contents; but, as I guess<lb/>
By the stern brow and waspish action<lb/>
Which she did use as she was writing of it,<lb/>
It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:<lb/>
I am but as a guiltless messenger.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Patience herself would startle at this letter<lb/>
And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:<lb/>
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;<lb/>
She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,<lb/>
Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!<lb/>
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:<lb/>
Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,<lb/>
This is a letter of your own device.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>No, I protest, I know not the contents:<lb/>
Phebe did write it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Come, come, you are a fool<lb/>
And turn'd into the extremity of love.<lb/>
I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.<lb/>
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think<lb/>
That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:<lb/>
She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:<lb/>
I say she never did invent this letter;<lb/>
This is a man's invention and his hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>Sure, it is hers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.<lb/>
A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,<lb/>
Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain<lb/>
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention<lb/>
Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect<lb/>
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>So please you, for I never heard it yet;<lb/>

Meaning me a beast.<lb/>
If the scorn of your bright eyne<lb/>

Alack, in me what strange effect<lb/>
Would they work in mild aspect!<lb/>
Whiles you chid me, I did love;<lb/>
How then might your prayers move!<lb/>
He that brings this love to thee<lb/>
Little knows this love in me:<lb/>
And by him seal up thy mind;<lb/>
Whether that thy youth and kind<lb/>
Will the faithful offer take<lb/>
Of me and all that I can make;<lb/>
Or else by him my love deny,<lb/>
And then I'll study how to die.<lb/>

<p>Alas, poor shepherd!<lb/>

<p>Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt<lb/>
thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an<lb/>
instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to<lb/>
be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see<lb/>
love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to<lb/>
her: that if she love me, I charge her to love<lb/>
thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless<lb/>
thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,<lb/>
hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,<lb/>
Where in the purlieus of this forest stands<lb/>
A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:<lb/>
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream<lb/>
Left on your right hand brings you to the place.<lb/>
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;<lb/>
There's none within.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>If that an eye may profit by a tongue,<lb/>
Then should I know you by description;<lb/>
Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,<lb/>
Of female favour, and bestows himself<lb/>
Like a ripe sister: the woman low<lb/>
And browner than her brother.' Are not you<lb/>
The owner of the house I did inquire for?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Orlando doth commend him to you both,<lb/>
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind<lb/>
He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I am: what must we understand by this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Some of my shame; if you will know of me<lb/>
What man I am, and how, and why, and where<lb/>
This handkercher was stain'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>I pray you, tell it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>When last the young Orlando parted from you<lb/>
He left a promise to return again<lb/>
Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,<lb/>
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,<lb/>
Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,<lb/>
And mark what object did present itself:<lb/>
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age<lb/>
And high top bald with dry antiquity,<lb/>
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,<lb/>
Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck<lb/>
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,<lb/>
Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd<lb/>
The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,<lb/>
Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,<lb/>
And with indented glides did slip away<lb/>
Into a bush: under which bush's shade<lb/>
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,<lb/>
Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,<lb/>
When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis<lb/>
The royal disposition of that beast<lb/>
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:<lb/>
This seen, Orlando did approach the man<lb/>
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;<lb/>
And he did render him the most unnatural<lb/>
That lived amongst men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>And well he might so do,<lb/>
For well I know he was unnatural.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,<lb/>
Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;<lb/>
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,<lb/>
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,<lb/>
Made him give battle to the lioness,<lb/>
Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling<lb/>
From miserable slumber I awaked.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Are you his brother?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Wast you he rescued?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker><p>	'Twas I; but 'tis not I<lb/>
I do not shame<lb/>
To tell you what I was, since my conversion<lb/>
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>But, for the bloody napkin?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>By and by.<lb/>
When from the first to last betwixt us two<lb/>
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,<lb/>
As how I came into that desert place:&mdash;<lb/>
In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,<lb/>
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,<lb/>
Committing me unto my brother's love;<lb/>
Who led me instantly unto his cave,<lb/>
There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm<lb/>
The lioness had torn some flesh away,<lb/>
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted<lb/>
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.<lb/>
Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;<lb/>
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,<lb/>
He sent me hither, stranger as I am,<lb/>
To tell this story, that you might excuse<lb/>
His broken promise, and to give this napkin<lb/>
Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth<lb/>
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>ROSALIND swoons</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Many will swoon when they do look on blood.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Look, he recovers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I would I were at home.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>We'll lead you thither.<lb/>
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a<lb/>
man's heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would<lb/>
think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell<lb/>
your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>This was not counterfeit: there is too great<lb/>
testimony in your complexion that it was a passion<lb/>
of earnest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Counterfeit, I assure you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CELIA</speaker>
<p>Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw<lb/>
homewards. Good sir, go with us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>That will I, for I must bear answer back<lb/>
How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend<lb/>
my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?<lb/>

<p>We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.<lb/>

<p>Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old<lb/>
gentleman's saying.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile<lb/>
Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the<lb/>
forest lays claim to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUDREY</speaker>
<p>Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in<lb/>
the world: here comes the man you mean.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my<lb/>
troth, we that have good wits have much to answer<lb/>
for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter WILLIAM</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>Good even, Audrey.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUDREY</speaker>
<p>God ye good even, William.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>And good even to you, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy<lb/>
head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>Five and twenty, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>A ripe age. Is thy name William?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>William, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir, I thank God.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>Faith, sir, so so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and<lb/>
yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,<lb/>
'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man<lb/>
knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen<lb/>
philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,<lb/>
would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;<lb/>
meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and<lb/>
lips to open. You do love this maid?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>I do, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Give me your hand. Art thou learned?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>No, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it<lb/>
is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out<lb/>
of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty<lb/>
the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse<lb/>
is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>WILLIAM</speaker>
<p>Which he, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you<lb/>
clown, abandon,&mdash;which is in the vulgar leave,&mdash;the<lb/>
society,&mdash;which in the boorish is company,&mdash;of this<lb/>
female,&mdash;which in the common is woman; which<lb/>
together is, abandon the society of this female, or,<lb/>
clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better<lb/>
understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make<lb/>
thee away, translate thy life into death, thy<lb/>
liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with<lb/>
thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy<lb/>
with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with<lb/>
policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:<lb/>
therefore tremble and depart.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you<lb/>
should like her? that but seeing you should love<lb/>
her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should<lb/>
grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the<lb/>
poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden<lb/>
wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,<lb/>
I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;<lb/>
consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it<lb/>
shall be to your good; for my father's house and all<lb/>
the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I<lb/>
estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:<lb/>
thither will I invite the duke and all's contented<lb/>
followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look<lb/>
you, here comes my Rosalind.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ROSALIND</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>God save you, brother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OLIVER</speaker>
<p>And you, fair sister.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee<lb/>
wear thy heart in a scarf!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>It is my arm.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws<lb/>
of a lion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to<lb/>
swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Ay, and greater wonders than that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was<lb/>
never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams<lb/>
and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and<lb/>
overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner<lb/>
met but they looked, no sooner looked but they<lb/>
loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner<lb/>
sighed but they asked one another the reason, no<lb/>
sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;<lb/>
and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs<lb/>
to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or<lb/>
else be incontinent before marriage: they are in<lb/>
the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs<lb/>
cannot part them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the<lb/>
duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it<lb/>
is to look into happiness through another man's<lb/>
eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at<lb/>
the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall<lb/>
think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>I can live no longer by thinking.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.<lb/>
Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,<lb/>
that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I<lb/>
speak not this that you should bear a good opinion<lb/>
of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;<lb/>
neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in<lb/>
some little measure draw a belief from you, to do<lb/>
yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if<lb/>
you please, that I can do strange things: I have,<lb/>
since I was three year old, conversed with a<lb/>
magician, most profound in his art and yet not<lb/>
damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart<lb/>
as your gesture cries it out, when your brother<lb/>
marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into<lb/>
what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is<lb/>
not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient<lb/>
to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human<lb/>
as she is and without any danger.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>Speakest thou in sober meanings?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I<lb/>
say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your<lb/>
best array: bid your friends; for if you will be<lb/>
married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE</stage></p>


<p>
Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,<lb/>
To show the letter that I writ to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I care not if I have: it is my study<lb/>
To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:<lb/>
You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;<lb/>
Look upon him, love him; he worships you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILVIUS</speaker>
<p>It is to be all made of sighs and tears;<lb/>

<p>It is to be all made of fantasy,<lb/>
All made of passion and all made of wishes,<lb/>
All adoration, duty, and observance,<lb/>
All humbleness, all patience and impatience,<lb/>
All purity, all trial, all observance;<lb/>
And so am I for Phebe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>And so am I for Ganymede.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>And so am I for Rosalind.<lb/>

<p>And so am I for no woman.<lb/>

<p>If this be so, why blame you me to love you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'<lb/>

<p>To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.<lb/>

of Irish wolves against the moon.<lb/>

married to-morrow:<lb/>

I will content you, if what pleases you contents<lb/>
you, and you shall be married to-morrow.<lb/>

<p>I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two<lb/>
gipsies on a horse.<lb/>

SONG.<lb/>
It was a lover and his lass,<lb/>
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,<lb/>
That o'er the green corn-field did pass<lb/>
In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,<lb/>
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:<lb/>
Sweet lovers love the spring.<lb/>

Between the acres of the rye,<lb/>
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino<lb/>
These pretty country folks would lie,<lb/>
In spring time, &amp;c.<lb/>

This carol they began that hour,<lb/>
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,<lb/>
How that a life was but a flower<lb/>
In spring time, &amp;c.<lb/>

And therefore take the present time,<lb/>
With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;<lb/>
For love is crowned with the prime<lb/>
In spring time, &amp;c.<lb/>

<p>I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:<lb/>
You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,<lb/>
You will bestow her on Orlando here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>My lord, the first time that I ever saw him<lb/>
Methought he was a brother to your daughter:<lb/>
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,<lb/>
And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments<lb/>
Of many desperate studies by his uncle,<lb/>
Whom he reports to be a great magician,<lb/>
Obscured in the circle of this forest.<lb/>

<p>Salutation and greeting to you all!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the<lb/>
motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in<lb/>
the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>If any man doubt that, let him put me to my<lb/>
purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered<lb/>
a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth<lb/>
with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have<lb/>
had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>And how was that ta'en up?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the<lb/>
seventh cause.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>I like him very well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I<lb/>
press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country<lb/>
copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as<lb/>
marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,<lb/>
sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor<lb/>
humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else<lb/>
will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a<lb/>
poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the<lb/>
quarrel on the seventh cause?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>Upon a lie seven times removed:&mdash;bear your body more<lb/>
seeming, Audrey:&mdash;as thus, sir. I did dislike the<lb/>
cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,<lb/>
if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the<lb/>
mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.<lb/>
If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he<lb/>
would send me word, he cut it to please himself:<lb/>
this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was<lb/>
not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is<lb/>
called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not<lb/>
well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this<lb/>
is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not<lb/>
well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the<lb/>
Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie<lb/>
Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,<lb/>
nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we<lb/>
measured swords and parted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TOUCHSTONE</speaker>
<p>O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have<lb/>
books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.<lb/>
The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the<lb/>
Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the<lb/>
fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the<lb/>
Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with<lb/>
Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All<lb/>
these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may<lb/>
avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven<lb/>
justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the<lb/>
parties were met themselves, one of them thought but<lb/>
of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and<lb/>
they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the<lb/>
only peacemaker; much virtue in If.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at<lb/>
any thing and yet a fool.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under<lb/>
the presentation of that he shoots his wit.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA</stage>



</p><p><stage>Still Music</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HYMEN</speaker>
<p>Then is there mirth in heaven,<lb/>
When earthly things made even<lb/>
Atone together.<lb/>
Good duke, receive thy daughter<lb/>
Hymen from heaven brought her,<lb/>
Yea, brought her hither,<lb/>
That thou mightst join her hand with his<lb/>
Whose heart within his bosom is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p><stage>[To DUKE SENIOR]</stage></p><p>  To you I give myself, for I am yours.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To ORLANDO</stage></p>


<p>
To you I give myself, for I am yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ORLANDO</speaker>
<p>If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>If sight and shape be true,<lb/>
Why then, my love adieu!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>I'll have no father, if you be not he:<lb/>
I'll have no husband, if you be not he:<lb/>
Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HYMEN</speaker>
<p>Peace, ho! I bar confusion:<lb/>
'Tis I must make conclusion<lb/>
Of these most strange events:<lb/>
Here's eight that must take hands<lb/>
To join in Hymen's bands,<lb/>
If truth holds true contents.<lb/>
You and you no cross shall part:<lb/>
You and you are heart in heart<lb/>
You to his love must accord,<lb/>
Or have a woman to your lord:<lb/>
You and you are sure together,<lb/>
As the winter to foul weather.<lb/>
Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,<lb/>
Feed yourselves with questioning;<lb/>
That reason wonder may diminish,<lb/>
How thus we met, and these things finish.<lb/>

SONG.<lb/>
Wedding is great Juno's crown:<lb/>
O blessed bond of board and bed!<lb/>
'Tis Hymen peoples every town;<lb/>
High wedlock then be honoured:<lb/>
Honour, high honour and renown,<lb/>
To Hymen, god of every town!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!<lb/>
Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHEBE</speaker>
<p>I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;<lb/>
Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter JAQUES DE BOYS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES DE BOYS</speaker>
<p>Let me have audience for a word or two:<lb/>
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,<lb/>
That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.<lb/>
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day<lb/>
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,<lb/>
Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,<lb/>
In his own conduct, purposely to take<lb/>
His brother here and put him to the sword:<lb/>
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;<lb/>
Where meeting with an old religious man,<lb/>
After some question with him, was converted<lb/>
Both from his enterprise and from the world,<lb/>
His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,<lb/>
And all their lands restored to them again<lb/>
That were with him exiled. This to be true,<lb/>
I do engage my life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Welcome, young man;<lb/>
Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:<lb/>
To one his lands withheld, and to the other<lb/>
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.<lb/>
First, in this forest, let us do those ends<lb/>
That here were well begun and well begot:<lb/>
And after, every of this happy number<lb/>
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us<lb/>
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,<lb/>
According to the measure of their states.<lb/>
Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity<lb/>
And fall into our rustic revelry.<lb/>
Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,<lb/>
With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,<lb/>
The duke hath put on a religious life<lb/>
And thrown into neglect the pompous court?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES DE BOYS</speaker>
<p>He hath.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker>
<p>To him will I : out of these convertites<lb/>
There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To DUKE SENIOR</stage></p>


<p>
You to your former honour I bequeath;<lb/>
Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To ORLANDO</stage></p>


<p>
You to a love that your true faith doth merit:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To OLIVER</stage></p>


<p>
You to your land and love and great allies:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To SILVIUS</stage></p>


<p>
You to a long and well-deserved bed:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To TOUCHSTONE</stage></p>


<p>
And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage<lb/>
Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:<lb/>
I am for other than for dancing measures.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Stay, Jaques, stay.<lb/></p>

</sp><sp><speaker>JAQUES</speaker><p>	To see no pastime I<lb/>
what you would have<lb/>
I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUKE SENIOR</speaker>
<p>Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,<lb/>
As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.<lb/>

<head>EPILOGUE</head>



<sp><speaker>ROSALIND</speaker>
<p>It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;<lb/>
but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord<lb/>
the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs<lb/>
no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no<lb/>
epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,<lb/>
and good plays prove the better by the help of good<lb/>
epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am<lb/>
neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with<lb/>
you in the behalf of a good play! I am not<lb/>
furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not<lb/>
become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin<lb/>
with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love<lb/>
you bear to men, to like as much of this play as<lb/>
please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love<lb/>
you bear to women&mdash;as I perceive by your simpering,<lb/>
none of you hates them&mdash;that between you and the<lb/>
women the play may please. If I were a woman I<lb/>
would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased<lb/>
me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I<lb/>
defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good<lb/>
beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my<lb/>
kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.<lb/>
