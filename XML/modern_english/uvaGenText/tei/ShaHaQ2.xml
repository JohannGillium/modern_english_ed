<sp><speaker>Hora.</speaker>
<l n="89">That can I. </l>
<l n="90">At least the whisper goes so; our last King, </l>

<l n="92">Was as you knowe by <hi rend="italic">Fortinbrasse</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Norway</hi>, </l>
<l n="93">Thereto prickt on by a most emulate pride </l>
<l n="94">Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant <hi rend="italic">Hamlet</hi>, </l>
<l n="95">(For so this side of our knowne world esteemd him) </l>
<l n="96">Did slay this <hi rend="italic">Fortinbrasse</hi>, who by a seald compact </l>
<l n="97">Well ratified by lawe and heraldy </l>
<pb n="B2v" id="ShaHaQ2B2v"/>
<l n="98">Did forfait (with his life) all these his lands </l>
<l n="99">Which he stood seaz'd of, to the conquerour. </l>

<l n="101">Was gaged by our King, which had returne  </l>
<l n="102">To the inheritance of <hi rend="italic">Fortinbrasse</hi>, </l>
<l n="103">Had he bin vanquisher; as by the same comart, </l>
<l n="104">And carriage of the article desseigne, </l>
<l n="105">His fell to Hamlet; now Sir, young <hi rend="italic">Fortinbrasse</hi>  </l>

<l n="108">Sharkt vp a list of lawelesse resolutes </l>

<l n="110">That hath a stomacke in't, which is no other </l>
<l n="111">As it doth well appeare vnto our state </l>
<l n="112">But to recouer of vs by strong hand </l>
<l n="113">And tearmes compulsatory, those foresaid lands </l>
<l n="114">So by his father lost; and this I take it, </l>
<l n="115">Is the maine motiue of our preparations </l>
<l n="116">The source of this our watch, and the chiefe head </l>
<l n="117">Of this post hast and Romeage in the land. </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<l n="118">I thinke it be no other, but enso; </l>
<l n="119">Well may it sort that this portentous figure </l>

<l n="122">A moth it is to trouble the mindes eye: </l>

<l n="125">The graues stood tenantlesse, and the sheeted dead </l>
<l n="126">Did squeake and gibber in the Roman streets </l>
<l n="127">As starres with traines of fier, and dewes of blood </l>
<l n="128">Disasters in the sunne; and the moist starre, </l>
<l n="129">Vpon whose influence <hi rend="italic">Neptunes</hi> Empier stands, </l>

<l n="154">We doe it wrong being so Maiesticall  </l>
<l n="155">To offer it the showe of violence, </l>

<sp><speaker>Bar.</speaker>
<l n="158">It was about to speake when the cocke crewe. </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<l n="159">And then it started like a guilty thing, </l>
<l n="160">Vpon a fearefull summons; I haue heard, </l>

<l n="162">Doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat </l>
<l n="163">Awake the God of day, and at his warning </l>
