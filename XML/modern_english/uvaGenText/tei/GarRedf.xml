	<head>THE RED FLOWER OF THE MADMAN.<lb/></head>
	
	<byline>BY M. GARSHINE.</byline>
<p><hi rend="small-caps">"IN</hi> the name of his majesty, the Czar, Peter the First, I order
an immediate inspection of this asylum for the insane!"
</p><p>These words were uttered in a shrill, sharp voice.  The
secretary of the establishment seated before a table stained with
blotches of ink, and about to inscribe in an enormous register the
name, age, etc., of the new patient, could not restrain a smile.  As to
the two young men that accompanied the madman, they did not feel
 much like laughing; they were hardly in a condition to keep on their
legs, owing to the two nights they had passed on the railroad with
the patient.  At the station before the last, he had had a furious
attack, and they had been obliged to procure in all haste a straight
waistcoat in the city, and to force him into it with the assistance of
the gendarmes and several employ&eacute;s of the road.  In this
manner they had brought him to the asylum.
</p><p>His appearance was repulsive.  A blouse of coarse cloth,
widely open at the breast, covered his gray suit, which he had torn
into shreds during his late outburst of frenzy.  The long sleeves
drew his arms across in front and were tied behind his back in a
large knot.  His red, inflamed eyes (he had not slept for ten days)
glared with a fixed and haggard look; his lower lip writhed, jerked
by a nervous spasm, and his curling hair hung in disorder over his
forehead.  He strode up and down the office with rapid steps,
making the pavement resound loudly under his boots, casting
defiant looks around him&mdash;on the boxes stuffed with dusty papers,
on the furniture covered with waxed cloth, and on his companions.
</p><p>"Lead him into the apartment to the right!"
</p><p>"I know, I know!  I was here before, last year.  We passed in
review the entire establishment.  I know all; it will be difficult to
conceal anything from me, no matter what," said the patient.
</p><p>He turned towards the door.  The guardian opened it for him.
With the same automatic step, firm and resounding, and holding
high his uneasy head, he left the office and walked rapidly to the
right where the cells reserved for the insane were placed.  His
companions found it hard to keep up with him.
</p><p>"Ring the bell!"
</p><p>"I can't.  You have tied my hands."
</p><p>The attendant opened the door.  They entered the mad-house.
</p><p>It was an old building in massive stone and antiquated style.
There were two immense halls.  The dining room and a room
common to the quiet patients, a wide vestibule with a glass door,
leading into a flower garden; then about twenty separate cells,
where ordinary patients were kept, formed the ground floor.
Besides these, there were two other gloomy apartments, the one
padded and lined with thick cushions, and the other, wainscoted
over the entire wall where the patients were carried during their mad
fits, and finally a vast room built with a cupola, and the bath-room,
with several huge bathing tanks.  The upper story <pb n="4"/> was for
women.  A fearful noise of howls and cries could be heard.
</p><p>The house had been arranged for eighty patients, but as the
surrounding districts had no institution of this kind, there were at
present three hundred packed within its walls.  In each of the narrow
cells were four or five beds.  In winter when the patients could not
go into the garden, and when the barred windows were hermetically
closed, the air in the asylum was pestiferous and insufferably heavy.
</p><p>The new patient was introduced into the bath-room.  This
apartment could not fail to make a painful impression on a man of
sound mind; how much more painfully must it impress a diseased
and irritable imagination.  It was large and paved, with the ceiling in
the form of a cupola, and lighted only on one side by a small
window.  The walls and arches were painted dark red.
</p><p>In the dirty gray soil two enormous basins were hollowed out.
They looked like two graves of an oval form.  A big copper furnace
with cylindrical reservoir and a complete system of pipes for
douching, occupied a space opposite the window.  Every thing in
this room had a strange, lugubrious aspect, as though contrived to
produce a vivid impression on a sick brain.  The attendant at the
baths, a coarse and powerful Sokal, who never spoke a word, added
not a little with his sinister face to the horror of the apartment.
</p><p>When they had led the madman into his chamber to bathe him,
and (following the sanitary method of the head physician) to apply a
huge blister plaster to the back of his neck, the patient was seized
with horror and fell into a terrible rage.  Mad fancies, each one more
horrible than the other, hurtled and clashed in his brain.  His hair
stood erect; he was bathed in cold sweat.
</p><p>What was this?  A chamber of torture?  A place of execution
where his enemies wished to get rid of him?  Perhaps even&mdash;hell!
And if it was hell!  Then the idea shot through his brain that he was
going to be questioned as in the Middle Ages.
</p><p>They undressed him in spite of his desperate resistance.  With
a strength rendered triply great by his malady, he tore himself loose
from the attendants and overturned them.  At last he was thrown to
the ground by four strong men, seized hand and foot, and lowered
into the basin filled with hot water.
</p><p>The water seemed to him boiling, and his poor sick brain
engendered the insane thought that he was being subjected to the
torture of fire and water.  The warm water entered his mouth.  He
stiffened himself and dealt blows and kicks about him, although
held by the attendants.  And in the midst of howlings interrupted by
endless lamentation, prayers burst from his lips at one moment, and
at the other, blasphemies.  He shouted until he could speak no more,
and ended by moaning pitifully with great burning tears rolling
down his cheeks.
</p><p>"Great and holy St. Gregory, into thy hands I commit my body.
As to my spirit&mdash;no&mdash;oh, no!"
</p><p>The keepers did not let go of him, although, thanks to the
warm bath and the bladder full of ice that they had placed on his
head, he had become a little calmer.  However, when they had taken
him out of the bath, and seated him on a stool in order to apply the
big blister to the back of his neck, a remnant of his vigor re-appeared and the mad fancies took possession of him with renewed
force.
</p><p>"Why?  Why?" he howled.  "I don't want to do harm to any
one.  Why do you torture me?  Oh! oh! oh! God!  You martyrs that
have gone before me, deliver me!"
</p><p>The burning of the plaster carried his madness to its climax.
He beat the air anew with his feet and hands.  The attendants could
not master him.  They stood there disheartened.
</p><p>"There is nothing to do," said the attendant that directed the
operation.  "All must be destroyed."
</p><p>The patient started at these words.  He was frightened.  A
trembling seized him.
</p><p>"Destroyed?  Destroy what?  Me," he thought.
</p><p>Frightened to death, horrified, he closed his eyes.  The
attendant took a coarse napkin at both ends and rubbed him with it
rapidly, pressing hard on the back of his neck, and tearing the
plaster off with the skin.  It stuck to it so well that a large and
bleeding wound was formed.
</p><p>The pain that the patient suffered, and that would have
exasperated a healthy man, <pb n="5"/> seemed to the miserable madman
unspeakable.  With a desperate wrench of his back he escaped from
the hands of the nurses, and threw himself on the stone pavement.
Then he imagined they had beheaded him.  He wished to cry and
groan, but he could not.  The keepers laid him on a litter and bore
him away.  He fell into a deep sleep, a sleep so long and heavy that
it was like death.</p>

</div1>

<div1 type="chapter" n="2" id="d4">
<head>II.</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">WHEN</hi> he awoke it was night.  All was quiet.  In the
neighboring chamber the deep respiration of the slumbering patients
could be heard, and farther away, a madman that had been locked
up in a dark cell talked loudly with himself in a monotonous tone,
his voice pitched to a strange key.  In the upper story where the
female department was, a contralto voice was singing an obscene
song.  He held his breath and listened.  He felt weary; it seemed to
him all his limbs were broken, and he had such an agonizing pain at
the back of his neck.
</p><p>"Where am I?  What has happened to me?" he thought.
</p><p>Suddenly his mind became clear.  He recalled distinctly every
thing that had happened to him during the last year of his life.  All,
even to the minutest detail, came back to him.  He knew that he was
ill at that very moment, and he understood the nature of his disease.
A procession of fantastic ideas, of insane words and actions defiled
through his mind.  He recalled every thing, and a horrible chill
shook him from head to foot.
</p><p>"Well, it is finished at last," he murmured.  "God be praised!"
</p><p>And he fell asleep again.
</p><p>The open window, guarded with iron bars, opened into a
narrow and tortuous way that extended between the great buildings
and a stone wall.  This path was unused.  It was invaded by a
wilderness of wild bushes, among which an enormous thicket of
lilacs stood in bloom at this moment.  Behind the bushes, just in
front of the window, rose a high, dark wall, over which the trees of
the garden stretched their branches, lit up by the pale moonbeams.
</p><p>To the right, a wing of the asylum could be seen, quite white in
the shade, with its grated windows behind which shone a light.  To
the left could be perceived the dim walls of the dead house silvered
with soft radiance.  The moonbeams passing through the bars of the
window shone dazzlingly upon the large stone flags of the floor,
and bathed in a sparkling haze a part of the bed and the livid face
and closed eyelids of the patient.
</p><p>At this hour nothing in his appearance betrayed the madman.
He was sleeping the profound and tranquil sleep of a martyr,
without a dream, without the least movement, almost without
breath.
</p><p>He woke at moments with a perfectly sane and lucid mind.
Then in the morning, when he re-opened his eyes, he was mad.</p>
</div1>

<div1 type="chapter" n="3" id="d5">
<head>III.</head>

<p>"How do you feel?" the doctor asked him the next day.
</p><p>The sick man had just awakened.  He was still resting under
the bed cover.
</p><p>"Very well," he answered, rising.
</p><p>He slipped his feet into his slippers, and took his dressing
gown.
</p><p>"Perfectly well.  Only one thing&mdash;here."
</p><p>He touched the back of his neck.
</p><p>"I can't move my neck without pain.  But that is a trifle.  Every
thing is all right when one understands, and I understand."
</p><p>"Do you know where you are?"
</p><p>"I'm in a mad-house.  But when you can reason about such
things, you feel perfectly indifferent, perfectly indifferent!"
</p><p>The doctor gave his eyes close attention.  His handsome rosy
face fringed with a carefully-kept beard, and its two gentle, blue
eyes shining behind gold-rimmed spectacles, was absolutely calm.
He examined his patient.
</p><p>"Why do you look at me like that?  You cannot read my soul,"
continued the sick man, "while I can read yours clearly.  Why do
you do evil?  Why have you imprisoned these unfortunate creatures
here, and refuse to give them their liberty!  To what purpose are all
these torments?  A man possessed by a grand idea, an idea inspired
by genius&mdash;ah, well! such a man is entirely indifferent to the
surroundings in which he lives, and to what he experiences&mdash;even to
the sensation of being and of not being.  Is it not so?"
</p><p>"It is possible," answered the physician, establishing himself
on a chair in a corner in order better to observe the sick man, who
was walking up and down the cell so fast <pb n="6"/> that his calfskin
slippers, a size or two too large, flapped with a clatter on the
pavement, and the skirts of his dressing gown with its red stripes
and clusters of big flowers blew to right and left.  The surgeon and
the nurse, who accompanied the doctor, remained at the door
immovable and as straight as ram-rods.
</p><p>"My soul, my soul, has been possessed by an inspired idea
too!" cried the patient.  "And from the moment that I became aware
of it, I have felt like one born anew.  The sensitiveness of my nerves
has become so acute, my brain works more than ever.  Formerly I
used to arrive at a knowledge of things by syllogisms and
hypotheses; now, it is simply by intuition.  And really, I have
attained to that at which philosophy aims, that which it has striven
after so long.  I have come to comprehend this grand thought&mdash;that
space and time are merely figments.  I live in eternity.  I live
without space&mdash;everywhere and nowhere, which ever you please.
Therefore it is indifferent to me whether you detain me here, or give
me my liberty, whether I am free or imprisoned.  But I am not alone
in this house.  Many people share my lot.  For them, such a state of
things is horrible.  Why do you not give them their liberty?  What
good does this do any one?"
</p><p>"You said," interrupted the physician, "that you lived outside
of time and space.  You will agree, however, that at the moment we
are in this room, that it is&mdash;" here the doctor drew his watch&mdash;"that it
is half-past ten and the 6th of May, 18&mdash;.  What do you say to that?"
</p><p>"Nothing.  When or where I live is indifferent to me.  That is
to say, I am eternal and everywhere."
</p><p>The doctor smiled.
</p><p>"Droll logic," said he, rising.  "Still, you are right.  Good-bye.
Would you like a cigar!"
</p><p>"With pleasure, thanks."
</p><p>He stopped, took the cigar, and bit off the end of it nervously.
</p><p>"That requires reflection and much reflection," he said.  This is
the world, the microcosm.  One extremity encloses the bases, and
the other the acids.  This is also the pivotal point of the universe
where the most opposite principles neutralize each other.  Good-bye, doctor."
</p><p>The physician withdrew.  The patients stood at the end of their
beds and waited for him.  No superior enjoys so high an esteem and
respect as the psychologist in the presence of his patients.
</p><p>As to our patient, he continued walking up and down his
chamber.  They brought him tea.  He swallowed standing, at two
draughts, the contents of a big cup, and a large piece of white bread
in a few mouthfuls.  Thereupon he left the cell, and for several
hours without an instant's pause kept running through the entire
house.
</p><p>The day was rainy.  The patients did not go into the garden.
When the surgeon sought his patient he was pointed out to him at
the end of the corridor.  He was standing before the door leading to
the garden, his face pressed against the glass, and he was looking
fixedly at a patch of green.  His attention was wholly concentrated
on a flower of a strange burning red color, a kind of wild poppy.
</p><p>"You are going to be weighed," said the surgeon.
</p><p>The madman turned round.  His questioner started violently,
and recoiled with fear, so terrible were the madman's eyes with
hatred, so sparkling with savage rage.  But when he noticed the
surgeon, his expression changed suddenly.  He followed him quite
docilely, without a word of revolt, and as though absorbed in a
reverie.
</p><p>They entered the doctor's cabinet, where the patient placed
himself upon the platform.  He was weighed, and the surgeon
inscribed in the register, "one hundred and nine pounds."  The next
day his weight was one hundred and seven, the day after, one
hundred and six.
</p><p>"If this continues, he won't last long," said the doctor.
</p><p>He prescribed for him the strongest kind of nourishment.  But
in spite of that, and although the sick man had an excellent appetite,
he grew thinner every day.  He did not sleep any more, and was
morning and evening in a state of feverish delirium.</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="d6">
<head>IV.</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">HE</hi> knew that he was in an insane asylum.  He knew that he
was mad.  Sometimes, after a feverish day, he would wake during
the night with weary limbs and a horrible headache, but entirely
rational.  Perhaps it <pb n="7"/> was the lack of impressions during the
darkness and nocturnal silence; perhaps it was the too great
feebleness of his brain, the absence of the restless creatures by
whom he was surrounded, that occasioned such moments during
which he comprehended his condition and became lucid.
</p><p>But the morning would come, and from the dawn when the
house was again in commotion, the strange and weird sensations
crowded upon him.  His diseased brain did not have the power to
master them, and madness resumed its sway.  His case presented a
curious mixture of rational and insane ideas.  He knew that he was
in the midst of madmen.  All the time while knowing it, he saw in
each one of them a being&mdash;some one who was in hiding or who had
been kidnapped, some one whom he had known formerly, whose
name he had read, or heard spoken.  The establishment seemed to
him filled with people of all times and all countries.  There were
there, the living and the dead.  There, were to be met with illustrious
personages, celebrities, soldiers fallen in the last war, people that
had been hanged and resuscitated.  He believed himself in an
enchanted circle, a mysterious place, that contained in itself alone
the power of the entire universe; and he himself (very proud of it)
imagined that he was the center of this circle.
</p><p>All his companions in misfortune had combined for the
accomplishment of a great work, of a thing that he considered an
important and inspired undertaking&mdash;the annihilation forever of evil
on the earth.  He did not know in what this undertaking consisted,
but he felt in himself a tremendous force to accomplish it.  He could
read the thoughts of others.  When he looked at objects he knew
their history.  The great elms in the garden related to him the events
of former times.  He took the hospital, which, it is true, dated many
years back, for a construction of Peter the Great, and he was sure
the Czar had inhabited it at the time of the battle of Pultawa.  He
read all this on the wall, on the stucco falling in dust, on the
fragments of brick, on the stones in the garden.  The history of the
establishment was engraven from one end to the other on these
scattered objects.
</p><p>He peopled the little house that served as a morgue with
hundreds of dead men, dead for many years, and scrutinized the
narrow skylight of the vault in a corner of the garden with
unwearied attention.  He saw in the vague light projected through
the dust-stained windows, well-known faces of men he had seen or
the pictures of whom he had contemplated.
</p><p>However, fine weather with its genial warmth returned.  The
patients passed the whole day in the open air.  The little
umbrageous place that was their favorite haunt was literally covered
with flowers.  All that were able worked under the surveillance of a
guardian.  They weeded the walks from morning till evening, and
carpeted them with fine sand, spaded the beds, and watered the
plants, cucumbers, and melons that they had sown themselves.
</p><p>One corner of the garden was all in leaf with cherry trees.
Here began an avenue lined with elms.  The middle forming an
artificial mound, was adorned with an immense bed of beautiful
flowers of brilliant and varied colors, over which towered a cluster
of rare tulips, a gorgeous flower of a golden yellow color flecked
with red flame.
</p><p>The tulips formed the center of the garden, and many of the
patients attributed to them a peculiar and mysterious significance.
</p><p>The walks were lined with pretty shrubs and plants.  There all
the flowers that are to be found in Little Russia teemed: tall and
brilliant geraniums, bright petunias with delicate petals, big tobacco
plants with pale leaves, and little pink flowers, curled mint,
amaranths, cresses, and poppies.  Not far from the stairway three
wild poppy plants of a curious species, grew.  Their flowers were
very small, and were distinguished by their fire-red color and
extremely vivid lustre.  They looked like tufts of glowing embers.
These were the flowers that our patient observed from the first day
of his arrival at the asylum when he looked into the garden through
the glass door.
</p><p>When he entered the garden for the first time, he contemplated
for a long time before descending the stairs, the wild poppies with
their dazzling red petals.  There were only two flowers, separated by
a considerable space.  The place not having yet been weeded, had
been invaded by a thick covering of wild grass and by a swarm of
white fringed daisies.
</p><p>The patients passed through the door, one <pb n="8"/> by one, near
which one of the keepers stood, who handed to each of them a knit
cotton cap, white and pointed at the top, with a red cross in front.
The madman immediately attributed a peculiar and mystic
significance to the red cross.  He took it off, looked at the cross that
adorned it.  Then he gazed at the poppy; its flowers were of a much
more vivid scarlet.
</p><p>"That is what bears it," he murmured, "only for us two."
</p><p>And he descended the stairs.  He walked through the grounds
without having been noticed by the keeper standing behind him, and
stretched his hand towards the flower.  Yet, he couldn't make up his
mind to pluck it.
</p><p>All at once he felt in his extended hand, painful, burning
prickings that spread from his arms through his entire body.  A
magnetic fluid of unheard-of power emanated from that red flower
and invaded his whole organism.  He stooped lower; his fingers
almost touched the flower.  But it defended itself, it resisted,
vomiting, as it seemed to him, blasts of fetid odor charged with
poison.  He turned his head aside, and made a last effort to seize it.
Already he held the stem pressed between his fingers, when a heavy
hand came down upon his shoulder.  It was the hand of the keeper.
</p><p>"Mustn't pluck it!" said the old Sokal, "and you mustn't walk in
the flower beds.  For if there were many of you madmen who had
that fancy, it wouldn't be long before every flower in the garden
would be gone."
</p><p>He added the last sentence in a persuasive voice, without
taking his hand from the patient's shoulder.
</p><p>The sick man looked in his face, freed himself from his hold
without a word, and began to walk up and down the garden in great
agitation.
</p><p>"O you unfortunates!" he thought.  "You see nothing.  You are
so blind that you defend it.  But, at all costs, I shall reach it!  If it is
not to-day, it will be to-morrow.  We shall measure our strength
with one another.  And even if I must die for it&mdash;well! what matter?"
</p><p>He walked in the garden until evening, making many
acquaintances and pronouncing strange discourses, which were
taken by those with whom he spoke as answers to their own
lucubrations&mdash;these lucubrations in turn being considered by our
madman as mysterious revelations of the highest importance.  The
sick man walked now with one, now with another of his
companions in misfortune, and when evening came he had reached
the perfect conviction that "all was ready," as he repeated to himself
in a low voice.  Soon, yes, soon the iron bars would fall in
fragments, the prisoners would quit the place to spread themselves
over all the countries of the world.  The earth would tremble, would
be despoiled of her ancient garment to be re-clothed resplendently
in new and youthful beauty.
</p><p>He had hardly thought any more of the flower; but when he
was preparing to mount the stairs, he perceived on the sward, heavy
with large pearls of dew, two burning embers of a vivid red.  Then
he remained in the rear, letting all the other patients pass before
him, hiding behind the keeper and watching a favorite opportunity.
No one saw him cross the flower bed, pluck the flower, and hide it
in his bosom under his shirt.  When its moist and cool petals
touched his skin a mortal pallor covered his face and he opened his
eyes, all big with horror, while an icy perspiration pearled his
forehead.
</p><p>They were lighting the lamps in the asylum.  The patients for
the most part, stretched themselves on their beds waiting for supper,
while a few uneasy madmen walked feverishly through the
corridors and halls.  Our patient with his flower was among the last.
He crossed his two hands convulsively on his breast.  He seemed to
wish to smother that flower and to crush it.  When he met one of his
comrades he sprang from him with a bound, fearing to touch him
with his garments.
</p><p>"Don't come near me!  Don't come near me!" he cried.
</p><p>But it was in an insane asylum where words like these are
considered of no importance.  He walked more and more rapidly
with automatic steps.  He walked one hour, two hours, lost in a
somber fury.
</p><p>"I shall destroy you!  I shall smother you!" said he in a hoarse
voice and with mad gesticulations.
</p><p>From time to time he ground his teeth terribly.
</p><p>Supper had been served in the dining hall.  On the great bare
tables were arranged big bowls of yellow wood with red figures
traced <pb n="9"/> on them, filled with thin vegetable soup.  The patients
took their places on the benches and received each a round loaf of
coarse bread.  About eight ate from the same bowl, from which they
helped themselves with wooden spoons.  Those for whom more
nourishing food had been ordered, ate apart.  Our madman, who had
swallowed quickly the portion brought to him in his cell by the
keeper, had descended, still ravenous, into the common hall.  He
tramped about, here and there, apparently much discontented.
</p><p>"Will you permit me to take a seat here?" he asked the
inspector.
</p><p>"Haven't you had your supper yet?" this official asked, busily
engaged filling fresh bowls with lentils.
</p><p>"The fact is, I am literally dying of hunger.  I need a great deal
of nourishment.  That is the only thing that sustains me.  You know
I cannot sleep, even for a minute."
</p><p>"Eat, my friend, and much good may it do you.  Taras, bring
him a bowl and some bread."
</p><p>He seated himself near one of the dishes and swallowed a great
quantity of soup.
</p><p>"Enough, now, enough," said the inspector at last, when all the
patients had quitted the table, and our madman remained alone, still
helping himself eagerly out of the bowl, holding the spoon with one
hand and the other pressed convulsively against his breast.  "You
are going to make yourself sick."
</p><p>"Ah, if you knew how much strength I need, and what
strength?  Good-bye, Nicolas Nicola&iuml;ewitch," said the
unfortunate, rising from his seat and pressing the hand of the
inspector.  "Good-bye!"
</p><p>"Where are you going, pray?" asked the inspector, smiling.
</p><p>"I?  Nowhere.  I shall stay here.  It is possible, however, that
we may not see each other to-morrow.  I thank you for the great
kindness you have shown me."
</p><p>He pressed the hand of the inspector a second time forcibly.
His voice trembled and big tears stood in his eyes.
</p><p>"Calm yourself, my dear friend.  Do not disquiet yourself,"
replied the inspector.  "What good do all these sad repinings do?
Go to bed and have a good sleep.  You ought to sleep more.  If you
sleep you will soon be cured."
</p><p>The poor wretch began to sob.  The inspector turned round and
ordered the table to be cleared.  A half hour later all were asleep in
the house except one, who lay stretched on his bed with his clothes
on.  He trembled as though in the grip of a fierce fever, with his
hand pressed strongly to his breast, where he seemed to feel the
embrace of poisoned flames running in fiery undulations.</p>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">ALL</hi> that night he did not close an eye.
</p><p>He had plucked the flower, believing to have performed
thereby a heroic action, which was imposed upon him, and which
he wanted to accomplish regardless of consequences.  At the first
glance he had cast through the glass door, his attention had fixed
itself on this red flower, and from that moment he had
comprehended what was his mission.
</p><p>In this red flower with incandescent petals were concentrated
the evil, the sins of the whole world.  He knew that poppies are used
in the making of opium.  Perhaps it was this thought, distorted by a
morbid imagination, that took on monstrous forms and developed in
him fantastic ideas of an exquisitely acute morbidness.
</p><p>In his eyes, this flower was the incarnation of evil on the earth.
It was steeped in blood, in all the blood shed wrongfully in the
world!  Gorged with the blood, the gall and the tears of humanity, it
stood triumphant.  This flower was a terrible and mysterious being,
the adversary of God, Arimanes, who had clothed himself in a form
of innocent and modest seeming.  The flower had to be plucked and
bruised to powder.
</p><p>But that was not all.  It was necessary when it died to prevent
it from exhaling among men its last poisonous breath.  Therefore he
had buried it in his bosom.  He hoped, if he kept it there until
morning, it would have lost its destructive power.  Evil sin would
enter his bosom and would filter into his soul, and in this manner
would be vanquished.  As for himself, he would be lost, but would
die in a heroic struggle.  He would be humanity's noblest martyr,
because until now there had been no one found to dare the combat,
body to body, with the personification of evil, that bad genius
whose power was so great.
</p><p>"They did not notice.  I have seen that. <pb n="10"/> Ought I to let it
live?  No.  It must be destroyed, annihilated forever."
</p><p>He writhed, extended on his couch, bathed with sweat, his hair
erect with fright, his strength growing less little by little.  In the
morning the surgeon found him nearly dead.  In spite of his
weakness the patient arose, sprang down from his bed, and ran
through the whole house in great agitation, holding with his
companions conversations more incoherent than ever.  He spoke
with himself also, in a vibrating voice, gesticulating wildly.  He was
not permitted to go into the garden, and the surgeon on weighing
him found his weight diminished by several pounds.  He ordered
strong injections of morphine to be administered.  The madman
made no opposition.  At this moment he had happily a short interval
of lucidity, which was favorable to the operation.  He soon dropped
asleep; his nervous gesticulation ceased, and the perpetual buzzing
in his ears, which had occasioned his jerking and noisy step, and
which he tried to escape in his feverish journeyings to and fro,
completely disappeared.  He became oblivious of all things, and
dreamed of nothing, not even of the second flower, the task of
plucking which he had imposed upon himself.
</p><p>At the end of three days, however, he succeeded in tearing it
from its stem, and that under the very eyes of the keeper, who did
not have time to prevent him.  The keeper pursued him into the
corridor.  The madman ran to his chamber, uttering a loud cry of
victory.
</p><p>He had hidden the flower in his bosom, and pressed it
passionately against his heart.
</p><p>"Who permitted you to pluck flowers?" cried the keeper, when
he caught up with him.
</p><p>But the sick man, stretched on his bed with arms folded,
answered with a flood of words so incoherent that he contented
himself with removing from the patient's head the cap with the red
cross, which he had forgotten to take off in his flight.  Then an
attack of furious madness broke out.  The patient felt the flower
disgorging torrents of poison, which became solidified and took the
form of venomous serpents.  These serpents entwined him, covered
him with sharp bites, imprisoned his limbs in their steely coils,
spewed over his whole body a burning and foul saliva, whose
corrosive action wounded him cruelly.  He wept in a loud voice.  He
called upon God to help him, and cursed his enemies.
</p><p>Towards evening the flower was withered.  The madman
crushed the blackened plant under his heel, stamped on it, and
collecting its smallest particles, carried them to the bath-room.
Here he threw them in the glowing furnace on the embers.  And
looking at his enemy writhing and hissing in the flames, he saw it
curl up and transform itself into a tiny flake of snowy whiteness.
He blew upon it, and every trace of it disappeared.  Then he drew a
long breath.
</p><p>The following day his condition had become much worse.
Pale as a sheet, with cheeks fallen in, his eyes fixed and burning in
their inflamed orbits, he dragged himself from morning till evening
through all the rooms, without rest, staggering and faltering at each
step, a mad race accompanied by feverish discourse and haggard
gesticulation.
</p><p>"I am afraid to use violence with him," said the head physician
to his assistants.
</p><p>"However, it is in the highest degree necessary.  He weighed
only ninety-three pounds to-day.  If this continues he will be dead
before forty-eight hours."
</p><p>The head physician reflected a moment: "Morphine?
Chloral?" he murmured undecided.
</p><p>"Yesterday the morphine injections produced no effect."
</p><p>"Well, have him bound, though, I doubt if we shall be able to
save him."
</p><p>And the sick man was bound.  He was put in a straight
waistcoat and laid on his bed, to which he was tied by means of
broad canvas bands.  But the furious madness persisted.  It
increased in violence.  He was dreadful to look at, his face a livid
blue, and jaws firmly knit together.  During several hours he
continued the most unheard-of exertions to break his bonds.
</p><p>Finally, stiffening himself in a supreme convulsive effort he
succeeded in rending some strips of canvas and freeing his feet.
Then he slipped from under the other strips that were crossed over
the bed, and went up and down his cell with tied hands, walking
with long steps, and declaiming an incoherent discourse interrupted
with savage growls.
</p><p>"What the devil!" cried the keeper on <pb n="11"/> opening the
door.  "What demon has come to your assistance?  Grizko!  Ivan!
Come quick, the patient has broken loose."
</p><p>The three threw themselves upon him, and a terrible struggle
took place, a struggle that exhausted the keepers and robbed the
patient of his last remaining strength.  Finally, they got him on the
bed, and tied him more securely than before, doubling the number
of canvas bands that held him.
</p><p>"You do not know what you are doing," cried the patient in a
strangled voice.  "You are consummating your own perdition!  I
have seen a third one of them.  It is just half open.  It will soon be in
full blossom!  Let me finish my work!  I must kill it!  Kill it!  Kill it!
Then all will be finished, all will be saved.  I would send you for it,
but I alone am to accomplish the task.  If one of you were so rash as
to touch it you would fall blasted by lightning!"
</p><p>"Silence," said the keeper.
</p><p>The assistants withdrew.  He remained near to watch him.  The
sick man became suddenly silent.  He had decided to make use of a
ruse.  He remained tied the whole day, and when night came he was
kept in the same condition.  The nurse gave him his supper himself;
then he prepared a bed on the floor near the patient, and lay down.
In a few moments he fell asleep.
</p><p>Then the madman set to work silently.  He twisted and
stiffened his body, forcing it to bring his hand enveloped in the long
sleeve of the straight waistcoat in contact with a rough iron bar that
extended along the middle of the bed.  He succeeded in rubbing
forcibly and rapidly this sleeve against the rugosities of the iron.
After some time the coarse canvas cloth yielded, and he was
enabled to pass out his index finger.  From that time the work went
on more rapidly.  With wonderful cunning and dexterity he untied
the knot that held the sleeves together.  Then he held his breath for
an instant, and listened to the snoring of the nurse.  The old man
was sleeping profoundly.  The patient took off the straight waistcoat
and unknotted the straps that bound him to his bed.  He was free.
He tried to open the door, but he found it locked inside.  The key
was probably in the keeper's pocket.  The madman was afraid to
awaken him if he touched him.  He decided to go out by the
window.
</p><p>The night was still and dark.  The air was warm and balmy.
When he opened the window, myriads of stars were shining.  He
raised his eyes to heaven and looked at the glittering constellations,
and rejoiced that they seemed to comprehend him and approve of
him with their soft lustre.  He beheld with blinking eyes the rays
they sent down to him, and felt strong in his determination.
</p><p>Now what he had to do was to separate the iron bars of the
grating by bending them, to slip through the narrow opening to the
lane beneath, and to climb the high wall in front of the window.
There a final struggle awaited him, and then&mdash;and then&mdash;  Or,
perhaps it would be his to encounter death!
</p><p>He tried to bend the thick bars with his two hands, but the iron
did not yield.  He then twisted the coarse sleeves of the straight
waistcoat into a kind of a rope, attached it to a bar and suspended
himself by it heavily, with all his force.  After several fruitless
efforts in which he employed a strength much more than that of
ordinary men, he succeeded in bending one of the branches of the
grating.  Then he slipped softly through the narrow aperture, first his
shoulders, his elbows, and his knees, and crept along the lane and
through the bushes as far as the wall.  Here he stopped.  All was
quiet.  The light of the night lamps illuminated the windows from
the interior of the asylum.  He saw no one.  No one noticed him.
Without doubt the old keeper was still sleeping profoundly at the
foot of his bed.  The stars were shining brightly; their pale beams
inundated his heart with a sweet joy.
</p><p>"I come," he murmured, looking up at the sky.
</p><p>His first attempt at climbing the wall failed; he fell to the
ground.  With torn nails and hands and knees bleeding, he sought a
more favorable place.  There where the wall ran along the morgue
several bricks had fallen and the mortar was gone.  The madman
profited by these breaks in the smooth surface.  He clung to them,
scrambling up the wall, and succeeded in seizing hold of the bough
of an elm tree planted in the garden.  He lifted himself into the air
by this, and let himself glide softly to the ground.
</p><p>He ran towards the stone stairway.  The flower, of a somber
color in the night, held <pb n="12"/> erect its half-open calyx in the midst
of the fresh, dew-covered sward.
</p><p>"The last!" he murmured.  "The last!  It is now victory or
death!  But that is indifferent to me.  Wait," said he, with eyes
raised ecstatically to the sky, "I shall soon be with you."
</p><p>He grasped the flower, bruised it, and crushed it slowly
between his fingers.  Then he regained his cell by the same way he
had left it.  He dragged himself painfully to his bed, and fell upon it
in a faint.
</p><p>They found him dead the next morning.  The expression of his
face was calm and serene.  His emaciated features, his thin lips and
closed and deeply sunken eyelids were transfigured and as though
illuminated with a joyous and triumphant radiance.  When they laid
him on the bier one of the keepers wanted to take the red flower
from his hand.  The hand was closed in a vise-like grip.  The
madman carried his trophy with him to the grave.</p>
