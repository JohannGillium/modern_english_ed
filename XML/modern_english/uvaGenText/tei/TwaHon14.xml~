Scenes in Honolulu &mdash; No. 14<lb/> 
HONOLULU, JUNE 30, 1866. </head> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="1" id="d4"> 
<head>A MONTH OF MOURNING</head> 
<p>For a little more than a month, the late Princess&mdash;Her Royal Highness Victoria  
Kamamalu Kaahumanu, heir presumptive to the crown and sister to the King&mdash;lay in state 
at Iolani Palace, the royal residence. For a little over a month, troops of natives of both  
sexes, drawn here from the several islands by the great event, have thronged past my door  
every evening on their way to the palace. Every night, and all night long, for more than  
thirty days, multitudes of these strange mourners have burned their candlenut torches in  
the royal inclosure, and sung their funeral dirges, and danced their hula-hulas, and wailed 
their harrowing wail for the dead. All this time we strangers have been consumed with  
curiosity to look within those walls and see the pagan deviltry that was going on there.  
But the thing was tabu (forbidden&mdash;we get our word "taboo" from the Hawaiian language)  
to foreigners&mdash;haoles. The grounds were thrown open to everybody the first night, but  
several rowdy white people acted so unbecomingly&mdash;so shamefully, in fact&mdash;that the King  
placed a strict tabu upon their future admittance. I was absent&mdash;on the island of Hawaii&mdash;at that time, and so I lost that one single opportunity to gratify my curiosity in  
this matter. </p> 
 
<p>	Last night was to behold the grand finale, inasmuch as the obsequies were to  
transpire today, and therefore I was a good deal gratified to learn that a few foreigners  
would be allowed to enter a side gate and view the performances in the palace yard from  
the veranda of Dr. Hutchinson's house (Minister of the Interior). I got there at a little after  
8 P.M. </p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="2" id="d5"> 
<head>NIGHT SCENE IN THE PALACE GROUNDS</head> 
 
<p>	The veranda we occupied overlooked the royal grounds, and afforded an excellent  
view of the two thousand or twenty-five hundred natives sitting, densely packed together,  
in the glare of the torches, between our position and the palace, a hundred feet in front of  
us. It was a wild scene&mdash;those long rows of eager, dusky faces, with the light upon them;  
the band of hula girls in the center, showily attired in white bodices and pink skirts, and  
with wreaths of pink and white flowers and garlands of green leaves about their heads;  
and the strongly illuminated torchbearers scattered far and near at intervals through the  
large assemblage and standing up conspicuously above the masses of sitting forms. Light  
enough found its way to the broad verandas of the palace to enable us to see whatever  
transpired upon them with considerable distinctness. We could see nothing there,  
however, except two or three native sentries in red uniforms, with gleaming muskets in  
their hands. </p> 
 
<p> Presently some one said: "Oh, there's the King!" </p> 
 
<p> "Where?" </p> 
 
<p>	"There&mdash;on the veranda&mdash;now, he's just passing that&mdash;No; it's that blasted Harris." </p> 
 
<p>	That isn't really his Christian name, but he is usually called by that or a stronger  
one. I state this by way of explanation. Harris is the Minister of Finance and Attorney  
General, and I don't know how many other things. He has three marked points: He is not  
a second Solomon; he is as vain as a peacock; he is as "cheeky" as&mdash;however, there is no  
simile for his "cheek." In the Legislature, the other day, the Speaker was trying to seat a  
refractory member; the member knew he was strictly in order, though, and that his only  
crime was his opposition to the Ministry, and so he refused to sit down. Harris whispered 
to the interpreter: "Tell the Speaker to let me have the chair a moment." The speaker  
vacated his place; Harris stepped into it, rapped fiercely with the gavel, scowled  
imperiously upon the intrepid commoner, and ordered him to sit down. The man declined  
to do it. Harris commanded the Sergeant-at-Arms to seat him. After a trial, that officer  
said the bold representative of the people refused to permit him to seat him. Harris  
ordered the Sergeant to take the man out of the house&mdash;remove him by force! [Sensation&mdash; 
tempest, I should rather say.] The poor humbled and browbeaten country members threw  
off their fears for the moment and became men; and from every part of the house they  
shouted: "Come out of that chair! leave that place! put him out! put out the &mdash;!" (I  
have forgotten the Hawaiian phrase, but it is equivalent to "miserable dog.") And this  
terrible man, who was going to perform such wonders, vacated the Speaker's chair, and  
went meekly back to his own place, leaving the stout opponent of the Ministry master of  
the field. The Legislature adjourned at once, and the excited and triumphant Kanakas  
burst forth into a stirring battle hymn of the old days of Kamehameha the Great. Harris  
was an American once (he was born in Portsmouth, N. H.) , but he is no longer one. He is  
<hi rend="italic">hoopilimeaai</hi> to the King. How do you like that, Mr. H.? How do you like being  
attacked in your own native tongue? </p> 
 
<p>	(NOTE TO THE READER: That long native word means&mdash;well, it means Uriah  
Heep boiled down&mdash;it means the soul and spirit of obsequiousness. No genuine American  
can be other than obedient and respectful toward the Government he lives under and the  
flag that protects him, but no such American can ever be hoopilimeaai to anybody.) </p> 
 
<p>	I hope the gentle reader will pardon this digression; but if the gentle reader don't  
want to do it, he can let it alone. </p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="3" id="d6"> 
<head>A GLIMPSE OF THE HEATHEN AGES</head> 
 
<p>	About half past eight o'clock a dozen native women rose up and began the sad  
mourning rites. They locked arms and swayed violently backward and forward; faced  
around and went through a number of quick gestures with hands, heads, and bodies;  
turned and twisted and mingled together&mdash;heads and hands going all the time, and their  
motions timed to a weird howling which it would be rather complimentary to call  
singing; and finished up spreading their arms abroad and throwing their heads and bodies  
far backward simultaneously, and all uttering a deafening squall at the same moment. </p> 
 
<p>	"Well, if there's anything between the Farallones and Fiddler's Green as devilish  
as that, I wish I may&mdash;" </p> 
 
<p>	"Brown," I said, "these solemn and impressive funeral rites of the ancient times  
have been rescued from the oblivion to which the ignorant missionaries consigned them  
forty years ago, by the good and wise Lord Bishop Staley, and it ill beseems such as you  
to speak irreverently of them. I cannot permit you to say more in this vein in my  
presence." </p> 
 
<p>	When the women had finished, the multitude clapped their hands boisterously in  
token of applause. </p> 
 
<p>	A number of native boys next stood up and went through a performance a good  
deal like that which I have just described, singing at the same time a strange, unmusical  
chant. The audience applauded again. (Harris came out once more on that part of the  
veranda which could be seen best by the great assemblage, and assumed an attitude and  
expression so suggestive of his being burdened with the cares of state of sixty or seventy  
kingdoms, that, if I had been a stranger, I must have said to myself "The trifles Richelieu  
had to contend with were foolishness to what this man has got on his hands.") </p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="4" id="d7"> 
<head>CHRISTIANITY AND CIVILIZATION IN WARM QUARTERS</head> 
 
<p>	Next, about twenty native women dressed in black rose up and sang some hymns  
like ours, but in the Kanaka tongue, and made good music of them. Some of the voices  
were very rich and sweet, the harmony was excellent and the time perfect. Every now and  
then, while this choir sang (and, in fact, all the evening), old-time natives scattered  
through the crowd would suddenly break out into a wild heartbroken wail that would  
almost startle one's pulse into stillness. And there was one old fellow near the center who  
would get up often, no matter what was going on, and branch forth into a sort of singsong  
recitation, which he would eventually change into a stump speech; he seemed to make a  
good many hits judging by the cordial applause he got from a coterie of admirers in his  
immediate vicinity. </p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="5" id="d8"> 
<head>MORE HEATHEN DEVILTRY</head> 
 
<p>	A dozen men performed next&mdash;howled and distorted their bodies and flung their  
arms fiercely about, like very maniacs. </p> 
 
<p>	"God bless my soul, just listen at that racket! Your opinion is your opinion, and I  
don't quarrel with it; and my opinion is my opinion; and I say, once for all, that if I was  
Mayor of this town I would just get up here and read the Riot Act once, if I died for it the  
next&mdash;" </p> 
 
<p>	"Brown, I cannot allow this language. These touching expressions of mourning  
were instituted by the good bishop, who has come from his English home to teach this  
poor benighted race to follow the example and imitate the sinless ways of the Redeemer,  
and did not he mourn for the dead Lazarus? Do not the sacred scriptures say 'Jesus  
wept'?" </p> 
 
<p>	I overheard this person Brown muttering something about the imitation being  
rather overdone or improved on, or something of that kind, but I paid no attention to it.  
The man means well; his ignorance is his misfortune&mdash;not his crime. </p> 
 
<p>	Twenty Kanakas in striped knit shirts now filed through the dense crowd and sat  
down in a double row on the ground; each bore an immense gourd, more than two feet  
long, with a neck near one end and a head to it; the outer, or largest end, was a foot in  
diameter; these things were dry and hollow, and are the native tom-toms or drums. Each  
man set his gourd on end, and supported it with a hand on each side; at a given signal  
every drummer launched out into a dismal chant and slapped his drum twice in quick  
succession with his open hands; then three times; then twice again; then&mdash;well, I cannot  
describe it; they slapped the drums in every conceivable way, and the sound produced  
was as dull and dry as if the drums had been solid stone; then they held them above their  
heads a few moments, or over their shoulders, or in front of their faces, or behind their  
necks, and then brought them simultaneously to the gound with a dead, hollow thump;  
and then they went on slapping them as before. They kept up this most dreary and  
unexciting performance for twenty minutes or more, and the great concourse of natives  
watched every motion with rapt and eager admiration, and loudly applauded the  
musicians. </p> 
 
<p>	Brown muttered (under the vile pretense of not intending to be overheard) : "Jesus  
wept." </p> 
 
<p>	"Brown," I said, "your conduct is shameful. It has always been conceded that in  
following the example set us by the Savior we may be allowed some latitude. But I will  
not argue with a man who is so bigoted, faultfinding, and uncharitable. I will have  
nothing further to say to you upon this subject." </p> 
 
<p>	"He&mdash;he wept." </p> 
 
<p>	I thought I heard those words, but Brown's head was out of the window, and I was  
not certain. I was already irritated to that degree that to speak would be to lose my  
temper, and therefore I allowed the suspected mutinous language to pass unnoticed. </p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="6" id="d9"> 
<head>THE CELEBRATED NATIONAL DANCE ("HULA-HULA")</head> 
 
<p>	After the drumming came the famous hula-hula we had heard so much about and  
so longed to see&mdash;the lascivious dance that was wont to set the passions of men ablaze in  
the old heathen days, a century ago. About thirty buxom young Kanaka women, gaily  
attired as I have before remarked, in pink and white, and with heads wreathed with  
flowers and evergreens, formed themselves into half a dozen rows of five or six in a row,  
shook the reefs out of their skirts, tightened their girdles and began the most unearthly  
caterwauling that was ever heard, perhaps; the noise had a marked and regular time to it,  
however, and they kept strict time to it with writhing bodies; with heads and hands thrust  
out to the left; then to the right; then a step to the front and the left hands all projected  
simultaneously forward, and the right hands placed on the hips; then the same repeated  
with a change of hands; then a mingling together of the performers&mdash;quicker time, faster  
and more violently excited motions&mdash;more and more complicated gestures&mdash;(the words of  
their fierce chant meantime treating in broadest terms, and in detail, of things which may  
be vaguely hinted at in a respectable newspaper, but not distinctly mentioned)&mdash;then a  
convulsive writhing of the person, continued for a few moments and ending in a sudden  
stop and a grand caterwaul in chorus (great applause). </p> 
 
<p>	"Jesus wept." </p> 
 
<p>	I barely heard the words, and that was all. They sounded like blasphemy. I offered  
no rebuke to the utterer, because I could not disguise from myself that the gentle grief of  
the Savior was but poorly imitated here&mdash;that the heathen orgies resurrected by the Lord  
Bishop of Honolulu were not warranted by the teachings of the Master whom he  
professes to serve. </p> 
 
<p>	Minister Harris emerging from the Palace veranda at this moment with the weight  
of his sixty kingdoms bearing down on him heavier than ever, and it being past midnight,  
I judged it time to go home, and I did so. </p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="7" id="d10"> 
<head>WHOSE CIRCUS IT WAS</head> 
 
<p>	It is reported that the King has said: "The foreigners like their religion&mdash;let them  
enjoy it, and freely. But the religion of my fathers is good enough for me." Now that is all  
right. At least I think so. And I have no fault to find with the natives for the lingering love  
they feel for their ancient customs. But I do find fault with Bishop Staley for reviving  
those customs of a barbarous age at a time when they had long been abandoned and were  
being forgotten&mdash;when one more generation of faithful adherence to the teachings of the  
American missionaries would have buried them forever and made them memories of the  
past&mdash;things to be talked of and wondered at, like the old laws that made it death for a  
plebeian to stand erect in the presence of his king, or for a man to speak to his wife on a  
tabu day&mdash;but never imitated. </p> 
 
<p>	For forty years before the bishop brought his Royal Hawaiian Established  
Reformed Catholic Church here, the kings and chiefs of this land had been buried with  
the quiet, simple, Christian rites that are observed in England and America, and no man  
thought of anything more being necessary. But one of the first things Bishop Staley did  
when he arrived here a few years ago was to write home that the missionaries had  
deprived the natives of their innocent sports and pastimes (such as the lascivious hula-hula, and the promiscuous bathing in the surf of nude natives of opposite sexes), and one  
of the next things he did was to attend a hula-hula at Waikiki with his holy head tricked  
out in the flower and evergreen trumpery worn by the hula girls. When the late king died,  
the bishop revived the half-forgotten howling and hula dancing and other barbarisms in  
the palace yard, and officiated there as a sort of master of ceremonies. For many a year  
before he came, that wretchedest of all wretched musical abortions, the tom-tom, had not  
been heard near the heart of Honolulu; but he has reinstated it and brought it into its  
ancient esteem and popularity. The old superstitions of this people were passing away far  
faster than is the case with the inhabitants of the unfrequented and sparsely populated  
country districts of America, France, and Wales, but Bishop Staley is putting a stop to  
progress in this direction. </p> 
 
<p>	We owe the strange and unpleasant scenes of last night to him&mdash;there are not ten  
white men in the kingdom who have ever seen their like before in public&mdash;and I am told  
that he is appalled at the work of his own hands&mdash;that he is ashamed&mdash;that he dreads to  
think of the comments it will provoke in Christian lands&mdash;in a word, that he finds, too late,  
that he has made a most melancholy blunder. </p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="8" id="d11"> 
<head>BISHOP STALEY</head> 
 
<p>	If I may speak freely, I think this all comes of elevating a weak, trivial-minded  
man to a position of rank and power&mdash;of making a bishop out of very inferior material&mdash;of  
trying to construct greatness out of constitutional insignificance. My estimate of Bishop  
Staley is not carelessly formed; there is evidence to back it. He gossips habitually; he  
lacks the common wisdom to keep still that deadly enemy of a man, his own tongue; he  
says ill-advised things in public speeches, and then in other public speeches denies that  
he ever said them; he shows spite, a trait which is not allied to greatness; he is fond of  
rushing into print, like mediocrity the world over, and is vainer of being my Lord Bishop  
over a diocese of fifteen thousand men and women (albeit they belong to other people's  
churches) than some other men would be of wielding the worldwide power of the Pope;  
and finally, every single important act of his administration has evinced a lack of sagacity  
and an unripeness of judgment which might be forgiven a youth, but not a full-grown  
man&mdash;or, if that seems too severe, which might be forgiven a restless, visionary nobody,  
but not a bishop. My estimate of Bishop Staley may be a wrong one, but it is at least an  
honest one. </p> 
 
<p>	Persons who are intimate with Bishop Staley say he is a good man, and a well  
educated and cultivated one, and that in social life he is companionable, pleasant, and  
liberal spirited when church matters are not the topic of conversation. This is no doubt  
true; but it is my province to speak of him in his official, not in his private capacity. He  
has shown the temerity of an incautious, inexperienced, and immature judgment in  
rushing in here fresh from the heart and home of a high English civilization and throwing  
down the gauntlet of defiance before a band of stern, tenacious, unyielding, tireless,  
industrious, devoted old Puritan knights who have seen forty years of missionary service;  
whose time was never fooled away in theorizing, but whose lightest acts always meant  
business; who landed here two score years ago, full of that fervent zeal and resistless  
determination inherited from their Pilgrim fore-fathers, and marched forth and seized  
upon this people with a grip of iron, and infused into their being, wrought into their very  
natures, the spirit of democracy and the religious enthusiasm that animated themselves;  
whose grip is still upon the race and can never be loosened till they, of their own free will  
and accord, shall relax it. He showed a marvelous temerity&mdash;one weak, inexperienced  
man against a host of drilled and hardy veterans; and among them great men&mdash;men who  
would be great in wider and broader spheres than that they have chosen here. He  
miscalculated the force, the confidence, the determination of that Puritan spirit which  
subdued America and underlies her whole religious fabric today&mdash;which has subdued  
these islanders, and whose influence over them can never be unseated.	</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="section" n="9" id="d12"> 
<head>THE REFORMED CATHOLIC CHURCH&mdash;THE "COURT RELIGION"</head> 
 
<p>	His church was another miscalculation. It was a mistake to appeal by imposing  
ceremonies and showy display to a people imbued with a thorough Puritan distaste for  
such things, and who had never been much accustomed to anything of the kind at any  
period of their history. There is little in common between the simple evergreen  
decorations and the tom-toms and the hula-hulas of the natives, and the cheap  
magnificence of the bishop's cathedral altar,	his gaudily painted organ pipes and the  
monotonous and unattractive ceremonials of his church service. </p> 
 		 
<p>	He is fighting with good nerve, but his side is weak. The moneyed strength of  
these islands&mdash;their agriculture, their commerce, their mercantile affairs&mdash;is in the hands  
of Americans&mdash;republicans; the religious power of the country is wielded by Americans&mdash; 
republicans; the whole people are saturated with the spirit of democratic Puritanism, 
and they are&mdash;republicans. This is a republic, to the very marrow, and over it sit a King, a  
dozen Nobles and half a dozen Ministers. The field of the Royal Hawaiian Established  
Church is thus so circumscribed that the little cathedral in Nuuanu Street, with its thirty  
pews of ten individual capacity each, is large enough to accommodate it in its entirety,  
and have room to spare. </p> 
 
<p> And this is the bugbear that has kept the American missionaries in hot water for  
three or four years! The Bishop of Honolulu ought to feel flattered that a chance so slim  
as his, and a power so feeble as his, has been able to accomplish it. But at the same time  
he ought to feel grateful, because, if let alone, he and his church must infallibly have been  
and remained insignificant. I do not say this ill-naturedly, for I bear the Bishop no malice,  
and I respect his sacred office; I simply state a palpable fact. </p> 
 
<p> I will say a word or two about the Reformed Catholic Church, to the end that  
strangers may understand its character. Briefly, then, it is a miraculous invention. One  
might worship this strange production itself without breaking the first commandment, for  
there is nothing like it in the heavens above or in the earth beneath, or in the water under  
the earth. The Catholics refuse to accept it as Catholic, the Episcopalians deny that it is  
the church they are accustomed to, and of course the Puritans claim no kindred with it. It  
is called a child of the Established Church of England, but it resembles its parent in few  
particulars. It has got an altar which is gay with fiery velvet, showy white trimmings,  
vases of flowers, and other mantel ornaments. (It was once flanked by imposing, seven-branched candlesticks, but these were obnoxious and have been removed.) Over it is a  
thing like a gilt signboard, on which is rudely painted two processions&mdash;four personages  
in each&mdash;marching solemnly and in single file toward the crucified Savior in the center,  
and bringing their baggage with them. The design of it is a secret known only to the artist  
and his Maker. Near the pulpit is a red canopied shower bath&mdash;I mean it looks like one&mdash;upon which is inscribed, "Separated unto the Gospel of God." The bishop sits under it at a  
small desk, when he has got nothing particular to do. The organ pipes are colored with a  
groundwork of blue, which is covered all over with a flower work wrought in other  
colors. Judging by its striking homeliness, I should say that the artist of the altar piece  
had labored here also. Near the door of the church, but inside, of course, stands a small  
pillar, surmounted by a large shell. It may be for holy water or it may be a contribution  
box. If the latter be the case, I must protest that this ghastly pun&mdash;this mute suggestion to  
shell out&mdash;is ill suited to the sacred character of the place, and it is only with the  
profoundest pain that I force myself to even think for a moment upon so distressing a  
circumstance. Against the wall is a picture of the future cathedral of Honolulu&mdash;a more  
imposing structure than the present one; that many a year may elapse before it is built is  
no wish of mine. A dozen acolytes&mdash;Chinese, Kanaka, and half-white boys, arrayed in  
white robes, hold positions near the altar, and during the early part of the service they  
sing and go through some performances suggestive of the regular Catholic services; after  
that, the majority of the boys go off on furlough. The bishop reads a chapter from the  
Bible; then the organist leaves his instrument and sings a litany peculiar to this church,  
and not to be heard elsewhere; there is nothing stirring or incendiary about his mild, nasal  
music; the congregation join the chorus; after this a third clergyman preaches the sermon;  
these three ecclesiastics all wear white surplices. I have described the evening services.  
When the bishop first came here, he indulged in a good deal of showy display and  
ceremony in his church, but these proved so distasteful, even to Episcopalians, that he  
shortly modified them very much. </p> 
 
<p>	I have spoken rather irreverently once or twice in the above paragraph, and am  
ashamed of it. But why write it over? I would not be likely to get it any better. I might  
make the matter worse. </p> 
 
<p> 	"And say that&mdash;" </p> 
 
<p>	"Brown, have you, in defiance of all my reproofs, been looking over my shoulder  
again?" </p> 
 
<p>	"Yes, but that's all right, you know&mdash;that's all right. Just say&mdash;just say that the  
bishop works as hard as any man, and makes the best fight he can&mdash;and that's a credit to  
him, anyway." </p> 
 
<p>	"Brown, that is the first charitable sentiment I have ever heard you utter. At a  
proper moment I will confer upon you a fitting reward for it. But for the present, good  
night, son. Go, now. Go to your innocent slumbers. And wash your feet, Brown&mdash;or  
perhaps it is your teeth&mdash;at any rate you are unusually offensive this evening. Remedy the  
matter. Never mind explaining&mdash;good night." </p>

<head>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSION</head> 
 
<p>	The French Roman Catholic Mission here, under the Right Reverend Lord Bishop  
Maigret, goes along quietly and unostentatiously; and its affairs are conducted with a  
wisdom which betrays the presence of a leader of distinguished ability. The Catholic  
clergy are honest, straightforward, frank, and open; they are industrious and devoted to  
their religion and their work; they never meddle; whatever they do can be relied on as  
being prompted by a good and worthy motive. These things disarm resentment&mdash;prejudice  
cannot exist in their presence. Consequently, Americans are never heard to speak ill or  
slightingly of the French Catholic Mission. Their religion is not nondescript&mdash;it is plain,  
out-and-out, undisguised, and unmistakable Catholicism. You know right where to find  
them when you want them. The American missionaries have no quarrel with these men;  
they honor and respect and esteem them&mdash;and bid them Godspeed. There is an anomaly  
for you&mdash;Puritan and Roman Catholic striding along, hand in hand, under the banner of  
the Cross! </p>
