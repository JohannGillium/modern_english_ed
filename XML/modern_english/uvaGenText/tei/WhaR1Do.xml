<head><hi rend="italic">The Decoration of Houses</hi>.  By Edith Wharton and Ogden  
     Codman, Jr. Charles Scribner's Sons.  1897.</head>  
<p>One opens a new book on decoration with a weary anticipation,  
remembering how much has been lately written on the subject for  
Americans, and to how little purpose; but now the whole style and  
practice of decoration has changed, and the teaching of the last  
generation has become obsolete.  'The Decoration of Houses,' a  
handsome, interesting, and well-written book, not only is an  
example of the recent reversion to quasi-classic styles and  
methods, but signalizes the complete reaction that has thrown to  
the winds, even before the public discovered it, perhaps, the  
lately accepted doctrine of constructive virtue, sincerity, and the  
beauty of use.  The authors take the new ground uncompromisingly,  
snap their fingers at sincerity, have no horror of shams, and stand  
simply on proportion, harmony of lines, and other architectural  
qualities.  "Any <hi rend="italic">trompe-d'oeil</hi> is permissible in decorative  
design," they say, "if it gives an impression of pleasure."  To  
this have we already come; yet it seems not to have produced  
harmony between the outside and the inside of their volume.  
</p><p>The thread of their discussion is historical.  Its fifty  
illustrations, taken from Italian, French, and English interiors,  
with a somewhat omnivorous appetite, are of various interest; but  
the book is the fruit of study, and of a larger knowledge of  
examples than has commonly been the case with its predecessors.  It  
is aimed, not at professional readers, but at the public, whom it  
instructs with many intelligent criticisms and sensible directions,  
calling their attention to artistic aspects of decoration which  
have been neglected by writers of the last dispensation.  It  
touches the root of present difficulty when it says, in the  
preface, that "the vulgarity of current decoration has its source  
in the indifference of the wealthy to architectural fitness."  But,  
to the authors, architectural fitness means agreeable proportions  
and combination of lines, and no more.  
</p><p>The temptation of the literature that we have left behind was  
that any ready-witted writer could discourse magisterially about  
decoration; and, inasmuch as his material was pure theory, it  
called for neither experience nor knowledge, nor yet for artistic  
or technical acquirement; in truth, after the beginning, the  
writers were mainly literary men and amateurs.  Nevertheless there  
were valuable truths in their writings, and principles which, under  
due limitation, should have infused freshness, vitality, and  
manliness into decorative work.  If these have been forgotten  
before they have borne their due fruit, the fault may have been in  
the narrowness, vehemence, and want of technical enlightenment with  
which they were urged.  But whether we are morally wise, or  
historically, the things we need for decorative work are taste and  
instinct for form&mdash;qualities which still wait their development  
among Americans.  Till these are evolved, we must either intrust  
ourselves to professional hands, or be left to vibrate between the  
dicta of dilettanti on the one hand and doctrinaires on the other.
