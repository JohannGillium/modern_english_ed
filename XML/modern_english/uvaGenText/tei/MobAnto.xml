<p><stage>Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PHILO</speaker>
<p>Nay, but this dotage of our general's<lb/>
O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,<lb/>
That o'er the files and musters of the war<lb/>
Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,<lb/>
The office and devotion of their view<lb/>
Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,<lb/>
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst<lb/>
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,<lb/>
And is become the bellows and the fan<lb/>
To cool a gipsy's lust.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,	the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her</stage></p>


<p>
Look, where they come:<lb/>
Take but good note, and you shall see in him.<lb/>
The triple pillar of the world transform'd<lb/>
Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>If it be love indeed, tell me how much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter an Attendant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<p>News, my good lord, from Rome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Grates me: the sum.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Nay, hear them, Antony:<lb/>
Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows<lb/>
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent<lb/>
His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;<lb/>
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;<lb/>
Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>How, my love!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Perchance! nay, and most like:<lb/>
You must not stay here longer, your dismission<lb/>
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.<lb/>
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?<lb/>
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,<lb/>
Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine<lb/>
Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame<lb/>
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch<lb/>
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.<lb/>
Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike<lb/>
Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life<lb/>
Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Embracing</stage></p>


<p>
And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,<lb/>
On pain of punishment, the world to weet<lb/>
We stand up peerless.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Excellent falsehood!<lb/>
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?<lb/>
I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony<lb/>
Will be himself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>But stirr'd by Cleopatra.<lb/>
Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,<lb/>
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:<lb/>
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch<lb/>
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Hear the ambassadors.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Fie, wrangling queen!<lb/>
Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,<lb/>
To weep; whose every passion fully strives<lb/>
To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!<lb/>
No messenger, but thine; and all alone<lb/>
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note<lb/>
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;<lb/>
Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with	their train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PHILO</speaker>
<p>Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,<lb/>
He comes too short of that great property<lb/>
Which still should go with Antony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEMETRIUS</speaker>
<p>I am full sorry<lb/>
That he approves the common liar, who<lb/>
Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope<lb/>
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>The same. Another room.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,<lb/>
almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer<lb/>
that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew<lb/>
this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns<lb/>
with garlands!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Soothsayer!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>Your will?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>In nature's infinite book of secrecy<lb/>
A little I can read.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Show him your hand.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough<lb/>
Cleopatra's health to drink.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Good sir, give me good fortune.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>I make not, but foresee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Pray, then, foresee me one.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>You shall be yet far fairer than you are.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>He means in flesh.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>No, you shall paint when you are old.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Wrinkles forbid!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Vex not his prescience; be attentive.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Hush!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>You shall be more beloving than beloved.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>I had rather heat my liver with drinking.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Nay, hear him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married<lb/>
to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:<lb/>
let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry<lb/>
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius<lb/>
Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>O excellent! I love long life better than figs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune<lb/>
Than that which is to approach.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Then belike my children shall have no names:<lb/>
prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>If every of your wishes had a womb.<lb/>
And fertile every wish, a million.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Nay, come, tell Iras hers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>We'll know all our fortunes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall<lb/>
be&mdash;drunk to bed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful<lb/>
prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,<lb/>
tell her but a worky-day fortune.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>Your fortunes are alike.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>But how, but how? give me particulars.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>I have said.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than<lb/>
I, where would you choose it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>Not in my husband's nose.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,&mdash;come,<lb/>
his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman<lb/>
that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let<lb/>
her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst<lb/>
follow worse, till the worst of all follow him<lb/>
laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good<lb/>
Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a<lb/>
matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!<lb/>
for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man<lb/>
loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a<lb/>
foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep<lb/>
decorum, and fortune him accordingly!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a<lb/>
cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but<lb/>
they'ld do't!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Hush! here comes Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Not he; the queen.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter CLEOPATRA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Saw you my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>No, lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Was he not here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>No, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden<lb/>
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Madam?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Seek him, and bring him hither.<lb/>
Where's Alexas?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Here, at your service. My lord approaches.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>We will not look upon him: go with us.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Against my brother Lucius?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Ay:<lb/>
But soon that war had end, and the time's state<lb/>
Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;<lb/>
Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,<lb/>
Upon the first encounter, drave them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Well, what worst?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>The nature of bad news infects the teller.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>When it concerns the fool or coward. On:<lb/>
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:<lb/>
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,<lb/>
I hear him as he flatter'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Labienus&mdash;<lb/>
This is stiff news&mdash;hath, with his Parthian force,<lb/>
Extended Asia from Euphrates;<lb/>
His conquering banner shook from Syria<lb/>
To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Antony, thou wouldst say,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>O, my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:<lb/>
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;<lb/>
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults<lb/>
With such full licence as both truth and malice<lb/>
Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,<lb/>
When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us<lb/>
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>At your noble pleasure.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Attendant</speaker>
<p>The man from Sicyon,&mdash;is there such an one?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Attendant</speaker>
<p>He stays upon your will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Let him appear.<lb/>
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,<lb/>
Or lose myself in dotage.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter another Messenger</stage></p>


<p>
What are you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Messenger</speaker>
<p>Fulvia thy wife is dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Where died she?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Messenger</speaker>
<p>In Sicyon:<lb/>
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious<lb/>
Importeth thee to know, this bears.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Gives a letter</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Forbear me.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Second Messenger</stage></p>


<p>
There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:<lb/>
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,<lb/>
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,<lb/>
By revolution lowering, does become<lb/>
The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;<lb/>
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.<lb/>
I must from this enchanting queen break off:<lb/>
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,<lb/>
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>What's your pleasure, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I must with haste from hence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Why, then, we kill all our women:<lb/>
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;<lb/>
if they suffer our departure, death's the word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I must be gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were<lb/>
pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between<lb/>
them and a great cause, they should be esteemed<lb/>
nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of<lb/>
this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty<lb/>
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is<lb/>
mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon<lb/>
her, she hath such a celerity in dying.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>She is cunning past man's thought.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit ALEXAS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but<lb/>
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her<lb/>
winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater<lb/>
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this<lb/>
cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a<lb/>
shower of rain as well as Jove.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Would I had never seen her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece<lb/>
of work; which not to have been blest withal would<lb/>
have discredited your travel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Fulvia is dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Fulvia is dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Fulvia!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When<lb/>
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man<lb/>
from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;<lb/>
comforting therein, that when old robes are worn<lb/>
out, there are members to make new. If there were<lb/>
no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,<lb/>
and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned<lb/>
with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new<lb/>
petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>The business she hath broached in the state<lb/>
Cannot endure my absence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>And the business you have broached here cannot be<lb/>
without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which<lb/>
wholly depends on your abode.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>No more light answers. Let our officers<lb/>
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break<lb/>
The cause of our expedience to the queen,<lb/>
And get her leave to part. For not alone<lb/>
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,<lb/>
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too<lb/>
Of many our contriving friends in Rome<lb/>
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius<lb/>
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands<lb/>
The empire of the sea: our slippery people,<lb/>
Whose love is never link'd to the deserver<lb/>
Till his deserts are past, begin to throw<lb/>
Pompey the Great and all his dignities<lb/>
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,<lb/>
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up<lb/>
For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,<lb/>
The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,<lb/>
Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,<lb/>
And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,<lb/>
To such whose place is under us, requires<lb/>
Our quick remove from hence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,<lb/>
You do not hold the method to enforce<lb/>
The like from him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>What should I do, I do not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:<lb/>
In time we hate that which we often fear.<lb/>
But here comes Antony.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MARK ANTONY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I am sick and sullen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:<lb/>
It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature<lb/>
Will not sustain it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Now, my dearest queen,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Pray you, stand further from me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.<lb/>
What says the married woman? You may go:<lb/>
Would she had never given you leave to come!<lb/>
Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:<lb/>
I have no power upon you; hers you are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>The gods best know,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O, never was there queen<lb/>
So mightily betray'd! yet at the first<lb/>
I saw the treasons planted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Cleopatra,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Why should I think you can be mine and true,<lb/>
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,<lb/>
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,<lb/>
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,<lb/>
Which break themselves in swearing!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Most sweet queen,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,<lb/>
But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,<lb/>
Then was the time for words: no going then;<lb/>
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,<lb/>
Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,<lb/>
But was a race of heaven: they are so still,<lb/>
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,<lb/>
Art turn'd the greatest liar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>How now, lady!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know<lb/>
There were a heart in Egypt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Hear me, queen:<lb/>
The strong necessity of time commands<lb/>
Our services awhile; but my full heart<lb/>
Remains in use with you. Our Italy<lb/>
Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius<lb/>
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:<lb/>
Equality of two domestic powers<lb/>
Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,<lb/>
Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,<lb/>
Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,<lb/>
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived<lb/>
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;<lb/>
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge<lb/>
By any desperate change: my more particular,<lb/>
And that which most with you should safe my going,<lb/>
Is Fulvia's death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Though age from folly could not give me freedom,<lb/>
It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>She's dead, my queen:<lb/>
Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read<lb/>
The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:<lb/>
See when and where she died.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O most false love!<lb/>
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill<lb/>
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,<lb/>
In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know<lb/>
The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,<lb/>
As you shall give the advice. By the fire<lb/>
That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence<lb/>
Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war<lb/>
As thou affect'st.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Cut my lace, Charmian, come;<lb/>
But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,<lb/>
So Antony loves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>My precious queen, forbear;<lb/>
And give true evidence to his love, which stands<lb/>
An honourable trial.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>So Fulvia told me.<lb/>
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,<lb/>
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears<lb/>
Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene<lb/>
Of excellent dissembling; and let it look<lb/>
Life perfect honour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>You'll heat my blood: no more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>You can do better yet; but this is meetly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Now, by my sword,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>And target. Still he mends;<lb/>
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,<lb/>
How this Herculean Roman does become<lb/>
The carriage of his chafe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I'll leave you, lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Courteous lord, one word.<lb/>
Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:<lb/>
Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;<lb/>
That you know well: something it is I would,<lb/>
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,<lb/>
And I am all forgotten.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>But that your royalty<lb/>
Holds idleness your subject, I should take you<lb/>
For idleness itself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>'Tis sweating labour<lb/>
To bear such idleness so near the heart<lb/>
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;<lb/>
Since my becomings kill me, when they do not<lb/>
Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;<lb/>
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.<lb/>
And all the gods go with you! upon your sword<lb/>
Sit laurel victory! and smooth success<lb/>
Be strew'd before your feet!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Let us go. Come;<lb/>
Our separation so abides, and flies,<lb/>
That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,<lb/>
And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS,	and their Train</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,<lb/>
It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate<lb/>
Our great competitor: from Alexandria<lb/>
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes<lb/>
The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like<lb/>
Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy<lb/>
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or<lb/>
Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there<lb/>
A man who is the abstract of all faults<lb/>
That all men follow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>I must not think there are<lb/>
Evils enow to darken all his goodness:<lb/>
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,<lb/>
More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,<lb/>
Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,<lb/>
Than what he chooses.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not<lb/>
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;<lb/>
To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit<lb/>
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;<lb/>
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet<lb/>
With knaves that smell of sweat: say this<lb/>
becomes him,&mdash;<lb/>
As his composure must be rare indeed<lb/>
Whom these things cannot blemish,&mdash;yet must Antony<lb/>
No way excuse his soils, when we do bear<lb/>
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd<lb/>
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,<lb/>
Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,<lb/>
Call on him for't: but to confound such time,<lb/>
That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud<lb/>
As his own state and ours,&mdash;'tis to be chid<lb/>
As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,<lb/>
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,<lb/>
And so rebel to judgment.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Here's more news.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,<lb/>
Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report<lb/>
How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;<lb/>
And it appears he is beloved of those<lb/>
That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports<lb/>
The discontents repair, and men's reports<lb/>
Give him much wrong'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>I should have known no less.<lb/>
It hath been taught us from the primal state,<lb/>
That he which is was wish'd until he were;<lb/>
And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,<lb/>
Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,<lb/>
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,<lb/>
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,<lb/>
To rot itself with motion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Caesar, I bring thee word,<lb/>
Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,<lb/>
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound<lb/>
With keels of every kind: many hot inroads<lb/>
They make in Italy; the borders maritime<lb/>
Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:<lb/>
No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon<lb/>
Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more<lb/>
Than could his war resisted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Antony,<lb/>
Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once<lb/>
Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st<lb/>
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel<lb/>
Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,<lb/>
Though daintily brought up, with patience more<lb/>
Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink<lb/>
The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle<lb/>
Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign<lb/>
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;<lb/>
Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,<lb/>
The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps<lb/>
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,<lb/>
Which some did die to look on: and all this&mdash;<lb/>
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now&mdash;<lb/>
Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek<lb/>
So much as lank'd not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis pity of him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Let his shames quickly<lb/>
Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain<lb/>
Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end<lb/>
Assemble we immediate council: Pompey<lb/>
Thrives in our idleness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>To-morrow, Caesar,<lb/>
I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly<lb/>
Both what by sea and land I can be able<lb/>
To front this present time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Till which encounter,<lb/>
It is my business too. Farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime<lb/>
Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,<lb/>
To let me be partaker.<lb/>

<p>Why, madam?<lb/>

<p>That I might sleep out this great gap of time<lb/>
My Antony is away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>You think of him too much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O, 'tis treason!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Madam, I trust, not so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Thou, eunuch Mardian!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARDIAN</speaker>
<p>What's your highness' pleasure?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure<lb/>
In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,<lb/>
That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts<lb/>
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARDIAN</speaker>
<p>Yes, gracious madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Indeed!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARDIAN</speaker>
<p>Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing<lb/>
But what indeed is honest to be done:<lb/>
Yet have I fierce affections, and think<lb/>
What Venus did with Mars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O Charmian,<lb/>
Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?<lb/>
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?<lb/>
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!<lb/>
Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?<lb/>
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm<lb/>
And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,<lb/>
Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'<lb/>
For so he calls me: now I feed myself<lb/>
With most delicious poison. Think on me,<lb/>
That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,<lb/>
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,<lb/>
When thou wast here above the ground, I was<lb/>
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey<lb/>
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;<lb/>
There would he anchor his aspect and die<lb/>
With looking on his life.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Sovereign of Egypt, hail!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!<lb/>
Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath<lb/>
With his tinct gilded thee.<lb/>
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Last thing he did, dear queen,<lb/>
He kiss'd,&mdash;the last of many doubled kisses,&mdash;<lb/>
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Mine ear must pluck it thence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>'Good friend,' quoth he,<lb/>
'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends<lb/>
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,<lb/>
To mend the petty present, I will piece<lb/>
Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,<lb/>
Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,<lb/>
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,<lb/>
Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke<lb/>
Was beastly dumb'd by him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>What, was he sad or merry?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Like to the time o' the year between the extremes<lb/>
Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O well-divided disposition! Note him,<lb/>
Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:<lb/>
He was not sad, for he would shine on those<lb/>
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,<lb/>
Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay<lb/>
In Egypt with his joy; but between both:<lb/>
O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,<lb/>
The violence of either thee becomes,<lb/>
So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXAS</speaker>
<p>Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:<lb/>
Why do you send so thick?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Who's born that day<lb/>
When I forget to send to Antony,<lb/>
Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.<lb/>
Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,<lb/>
Ever love Caesar so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>O that brave Caesar!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>

Deny us for our good; so find we profit<lb/>

<p>I shall do well:<lb/>
The people love me, and the sea is mine;<lb/>
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope<lb/>
Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony<lb/>
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make<lb/>
No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where<lb/>
He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,<lb/>
Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,<lb/>
Nor either cares for him.<lb/>

<p>Caesar and Lepidus<lb/>
Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.<lb/>

Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,<lb/>
Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!<lb/>
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!<lb/>
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,<lb/>
Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks<lb/>
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;<lb/>

Even till a Lethe'd dulness!<lb/>

Mark Antony is every hour in Rome<lb/>
Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis<lb/>
A space for further travel.<lb/>

<p>I could have given less matter<lb/>
A better ear. Menas, I did not think<lb/>
This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm<lb/>
For such a petty war: his soldiership<lb/>
Is twice the other twain: but let us rear<lb/>
The higher our opinion, that our stirring<lb/>

Were't not that we stand up against them all,<lb/>
'Twere pregnant they should square between<lb/>

For they have entertained cause enough<lb/>
To draw their swords: but how the fear of us<lb/>

And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,<lb/>
Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,<lb/>
I would not shave't to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis not a time<lb/>
For private stomaching.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Every time<lb/>
Serves for the matter that is then born in't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>But small to greater matters must give way.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Not if the small come first.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Your speech is passion:<lb/>
But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes<lb/>
The noble Antony.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>And yonder, Caesar.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>If we compose well here, to Parthia:<lb/>
Hark, Ventidius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>I do not know,<lb/>
Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Noble friends,<lb/>
That which combined us was most great, and let not<lb/>
A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,<lb/>
May it be gently heard: when we debate<lb/>
Our trivial difference loud, we do commit<lb/>
Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,<lb/>
The rather, for I earnestly beseech,<lb/>
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,<lb/>
Nor curstness grow to the matter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>'Tis spoken well.<lb/>
Were we before our armies, and to fight.<lb/>
I should do thus.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Welcome to Rome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Thank you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Sit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Sit, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Nay, then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I learn, you take things ill which are not so,<lb/>
Or being, concern you not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>I must be laugh'd at,<lb/>
If, or for nothing or a little, I<lb/>
Should say myself offended, and with you<lb/>
Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should<lb/>
Once name you derogately, when to sound your name<lb/>
It not concern'd me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>My being in Egypt, Caesar,<lb/>
What was't to you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>No more than my residing here at Rome<lb/>
Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there<lb/>
Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt<lb/>
Might be my question.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>How intend you, practised?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>You may be pleased to catch at mine intent<lb/>
By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother<lb/>
Made wars upon me; and their contestation<lb/>
Was theme for you, you were the word of war.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>You do mistake your business; my brother never<lb/>
Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;<lb/>
And have my learning from some true reports,<lb/>
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather<lb/>
Discredit my authority with yours;<lb/>
And make the wars alike against my stomach,<lb/>
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters<lb/>
Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,<lb/>
As matter whole you have not to make it with,<lb/>
It must not be with this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>You praise yourself<lb/>
By laying defects of judgment to me; but<lb/>
You patch'd up your excuses.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Not so, not so;<lb/>
I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,<lb/>
Very necessity of this thought, that I,<lb/>
Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,<lb/>
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars<lb/>
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,<lb/>
I would you had her spirit in such another:<lb/>
The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle<lb/>
You may pace easy, but not such a wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Would we had all such wives, that the men might go<lb/>
to wars with the women!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar<lb/>
Made out of her impatience, which not wanted<lb/>
Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant<lb/>
Did you too much disquiet: for that you must<lb/>
But say, I could not help it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>I wrote to you<lb/>
When rioting in Alexandria; you<lb/>
Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts<lb/>
Did gibe my missive out of audience.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
He fell upon me ere admitted: then<lb/>
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want<lb/>
Of what I was i' the morning: but next day<lb/>
I told him of myself; which was as much<lb/>
As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow<lb/>
Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,<lb/>
Out of our question wipe him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>You have broken<lb/>
The article of your oath; which you shall never<lb/>
Have tongue to charge me with.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Soft, Caesar!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>No,<lb/>
Lepidus, let him speak:<lb/>
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,<lb/>
Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;<lb/>
The article of my oath.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>To lend me arms and aid when I required them;<lb/>
The which you both denied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Neglected, rather;<lb/>
And then when poison'd hours had bound me up<lb/>
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,<lb/>
I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty<lb/>
Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power<lb/>
Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,<lb/>
To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;<lb/>
For which myself, the ignorant motive, do<lb/>
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour<lb/>
To stoop in such a case.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis noble spoken.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>If it might please you, to enforce no further<lb/>
The griefs between ye: to forget them quite<lb/>
Were to remember that the present need<lb/>
Speaks to atone you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Or, if you borrow one another's love for the<lb/>
instant, you may, when you hear no more words of<lb/>
Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to<lb/>
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Go to, then; your considerate stone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>I do not much dislike the matter, but<lb/>
The manner of his speech; for't cannot be<lb/>
We shall remain in friendship, our conditions<lb/>
So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew<lb/>
What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge<lb/>
O' the world I would pursue it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Give me leave, Caesar,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Speak, Agrippa.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,<lb/>
Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony<lb/>
Is now a widower.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Say not so, Agrippa:<lb/>
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof<lb/>
Were well deserved of rashness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I am not married, Caesar: let me hear<lb/>
Agrippa further speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>To hold you in perpetual amity,<lb/>
To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts<lb/>
With an unslipping knot, take Antony<lb/>
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims<lb/>
No worse a husband than the best of men;<lb/>
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak<lb/>
That which none else can utter. By this marriage,<lb/>
All little jealousies, which now seem great,<lb/>
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,<lb/>
Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,<lb/>
Where now half tales be truths: her love to both<lb/>
Would, each to other and all loves to both,<lb/>
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;<lb/>
For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,<lb/>
By duty ruminated.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Will Caesar speak?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd<lb/>
With what is spoke already.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>What power is in Agrippa,<lb/>
If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'<lb/>
To make this good?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>The power of Caesar, and<lb/>
His power unto Octavia.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>May I never<lb/>
To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,<lb/>
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:<lb/>
Further this act of grace: and from this hour<lb/>
The heart of brothers govern in our loves<lb/>
And sway our great designs!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>There is my hand.<lb/>
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother<lb/>
Did ever love so dearly: let her live<lb/>
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never<lb/>
Fly off our loves again!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Happily, amen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;<lb/>
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great<lb/>
Of late upon me: I must thank him only,<lb/>
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;<lb/>
At heel of that, defy him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Time calls upon's:<lb/>
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,<lb/>
Or else he seeks out us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Where lies he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>About the mount Misenum.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>What is his strength by land?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Great and increasing: but by sea<lb/>
He is an absolute master.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>So is the fame.<lb/>
Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:<lb/>
Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we<lb/>
The business we have talk'd of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>With most gladness:<lb/>
And do invite you to my sister's view,<lb/>
Whither straight I'll lead you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Let us, Lepidus,<lb/>
Not lack your company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Noble Antony,<lb/>
Not sickness should detain me.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY,	and LEPIDUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>Welcome from Egypt, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My<lb/>
honourable friend, Agrippa!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Good Enobarbus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>We have cause to be glad that matters are so well<lb/>
digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and<lb/>
made the night light with drinking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and<lb/>
but twelve persons there; is this true?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more<lb/>
monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to<lb/>
her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up<lb/>
his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised<lb/>
well for her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>I will tell you.<lb/>
The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,<lb/>
Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;<lb/>
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that<lb/>
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,<lb/>
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made<lb/>
The water which they beat to follow faster,<lb/>
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,<lb/>
It beggar'd all description: she did lie<lb/>
In her pavilion&mdash;cloth-of-gold of tissue&mdash;<lb/>
O'er-picturing that Venus where we see<lb/>
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her<lb/>
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,<lb/>
With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem<lb/>
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,<lb/>
And what they undid did.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>O, rare for Antony!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,<lb/>
So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,<lb/>
And made their bends adornings: at the helm<lb/>
A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle<lb/>
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,<lb/>
That yarely frame the office. From the barge<lb/>
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense<lb/>
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast<lb/>
Her people out upon her; and Antony,<lb/>
Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,<lb/>
Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,<lb/>
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,<lb/>
And made a gap in nature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Rare Egyptian!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,<lb/>
Invited her to supper: she replied,<lb/>
It should be better he became her guest;<lb/>
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,<lb/>
Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,<lb/>
Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,<lb/>
And for his ordinary pays his heart<lb/>
For what his eyes eat only.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Royal wench!<lb/>
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:<lb/>
He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>I saw her once<lb/>
Hop forty paces through the public street;<lb/>
And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,<lb/>
That she did make defect perfection,<lb/>
And, breathless, power breathe forth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>Now Antony must leave her utterly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Never; he will not:<lb/>
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale<lb/>
Her infinite variety: other women cloy<lb/>
The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry<lb/>
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things<lb/>
Become themselves in her: that the holy priests<lb/>
Bless her when she is riggish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle<lb/>
The heart of Antony, Octavia is<lb/>
A blessed lottery to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Let us go.<lb/>
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest<lb/>
Whilst you abide here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Humbly, sir, I thank you.<lb/>

Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>Caesar's.<lb/>
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:<lb/>
Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is<lb/>
Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,<lb/>
Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel<lb/>
Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore<lb/>
Make space enough between you.<lb/>

<p>Well, go to, I will;<lb/>
But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony<lb/>
Be free and healthful,&mdash;so tart a favour<lb/>
To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,<lb/>
Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,<lb/>
Not like a formal man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Will't please you hear me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:<lb/>
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,<lb/>
Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,<lb/>
I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail<lb/>
Rich pearls upon thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Madam, he's well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Well said.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>And friends with Caesar.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Thou'rt an honest man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Make thee a fortune from me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>But yet, madam,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay<lb/>
The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!<lb/>
'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth<lb/>
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,<lb/>
Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,<lb/>
The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:<lb/>
In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Free, madam! no; I made no such report:<lb/>
He's bound unto Octavia.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>For what good turn?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>For the best turn i' the bed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I am pale, Charmian.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Madam, he's married to Octavia.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>The most infectious pestilence upon thee!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Strikes him down</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Good madam, patience.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>What say you? Hence,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Strikes him again</stage></p>


<p>
Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes<lb/>
Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>She hales him up and down</stage></p>


<p>
Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,<lb/>
Smarting in lingering pickle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Gracious madam,<lb/>
I that do bring the news made not the match.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,<lb/>
And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst<lb/>
Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;<lb/>
And I will boot thee with what gift beside<lb/>
Thy modesty can beg.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>He's married, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Rogue, thou hast lived too long.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Draws a knife</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Nay, then I'll run.<lb/>
What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:<lb/>
The man is innocent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.<lb/>
Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures<lb/>
Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:<lb/>
Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>He is afeard to come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I will not hurt him.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit CHARMIAN</stage></p>


<p>
These hands do lack nobility, that they strike<lb/>
A meaner than myself; since I myself<lb/>
Have given myself the cause.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger</stage></p>


<p>
Come hither, sir.<lb/>
Though it be honest, it is never good<lb/>
To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.<lb/>
An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell<lb/>
Themselves when they be felt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>I have done my duty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Is he married?<lb/>
I cannot hate thee worser than I do,<lb/>
If thou again say 'Yes.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>He's married, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Should I lie, madam?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O, I would thou didst,<lb/>
So half my Egypt were submerged and made<lb/>
A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:<lb/>
Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me<lb/>
Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>I crave your highness' pardon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>He is married?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Take no offence that I would not offend you:<lb/>
To punish me for what you make me do.<lb/>
Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,<lb/>
That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:<lb/>
The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome<lb/>
Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,<lb/>
And be undone by 'em!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Good your highness, patience.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Many times, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I am paid for't now.<lb/>
Lead me from hence:<lb/>
I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.<lb/>
Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him<lb/>
Report the feature of Octavia, her years,<lb/>
Her inclination, let him not leave out<lb/>
The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit ALEXAS</stage></p>


<p>
Let him for ever go:&mdash;let him not&mdash;Charmian,<lb/>
Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,<lb/>
The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To MARDIAN</stage></p>


<p>
Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,<lb/>
But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.<lb/>

<head>Scene 6</head>

<p><stage>Near Misenum.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,	with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR,	MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS,	with Soldiers marching</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Your hostages I have, so have you mine;<lb/>
And we shall talk before we fight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Most meet<lb/>
That first we come to words; and therefore have we<lb/>
Our written purposes before us sent;<lb/>
Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know<lb/>
If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,<lb/>
And carry back to Sicily much tall youth<lb/>
That else must perish here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>To you all three,<lb/>
The senators alone of this great world,<lb/>
Chief factors for the gods, I do not know<lb/>
Wherefore my father should revengers want,<lb/>
Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,<lb/>
Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,<lb/>
There saw you labouring for him. What was't<lb/>
That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what<lb/>
Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,<lb/>
With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,<lb/>
To drench the Capitol; but that they would<lb/>
Have one man but a man? And that is it<lb/>
Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen<lb/>
The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant<lb/>
To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome<lb/>
Cast on my noble father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Take your time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;<lb/>
We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st<lb/>
How much we do o'er-count thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>At land, indeed,<lb/>
Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:<lb/>
But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,<lb/>
Remain in't as thou mayst.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Be pleased to tell us&mdash;<lb/>
For this is from the present&mdash;how you take<lb/>
The offers we have sent you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>There's the point.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Which do not be entreated to, but weigh<lb/>
What it is worth embraced.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>And what may follow,<lb/>
To try a larger fortune.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>You have made me offer<lb/>
Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must<lb/>
Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send<lb/>
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon<lb/>
To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back<lb/>
Our targes undinted.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>That's our offer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Know, then,<lb/>
I came before you here a man prepared<lb/>
To take this offer: but Mark Antony<lb/>
Put me to some impatience: though I lose<lb/>
The praise of it by telling, you must know,<lb/>
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,<lb/>
Your mother came to Sicily and did find<lb/>
Her welcome friendly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I have heard it, Pompey;<lb/>
And am well studied for a liberal thanks<lb/>
Which I do owe you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Let me have your hand:<lb/>
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,<lb/>
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;<lb/>
For I have gain'd by 't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Since I saw you last,<lb/>
There is a change upon you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Well, I know not<lb/>
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;<lb/>
But in my bosom shall she never come,<lb/>
To make my heart her vassal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Well met here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:<lb/>
I crave our composition may be written,<lb/>
And seal'd between us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>That's the next to do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's<lb/>
Draw lots who shall begin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>That will I, Pompey.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>No, Antony, take the lot: but, first<lb/>
Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery<lb/>
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar<lb/>
Grew fat with feasting there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>You have heard much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>I have fair meanings, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>And fair words to them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Then so much have I heard:<lb/>
And I have heard, Apollodorus carried&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>No more of that: he did so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>What, I pray you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Well;<lb/>
And well am like to do; for, I perceive,<lb/>
Four feasts are toward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Let me shake thy hand;<lb/>
I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,<lb/>
When I have envied thy behavior.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,<lb/>
When you have well deserved ten times as much<lb/>
As I have said you did.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Enjoy thy plainness,<lb/>
It nothing ill becomes thee.<lb/>
Aboard my galley I invite you all:<lb/>
Will you lead, lords?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Show us the way, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Come.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have<lb/>
made this treaty.&mdash;You and I have known, sir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>At sea, I think.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>We have, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>You have done well by water.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>And you by land.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>I will praise any man that will praise me; though it<lb/>
cannot be denied what I have done by land.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>Nor what I have done by water.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Yes, something you can deny for your own<lb/>
safety: you have been a great thief by sea.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>And you by land.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>There I deny my land service. But give me your<lb/>
hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they<lb/>
might take two thieves kissing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>But there is never a fair woman has a true face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>No slander; they steal hearts.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>We came hither to fight with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.<lb/>
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony<lb/>
here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Caesar's sister is called Octavia.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>Pray ye, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would<lb/>
not prophesy so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>I think the policy of that purpose made more in the<lb/>
marriage than the love of the parties.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>I think so too. But you shall find, the band that<lb/>
seems to tie their friendship together will be the<lb/>
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a<lb/>
holy, cold, and still conversation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>Who would not have his wife so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.<lb/>
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the<lb/>
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as<lb/>
I said before, that which is the strength of their<lb/>
amity shall prove the immediate author of their<lb/>
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:<lb/>
he married but his occasion here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?<lb/>
I have a health for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>Come, let's away.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 7</head>

<p><stage>On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with	a banquet</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are<lb/>
ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world<lb/>
will blow them down.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Servant</speaker>
<p>Lepidus is high-coloured.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>They have made him drink alms-drink.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Servant</speaker>
<p>As they pinch one another by the disposition, he<lb/>
cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his<lb/>
entreaty, and himself to the drink.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>But it raises the greater war between him and<lb/>
his discretion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Servant</speaker>
<p>Why, this is to have a name in great men's<lb/>
fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do<lb/>
me no service as a partisan I could not heave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen<lb/>
to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,<lb/>
which pitifully disaster the cheeks.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK	ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS,	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p><stage>[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]</stage></p><p>  Thus do they, sir: they take<lb/>
the flow o' the Nile<lb/>
By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,<lb/>
By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth<lb/>
Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,<lb/>
The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman<lb/>
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,<lb/>
And shortly comes to harvest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>You've strange serpents there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Ay, Lepidus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the<lb/>
operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>They are so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Sit,&mdash;and some wine! A health to Lepidus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'<lb/>
pyramises are very goodly things; without<lb/>
contradiction, I have heard that.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to POMPEY]</stage></p><p>  Pompey, a word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to MENAS]</stage></p><p>                 Say in mine ear:<lb/>
what is't?<lb/>

thee, captain,<lb/>
And hear me speak a word.<lb/>

This wine for Lepidus!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>What manner o' thing is your crocodile?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad<lb/>
as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,<lb/>
and moves with its own organs: it lives by that<lb/>
which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of<lb/>
it, it transmigrates.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>What colour is it of?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Of it own colour too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis a strange serpent.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Will this description satisfy him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a<lb/>
very epicure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to MENAS]</stage></p><p>  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of<lb/>
that? away!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?<lb/>
Be jolly, lords.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>These quick-sands, Lepidus,<lb/>
Keep off them, for you sink.<lb/>

<p>Wilt thou be lord of all the world?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>

And, though thou think me poor, I am the man<lb/>
Will give thee all the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Hast thou drunk well?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.<lb/>
Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:<lb/>
Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,<lb/>
Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Show me which way.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>These three world-sharers, these competitors,<lb/>
Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;<lb/>
And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:<lb/>
All there is thine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Ah, this thou shouldst have done,<lb/>
And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;<lb/>
In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,<lb/>
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;<lb/>
Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue<lb/>
Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,<lb/>
I should have found it afterwards well done;<lb/>
But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  For this,<lb/>
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.<lb/>
Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,<lb/>
Shall never find it more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>This health to Lepidus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Here's to thee, Menas!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>Enobarbus, welcome!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Fill till the cup be hid.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>There's a strong fellow, Menas.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>Why?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st<lb/>
not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,<lb/>
That it might go on wheels!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Drink thou; increase the reels.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>Come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?<lb/>
Here is to Caesar!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>I could well forbear't.<lb/>
It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,<lb/>
And it grows fouler.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Be a child o' the time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Possess it, I'll make answer:<lb/>
But I had rather fast from all four days<lb/>
Than drink so much in one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Ha, my brave emperor!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To MARK ANTONY</stage></p>


<p>
Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,<lb/>
And celebrate our drink?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>Let's ha't, good soldier.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Come, let's all take hands,<lb/>
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense<lb/>
In soft and delicate Lethe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>All take hands.<lb/>
Make battery to our ears with the loud music:<lb/>
The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;<lb/>
The holding every man shall bear as loud<lb/>
As his strong sides can volley.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them	hand in hand</stage></p>


<p>
THE SONG.<lb/>

Come, thou monarch of the vine,<lb/>
Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!<lb/>
In thy fats our cares be drown'd,<lb/>
With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:<lb/>
Cup us, till the world go round,<lb/>
Cup us, till the world go round!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,<lb/>
Let me request you off: our graver business<lb/>
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;<lb/>
You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb<lb/>
Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue<lb/>
Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost<lb/>
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.<lb/>
Good Antony, your hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>I'll try you on the shore.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>And shall, sir; give's your hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POMPEY</speaker>
<p>O Antony,<lb/>
You have my father's house,&mdash;But, what? we are friends.<lb/>
Come, down into the boat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Take heed you fall not.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS</stage></p>


<p>
Menas, I'll not on shore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENAS</speaker>
<p>No, to my cabin.<lb/>
These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!<lb/>
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell<lb/>
To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sound a flourish, with drums</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>

<p><stage>A plain in Syria.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,	and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead	body of PACORUS borne before him</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>VENTIDIUS</speaker>
<p>Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now<lb/>
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death<lb/>
Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body<lb/>
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,<lb/>
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILIUS</speaker>
<p>Noble Ventidius,<lb/>
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,<lb/>
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,<lb/>
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither<lb/>
The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony<lb/>
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and<lb/>
Put garlands on thy head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VENTIDIUS</speaker>
<p>O Silius, Silius,<lb/>
I have done enough; a lower place, note well,<lb/>
May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;<lb/>
Better to leave undone, than by our deed<lb/>
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.<lb/>
Caesar and Antony have ever won<lb/>
More in their officer than person: Sossius,<lb/>
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,<lb/>
For quick accumulation of renown,<lb/>
Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.<lb/>
Who does i' the wars more than his captain can<lb/>
Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,<lb/>
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,<lb/>
Than gain which darkens him.<lb/>
I could do more to do Antonius good,<lb/>
But 'twould offend him; and in his offence<lb/>
Should my performance perish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILIUS</speaker>
<p>Thou hast, Ventidius,<lb/>
that<lb/>
Without the which a soldier, and his sword,<lb/>
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VENTIDIUS</speaker>
<p>I'll humbly signify what in his name,<lb/>
That magical word of war, we have effected;<lb/>
How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,<lb/>
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia<lb/>
We have jaded out o' the field.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SILIUS</speaker>
<p>Where is he now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VENTIDIUS</speaker>
<p>He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste<lb/>
The weight we must convey with's will permit,<lb/>
We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>What, are the brothers parted?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;<lb/>
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps<lb/>
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,<lb/>
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled<lb/>
With the green sickness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>'Tis a noble Lepidus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:<lb/>
Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,<lb/>
poets, cannot<lb/>
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!<lb/>
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,<lb/>
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.<lb/>

<p>No further, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>You take from me a great part of myself;<lb/>
Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife<lb/>
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band<lb/>

Let not the piece of virtue, which is set<lb/>
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,<lb/>
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter<lb/>
The fortress of it; for better might we<lb/>
Have loved without this mean, if on both parts<lb/>
This be not cherish'd.<lb/>

<p>I have said.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>You shall not find,<lb/>
Though you be therein curious, the least cause<lb/>
For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,<lb/>
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!<lb/>
We will here part.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>

troubled with a rheum;<lb/>

<p>No, sweet Octavia,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Madam, in Rome;<lb/>

Between her brother and Mark Antony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>She is not, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>That's not so good: he cannot like her long.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!<lb/>
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,<lb/>
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>She creeps:<lb/>
Her motion and her station are as one;<lb/>
She shows a body rather than a life,<lb/>
A statue than a breather.<lb/>

<p>For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.<lb/>
Her hair, what colour?<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,&mdash;<lb/>
That were excusable, that, and thousands more<lb/>
Of semblable import,&mdash;but he hath waged<lb/>
New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it<lb/>
To public ear:<lb/>
Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not<lb/>
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly<lb/>
He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:<lb/>
When the best hint was given him, he not took't,<lb/>
Or did it from his teeth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
<p>O my good lord,<lb/>
Believe not all; or, if you must believe,<lb/>
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,<lb/>
If this division chance, ne'er stood between,<lb/>
Praying for both parts:<lb/>
The good gods me presently,<lb/>
When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'<lb/>
Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,<lb/>
'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,<lb/>
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway<lb/>
'Twixt these extremes at all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Gentle Octavia,<lb/>
Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks<lb/>
Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,<lb/>
I lose myself: better I were not yours<lb/>
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,<lb/>
Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,<lb/>
I'll raise the preparation of a war<lb/>
Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;<lb/>
So your desires are yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
<p>Thanks to my lord.<lb/>
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,<lb/>
Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be<lb/>
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men<lb/>
Should solder up the rift.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>When it appears to you where this begins,<lb/>
Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults<lb/>
Can never be so equal, that your love<lb/>
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;<lb/>
Choose your own company, and command what cost<lb/>
Your heart has mind to.<lb/>

<p>Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst<lb/>
Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let<lb/>
him partake in the glory of the action: and not<lb/>
resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly<lb/>
wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so<lb/>
the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.<lb/>

<p><stage>Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,<lb/>
In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:<lb/>
I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,<lb/>
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold<lb/>
Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat<lb/>
Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,<lb/>
And all the unlawful issue that their lust<lb/>
Since then hath made between them. Unto her<lb/>
He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her<lb/>
Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,<lb/>
Absolute queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>This in the public eye?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>I' the common show-place, where they exercise.<lb/>
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:<lb/>
Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.<lb/>
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd<lb/>
Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she<lb/>
In the habiliments of the goddess Isis<lb/>
That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,<lb/>
As 'tis reported, so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>Let Rome be thus Inform'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Who, queasy with his insolence<lb/>
Already, will their good thoughts call from him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>The people know it; and have now received<lb/>
His accusations.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Who does he accuse?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Caesar: and that, having in Sicily<lb/>
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him<lb/>
His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me<lb/>
Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets<lb/>
That Lepidus of the triumvirate<lb/>
Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain<lb/>
All his revenue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Sir, this should be answer'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.<lb/>
I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;<lb/>
That he his high authority abused,<lb/>
And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,<lb/>
I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,<lb/>
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I<lb/>
Demand the like.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>He'll never yield to that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Nor must not then be yielded to in this.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter OCTAVIA with her train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
<p>Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>That ever I should call thee castaway!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
<p>You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not<lb/>
Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony<lb/>
Should have an army for an usher, and<lb/>
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach<lb/>
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way<lb/>
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,<lb/>
Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust<lb/>
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,<lb/>
Raised by your populous troops: but you are come<lb/>
A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented<lb/>
The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,<lb/>
Is often left unloved; we should have met you<lb/>
By sea and land; supplying every stage<lb/>
With an augmented greeting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
<p>Good my lord,<lb/>
To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did<lb/>
On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,<lb/>
Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted<lb/>
My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd<lb/>
His pardon for return.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Which soon he granted,<lb/>
Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
<p>Do not say so, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>I have eyes upon him,<lb/>
And his affairs come to me on the wind.<lb/>
Where is he now?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
<p>My lord, in Athens.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra<lb/>
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire<lb/>
Up to a whore; who now are levying<lb/>
The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled<lb/>
Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,<lb/>
Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king<lb/>
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;<lb/>
King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;<lb/>
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king<lb/>
Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,<lb/>
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,<lb/>
With a more larger list of sceptres.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
<p>Ay me, most wretched,<lb/>
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends<lb/>
That do afflict each other!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Welcome hither:<lb/>
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;<lb/>
Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,<lb/>
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;<lb/>
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives<lb/>
O'er your content these strong necessities;<lb/>
But let determined things to destiny<lb/>
Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;<lb/>
Nothing more dear to me. You are abused<lb/>
Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,<lb/>
To do you justice, make them ministers<lb/>
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;<lb/>
And ever welcome to us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>Welcome, lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>Welcome, dear madam.<lb/>
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:<lb/>
Only the adulterous Antony, most large<lb/>
In his abominations, turns you off;<lb/>
And gives his potent regiment to a trull,<lb/>
That noises it against us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIA</speaker>
<p>Is it so, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,<lb/>
Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!<lb/>

<p><stage>Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I will be even with thee, doubt it not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>But why, why, why?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,<lb/>
And say'st it is not fit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Well, is it, is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>If not denounced against us, why should not we<lb/>
Be there in person?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Well, I could reply:<lb/>
If we should serve with horse and mares together,<lb/>
The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear<lb/>
A soldier and his horse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>What is't you say?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;<lb/>
Take from his heart, take from his brain,<lb/>
from's time,<lb/>
What should not then be spared. He is already<lb/>
Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome<lb/>
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids<lb/>
Manage this war.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Sink Rome, and their tongues rot<lb/>
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,<lb/>
And, as the president of my kingdom, will<lb/>
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:<lb/>
I will not stay behind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, I have done.<lb/>
Here comes the emperor.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Is it not strange, Canidius,<lb/>
That from Tarentum and Brundusium<lb/>
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,<lb/>
And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Celerity is never more admired<lb/>
Than by the negligent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>A good rebuke,<lb/>
Which might have well becomed the best of men,<lb/>
To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we<lb/>
Will fight with him by sea.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>By sea! what else?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CANIDIUS</speaker>
<p>Why will my lord do so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>For that he dares us to't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>So hath my lord dared him to single fight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CANIDIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.<lb/>
Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,<lb/>
Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;<lb/>
And so should you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Your ships are not well mann'd;<lb/>
Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people<lb/>
Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet<lb/>
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:<lb/>
Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace<lb/>
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,<lb/>
Being prepared for land.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>By sea, by sea.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Most worthy sir, you therein throw away<lb/>
The absolute soldiership you have by land;<lb/>
Distract your army, which doth most consist<lb/>
Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted<lb/>
Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego<lb/>
The way which promises assurance; and<lb/>
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,<lb/>
From firm security.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I'll fight at sea.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Our overplus of shipping will we burn;<lb/>
And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium<lb/>
Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,<lb/>
We then can do't at land.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage></p>


<p>
Thy business?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>The news is true, my lord; he is descried;<lb/>
Caesar has taken Toryne.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;<lb/>
Strange that power should be. Canidius,<lb/>
Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,<lb/>
And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:<lb/>
Away, my Thetis!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Soldier</stage></p>


<p>
How now, worthy soldier?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soldier</speaker>
<p>O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;<lb/>
Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt<lb/>
This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians<lb/>
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we<lb/>
Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,<lb/>
And fighting foot to foot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Well, well: away!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS	ENOBARBUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soldier</speaker>
<p>By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CANIDIUS</speaker>
<p>Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows<lb/>
Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,<lb/>
And we are women's men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soldier</speaker>
<p>You keep by land<lb/>
The legions and the horse whole, do you not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CANIDIUS</speaker>
<p>Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,<lb/>
Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:<lb/>
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's<lb/>
Carries beyond belief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soldier</speaker>
<p>While he was yet in Rome,<lb/>
His power went out in such distractions as<lb/>
Beguiled all spies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CANIDIUS</speaker>
<p>Who's his lieutenant, hear you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soldier</speaker>
<p>They say, one Taurus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CANIDIUS</speaker>

<p>Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and<lb/>
Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,<lb/>
He lessens his requests; and to thee sues<lb/>
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,<lb/>
A private man in Athens: this for him.<lb/>
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;<lb/>
Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves<lb/>
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,<lb/>
Now hazarded to thy grace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>For Antony,<lb/>
I have no ears to his request. The queen<lb/>
Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she<lb/>
From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,<lb/>
Or take his life there: this if she perform,<lb/>
She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EUPHRONIUS</speaker>
<p>Fortune pursue thee!<lb/>

	<stage>[To THYREUS]</stage></p><p>  To try eloquence, now 'tis time: dispatch;<lb/>
From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,<lb/>
And in our name, what she requires; add more,<lb/>
From thine invention, offers: women are not<lb/>
In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure<lb/>
The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;<lb/>
Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we<lb/>
Will answer as a law.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>Caesar, I go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,<lb/>
And what thou think'st his very action speaks<lb/>
In every power that moves.<lb/>

<p><stage>Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>What shall we do, Enobarbus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Think, and die.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Is Antony or we in fault for this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Antony only, that would make his will<lb/>
Lord of his reason. What though you fled<lb/>
From that great face of war, whose several ranges<lb/>
Frighted each other? why should he follow?<lb/>
The itch of his affection should not then<lb/>
Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,<lb/>
When half to half the world opposed, he being<lb/>
The meered question: 'twas a shame no less<lb/>
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,<lb/>
And leave his navy gazing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Prithee, peace.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Is that his answer?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EUPHRONIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>The queen shall then have courtesy, so she<lb/>
Will yield us up.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EUPHRONIUS</speaker>
<p>He says so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Let her know't.<lb/>
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,<lb/>
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim<lb/>
With principalities.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>That head, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>To him again: tell him he wears the rose<lb/>
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note<lb/>
Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,<lb/>
May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail<lb/>
Under the service of a child as soon<lb/>
As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore<lb/>
To lay his gay comparisons apart,<lb/>
And answer me declined, sword against sword,<lb/>
Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will<lb/>
Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,<lb/>
Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are<lb/>
A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward<lb/>
Do draw the inward quality after them,<lb/>
To suffer all alike. That he should dream,<lb/>
Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will<lb/>
Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued<lb/>
His judgment too.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter an Attendant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Attendant</speaker>
<p>A messenger from CAESAR.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>What, no more ceremony? See, my women!<lb/>
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose<lb/>
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Attendant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Mine honesty and I begin to square.<lb/>
The loyalty well held to fools does make<lb/>
Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure<lb/>
To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord<lb/>
Does conquer him that did his master conquer<lb/>
And earns a place i' the story.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter THYREUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Caesar's will?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>Hear it apart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>None but friends: say boldly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>So, haply, are they friends to Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;<lb/>
Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master<lb/>
Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,<lb/>
Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>So.<lb/>
Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,<lb/>
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,<lb/>
Further than he is Caesar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Go on: right royal.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>He knows that you embrace not Antony<lb/>
As you did love, but as you fear'd him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>The scars upon your honour, therefore, he<lb/>
Does pity, as constrained blemishes,<lb/>
Not as deserved.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>He is a god, and knows<lb/>
What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,<lb/>
But conquer'd merely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>             To be sure of that,<lb/>
I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,<lb/>
That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for<lb/>
Thy dearest quit thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>Shall I say to Caesar<lb/>
What you require of him? for he partly begs<lb/>
To be desired to give. It much would please him,<lb/>
That of his fortunes you should make a staff<lb/>
To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,<lb/>
To hear from me you had left Antony,<lb/>
And put yourself under his shrowd,<lb/>
The universal landlord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>What's your name?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>My name is Thyreus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Most kind messenger,<lb/>
Say to great Caesar this: in deputation<lb/>
I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt<lb/>
To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:<lb/>
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear<lb/>
The doom of Egypt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis your noblest course.<lb/>
Wisdom and fortune combating together,<lb/>
If that the former dare but what it can,<lb/>
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay<lb/>
My duty on your hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Your Caesar's father oft,<lb/>
When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,<lb/>
Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,<lb/>
As it rain'd kisses.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Favours, by Jove that thunders!<lb/>
What art thou, fellow?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>One that but performs<lb/>
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest<lb/>
To have command obey'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>               You will be whipp'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods<lb/>
and devils!<lb/>
Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'<lb/>
Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,<lb/>
And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am<lb/>
Antony yet.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Attendants</stage></p>


<p>
Take hence this Jack, and whip him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp<lb/>
Than with an old one dying.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Moon and stars!<lb/>
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries<lb/>
That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them<lb/>
So saucy with the hand of she here,&mdash;what's her name,<lb/>
Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,<lb/>
Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,<lb/>
And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THYREUS</speaker>
<p>Mark Antony!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Tug him away: being whipp'd,<lb/>
Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall<lb/>
Bear us an errand to him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS</stage></p>


<p>
You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!<lb/>
Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,<lb/>
Forborne the getting of a lawful race,<lb/>
And by a gem of women, to be abused<lb/>
By one that looks on feeders?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Good my lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>You have been a boggler ever:<lb/>
But when we in our viciousness grow hard&mdash;<lb/>
O misery on't!&mdash;the wise gods seel our eyes;<lb/>
In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us<lb/>
Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut<lb/>
To our confusion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O, is't come to this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I found you as a morsel cold upon<lb/>
Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment<lb/>
Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,<lb/>
Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have<lb/>
Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,<lb/>
Though you can guess what temperance should be,<lb/>
You know not what it is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Wherefore is this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>To let a fellow that will take rewards<lb/>
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with<lb/>
My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal<lb/>
And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were<lb/>
Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar<lb/>
The horned herd! for I have savage cause;<lb/>
And to proclaim it civilly, were like<lb/>
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank<lb/>
For being yare about him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS</stage></p>


<p>
Is he whipp'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Attendant</speaker>
<p>Soundly, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Attendant</speaker>
<p>He did ask favour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>If that thy father live, let him repent<lb/>
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry<lb/>
To follow Caesar in his triumph, since<lb/>
Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth<lb/>
The white hand of a lady fever thee,<lb/>
Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,<lb/>
Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say<lb/>
He makes me angry with him; for he seems<lb/>
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,<lb/>
Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;<lb/>
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,<lb/>
When my good stars, that were my former guides,<lb/>
Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires<lb/>
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike<lb/>
My speech and what is done, tell him he has<lb/>
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom<lb/>
He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,<lb/>
As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:<lb/>
Hence with thy stripes, begone!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit THYREUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Have you done yet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Alack, our terrene moon<lb/>
Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone<lb/>
The fall of Antony!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I must stay his time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes<lb/>
With one that ties his points?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Not know me yet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Cold-hearted toward me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Ah, dear, if I be so,<lb/>
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,<lb/>
And poison it in the source; and the first stone<lb/>
Drop in my neck: as it determines, so<lb/>
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!<lb/>
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,<lb/>
Together with my brave Egyptians all,<lb/>
By the discandying of this pelleted storm,<lb/>
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile<lb/>
Have buried them for prey!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I am satisfied.<lb/>
Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where<lb/>
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land<lb/>
Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too<lb/>
Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.<lb/>
Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?<lb/>
If from the field I shall return once more<lb/>
To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;<lb/>
I and my sword will earn our chronicle:<lb/>
There's hope in't yet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>That's my brave lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,<lb/>
And fight maliciously: for when mine hours<lb/>
Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives<lb/>
Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,<lb/>
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,<lb/>
Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me<lb/>
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;<lb/>
Let's mock the midnight bell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>It is my birth-day:<lb/>
I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord<lb/>
Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>We will yet do well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Call all his noble captains to my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force<lb/>
The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;<lb/>
There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,<lb/>
I'll make death love me; for I will contend<lb/>
Even with his pestilent scythe.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</stage></p>

</sp><sp><speaker>DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS</speaker>
<p>Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,<lb/>
Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood<lb/>
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,<lb/>
A diminution in our captain's brain<lb/>
Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,<lb/>
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek<lb/>
Some way to leave him.<lb/>

My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled<lb/>
With thine entirely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!<lb/>
She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARDIAN</speaker>
<p>Death of one person can be paid but once,<lb/>
And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do<lb/>
Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake<lb/>
Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'<lb/>
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break<lb/>
The name of Antony; it was divided<lb/>
Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,<lb/>
Thy name so buried in her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Dead, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARDIAN</speaker>
<p>Dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,<lb/>
And we must sleep.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To MARDIAN</stage></p>


<p>
That thou depart'st hence safe,<lb/>
Does pay thy labour richly; go.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit MARDIAN</stage></p>


<p>
Off, pluck off:<lb/>
The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep<lb/>
The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!<lb/>
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,<lb/>
Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.<lb/>
No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;<lb/>
You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit EROS</stage></p>


<p>
I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and<lb/>
Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now<lb/>
All length is torture: since the torch is out,<lb/>
Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour<lb/>
Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles<lb/>
Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.<lb/>
Eros!&mdash;I come, my queen:&mdash;Eros!&mdash;Stay for me:<lb/>
Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,<lb/>
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:<lb/>
Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,<lb/>
And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter EROS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EROS</speaker>
<p>What would my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Since Cleopatra died,<lb/>
I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods<lb/>
Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword<lb/>
Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back<lb/>
With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack<lb/>
The courage of a woman; less noble mind<lb/>
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells<lb/>
'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,<lb/>
That, when the exigent should come, which now<lb/>
Is come indeed, when I should see behind me<lb/>
The inevitable prosecution of<lb/>
Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,<lb/>
Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:<lb/>
Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.<lb/>
Put colour in thy cheek.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EROS</speaker>
<p>The gods withhold me!<lb/>
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,<lb/>
Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Eros,<lb/>
Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see<lb/>
Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down<lb/>
His corrigible neck, his face subdued<lb/>
To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat<lb/>
Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded<lb/>
His baseness that ensued?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EROS</speaker>
<p>I would not see't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.<lb/>
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn<lb/>
Most useful for thy country.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EROS</speaker>
<p>O, sir, pardon me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then<lb/>
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;<lb/>
Or thy precedent services are all<lb/>
But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EROS</speaker>
<p>Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,<lb/>
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Lo thee!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Turning from him</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EROS</speaker>
<p>My sword is drawn.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Then let it do at once<lb/>
The thing why thou hast drawn it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EROS</speaker>
<p>My dear master,<lb/>
My captain, and my emperor, let me say,<lb/>
Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>'Tis said, man; and farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EROS</speaker>
<p>Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Now, Eros.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EROS</speaker>
<p>Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow<lb/>
Of Antony's death.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kills himself</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Thrice-nobler than myself!<lb/>
Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what<lb/>
I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros<lb/>
Have by their brave instruction got upon me<lb/>
A nobleness in record: but I will be<lb/>
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't<lb/>
As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,<lb/>
Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Falling on his sword</stage></p>


<p>
I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?<lb/>
The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DERCETAS and Guard</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Guard</speaker>
<p>What's the noise?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end<lb/>
Of what I have begun.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Guard</speaker>
<p>The star is fall'n.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Guard</speaker>
<p>And time is at his period.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Alas, and woe!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Let him that loves me strike me dead.<lb/>

<p>Not I.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Guard</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERCETAS</speaker>
<p>Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.<lb/>
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,<lb/>
Shall enter me with him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DIOMEDES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Where's Antony?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERCETAS</speaker>
<p>There, Diomed there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Lives he?<lb/>
Wilt thou not answer, man?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit DERCETAS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me<lb/>
Sufficing strokes for death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Most absolute lord,<lb/>
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>When did she send thee?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Now, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Where is she?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear<lb/>
Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw&mdash;<lb/>
Which never shall be found&mdash;you did suspect<lb/>
She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage<lb/>
Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;<lb/>
But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent<lb/>
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,<lb/>
I dread, too late.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!<lb/>
Come, your lord calls!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;<lb/>
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Guard</speaker>
<p>Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear<lb/>
All your true followers out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Most heavy day!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate<lb/>
To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome<lb/>
Which comes to punish us, and we punish it<lb/>
Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:<lb/>
I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,<lb/>
And have my thanks for all.<lb/>

<p>Be comforted, dear madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>No, I will not:<lb/>
All strange and terrible events are welcome,<lb/>
But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,<lb/>
Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great<lb/>
As that which makes it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter, below, DIOMEDES</stage></p>


<p>
How now! is he dead?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>His death's upon him, but not dead.<lb/>
Look out o' the other side your monument;<lb/>
His guard have brought him thither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O sun,<lb/>
Burn the great sphere thou movest in!<lb/>
darkling stand<lb/>
The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,<lb/>
Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;<lb/>
Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Peace!<lb/>
Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,<lb/>
But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>So it should be, that none but Antony<lb/>
Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I am dying, Egypt, dying; only<lb/>
I here importune death awhile, until<lb/>
Of many thousand kisses the poor last<lb/>
I lay up thy lips.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I dare not, dear,&mdash;<lb/>
Dear my lord, pardon,&mdash;I dare not,<lb/>
Lest I be taken: not the imperious show<lb/>
Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall<lb/>
Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,<lb/>
serpents, have<lb/>
Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:<lb/>
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes<lb/>
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour<lb/>
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,&mdash;<lb/>
Help me, my women,&mdash;we must draw thee up:<lb/>
Assist, good friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>O, quick, or I am gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!<lb/>
Our strength is all gone into heaviness,<lb/>
That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,<lb/>
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,<lb/>
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,&mdash;<lb/>
Wishes were ever fools,&mdash;O, come, come, come;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA</stage></p>


<p>
And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:<lb/>
Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,<lb/>
Thus would I wear them out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>A heavy sight!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I am dying, Egypt, dying:<lb/>
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,<lb/>
That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,<lb/>
Provoked by my offence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>One word, sweet queen:<lb/>
Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>They do not go together.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Gentle, hear me:<lb/>
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>My resolution and my hands I'll trust;<lb/>
None about Caesar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARK ANTONY</speaker>
<p>The miserable change now at my end<lb/>
Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts<lb/>
In feeding them with those my former fortunes<lb/>
Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,<lb/>
The noblest; and do now not basely die,<lb/>
Not cowardly put off my helmet to<lb/>
My countryman,&mdash;a Roman by a Roman<lb/>
Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;<lb/>
I can no more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Noblest of men, woo't die?<lb/>
Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide<lb/>
In this dull world, which in thy absence is<lb/>
No better than a sty? O, see, my women,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>MARK ANTONY dies</stage></p>


<p>
The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!<lb/>
O, wither'd is the garland of the war,<lb/>
The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls<lb/>
Are level now with men; the odds is gone,<lb/>
And there is nothing left remarkable<lb/>
Beneath the visiting moon.<lb/>

<p>Peace, peace, Iras!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded<lb/>
By such poor passion as the maid that milks<lb/>
And does the meanest chares. It were for me<lb/>
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;<lb/>
To tell them that this world did equal theirs<lb/>
Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;<lb/>
Patience is scottish, and impatience does<lb/>
Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin<lb/>
To rush into the secret house of death,<lb/>
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?<lb/>
What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!<lb/>
My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,<lb/>
Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:<lb/>
We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,<lb/>
what's noble,<lb/>
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,<lb/>
And make death proud to take us. Come, away:<lb/>
This case of that huge spirit now is cold:<lb/>
Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend<lb/>
But resolution, and the briefest end.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest<lb/>
Appear thus to us?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERCETAS</speaker>
<p>I am call'd Dercetas;<lb/>
Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy<lb/>
Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,<lb/>
He was my master; and I wore my life<lb/>
To spend upon his haters. If thou please<lb/>
To take me to thee, as I was to him<lb/>
I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,<lb/>
I yield thee up my life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>What is't thou say'st?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERCETAS</speaker>
<p>I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>The breaking of so great a thing should make<lb/>
A greater crack: the round world<lb/>
Should have shook lions into civil streets,<lb/>
And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony<lb/>
Is not a single doom; in the name lay<lb/>
A moiety of the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERCETAS</speaker>
<p>He is dead, Caesar:<lb/>
Not by a public minister of justice,<lb/>
Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,<lb/>
Which writ his honour in the acts it did,<lb/>
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,<lb/>
Splitted the heart. This is his sword;<lb/>
I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd<lb/>
With his most noble blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Look you sad, friends?<lb/>
The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings<lb/>
To wash the eyes of kings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>

That nature must compel us to lament<lb/>
Our most persisted deeds.<lb/>

<p>His taints and honours<lb/>
Waged equal with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGRIPPA</speaker>
<p>A rarer spirit never<lb/>
Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us<lb/>
Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MECAENAS</speaker>
<p>When such a spacious mirror's set before him,<lb/>
He needs must see himself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>O Antony!<lb/>
I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance<lb/>
Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce<lb/>
Have shown to thee such a declining day,<lb/>
Or look on thine; we could not stall together<lb/>
In the whole world: but yet let me lament,<lb/>
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,<lb/>
That thou, my brother, my competitor<lb/>
In top of all design, my mate in empire,<lb/>
Friend and companion in the front of war,<lb/>
The arm of mine own body, and the heart<lb/>
Where mine his thoughts did kindle,&mdash;that our stars,<lb/>
Unreconciliable, should divide<lb/>
Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends&mdash;<lb/>
But I will tell you at some meeter season:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter an Egyptian</stage></p>


<p>
The business of this man looks out of him;<lb/>
We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Egyptian</speaker>
<p>A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,<lb/>
Confined in all she has, her monument,<lb/>
Of thy intents desires instruction,<lb/>
That she preparedly may frame herself<lb/>
To the way she's forced to.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Bid her have good heart:<lb/>
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,<lb/>
How honourable and how kindly we<lb/>
Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live<lb/>
To be ungentle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Egyptian</speaker>
<p>So the gods preserve thee!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,<lb/>
We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts<lb/>
The quality of her passion shall require,<lb/>
Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke<lb/>
She do defeat us; for her life in Rome<lb/>
Would be eternal in our triumph: go,<lb/>
And with your speediest bring us what she says,<lb/>
And how you find of her.<lb/>

Go with me to my tent; where you shall see<lb/>
How hardly I was drawn into this war;<lb/>
How calm and gentle I proceeded still<lb/>
In all my writings: go with me, and see<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>My desolation does begin to make<lb/>
A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;<lb/>
Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,<lb/>
A minister of her will: and it is great<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Antony<lb/>
Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but<lb/>
I do not greatly care to be deceived,<lb/>
That have no use for trusting. If your master<lb/>
Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,<lb/>
That majesty, to keep decorum, must<lb/>
No less beg than a kingdom: if he please<lb/>
To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,<lb/>
He gives me so much of mine own, as I<lb/>
Will kneel to him with thanks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROCULEIUS</speaker>
<p>Be of good cheer;<lb/>
You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:<lb/>
Make your full reference freely to my lord,<lb/>
Who is so full of grace, that it flows over<lb/>
On all that need: let me report to him<lb/>
Your sweet dependency; and you shall find<lb/>
A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,<lb/>
Where he for grace is kneel'd to.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Pray you, tell him<lb/>
I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him<lb/>
The greatness he has got. I hourly learn<lb/>
A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly<lb/>
Look him i' the face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROCULEIUS</speaker>
<p>Hold, worthy lady, hold:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Seizes and disarms her</stage></p>


<p>
Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this<lb/>
Relieved, but not betray'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>What, of death too,<lb/>
That rids our dogs of languish?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROCULEIUS</speaker>
<p>Cleopatra,<lb/>
Do not abuse my master's bounty by<lb/>
The undoing of yourself: let the world see<lb/>
His nobleness well acted, which your death<lb/>
Will never let come forth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Where art thou, death?<lb/>
Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen<lb/>
Worthy many babes and beggars!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROCULEIUS</speaker>
<p>O, temperance, lady!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;<lb/>
If idle talk will once be necessary,<lb/>
I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,<lb/>
Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I<lb/>
Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;<lb/>
Nor once be chastised with the sober eye<lb/>
Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up<lb/>
And show me to the shouting varletry<lb/>
Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt<lb/>
Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud<lb/>
Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies<lb/>
Blow me into abhorring! rather make<lb/>
My country's high pyramides my gibbet,<lb/>
And hang me up in chains!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROCULEIUS</speaker>
<p>You do extend<lb/>
These thoughts of horror further than you shall<lb/>
Find cause in Caesar.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Proculeius,<lb/>
What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,<lb/>
And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,<lb/>
I'll take her to my guard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PROCULEIUS</speaker>
<p>So, Dolabella,<lb/>
It shall content me best: be gentle to her.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To CLEOPATRA</stage></p>


<p>
To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,<lb/>
If you'll employ me to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Say, I would die.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Most noble empress, you have heard of me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I cannot tell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Assuredly you know me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.<lb/>
You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;<lb/>
Is't not your trick?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>I understand not, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:<lb/>
O, such another sleep, that I might see<lb/>
But such another man!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>If it might please ye,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck<lb/>
A sun and moon, which kept their course,<lb/>
and lighted<lb/>
The little O, the earth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Most sovereign creature,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm<lb/>
Crested the world: his voice was propertied<lb/>
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;<lb/>
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,<lb/>
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,<lb/>
There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas<lb/>
That grew the more by reaping: his delights<lb/>
Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above<lb/>
The element they lived in: in his livery<lb/>
Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were<lb/>
As plates dropp'd from his pocket.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Cleopatra!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Think you there was, or might be, such a man<lb/>
As this I dream'd of?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Gentle madam, no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.<lb/>
But, if there be, or ever were, one such,<lb/>
It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff<lb/>
To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine<lb/>
And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,<lb/>
Condemning shadows quite.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Hear me, good madam.<lb/>
Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it<lb/>
As answering to the weight: would I might never<lb/>
O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,<lb/>
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites<lb/>
My very heart at root.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>I thank you, sir,<lb/>
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Nay, pray you, sir,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Though he be honourable,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>He'll lead me, then, in triumph?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Madam, he will; I know't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Which is the Queen of Egypt?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>It is the emperor, madam.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>CLEOPATRA kneels</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Arise, you shall not kneel:<lb/>
I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Sir, the gods<lb/>
Will have it thus; my master and my lord<lb/>
I must obey.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Take to you no hard thoughts:<lb/>
The record of what injuries you did us,<lb/>
Though written in our flesh, we shall remember<lb/>
As things but done by chance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Sole sir o' the world,<lb/>
I cannot project mine own cause so well<lb/>
To make it clear; but do confess I have<lb/>
Been laden with like frailties which before<lb/>
Have often shamed our sex.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Cleopatra, know,<lb/>
We will extenuate rather than enforce:<lb/>
If you apply yourself to our intents,<lb/>
Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find<lb/>
A benefit in this change; but if you seek<lb/>
To lay on me a cruelty, by taking<lb/>
Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself<lb/>
Of my good purposes, and put your children<lb/>
To that destruction which I'll guard them from,<lb/>
If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,<lb/>
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall<lb/>
Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,<lb/>
I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;<lb/>
Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SELEUCUS</speaker>
<p>Here, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,<lb/>
Upon his peril, that I have reserved<lb/>
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SELEUCUS</speaker>
<p>Madam,<lb/>
I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,<lb/>
Speak that which is not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>What have I kept back?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SELEUCUS</speaker>
<p>Enough to purchase what you have made known.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve<lb/>
Your wisdom in the deed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>See, Caesar! O, behold,<lb/>
How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;<lb/>
And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.<lb/>
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does<lb/>
Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust<lb/>
Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt<lb/>
Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,<lb/>
Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!<lb/>
O rarely base!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Good queen, let us entreat you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,<lb/>
That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,<lb/>
Doing the honour of thy lordliness<lb/>
To one so meek, that mine own servant should<lb/>
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by<lb/>
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,<lb/>
That I some lady trifles have reserved,<lb/>
Immoment toys, things of such dignity<lb/>
As we greet modern friends withal; and say,<lb/>
Some nobler token I have kept apart<lb/>
For Livia and Octavia, to induce<lb/>
Their mediation; must I be unfolded<lb/>
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me<lb/>
Beneath the fall I have.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To SELEUCUS</stage></p>


<p>
Prithee, go hence;<lb/>
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits<lb/>
Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,<lb/>
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Forbear, Seleucus.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit SELEUCUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought<lb/>
For things that others do; and, when we fall,<lb/>
We answer others' merits in our name,<lb/>
Are therefore to be pitied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Cleopatra,<lb/>
Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,<lb/>
Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,<lb/>
Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,<lb/>
Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you<lb/>
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;<lb/>
Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;<lb/>
For we intend so to dispose you as<lb/>
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:<lb/>
Our care and pity is so much upon you,<lb/>
That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>My master, and my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Not so. Adieu.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Dolabella!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,<lb/>
Which my love makes religion to obey,<lb/>
I tell you this: Caesar through Syria<lb/>
Intends his journey; and within three days<lb/>
You with your children will he send before:<lb/>
Make your best use of this: I have perform'd<lb/>
Your pleasure and my promise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Dolabella,<lb/>
I shall remain your debtor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOLABELLA</speaker>
<p>I your servant,<lb/>
Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Farewell, and thanks.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit DOLABELLA</stage></p>


<p>
Now, Iras, what think'st thou?<lb/>
Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown<lb/>
In Rome, as well as I	mechanic slaves<lb/>
With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall<lb/>
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,<lb/>
Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,<lb/>
And forced to drink their vapour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>The gods forbid!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors<lb/>
Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers<lb/>
Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians<lb/>
Extemporally will stage us, and present<lb/>
Our Alexandrian revels; Antony<lb/>
Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see<lb/>
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness<lb/>
I' the posture of a whore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>O the good gods!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's certain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>IRAS</speaker>
<p>I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails<lb/>
Are stronger than mine eyes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Why, that's the way<lb/>
To fool their preparation, and to conquer<lb/>
Their most absurd intents.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter CHARMIAN</stage></p>


<p>
Now, Charmian!<lb/>
Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch<lb/>
My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,<lb/>
To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.<lb/>
Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;<lb/>
And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave<lb/>
To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.<lb/>
Wherefore's this noise?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit IRAS. A noise within</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter a Guardsman</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker>
<p>Here is a rural fellow<lb/>
That will not be denied your highness presence:<lb/>
He brings you figs.<lb/>

<p>Let him come in.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Guardsman</stage></p>


<p>
What poor an instrument<lb/>
May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.<lb/>
My resolution's placed, and I have nothing<lb/>
Of woman in me: now from head to foot<lb/>
I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon<lb/>
No planet is of mine.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Guard</speaker>
<p>This is the man.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Guardsman</stage></p>


<p>
Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,<lb/>
That kills and pains not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party<lb/>
that should desire you to touch him, for his biting<lb/>
is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or<lb/>
never recover.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Rememberest thou any that have died on't?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of<lb/>
them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,<lb/>
but something given to lie; as a woman should not<lb/>
do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the<lb/>
biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes<lb/>
a very good report o' the worm; but he that will<lb/>
believe all that they say, shall never be saved by<lb/>
half that they do: but this is most fallible, the<lb/>
worm's an odd worm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Get thee hence; farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I wish you all joy of the worm.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Setting down his basket</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>You must think this, look you, that the worm will<lb/>
do his kind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay; farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the<lb/>
keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no<lb/>
goodness in worm.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is<lb/>
not worth the feeding.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Will it eat me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>You must not think I am so simple but I know the<lb/>
devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a<lb/>
woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her<lb/>
not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the<lb/>
gods great harm in their women; for in every ten<lb/>
that they make, the devils mar five.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Well, get thee gone; farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.<lb/>

</sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have<lb/>
Immortal longings in me: now no more<lb/>
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:<lb/>
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear<lb/>
Antony call; I see him rouse himself<lb/>
To praise my noble act; I hear him mock<lb/>
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men<lb/>
To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:<lb/>
Now to that name my courage prove my title!<lb/>
I am fire and air; my other elements<lb/>
I give to baser life. So; have you done?<lb/>
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.<lb/>
Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies</stage></p>


<p>
Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?<lb/>
If thou and nature can so gently part,<lb/>
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,<lb/>
Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?<lb/>
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world<lb/>
It is not worth leave-taking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>
<p>Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,<lb/>
The gods themselves do weep!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>This proves me base:<lb/>
If she first meet the curled Antony,<lb/>
He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss<lb/>
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou<lb/>
mortal wretch,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To an asp, which she applies to her breast</stage></p>


<p>
With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate<lb/>
Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool<lb/>
Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,<lb/>
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass<lb/>
Unpolicied!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>

<p>O, break! O, break!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOPATRA</speaker>
<p>As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,&mdash;<lb/>
O Antony!&mdash;Nay, I will take thee too.<lb/>

<p>
What should I stay&mdash;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHARMIAN</speaker>

Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies<lb/>
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;<lb/>

O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.<lb/>

As she would catch another Antony<lb/>
In her strong toil of grace.<lb/>

<p>Here, on her breast,<lb/>
There is a vent of blood and something blown:<lb/>
The like is on her arm.<lb/>

<p>This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves<lb/>
Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves<lb/>
Upon the caves of Nile.<lb/>

<p>Most probable<lb/>
That so she died; for her physician tells me<lb/>
She hath pursued conclusions infinite<lb/>
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;<lb/>
And bear her women from the monument:<lb/>
She shall be buried by her Antony:<lb/>
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it<lb/>
A pair so famous. High events as these<lb/>
Strike those that make them; and their story is<lb/>
No less in pity than his glory which<lb/>
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall<lb/>
In solemn show attend this funeral;<lb/>
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see<lb/>
High order in this great solemnity.<lb/>
