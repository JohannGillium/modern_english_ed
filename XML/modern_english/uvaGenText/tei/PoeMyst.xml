<q>Es giebt eine Reihe idealischer Begebenheiten, die der 
Wirklichkeit parallel lauft.  Selten fallen sie zusammen.  Menschen 
und Zufalle modificeren gewohnlich die idealische Begebenheit, so 
dass sie unvollkommem erscheint, und ihre Folgen gleichfalls 
unvollkommen sind.  So bei der Reformation; statt des 
Protestantismus kam das Lutherthum hervor. 
</q>

<q>There are ideal series of events which run parallel with the 
real ones.  They rarely coincide.  Men and circumstances generally 
modify the ideal train of events, so that it seems imperfect, and 
its consequences are equally imperfect.  Thus with the Reformation; 
instead of Protestantism came Lutheranism.
<lb/>   &mdash; NOVALIS.  <hi rend="italic">Moral Ansichten</hi> 
</q> 
</epigraph>


<p>There are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who 
have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling 
half-credence in the supernatural, by <hi rend="italic">coincidences</hi> of so 
seemingly marvellous a character that, as <hi rend="italic">mere</hi> coincidences, 
the intellect has been unable to receive them.  Such sentiments &mdash; 

<pb n="411"/>  

for the half-credences of which I speak have never the full force of 
<hi rend="italic">thought</hi> &mdash; such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by 
reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically 
termed, the Calculus of Probabilities.  Now this Calculus is, in 
its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of 
the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and 
spirituality of the most intangible in speculation. 
</p><p>The extraordinary details which I am now called upon to make 
public, will be found to form, as regards sequences of time, the 
primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible 
<hi rend="italic">coincidences</hi>, whose secondary or concluding branch will be 
recognized by all readers in the late murder of MARY CECILIA 
ROGERS, at New York. 
</p><p>When, in an article entitled, <hi rend="italic">The Murders in the Rue 
Morgue</hi>, I endeavoured, about a year ago, to depict some very 
remarkable features in the mental character of my friend, the 
Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin, it did not occur to me that I should 
ever resume the subject.  This depicting of character constituted 
my design; and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild 
train of circumstances brought to instance Dupin's idiosyncrasy. 
I might have adduced other examples, but I should have proven no 
more.  Late events, however, in their surprising development, have 
startled me into some further details, which will carry with them 
the air of extorted confession.  Hearing what I have lately heard, 
it would be indeed strange should I remain silent in regard to what 
I both heard and saw long ago. 
</p><p>Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of 
Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the 
affair at once from his attention, and relapsed into his old habits 
of moody reverie.  Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I readily 
fell in with his humour; and continuing to occupy our chambers in 
the Faubourg Saint Germain, we gave the Future to the winds, and 
slumbered tranquillity in the Present, weaving the dull world 
around us into dreams. 
</p><p>But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted.  It may 
readily be supposed that the part played by my friend, in the drama 
at the Rue Morgue, had not failed of its impression upon 
the fancies of the Parisian police.  With its emissaries, the name 
of Dupin had grown into a household word.  The simple character of 
those inductions by which he had disentangled the mystery never 
having been explained even to the Prefect, or to any other 
individual than myself, of course it is not surprising 
<pb n="412"/>  
that the 
affair was regarded as little less than miraculous, or that the 
Chevalier's analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of 
intuition.  His frankness would have led him to disabuse every 
inquirer of such prejudice; but his indolent humour forbade all 
further agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long 
ceased.  It thus happened that he found himself the cynosure of the 
political eyes; and the cases were not few in which attempt was 
made to engage his services at the Prefecture.  One of the most 
remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl named 
Marie Roget. 
</p><p>This event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the 
Rue Morgue.  Marie, whose Christian and family name will at once 
arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate 
'cigar-girl', was the only daughter of the widow Estelle Roget. 
The father had died during the child's infancy, and from the period 
of his death, until within eighteen months before the assassination 
which forms the subject of our narrative, the mother and daughter 
had dwelt together in the Rue Pavee Saint Andree;<ref target="P1">1</ref> 
Madame there keeping a <hi rend="italic">pension</hi>, assisted by Marie.  Affairs went on thus 
until the latter had attained her twenty-second year, when her 
great beauty attracted the notice of a perfumer, who occupied one 
of the shops in the basement of the Palais Royal, and whose custom 
lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers infesting that 
neighbourhood.  Monsieur Le Blanc<ref target="P2">2</ref> was not unaware of the 
advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair Marie in 
his perfumery; and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by 
the girl, although with somewhat more of hesitation by Madame. 
</p><p>The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his 
rooms soon became notorious through the charms of the sprightly 
<hi rend="italic">grisette</hi>.  She had been in his employ about a year, when her 
admirers were thrown into confusion by her sudden disappearance 
from the shop.  Monsieur Le Blanc was unable to account for her 
absence, and Madame Roget was distracted with anxiety and terror. 
The public papers immediately took up the theme, and the police 
were upon the point of making serious investigations, when, one 
morning, after the lapse of a week, Marie, in good health, but with 
a somewhat saddened air, made her reappearance at her usual counter 
in the perfumery.  All inquiry, except that of a private character, 
was, of course, immediately hushed.  Monsieur Le Blanc professed 
total ignorance, as before.  Marie, with Madame, replied to all 
questions, 
<pb n="413"/>  
that the last week had been spent at the house of a 
relation in the country.  Thus the affair died away, and was 
generally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself 
from the impertinence of curiosity, soon bade a final adieu to the 
perfumer, and sought the shelter of her mother's residence in the 
Rue Pavee Saint Andree. 
</p><p>It was about five months after this return home, that her 
friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second 
time.  Three days elapsed, and nothing was heard of her.  On the 
fourth her corpse was found floating in the Seine,<ref target="P3">3</ref> 

near the shore which is opposite the Quartier of the Rue Saint Andree, and 
at a point not very far distant from the secluded neighbourhood of 
the Barriere du Roule.<ref target="P4">4</ref>
</p>
 
<p>The atrocity of this murder (for it was at once evident that 
murder had been committed), the youth and beauty of the victim, 
and, above all, her previous notoriety, conspired to produce 
intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive Parisians.  I can 
call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and intense 
an effect.  For several weeks, in the discussion of this one 
absorbing theme, even the momentous political topics of the day 
were forgotten.  The Prefect made unusual exertions; and the powers 
of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to the utmost 
extent. 
</p><p>Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed 
that the murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very 
brief period, the inquisition which was immediately set on foot.  It was 
not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to 
offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand 
francs.  In the meantime the investigation proceeded with vigour, 
if not always with judgment, and numerous individuals were examined 
to no purpose; while, owing to the continual absence of all clue to 
the mystery, the popular excitement greatly increased.  At the end 
of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum 
originally proposed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed 
without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always 
exists in Paris against the police having given vent to itself in 
several serious <hi rend="italic">emeutes</hi>, the Prefect took it upon himself to 
offer the sum of twenty thousand francs 'for the conviction of the 
assassin', or, if more than one should prove to have been 
implicated, 'for the conviction of any one of the assassins'.  In 
the proclamation setting forth this reward, a full pardon was 
<pb n="414"/>  
promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence 
against his fellow; and to the whole was appended, wherever it 
appeared, the private placard of a committee of citizens, offering 
ten thousand francs, in addition to the amount proposed by the 
Prefecture.  The entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty 
thousand francs, which will be regarded as an extraordinary sum 
when we consider the humble condition of the girl, and the great 
frequency, in large cities, of such atrocities as the one 
described. 
</p><p>No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be 
immediately brought to light.  But although, in one or two 
instances, arrests were made which promised elucidation, yet 
nothing was elicited which could implicate the parties suspected; 
and they were discharged forthwith.  Strange as it may appear, the 
third week from the discovery of the body had passed, and passed 
without any light being thrown upon the subject, before even a 
rumour of the events which had so agitated the public mind reached 
the ears of Dupin and myself.  Engaged in researches which had 
absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since 
either of us had gone abroad, or received a visitor, or more than 
glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily 
papers.  The first intelligence of the murder was brought us 
by G&mdash;, in person.  He called upon us early in the afternoon 
of the thirteenth of July 18 &mdash; , and remained with us until late in 
the night.  He had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavours 
to ferret out the assassins.  His reputation &mdash; so he said with a 
peculiarly Parisian air &mdash; was at stake.  Even his honour was 
concerned.  The eyes of the public were upon him; and there was 
really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the 
development of the mystery.  He concluded a somewhat droll speech 
with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the <hi rend="italic">tact</hi> of 
Dupin, and made him a direct and certainly a liberal proposition, 
the precise nature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to 
disclose, but which has no bearing upon the proper subject of my 
narrative. 
</p><p>The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the 
proposition he accepted at once, although its advantages were 
altogether provisional.  This point being settled, the Prefect 
broke forth at once into explanations of his own views, 
interspersing them with long comments upon the evidence; of which 
latter we were not yet in possession.  He discoursed much and, 
beyond doubt, learnedly; while I hazarded an occasional 
<pb n="415"/>  
suggestion 
as the night wore drowsily away.  Dupin, sitting steadily in his 
accustomed arm-chair, was the embodiment of respectful attention. 
He wore spectacles, during the whole interview; and an occasional 
glance beneath their green glasses sufficed to convince me that he 
slept not the less soundly, because silently, throughout the seven 
or eight leaden-footed hours which immediately preceded the 
departure of the Prefect. 
</p><p>In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report 
of all the evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper 
offices, a copy of every paper in which, from first to last, had 
been published any decisive information in regard to this sad 
affair.  Freed from all that was positively disproved, the mass of 
information stood thus: 
</p><p>Marie Roget left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavee 
St Andree, about nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday, June the 
twenty-second, 18 &mdash; .  In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur 
Jacques St Eustache,<ref target="P5">5</ref> and to him only, of her 
intention to spend the day with an aunt, who resided in the Rue des Dromes.  The Rue 
des Dromes is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not far 
from the banks of the river, and at a distance of some two miles, 
in the most direct course possible, from the <hi rend="italic">pension</hi> of Madame 
Roget.  St Eustache was the accepted suitor of Marie, and lodged, 
as well as took his meals, at the <hi rend="italic">pension</hi>.  He was to have gone 
for his betrothed at dusk, and to have escorted her home.  In the 
afternoon, however, it came on to rain heavily; and, supposing that 
she would remain at her aunt's (as she had done under similar 
circumstances before), he did not think it necessary to keep his 
promise.  As night drew on, Madame Roget (who was an infirm old 
lady, seventy years of age) was heard to express a fear 'that she 
should never see Marie again'; but this observation attracted 
little attention at the time. 
</p><p>On Monday it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the 
Rue des Dromes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a 
tardy search was instituted at several points in the city and its 
environs.  It was not, however, until the fourth day from the 
period of her disappearance that anything satisfactory was 
ascertained respecting her.  On this day (Wednesday, the twenty-fifth 
of June) a Monsieur Beauvais,<ref target="P6">6</ref> 

who, with a friend, had been 
making inquiries for Marie near the Barriere du Roule, on the shore 
of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavee St Andree, was 
informed a corpse had just been towed ashore by 
<pb n="416"/>  
some fishermen, who 
had found it floating in the river.  Upon seeing the body, 
Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the 
perfumery girl.  His friend recognized it more promptly. 
</p><p>The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued 
from the mouth.  No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely 
drowned.  There was no discoloration in the cellular tissue.  About 
the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers.  The arms were 
bent over on the chest, and were rigid.  The right hand was 
clenched; the left partially open.  On the left wrist were two 
circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes, or of a rope 
in more than one volution.  A part of the right wrist, also, was 
much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent, but more 
especially at the shoulder-blades.  In bringing the body to the 
shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope, but none of the excoriations 
had been effected by this.  The flesh of the neck was much swollen. 
There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the effect 
of blows.  A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the 
neck as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the 
flesh, and was fastened by a knot which lay just under the left 
ear.  This alone would have sufficed to produce death.  The medical 
testimony spoke confidently of the virtuous character of the 
deceased.  She had been subjected, it said, to brutal violence. 
The corpse was in such condition when found that there could have 
been no difficulty in its recognition by friends. 
</p><p>The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered.  In the 
outer garment, a slip, about a food wide, had been torn upward from 
the bottom hem to the waist, but not torn off.  It was wound three 
times around the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back. 
The dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin; and 
from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely out &mdash; 
torn very evenly and with great care.  It was found around her 
neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot.  Over this 
muslin slip and the slip of lace the strings of a bonnet were 
attached, the bonnet being apprehended.  The knot by which the 
strings of the bonnet were fastened was not a lady's, but a slip or 
sailor's knot. 
</p><p>After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, 
taken to the Morgue (this formality being superfluous), but hastily 
interred not far from the spot at which it was brought ashore. 
Through the exertions of Beauvais, the matter was industriously 
hushed up, as far as possible; and several days had elapsed 
<pb n="417"/>  
before 
any public emotion resulted.  A weekly paper,<ref target="P7">7</ref> 
however, at length 
took up the theme; the corpse was disinterred, and a re-examination 
instituted; but nothing was elicited beyond what has been already 
noted.  The clothes, however, were now submitted to the mother and 
friends of the deceased and fully identified as those worn by the 
girl upon leaving home. 
</p><p>Meantime, the excitement increased hourly.  Several 
individuals were arrested and discharged.  St Eustache fell 
especially under suspicion; and he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account 
of his whereabouts during the Sunday on which Marie left home. 
Subsequently, however, he submitted to Monsieur G&mdash;, affidavits, 
accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question. 
As time passed and no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory 
rumours were circulated, and journalists busied themselves in 
<hi rend="italic">suggestions</hi>.  Among these, the one which attracted the most 
notice, was the idea that Marie Roget still lived &mdash; that the corpse 
found in the Seine was that of some other unfortunate.  It will be 
proper that I submit to the reader some passages which embody the 
suggestion alluded to.  These passages are <hi rend="italic">literal</hi> translations 
from <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>,<ref target="P8">8</ref>
a paper conducted, in general, with much ability. 
</p><p>'Mademoiselle Roget left her mother's house on Sunday morning, 
June the twenty-second, 18 &mdash; , with the ostensible purpose of going 
to see her aunt, or some other connection in the Rue des Dromes. 
From that hour, nobody is proved to have seen her.  There is no 
trace or tidings of her at all. . . .  There has no person, 
whatever, come forward, so far, who saw her at all, on that day, 
after she left her mother's door. . . .  Now, though we have no 
evidence that Marie Roget was in the land of the living after nine 
o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have proof that, up 
to that hour, she was alive.  On Wednesday noon, at twelve, a 
female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barriere du 
Roule.  This was, even if we presume that Marie Roget was thrown 
into the river within three hours after she left her mother's 
house, only three days from the time she left her home &mdash; three days 
to an hour.  But it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder 
was committed on her body, could have been consummated soon enough 
to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river 
before midnight.  Those who are guilty of such horrid crimes choose 
darkness rather than light. . . .  Thus we see that if the 
<pb n="418"/>  
body 
found in the river <hi rend="italic">was</hi> that of Marie Roget, it could only have 
been in the water two and a half days, or three at the outside. 
All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into 
the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to 
ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them 
to the top of the water.  Even where a cannon is fired over a 
corpse, and it rises before, at least, five or six days' immersion, 
it sinks again, if let alone.  Now, we ask what was there in this 
case to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature? . . 
. if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until 
Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the murderers. 
It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body would be so soon 
afloat, even were it thrown in after having been dead two days. 
And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any villains 
who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would have 
thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a 
precaution could have so easily been taken.' 
</p><p>The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been 
in water 'not three days merely, but, at least, five times three 
days', because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great 
difficulty in recognizing it.  This latter point, however, was 
fully disproved.  I continued the translation: 
</p><p>'What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he 
has no doubt the body was that of Marie Roget?  He ripped up the 
gown sleeve, and says he found marks which satisfied him of the 
identity.  The public generally supposed those marks to have 
consisted of some description of scars.  He rubbed the arm and 
found <hi rend="italic">hair</hi> upon it &mdash; something as indefinite, we think, as can 
readily be imagined &mdash; as little conclusive as finding an arm in the 
sleeve.  M. Beauvais did not return that night, but sent word to 
Madame Roget, at seven o'clock, on Wednesday evening, that an 
investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter.  If we 
allow that Madame Roget, from her age and grief, could not go over 
(which is allowing a great deal), there certainly must have been 
some one who would have thought it worth while to go over and 
attend the investigation, if they thought the body was that of 
Marie.  Nobody went over.  There was nothing said or heard about 
the matter in the Rue Pavee St Andree, that reached even the 
occupants of the same building.  M St Eustache, the lover and 
intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her mother's house, 
deposes 
<pb n="419"/>  
that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his 
intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came into his 
chamber and told him of it.  For an item of news like this, it 
strikes us it was very coolly received.' 
</p><p>In this way the journal endeavoured to create the impression 
of an apathy on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent 
with the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be 
hers.  Its insinuations amount to this; that Marie, with the 
connivance of her friends, had absented herself from the city for 
reasons involving a charge against her chastity; and that these 
friends upon the discovery of a corpse in the Seine, somewhat 
resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves of the 
opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her death. 
But <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> was again over-hasty.  It was distinctly proved 
that no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady 
was exceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend 
to any duty; that St Eustache, so far from receiving the news 
coolly, was distracted with grief, and bore himself so frantically, 
that M. Beauvais prevailed upon a friend and relative to take 
charge of him, and prevent his attending the examination at the 
disinterment.  Moreover, although it was stated by <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>, 
that the corpse was re-interred at public expense, that an 
advantageous offer of private sepulture was absolutely declined by 
the family, and that no member of the family attended the 
ceremonial; &mdash; although, I say, all this was asserted by <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> 
in furtherance of the impression it designed to convey &mdash; yet <hi rend="italic">all</hi> 
this was satisfactorily disproved.  In a subsequent number of the 
paper, an attempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais 
himself.  The editor says: 
</p><p>'Now, then, a change comes over the matter.  We are told that, 
on one occasion, while a Madame B&mdash; was at Madame Roget's house, 
M. Beauvais, who was going out, told her that a <hi rend="italic">gendarme</hi> was 
expected there, and that she, Madame B&mdash;, must not say anything 
to the <hi rend="italic">gendarme</hi> until he returned, but let the matter be for 
him. . . .  In the present posture of affairs M. Beauvais appears 
to have the whole matter locked up in his head.  A single step 
cannot be taken without M. Beauvais, for go which way you will, you 
run against him. . . .  For some reason he determined that nobody 
shall have anything to do with the proceedings but himself, and he 
has elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their 
representations, in a very singular manner.  He seems 
to have been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the 
body.' 
<pb n="420"/>  
</p><p>By the following fact, some colour was given to the suspicion 
thus thrown upon Beauvais.  A visitor at his office, a few days 
prior to the girl's disappearance, and during the absence of its 
occupant, had observed a <hi rend="italic">rose</hi> in the key-hole of the door, and 
the name '<hi rend="italic">Marie</hi>' inscribed upon a slate which hung near at 
hand. 
</p><p>The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it 
from the newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim 
of a <hi rend="italic">gang</hi> of desperadoes &mdash; that by these she had been borne 
across the river, maltreated, and murdered.  <hi rend="italic">Le Commerciel</hi>,<ref target="P9">9</ref> 
however, a print of extensive influence, was earnest in combating 
this popular idea.  I quote a passage or two from its columns: 
</p><p>'We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false 
scent so far as it has been directed to the Barriere du Roule.  It 
is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this 
young woman was, should have passed three blocks without someone 
having seen her; and any one who saw her would have remembered it, 
for she interested all who knew her.  It was when the streets were 
full of people, when she went out. . . .  It is impossible that she 
could have gone to the Barriere du Roule, or to the Rue des Dromes, 
without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet no one has come 
forward who saw her outside her mother's door, and there is no 
evidence except the testimony concerning her <hi rend="italic">expressed 
intentions</hi>, that she did go out at all.  Her gown was torn, bound 
round her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle. 
If the murder had been committed at the Barriere du Roule, there 
would have been no necessity for any such arrangement.  The fact 
that the body was found floating near the Barriere is no proof as 
to where it was thrown into the water. . . .  A piece of one of the 
unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long and one foot wide, was 
torn out and tied under her chin around the back of her head, 
probably to prevent screams.  This was done by fellows who had no 
pocket-handkerchief.' 
</p><p>A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some 
important information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, 
at least, the chief portion of <hi rend="italic">Le Commerciel</hi>'s argument. 
Two small boys, sons of a Madame Deluc, while roaming among the 
woods near the Barriere du Roule, chanced to penetrate a close 
thicket, within which were three or four large stones, forming a 
kind of seat with a back and footstool.  On the upper
<pb n="421"/> 
stone lay a 
white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf.  A parasol, gloves, 
and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found.  The handkerchief 
bore the name 'Marie Roget'.  Fragments of dress were discovered on 
the brambles around.  The earth was trampled, the bushes were 
broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle.  Between the 
thicket and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the 
ground bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged 
along it. 
</p><p>A weekly paper, <hi rend="italic">Le Soleil</hi>,<ref target="P10">10</ref> 
had the following comments 
upon this discovery &mdash; comments which merely echoed the sentiment of 
the whole Parisian press: 
<q>'The things had all evidently been there at least three or 
four weeks; they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the 
rain, and stuck together from mildew.  The grass had grown around 
and over some of them.  The silk on the parasol was strong, but the 
threads of it were run together within.  The upper part, where it 
had been doubled and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore 
on its being opened. . . .  The pieces of her frock torn out by the 
bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long.  One part 
was the hem of the frock, and it had been mended; the other piece 
was part of the skirt, not the hem.  They looked like strips torn 
off, and were on the thorn bush, about a foot from the ground. . . . 
There can be no doubt, therefore, that the spot of this 
appalling outrage has been discovered.' 
</q>
Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared.  Madame 
Deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank 
of the river, opposite the Barriere du Roule.  The neighbourhood is 
secluded &mdash; particularly so.  It is the usual Sunday resort of 
blackguards from the city, who cross the river in boats.  About 
three o'clock, in the afternoon of the Sunday in question, a young 
girl arrived at the inn accompanied by a young man of dark 
complexion.  The two remained here for some time.  On their 
departure, they took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity. 
Madame Deluc's attention was called to the dress worn by the girl, 
on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative. 
A scarf was particularly noticed.  Soon after the departure of the 
couple, a gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved 
boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the 
route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, 
and re-crossed the river as if in great haste. 
<pb n="422"/>  
</p><p>It was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that Madame 
Deluc, as well as her eldest son, heard the screams of a female in 
the vicinity of the inn.  The screams were violent but brief. 
Madame D. recognized not only the scarf which was found in the 
thicket, but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse.  An 
omnibus driver, Valence,<ref target="P11"></ref> 
now also testified that he saw Marie 
Roget cross a ferry on the Seine, on the Sunday in question.  He, 
Valence, knew Marie, and could not be mistaken in her identity. 
The articles found in the thicket were fully identified by the 
relatives of Marie. 
</p><p>The items of evidence and information thus collected by 
myself, from the newspapers, at the suggestion of Dupin, embraced 
only one more point &mdash; but this was a point of seemingly vast 
consequence.  It appears that, immediately after the discovery of 
the clothes as above described, the lifeless or nearly lifeless 
body of St Eustache, Marie's betrothed, was found in the vicinity 
of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage.  A phial 
labelled 'laudanum', and emptied, was found near him.  His breath 
gave evidence of the poison.  He died without speaking.  Upon his 
person was found a letter, briefly stating his love for Marie, with 
his design of self-destruction. 
</p><p>'I need scarcely tell you,' said Dupin, as he finished the 
perusal of my notes, 'that this is a far more intricate case than 
that of the Rue Morgue; from which it differs in one important 
respect.  This is an <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi>, although an atrocious, instance 
of crime.  There is nothing peculiarly <hi rend="italic">outre</hi> about it.  You 
will observe that, for this reason, the mystery has been considered 
easy, when for this reason, it should have been considered difficult of solution. 
Thus, at first, it was thought unnecessary to offer a reward.  The 
myrmidons of G&mdash; were able at once to comprehend how and why such 
an atrocity <hi rend="italic">might have been</hi> committed.  They could picture to 
their imaginations a mode &mdash; many modes, &mdash; and a motive &mdash; many motives; 
and because it was not impossible that either of these numerous 
modes and motives <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been the actual one, they have 
taken it for granted that one of them <hi rend="italic">must</hi>.  But the ease with 
which these variable fancies were entertained, and the very 
plausibility which each assumed, should have been understood as 
indicative rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which 
must attend elucidation.  I have therefore observed that it is by 
prominences above the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels her 
way, if at 
<pb n="423"/>  
all, in her search for the true, and that the proper 
question in cases such as this is not so much "what has occurred?" 
as "what has occurred that has never occurred before?"  In the 
investigations at the house of Madame L'Espanaye,<ref target="P12">12</ref> 
the agents of 
G&mdash; were discouraged and confounded by that very <hi rend="italic">unusualness</hi> 
which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have afforded the 
surest omen of success; while this same intellect might have been 
plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the 
eye in the case of the perfumery-girl, and yet told of nothing but 
easy triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture. 
</p><p>'In the case of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, there was, 
even at the beginning of our investigation, no doubt that murder 
had been committed.  The idea of suicide was excluded at once. 
Here, too, we are freed, at the commencement, from all supposition 
of self-murder.  The body found at the Barriere du Roule was found 
under such circumstances as to leave us no room for embarrassment 
upon this important point.  But it has been suggested that the 
corpse discovered is not that of the Marie Roget for the conviction 
of whose assassin, or assassins, the reward is offered, and 
respecting whom, solely, our agreement has been arranged with the 
Prefect.  We both know this gentleman well.  It will not do to 
trust him too far.  If, dating our inquiries from the 
body found, and then tracing a murderer, we yet discover this body 
to be that of some other individual than Marie; or if, starting 
from the living Marie, we find her, yet find her unassassinated &mdash; in 
either case we lose our labour; since it is Monsieur G&mdash; with 
whom we have to deal.  For our own purpose, therefore, if not for 
the purpose of justice, it is indispensable that our first step 
should be the determination of the identity of the corpse with the 
Marie Roget who is missing. 
</p><p>'With the public the arguments of <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> have had 
weight; and that the journal itself is convinced of their 
importance would appear from the manner in which it commences one 
of its essays upon the subject &mdash; "Several of the morning papers of 
the day," it says, "speak of the <hi rend="italic">conclusive</hi> article in Monday's 
<hi rend="italic">Etoile</hi>."  To me, this article appears conclusive of little 
beyond the zeal of its inditer.  We should bear in mind that, in 
general, it is the object of our newspapers rather to create a 
sensation &mdash; to make a point &mdash; than to further the cause of truth. 
The latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the 
former.  The print which merely falls in with ordinary opinion 
(however well founded this opinion may be) earns for itself no 
credit with the 
<pb n="424"/>  
mob.  The mass of the people regard as profound 
only him who suggests <hi rend="italic">pungent contradictions</hi> of the general 
idea.  In ratiocination, not less than in literature, it is the 
<hi rend="italic">epigram</hi> which is the most immediately and the most universally 
appreciated.  In both, it is of the lowest order of merit. 
</p><p>'What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and 
melodrame of the idea, that Marie Roget still lives, rather than 
any true plausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to 
<hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>, and secured it a favourable reception with the public. 
Let us examine the heads of this journal's argument; endeavouring 
to avoid the incoherence with which it is originally set forth. 
</p><p>'The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of 
the interval between Marie's disappearance and the finding of the 
floating corpse, that this corpse cannot be that of Marie.  The 
reduction of this interval to its smallest possible dimension, 
becomes thus, at once, an object with the reasoner.  In the rash 
pursuit of this object, he rushes into mere assumption at the 
outset.  "It is folly to suppose," he says, "that the murder, if 
murder was committed on her body, could have been consummated 
soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into 
the river before midnight."  We demand at once, and very naturally, 
<hi rend="italic">why</hi>?  Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed 
<hi rend="italic">within five minutes</hi> after the girl's quitting her mother's 
house?  Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed at 
any given period of the day?  There have been assassinations at all 
hours.  But, had the murder taken place at any moment between nine 
o'clock in the morning of Sunday and a quarter before midnight, 
there would still have been time enough "to throw the body into the 
river before midnight".  This assumption, then, amounts precisely 
to this &mdash; that the murder was not committed on Sunday at all &mdash; and, 
if we allow <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> to assume this, we may permit it any 
liberties whatever.  The paragraph beginning "It is folly to 
suppose that the murder, etc.," however it appears as printed in 
<hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>, may be imagined to have existed actually <hi rend="italic">thus</hi> in the 
brain of the inditer: "It is folly to suppose that the murder, if 
murder was committed on the body, could have been committed soon 
enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the 
river before midnight; it is folly, we say, to suppose all this, 
and to suppose at the same time (as we are resolved to suppose), 
that the body was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> thrown in until <hi rend="italic">after</hi> midnight" &mdash; a 
sentence sufficiently inconsequential in itself, but not so utterly 
preposterous as the one printed. 
<pb n="425"/>  
</p><p>'Were it my purpose,' continued Dupin, 'merely to <hi rend="italic">make out 
a case</hi> against this passage of <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile's</hi> argument, I might 
safely leave it where it is.  It is not, however, with <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> 
that we have to do, but with the truth.  The sentence in question 
has but one meaning, as it stands; and this meaning I have fairly 
stated; but it is material that we go behind the mere words for an 
idea which these words have obviously intended, and failed to 
convey.  It was the design of the journalists to say that at 
whatever period of the day or night of Sunday this murder was 
committed, it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured 
to bear the corpse to the river before midnight.  And herein lies, 
really, the assumption of which I complain.  It is assumed that the 
murder was committed at such a position, and under such 
circumstances, that <hi rend="italic">the bearing it</hi> to the river became 
necessary.  Now, the assassination might have taken place 
upon the river's brink, or on the river itself; and thus, the 
throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to at any 
period of the day or night, as the most obvious and most immediate 
mode of disposal.  You will understand that I suggest nothing here 
as probable, or as coincident with my own opinion.  My design, so 
far, has no reference to the <hi rend="italic">facts</hi> of the case.  I wish merely 
to caution you against the whole tone of <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile's suggestion</hi>, 
by calling your attention to its <hi rend="italic">ex-parte</hi> character at the 
outset. 
</p><p>'Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived 
notions; having assumed that, if this were the body of Marie, it 
could have been in the water but a very brief time, the journal 
goes on to say: 
</p><p>'"All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies 
thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require 
from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to 
bring them to the top of the water.  Even when a cannon is fired 
over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' 
immersion, it sinks again if let alone." 
</p><p>'These assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in 
Paris, with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Le Moniteur</hi>.<ref target="P13">13</ref> 
This latter print 
endeavours to combat that portion of the paragraph which has 
reference to "drowned bodies" only, by citing some five or six 
instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned 
were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted 
upon by <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>.  But there is something excessively 
unphilosophical in the attempt, on the part of <hi rend="italic">Le Moniteur</hi>, to 
<pb n="426"/>  
rebut the general assertion of <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>, by a citation of 
particular instances militating against that assertion.  Had it 
been possible to adduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies 
found floating at the end of two or three days, these fifty 
examples could still have been properly regarded only as exceptions 
to <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile's</hi> rule, until such time as the rule itself should 
be confuted.  Admitting the rule (and this <hi rend="italic">Le Moniteur</hi> does not 
deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions), the argument of 
<hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> is suffered to remain in full force; for this argument 
does not pretend to involve more than a question 
of the <hi rend="italic">probability</hi> of the body having risen to the surface 
in less than three days; and this probability will be in favour of 
<hi rend="italic">L'Etoile's</hi> position until the instances so childishly adduced 
shall be sufficient in number to establish an antagonistical rule. 
</p><p>'You will see at once that all argument upon this head should 
be urged, if at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we 
must examine the <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of the rule.  Now the human body, in 
general, is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of 
the Seine; that is to say, the specific gravity of the human body, 
in its natural condition, is about equal to the bulk of fresh water 
which it displaces.  The bodies of fat and fleshy persons, with 
small bones, and of women generally, are lighter than those of the 
lean and large-boned, and of men; and the specific gravity of the 
water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide 
from the sea.  But, leaving this tide out of question, it may be 
said that <hi rend="italic">very</hi> few human bodies will sink at all, even in fresh 
water, <hi rend="italic">of their own accord</hi>.  Almost any one, falling into a 
river, will be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity 
of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own &mdash; that 
is to say, if he suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as 
little exception as possible.  The proper position for one who 
cannot swim, is the upright position of the walker on land, with 
the head thrown fully back, and immersed; the mouth and nostrils 
alone remaining above the surface.  Thus circumstanced, we shall 
find that we float without difficulty and without exertion.  It is 
evident, however, that the gravities of the body, and of the bulk 
of water displaced, are very nicely balanced, and that a trifle 
will cause either to preponderate.  An arm, for instance, uplifted 
from the water, and thus deprived of its support, is an additional 
weight sufficient to immerse the whole head, while the accidental 
aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate the 
head so as to look about.  Now, in the struggles of one unused to 
swimming, the 
<pb n="427"/>  
arms are invariably thrown upward, while an attempt 
is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position.  The 
result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the 
inception, during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of 
water into the lungs.  Much is also received into the stomach, and 
the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight 
of the air originally distending these cavities, and that 
of the fluid which now fills them.  This difference is sufficient 
to cause the body to sink, as a general rule; but is insufficient 
in the cases of individuals with small bones and an abnormal 
quantity of flaccid or fatty matter.  Such individuals float even 
after drowning. 
</p><p>'The corpse, being supposed at the bottom of the river, will 
there remain until, by some means, its specific gravity again 
becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces. 
This effect is brought about by decomposition, or otherwise.  The 
result of decomposition is the generation of gas, distending the 
cellular tissues and all the cavities, and giving the <hi rend="italic">puffed</hi> 
appearance which is so horrible.  When this distension has so far 
progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased 
without a corresponding increase of <hi rend="italic">mass</hi> or weight, its 
specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced, and 
it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface.  But 
decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances &mdash; is hastened 
or retarded by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or 
cold of the season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the 
water, by its depth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, 
by the temperament of the body, by its infection or freedom from 
disease before death.  Thus it is evident that we can assign no 
period, with anything like accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise 
through decomposition.  Under certain conditions this result would 
be brought about within an hour; under others it might not take 
place at all.  There are chemical infusions by which the animal 
frame can be preserved <hi rend="italic">for ever</hi> from corruption; the bichloride 
of mercury is one.  But, apart from decomposition, there may be, 
and very usually is, a generation of gas within the stomach, from 
the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter (or within other 
cavities from other causes), sufficient to induce a distension 
which will bring the body to the surface.  The effect produced by 
the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration.  This may 
either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is 
embedded, thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have 
already prepared 
<pb n="428"/>  
it for so doing: or it may overcome the tenacity 
of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissues, allowing the 
cavities to distend under the influence of the gas. 
</p><p>'Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, 
we can easily test by it the assertions of <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>.  "All 
experience shows," says this paper, "that drowned bodies, or bodies 
thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require 
from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to 
bring them to the top of the water.  Even when a cannon is fired 
over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' 
immersion, it sinks again if let alone." 
</p><p>'The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of 
inconsequence and incoherence.  All experience does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> show 
that "drowned bodies" <hi rend="italic">require</hi> from six to ten days for 
sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the 
surface.  Both science and experience show that the period of their 
rising is, and necessarily must be, indeterminate.  If, moreover, 
a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon, it will 
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> "sink again is let alone", until decomposition has so far 
progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas.  But I 
wish to call your attention to the distinction which is made 
between "drowned bodies", and "bodies thrown into water immediately 
after death by violence".  Although the writer admits the 
distinction, he yet includes them all in the same category.  I have 
shown how it is that the body of a drowning man becomes 
specifically heavier than its bulk of water, and that he would not 
sink at all, except for the struggle by which he elevates his arms 
above the surface, and his gasps for breath while beneath the 
surface &mdash; gasps which supply by water the place of the original air 
in the lungs.  But these struggles and these gasps would not occur 
in the body "thrown into the water immediately after death by 
violence".  Thus, in the latter instance, <hi rend="italic">the body, as a general 
rule, would not sink at all</hi> &mdash; a fact of which <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> is 
evidently ignorant.  When decomposition had proceeded to a very 
great extent &mdash; when the flesh had in a great measure left the bones &mdash; 
then, indeed, but not <hi rend="italic">till</hi> then, should we lose sight of the 
corpse. 
</p><p>'And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body 
found could not be that of Marie Roget, because, three days only 
having elapsed, this body was found floating?  If drowned, being a 
woman, she might never have sunk; or, having sunk, might have 
reappeared in twenty-four hours or less.  But no one supposes her 
to have been drowned; and, 
<pb n="429"/>  
dying before being thrown into the 
river, she might have been found floating at any period 
afterward whatever. 
</p><p>'"But," says <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>, "if the body had been kept in its 
mangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be 
found on shore of the murderers."  Here it is at first difficult to 
perceive the intention of the reasoner.  He means to anticipate 
what he imagines would be an objection to his theory &mdash; viz.: that 
the body was kept on shore two days, suffering rapid decomposition &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">more</hi> rapid than if immersed in water.  He supposes that, had 
this been the case, it <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have appeared at the surface on 
the Wednesday, and thinks that <hi rend="italic">only</hi> under such circumstances it 
could have so appeared.  He is accordingly in haste to show that it 
<hi rend="italic">was not</hi> kept on shore; for, if so, "some trace would be found 
on shore of the murderers."  I presume you smile at the 
<hi rend="italic">sequitur</hi>.  You cannot be made to see how the mere <hi rend="italic">duration</hi> of 
the corpse on the shore could operate to <hi rend="italic">multiply traces</hi> of the 
assassins.  Nor can I. 
</p><p>'"And furthermore it is exceedingly improbable," continues our 
journal, "that any villains who had committed such a murder as is 
here supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink 
it, when such a precaution could have so easily been taken." 
Observe, here, the laughable confusion of thought!  No one &mdash; not 
even <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> &mdash; disputes the murder committed <hi rend="italic">on the body 
found</hi>.  The marks of violence are too obvious.  It is our 
reasoner's object merely to show that this body is not Marie's.  He 
wishes to prove that <hi rend="italic">Marie</hi> is not assassinated &mdash; not that the 
corpse was not.  Yet his observation proves only the latter point. 
Here is a corpse without weight attached.  Murderers, casting it 
in, would not have failed to attach a weight.  Therefore it was not 
thrown in by murderers.  This is all which is proved, if anything 
is.  The question of identity is not even approached, and 
<hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> has been at great pains merely to gainsay now what it has 
admitted only a moment before.  "We are perfectly convinced," it 
says, "that the body found was that of a murdered female." 
</p><p>'Nor is this the sole instance, even in this division of his 
subject, where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself. 
His evident object, I have already said, is to reduce, as much as 
possible, the interval between Marie's disappearance and the 
finding of the corpse.  Yet we find him <hi rend="italic">urging</hi> the point that 
no person saw the girl from the moment of her leaving her 
mother's house.  "We have no evidence," he says, "that Marie Roget 
was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on Sunday, 
<pb n="430"/>  
June 
the twenty-second."  As his argument is obviously an <hi rend="italic">ex-parte</hi> 
one, he should, at least, have left this matter out of sight; for 
had any one been known to see Marie, say on Monday, or on Tuesday, 
the interval in question would have been much reduced, and, by his 
own ratiocination, the probability much diminished of the corpse 
being that of the <hi rend="italic">grisette</hi>.  It is, nevertheless, amusing to 
observe that <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> insists upon its point in the full belief 
of its furthering its general argument. 
</p><p>'Re-peruse now that portion of this argument which has 
reference to the identification of the corpse by Beauvais.  In 
regard to the <hi rend="italic">hair</hi> upon the arm, <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> has been 
obviously disingenuous.  M. Beauvais, not being an idiot, could 
never have urged in identification of the corpse, simply <hi rend="italic">hair 
upon its arm</hi>.  No arm is <hi rend="italic">without</hi> hair.  The <hi rend="italic">generality</hi> of 
the expression of <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> is a mere perversion of the witness' 
phraseology.  He must have spoken of some <hi rend="italic">peculiarity</hi> in this 
hair.  It must have been a peculiarity of colour, of quantity, of 
length, or of situation. 
</p><p>'"Her foot," says the journal, "was small" &mdash; so are thousands 
of feet.  Her garter is no proof whatever &mdash; nor is her shoe &mdash; for 
shoes and garters are sold in packages.  The same may be said of 
the flowers in her hat.  One thing upon which M. Beauvais strongly 
insists is, that the clasp of the garter found had been set back to 
take it in.  This amounts to nothing; for most women find it proper 
to take a pair of garters home and fit them to the size of the 
limbs they are to encircle, rather than to try them in the store 
where they purchase."  Here it is difficult to suppose the reasoner 
in earnest.  Had M. Beauvais, in his search for the body of Marie, 
discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance to 
the missing girl, he would have been warranted (without reference 
to the question of habiliment at all) in forming an opinion that 
his search had been successful.  If, in addition to the point of 
general size and contour, he had found upon the arm a peculiar 
hairy appearance which he had observed upon the living Marie, his 
opinion might have been justly strengthened; and the increase of 
positiveness might well have been in the ratio of the peculiarity, 
or unusualness of the hairy mark.  If the feet of Marie 
being small, those of the corpse were also small, the increase of 
probability that the body was that of Marie would not be an 
increase in a ratio merely arithmetical, but in one highly 
geometrical, or accumulative.  Add to all this shoes such as she 
had been known to wear upon the day of her disappearance, and, 
although these shoes 
<pb n="431"/>  
may be "sold in packages", you so far augment 
the probability as to verge upon the certain.  What, of itself, 
would be no evidence of identity, becomes, through its 
corroborative position, proof most sure.  Give us then, flowers in 
the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and we 
seek for nothing further.  If only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> flower, we seek for 
nothing further &mdash; what then if two or three, or more?  Each 
successive one is multiple evidence &mdash; proof not <hi rend="italic">added</hi> to proof, 
but <hi rend="italic">multiplied</hi> by hundreds or thousands.  Let us now discover, 
upon the deceased, garters such as the living used, and it is 
almost folly to proceed.  But these garters are found to be 
tightened, by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a manner as 
her own had been tightened by Marie shortly previous to her leaving 
home.  It is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt.  What <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> 
says in respect to this abbreviation of the garters being an 
unusual occurrence, shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in 
error.  The elastic nature of the clasp-garter is 
self-demonstration of the <hi rend="italic">unusualness</hi> of the abbreviation.  What is 
made to adjust itself, must of necessity require foreign adjustment 
but rarely.  It must have been by an accident, in its strictest 
sense, that these garters of Marie needed the tightening described. 
They alone would have amply established her identity.  But it is 
not that the corpse was found to have the garters of the missing 
girl, or found to have her shoes, or her bonnet, or the flowers of 
her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar mark upon the arm, or her 
general size and appearance &mdash; it is that the corpse had each, and 
<hi rend="italic">all collectively</hi>.  Could it be proved that the editor of 
<hi rend="italic">L'Etoile really</hi> entertained a doubt, under the circumstances, 
there would be no need, in his case, of a commission <hi rend="italic">de lunatico 
inquirendo</hi>.  He has thought it sagacious to echo the small talk of 
the lawyers, who, for the most part, content themselves with 
echoing the rectangular precepts of the courts.  I would here 
observe that very much of what is rejected as evidence by a court 
is the best of evidence to the intellect.  For the court, 
guided itself by the general principles of evidence &mdash; the recognized 
and <hi rend="italic">booked</hi> principles &mdash; is averse from swerving at particular 
instances.  And this steadfast adherence to principle, with 
rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception, is a sure mode of 
attaining the <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> of attainable truth, in any long sequence 
of time.  The practice, <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>, is therefore philosophical; 
but it is not the less certain that it engenders vast individual 
error.<ref target="P14">14</ref>

<pb n="432"/>  

'In respect to the insinuations levelled at Beauvais, you will 
be willing to dismiss them in a breath.  You have already fathomed 
the true character of this good gentleman.  He is a <hi rend="italic">busy-body</hi>, 
with much of romance and little of wit.  Any one so constituted 
will readily so conduct himself, upon occasion of <hi rend="italic">real</hi> 
excitement, as to render himself liable to suspicion on the part of 
the over-acute, or the ill-disposed.  M. Beauvais (as it appears 
from your notes) had some personal interviews with the editor of 
<hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>, and offended him by venturing an opinion that the 
corpse, notwithstanding the theory of the editor, was, in sober 
fact, that of Marie.  "He persists," says the paper, "in asserting 
the corpse to be that of Marie, but cannot give a circumstance, in 
addition to those which we have commented upon, to make others 
believe."  Now, without re-adverting to the fact that stronger 
evidence "to make others believe", could <hi rend="italic">never</hi> have been 
adduced, it may be remarked that a man may very well be understood 
to believe, in a case of this kind, without the ability to advance 
a single reason for the belief of a second party.  Nothing is more 
vague than impressions of individual identity.  Each man recognizes 
his neighbour, yet there are few instances in which any one is 
prepared <hi rend="italic">to give a reason</hi> for his recognition.  The editor of 
<hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi> had no right to be offended at M. Beauvais' 
unreasoning belief. 
</p><p>'The suspicious circumstances which invest him, will be found 
to tally much better with my hypothesis of <hi rend="italic">romantic 
busy-bodyism</hi>, than with the reasoner's suggestion of guilt.  Once adopting the 
more charitable interpretation, we shall find no difficulty in 
comprehending the rose in the key-hole; the "Marie" upon the slate; 
the "elbowing the male relatives out of the way"; the "aversion to 
permitting them to see the body"; the caution given to Madame B&mdash;, 
that she must hold no conversation with the <hi rend="italic">gendarme</hi> until his 
(Beauvais') return; and, lastly, his apparent determination, "that 
nobody should have anything to do with the proceedings except 
himself".  It seems to me unquestionable that Beauvais was a suitor 
of Marie's; that she coquetted with him; and that he was ambitious 
of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy and confidence.  I 
shall say nothing more upon this point; and, as the evidence 
<pb n="433"/>  
fully 
rebuts the assertion of <hi rend="italic">L'Etoile</hi>, touching the matter of 
<hi rend="italic">apathy</hi> on the part of the mother and other relatives &mdash; an apathy 
inconsistent with the supposition of their believing the corpse to 
be that of the perfumery-girl &mdash; we shall now proceed as if the 
question of <hi rend="italic">identity</hi> were settled to our perfect satisfaction.' 
</p><p>'And what,' I here demanded, 'do you think of the opinions of 
<hi rend="italic">Le Commerciel</hi>?' 
</p><p>'That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than 
any which have been promulgated upon the subject.  The deductions 
from the premises are philosophical and acute; but the premises, in 
two instances, at least, are founded in imperfect observation. 
<hi rend="italic">Le Commerciel</hi> wishes to intimate that Marie was seized by some 
gang of low ruffians not far from her mother's door.  "It is 
impossible," it urges, "that a person so well known to thousands as 
this young woman was, should have passed three blocks without some 
one having seen her."  This is the idea of a man long resident in 
Paris &mdash; a public man &mdash; and one whose walks to and fro in the city 
have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices.  He 
is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his 
own <hi rend="italic">bureau</hi>, without being recognized and accosted.  And, 
knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance with others, and of 
others with him, he compares his notoriety with that of the 
perfumery-girl, finds no great difference between them, and reaches 
at once the conclusion that she, in her walks, would be equally 
liable to recognition with himself in his.  This could only be the 
case were her walks of the same unvarying methodical 
character, and within the same <hi rend="italic">species</hi> of limited region as are 
his own.  He passes to and fro, at regular intervals, within a 
confined periphery, abounding in individuals who are led to 
observation of his person through interest in the kindred nature of 
his occupation with their own.  But the walks of Marie may, in 
general, be supposed discursive.  In this particular instance, it 
will be understood as most probable that she proceeded upon a route 
of more than average diversity, from her accustomed ones.  The 
parallel which we imagine to have existed in the mind of <hi rend="italic">Le 
Commerciel</hi> would only be sustained in the event of the two 
individuals traversing the whole city.  In this case, granting the 
personal acquaintances to be equal, the chances would be also equal 
that an equal number of personal rencontres would be made.  For my 
own part, I should hold it not only as possible, but as far more 
than probable, that Marie might have proceeded, at any given 
period, by any one 
<pb n="434"/>  
of the many routes between her own residence and 
that of her aunt, without meeting a single individual whom she 
knew, or by whom she was known.  In viewing this question in its 
full and proper light, we must hold steadily in mind the great 
disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most 
noted individual in Paris, and the entire population of Paris 
itself. 
</p><p>'But whatever force there may still appear to be in the 
suggestion of <hi rend="italic">Le Commerciel</hi>, will be much diminished when we 
take into consideration <hi rend="italic">the hour</hi> at which the girl went abroad. 
"It was when the streets were full of people," says <hi rend="italic">Le 
Commerciel</hi>, "that she went out."  But not so.  It was nine o'clock 
in the morning.  Now at nine o'clock of every morning in the week, 
<hi rend="italic">with the exception of Sunday</hi>, the streets in the city are, it 
is true, thronged with people.  At nine on Sunday, the populace are 
chiefly within doors <hi rend="italic">preparing for church</hi>.  No observing person 
can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town, 
from about eight until ten on the morning of every Sabbath. 
Between ten and eleven the streets are thronged, but not at so 
early a period as that designated. 
</p><p>'There is another point at which there seems a deficiency of 
<hi rend="italic">observation</hi> on the part of <hi rend="italic">Le Commerciel</hi>.  "A piece," it 
says, "of one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long, 
and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin, 
and around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams.  This 
was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief."  Whether this 
idea is or is not well founded, we will endeavour to see hereafter; 
but by "fellows who have no pocket-handkerchiefs", the editor 
intends the lowest class of ruffians.  These, however, are the very 
description of people who will always be found to have 
handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts.  You must have had 
occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable, of late years, to 
the thorough blackguard, has become the pocket-handkerchief.' 
</p><p>'And what are we to think,' I said, 'of the article in <hi rend="italic">Le 
Soleil</hi>?' 
</p><p>'That it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrot &mdash; in 
which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his 
race.  He has merely repeated the individual items of the already 
published opinion; collecting them, with a laudible industry, from 
this paper and from that.  "The things had all <hi rend="italic">evidently</hi> been 
there," he says, "at least three or four weeks, and there can be 
<hi rend="italic">no doubt</hi> that the spot of this appalling outrage has been 
discovered."  The facts here re-stated by <hi rend="italic">Le Soleil</hi> are 
<pb n="435"/>  
very 
far indeed from removing my own doubts upon this subject, and we 
will examine them more particularly hereafter in connection with 
another division of the theme. 
</p><p>'At present we must occupy ourselves with other 
investigations.  You cannot fail to have remarked the extreme 
laxity of the examination of the corpse.  To be sure, the question 
of identity was readily determined, or should have been; but there 
were other points to be ascertained.  Had the body been in any 
respect <hi rend="italic">despoiled</hi>?  Had the deceased any articles of jewellery 
about her person upon leaving home? if so, had she any when found? 
These are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence; 
and there are others of equal moment, which have met with no 
attention.  We must endeavour to satisfy ourselves by personal 
inquiry.  The case of St Eustache must be re-examined.  I have no 
suspicion of this person; but let us proceed methodically.  We will 
ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the <hi rend="italic">affidavits</hi> in 
regard to his whereabouts on the Sunday.  Affidavits of this 
character are readily made matter of mystification.  Should there 
be nothing wrong here, however, we will dismiss St Eustache from 
our investigations.  His suicide, however, corroborative of suspicion, 
were there found to be deceit in the affidavits, 
is, without such deceit, in no respect an unaccountable 
circumstance, or one which need cause us to deflect from the line 
of ordinary analysis. 
</p><p>'In that which I now propose, we will discard the interior 
points of this tragedy, and concentrate our attention upon its 
outskirts.  Not the least usual error in investigations such as 
this is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate, with total 
disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events.  It is the 
malpractice of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to the 
bounds of apparent relevancy.  Yet experience has shown, and a true 
philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger, 
portion of truth arises from the seemingly irrelevant.  It is 
through the spirit of this principle, if not precisely through its 
letter, that modern science has resolved to <hi rend="italic">calculate upon the 
unforeseen</hi>.  But perhaps you do not comprehend me.  The history of 
human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or 
incidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most 
numerous and valuable discoveries, that it has at length become 
necessary, in prospective view of improvement, to make not only 
large, but the largest, allowances for inventions that shall arise 
by chance, and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation.  It 
is no longer philosophical to base 
<pb n="436"/>  
upon what has been a vision of 
what is to be.  <hi rend="italic">Accident</hi> is admitted as a portion of the 
substructure.  We make chance a matter of absolute calculation.  We 
subject the unlookedfor and unimagined to the mathematical 
<hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> of the schools. 
</p><p>'I repeat that it is more than fact that the <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> 
portion of all truth has sprung from the collateral; and it is but 
in accordance with the spirit of the principle involved in this 
fact that I would divert inquiry, in the present case, from the 
trodden and hitherto unfruitful ground of the event itself to the 
contemporary circumstances which surround it.  While you ascertain 
the validity of the affidavits, I will examine the newspapers more 
generally than you have as yet done.  So far, we have only 
reconnoitred the field of investigation; but it will be strange, 
indeed, if a comprehensive survey, such as I propose, of the public 
prints will not afford us some minute points which shall establish 
a <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> for inquiry.' 
</p><p>In pursuance of Dupin's suggestion, I made scrupulous 
examination of the affair of the affidavits.  The result was a firm 
conviction of their validity, and of the consequent 
innocence of St Eustache.  In the meantime my friend occupied 
himself, with what seemed to me a minuteness altogether objectless, 
in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files.  At the end of a week 
he placed before me the following extracts: 
</p><p>'About three years and a half ago, a disturbance very similar 
to the present was caused by the disappearance of this same Marie 
Roget from the <hi rend="italic">parfumerie</hi> of Monsieur Le Blanc, in the Palais 
Royal.  At the end of a week, however, she re-appeared at her 
customary <hi rend="italic">comptoir</hi>, as well as ever, with the exception of a 
slight paleness not altogether usual.  It was given out by Monsieur 
Le Blanc and her mother that she had merely been on a visit to some 
friend in the country; and the affair was speedily hushed up.  We 
presume that the present absence is a freak of the same nature, and 
that, at the expiration of a week or, perhaps, of a month, we shall 
have her among us again.'   
&mdash; <hi rend="italic">Evening Paper</hi>, Monday, June 23.<ref target="P15">15</ref> 
'An evening journal of yesterday refers to a former mysterious 
disappearance of Mademoiselle Roget.  It is well known that, during 
the week of her absence from Le Blanc's <hi rend="italic">parfumerie</hi>, she was in 
the company of a young naval officer much noted for his 
debaucheries.  A quarrel, it is supposed, providentially led to her 
return home.  We have the name of the Lothario in question, who is

shore the three passengers stepped out, and had proceeded so far as 
to be beyond the view of the boat, when the daughter discovered 
that she had left in it her parasol.  She returned for it, was 
seized by the gang, carried out into the stream, gagged, brutally 
treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point not far from

<pb n="438"/>  

Upon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to 
me irrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of 
them could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand.  I waited 
for some explanation from Dupin. 
</p><p>'It is not my present opinion,' he said, 'to <hi rend="italic">dwell</hi> upon 
the first and second of these extracts.  I have copied them chiefly 
to show you the extreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I 
can understand from the Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in 
any respect, with an examination of the naval officer alluded to. 
Yet it is mere folly to say that between the first and second 
disappearance of Marie there is no <hi rend="italic">supposable</hi> connection.  Let 
us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between 
the lovers, and the return home of the betrayed.  We are now 
prepared to view a second <hi rend="italic">elopement</hi> (if we <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that an 
elopement has again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the 
betrayer's advances, rather than as the result of new proposals by 
a second individual &mdash; we are prepared to regard it as a "making up" 
of the old <hi rend="italic">amour</hi>, rather than as the commencement of a new one. 
The chances are ten to one, that he who had once eloped with Marie 
would again propose an elopement, rather than that she to whom 
proposals of elopement had been made by one individual, should have 
them made to her by another.  And here let me call your attention 
to the fact, that the time elapsing between the first ascertained 
and the second supposed elopement is a few months more than the 
general period of the cruises of our men-of-war.  Had the lover 
been interrupted in his first villainy by the necessity of 
departure to sea, and had he seized the first moment of his return 
to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished &mdash; or not 
yet altogether accomplished <hi rend="italic">by him</hi>?  Of all these things we 
know nothing. 
</p><p>'You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there 
was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> elopement as imagined.  Certainly not &mdash; but are we 
prepared to say that there was not the frustrated design?  Beyond 
St Eustache, and perhaps Beauvais, we find no recognized, no open, 
no honourable suitors of Marie.  Of none other is there anything 
said.  Who, then, is the secret lover, of whom the relatives (<hi rend="italic">at 
least most of them</hi>) know nothing, but whom Marie meets upon the 
morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her confidence, that she 
hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening 
descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barriere du Roule?  Who is 
that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, <hi rend="italic">most</hi> of the 
relatives know nothing?  And what means the 
<pb n="439"/>  
singular prophecy of 
Madame Roget on the morning of Marie's departure &mdash; "I fear that I 
shall never see Marie again." 
</p><p>'But if we cannot imagine Madame Roget privy to the design of 
elopement, may we not at least suppose this design entertained by 
the girl?  Upon quitting home, she gave it to be understood that she 
was about to visit her aunt in the Rue des Dromes, and 
St Eustache was requested to call for her at dark.  Now, at first 
glance, this fact strongly militates against my suggestion; &mdash; but 
let us reflect.  That she <hi rend="italic">did</hi> meet some companion, and proceed 
with him across the river, reaching the Barriere du Roule at so 
late an hour as three o'clock in the afternoon, is known.  But in 
consenting so to accompany this individual (<hi rend="italic">for whatever 
purpose &mdash; to her mother known or unknown</hi>), she must have thought of 
her expressed intention when leaving home, and of the surprise and 
suspicion aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor, St 
Eustache, when, calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue 
des Dromes, he should find that she had not been there, and when, 
moreover, upon returning to the <hi rend="italic">pension</hi> with this alarming 
intelligence, he should become aware of her continued absence from 
home.  She must have thought of these things, I say.  She must have 
foreseen the chagrin of St Eustache, the suspicion of all.  She 
could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion; but 
the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her, if we 
suppose her <hi rend="italic">not</hi> intending to return. 
</p><p>'We may imagine her thinking thus &mdash; "I am to meet a certain 
person for the purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes 
known only to myself.  It is necessary that there be no chance of 
interruption &mdash; there must be a sufficient time given us to elude 
pursuit &mdash; I will give it to be understood that I shall visit and 
spend the day with my aunt at the Rue des Dromes &mdash; I will tell St 
Eustache not to call for me until dark &mdash; in this way, my absence 
from home for the longest possible period, without causing 
suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I shall gain more 
time than in any other manner.  If I bid St Eustache call for me at 
dark, he will be sure not to call before; but if I wholly neglect 
to bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it 
will be expected that I return the earlier, and my absence will the 
sooner excite anxiety.  Now, if it were my design to return <hi rend="italic">at 
all</hi> &mdash; if I had in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual 
in question &mdash; it would not be my policy to bid St Eustache call; 
for, calling, he will be <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> to ascertain that I have played 
him false &mdash; a fact of which I might keep him 
<pb n="440"/>  
for ever in ignorance, 
by leaving home without notifying him of my intention, by returning 
before dark, and by then stating that I had been to visit 
my aunt in the Rue des Dromes.  But, as it is my design <hi rend="italic">never</hi> 
to return &mdash; or not for some weeks &mdash; or not until certain concealments 
are effected &mdash; the gaining of time is the only point about which I 
need give myself any concern." 
</p><p>'You have observed, in your notes, that the most general 
opinion in relation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, 
that the girl had been the victim of a <hi rend="italic">gang</hi> of blackguards. 
Now, the popular opinion, under certain conditions, is not to be 
disregarded.  When arising of itself &mdash; when manifesting itself in a 
strictly spontaneous manner &mdash; we should look upon it as analogous 
with that <hi rend="italic">intuition</hi> which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual 
man of genius.  In ninety-nine cases from the hundred I would abide 
by its decision.  But it is important that we find no palpable 
traces of <hi rend="italic">suggestion</hi>.  The opinion must be rigorously <hi rend="italic">the 
public's own</hi>; and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult 
to perceive and to maintain.  In the present instance, it appears 
to me that this "public opinion", in respect to a <hi rend="italic">gang</hi>, has 
been superinduced by the collateral event which is detailed in the 
third of my extracts.  All Paris is excited by the discovered 
corpse of Marie, a girl young, beautiful, and notorious.  This 
corpse is found, bearing marks of violence, and floating in the 
river.  But it is now made known that, at the very period, or about 
the very period, in which it is supposed that the girl was 
assassinated, an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the 
deceased, although less in extent, was perpetrated, by a gang of 
young ruffians, upon the person of a second young female.  Is it 
wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular 
judgment in regard to the other unknown?  This judgment awaited 
direction, and the known outrage seemed so opportunely to afford 
it!  Marie, too, was found in the river; and upon this very river 
was this known outrage committed?  The connection of the two events 
had about it so much of the palpable that the true wonder would 
have been a <hi rend="italic">failure</hi> of the populace to appreciate and to seize 
it.  But, in fact, the one atrocity, known to be so committed, is, 
if anything, evidence that the other, committed at a time nearly 
coincident, was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> so committed.  It would have been a 
miracle, indeed, if, while a gang of ruffians were perpetrating, at 
a given locality, a most unheard-of wrong, there should 
have been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the same 
city, under the same circumstances, with the same means and 
appliances, 
<pb n="441"/>  
engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at 
precisely the same period of time!  Yet in what, if not in this 
marvellous train of coincidence, does the accidentally 
<hi rend="italic">suggested</hi> opinion of the populace call upon us to believe? 
</p><p>'Before proceeding further, let us consider the supposed scene 
of the assassination, in the thicket at the Barriere du Roule. 
This thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public 
road.  Within were three or four large stones forming a kind of 
seat with a back and a footstool.  On the upper stone was 
discovered a white petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf.  A 
parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. 
The handkerchief bore the name "Marie Roget".  Fragments of dress 
were seen on the branches around.  The earth was trampled, the 
bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a violent 
struggle. 
</p><p>'Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of 
this thicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with 
which it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, 
it must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt. 
That it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the scene, I may or I may not believe &mdash; but there 
was excellent reason for doubt.  Had the <hi rend="italic">true</hi> scene been, as 
<hi rend="italic">Le Commerciel</hi> suggested, in the neighbourhood of the Rue Pavee St 
Andree, the perpetrators of the crime, supposing them still 
resident in Paris, would naturally have been stricken with terror 
at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper 
channel; and, in certain classes of minds, there would have arisen, 
at once, a sense of the necessity of some exertion to redivert the 
attention.  And thus, the thicket of the Barriere du Roule having 
been already suspected, the idea of placing the articles where they 
were found, might have been naturally entertained.  There is no 
real evidence, although <hi rend="italic">Le Soleil</hi> so supposes, that the 
articles discovered had been more than a few days in the thicket; 
while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not have 
remained there, without attracting attention, during the twenty 
days elapsing between the fatal Sunday and the afternoon upon which 
they were found by the boys.  "They were all <hi rend="italic">mildewed</hi> down 
hard," says <hi rend="italic">Le Soleil</hi>, adopting the opinions of its 
predecessors, "with the action of the rain and stuck 
together from <hi rend="italic">mildew</hi>.  The grass had grown around and over some 
of them.  The silk of the parasol was strong, but the threads of it 
were run together within.  The upper part, where it had been 
doubled and folded, was all <hi rend="italic">mildewed</hi> and rotten, and tore on 
being opened."  In respect to 
<pb n="442"/>  
the grass having "grown around and 
over some of them", it is obvious that the fact could only have 
been ascertained from the words, and thus from the recollections, 
of two small boys; for these boys removed the articles and took 
them home before they had been seen by a third party.  But the 
grass will grow, especially in warm and damp weather (such as was 
that of the period of the murder), as much as two or three inches 
in a single day.  A parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground, 
might, in a single week, be entirely concealed from sight by the 
upspringing grass.  And touching that <hi rend="italic">mildew</hi> upon which the 
editor of <hi rend="italic">Le Soleil</hi> so pertinaciously insists, that he employs 
the words no less than three times in the brief paragraph just 
quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this <hi rend="italic">mildew</hi>?  Is 
he to be told that it is one of many classes of <hi rend="italic">fungus</hi>, of 
which the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence 
within twenty-four hours? 
</p><p>'Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most 
triumphantly adduced in support of the idea that the articles had 
been "for at least three or four weeks" in the thicket, is most 
absurdly null as regards any evidence of that fact.  On the other 
hand, it is exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles 
could have remained in the thicket specified for a longer period 
than a single week &mdash; for a longer period than from one Sunday to the 
next.  Those who know anything of the vicinity of Paris, know the 
extreme difficulty of finding <hi rend="italic">seclusion</hi>, unless at a great 
distance from its suburbs.  Such a thing as an unexplored or even 
an unfrequently visited recess, amid its woods or groves, is not 
for a moment to be imagined.  Let any one who, being at heart a 
lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of 
this great metropolis &mdash; let any such one attempt, even during the 
week-days, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of 
natural loveliness which immediately surround us.  At every second 
step, he will find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and 
personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing 
blackguards.  He will seek privacy amid the densest foliage 
all in vain.  Here are the very nooks where the unwashed most 
abound &mdash; here are the temples most desecrate.  With sickness of the 
heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted Paris as to a 
less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution.  But if the 
vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the 
week, how much more so on the Sabbath!  It is now especially that, 
released from the claims of labour, or deprived of the customary 
opportunities of crime, the town blackguard seeks 
<pb n="443"/>  
the precincts of 
the town, not through love of the rural, which in his heart he 
despises, but by way of escape from the restraints and 
conventionalities of society.  He desires less the fresh air and 
the green trees, than the utter <hi rend="italic">licence</hi> of the country.  Here 
at the roadside inn, or beneath the foliage of the woods, he 
indulges, unchecked by any eye except those of his boon companions, 
in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity &mdash; the joint 
offspring of liberty and of rum.  I say nothing more than what must 
be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that the 
circumstance of the articles in question having remained 
undiscovered, for a longer period than from one Sunday to another, 
in <hi rend="italic">any</hi> thicket in the immediate neighbourhood of Paris, is to 
be looked upon as little less than miraculous. 
</p><p>'But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion 
that the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of 
diverting attention from the real scene of the outrage.  And, 
first, let me direct your notice to the <hi rend="italic">date</hi> of the discovery 
of the articles.  Collate this with the date of the fifth extract 
made by myself from the newspapers.  You will find that the 
discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent communications 
sent to the evening paper.  These communications, although various, 
and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same point &mdash; 
viz., the directing of attention to a <hi rend="italic">gang</hi> as the perpetrators 
of the outrage, and to the neighbourhood of the Barriere du Roule 
as its scene.  Now, here, of course, the situation is not that, in 
consequence of these communications, or of the public attention by 
them directed, the articles were found by the boys; but the 
suspicion might and may well have been, that the articles were not 
<hi rend="italic">before</hi> found by the boys, for the reason that the articles had 
not before been in the thicket; having been deposited there only at 
so late a period as at the date, or shortly prior to the 
date of the communications, by the guilty authors of these 
communications themselves. 
</p><p>'This thicket was a singular &mdash; an exceedingly singular one.  It 
was unusually dense.  Within its natural walled enclosure were 
three extraordinary stones, <hi rend="italic">forming a seat with a back and a 
footstool</hi>.  And this thicket, so full of art, was in the immediate 
vicinity, <hi rend="italic">within a few rods</hi>, of the dwelling of Madame Deluc, 
whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the shrubberies 
about them in search of the bark of the sassafras.  Would it be a 
rash wager &mdash; a wager of one thousand to one &mdash; that a <hi rend="italic">day</hi> never 
passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of 
them ensconced in the umbrageous hall, and enthroned upon 
<pb n="444"/>  
its 
natural throne?  Those who would hesitate at such a wager, have 
either never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the boyish 
nature.  I repeat &mdash; it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the 
articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered, for a 
longer period than one or two days; and that thus there is good 
ground for suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of <hi rend="italic">Le 
Soleil</hi>, that they were, at a comparatively late date, deposited 
where found. 
</p><p>But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing 
them so deposited, than any which I have as yet urged.  And, now, 
let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the 
articles.  On the <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> stone lay a white petticoat; on the 
<hi rend="italic">second</hi>, a silk scarf; scattered around, were a parasol, gloves, 
and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name "Marie Roget".  Here is 
just such an arrangement as would <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi> be made by a 
not-over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles <hi rend="italic">naturally</hi>. 
But it is by no means a <hi rend="italic">really</hi> natural arrangement.  I should 
rather have looked to see the things <hi rend="italic">all</hi> lying on the ground 
and trampled under foot.  In the narrow limits of that bower, it 
would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf 
should have retained a position upon the stones, when subjected to 
the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons.  "There was 
evidence," it is said, "of a struggle; and the earth was trampled, 
the bushes were broken," &mdash; but the petticoat and the scarf are found 
deposited as if upon shelves.  "The pieces of the frock torn out by 
the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long.  One 
part was the hem of the frock, and it had been mended. 
They <hi rend="italic">looked like strips torn off</hi>."  Here, inadvertently, <hi rend="italic">Le 
Soleil</hi> has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase.  The pieces, 
as described, do indeed "look like strips torn off"; but purposely 
and by hand.  It is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is 
"torn off", from any garment such as is now in question, by the 
agency <hi rend="italic">of a thorn</hi>.  From the very nature of such fabrics, a 
thorn or nail becoming tangled in them, tears them rectangularly &mdash; 
divides them into two longitudinal rents, at right angles with each 
other, and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters &mdash; but it is 
scarcely possible to conceive the piece "torn off".  I never so 
knew it, nor did you.  To tear a piece <hi rend="italic">off</hi> from such fabric, 
two distinct forces, in different directions, will be, in almost 
every case, required.  If there be two edges to the fabric &mdash; if, for 
example, it be a pocket-handkerchief, and it is desired to tear 
from it a slip, then, and then only, will the one force serve the 
<pb n="445"/>  
purpose.  But in the present case the question is of a dress, 
presenting but one edge.  To tear a piece from the interior, where 
no edge is presented, could only be effected by a miracle through 
the agency of thorns, and no <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thorn could accomplish it. 
But, even where an edge is presented, two thorns will be necessary, 
operating, the one in two distinct directions, and the other in 
one.  And this in the supposition that the edge is unhemmed.  If 
hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question.  We thus see the 
numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being "torn off" 
through the simple agency of "thorns"; yet we are required to 
believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn. 
"And one part," too, <hi rend="italic">"was the hem of the frock</hi>!"  Another piece 
was <hi rend="italic">"part of the skirt, not the hem"</hi>, &mdash; that is to say, was torn 
completely out, through the agency of thorns, from the unedged 
interior of the dress!  These, I say, are things which one may well 
be pardoned for disbelieving; yet, taken collectedly, they form, 
perhaps, less of reasonable ground for suspicion, than the one 
startling circumstance of the articles having been left in this 
thicket at all, by any <hi rend="italic">murderers</hi> who had enough precaution to 
think of removing the corpse.  You will not have apprehended me 
rightly, however, if you suppose it my design to <hi rend="italic">deny</hi> this 
thicket as the scene of the outrage.  There might have been a wrong 
<hi rend="italic">here</hi>, or, more possibly, an accident at Madame Deluc's.  But, 
in fact, this is a point of minor importance.  We are not 
engaged in an attempt to discover the scene, but to produce the 
perpetrators of the murder.  What I have adduced, notwithstanding 
the minuteness with which I have adduced it, has been with the 
view, first, to show the folly of the positive and headlong 
assertions of <hi rend="italic">Le Soleil</hi>, but secondly and chiefly, to bring 
you, by the most natural route, to further contemplation of the 
doubt whether this assassination has, or has not, been the work of 
a <hi rend="italic">gang</hi>. 
</p><p>'We will resume this question by mere allusion to the 
revolting details of the surgeon examined at the inquest.  It is 
only necessary to say that his published <hi rend="italic">inferences</hi>, in regard 
to the number of the ruffians, have been properly ridiculed as 
unjust and totally baseless, by all the reputable anatomists of 
Paris.  Not that the matter <hi rend="italic">might not</hi> have been as inferred, 
but that there was no ground for the inference: &mdash; was there not much 
for another? 
</p><p>'Let us now reflect upon "the traces of a struggle"; and let 
me ask what these traces have been supposed to demonstrate.  A 
gang.  But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a 
<pb n="446"/>  
gang? 
What <hi rend="italic">struggle</hi> could have taken place &mdash; what struggle so violent 
and so enduring as to have left its "traces" in all directions &mdash; 
between a weak and defenceless girl and the <hi rend="italic">gang</hi> of ruffians 
imagined?  The silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have 
been over.  The victim must have been absolutely passive at their 
will.  You will here bear in mind that the arguments used against 
the thicket as the scene, are applicable, in chief part, only 
against it as the scene of an outrage committed by <hi rend="italic">more than a 
single individual</hi>.  If we imagine but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> violator, we can 
conceive, and thus only conceive, the struggle of so violent and so 
obstinate a nature as to have left the "traces" apparent. 
</p><p>'And again.  I have already mentioned the suspicion to be 
excited by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to 
remain <hi rend="italic">at all</hi> in the thicket where discovered.  It seems almost 
impossible that these evidences of guilt should have been 
accidentally left where found.  There was sufficient presence of 
mind (it is supposed) to remove the corpse; and yet a more positive 
evidence than the corpse itself (whose features might have been 
quickly obliterated by decay), is allowed to lie conspicuously in 
the scene of the outrage &mdash; I allude to the handkerchief with the 
<hi rend="italic">name</hi> of the deceased.  If this was accident, it was not 
the accident <hi rend="italic">of a gang</hi>.  We can imagine it only the accident of 
an individual.  Let us see.  An individual has committed the 
murder.  He is alone with the ghost of the departed.  He is 
appalled by what lies motionless before him.  The fury of his 
passion is over, and there is abundant room in his heart for the 
natural awe of the deed.  His is none of that confidence which the 
presence of numbers inevitably inspires.  He is <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> with the 
dead.  He trembles and is bewildered.  Yet there is a necessity for 
disposing of the corpse.  He bears it to the river, and leaves 
behind him the other evidences of his guilt; for it is difficult, 
if not impossible, to carry all the burthen at once, and it will be 
easy to return for what is left.  But in his toilsome journey to 
the water his fears redouble within him.  The sounds of life 
encompass his path.  A dozen times he hears or fancies he hears the 
step of an observer.  Even the very lights from the city bewilder 
him.  Yet, in time, and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony, 
he reaches the river's brink, and disposes of his ghastly charge &mdash; 
perhaps through the medium of a boat.  But <hi rend="italic">now</hi> what treasure 
does the world hold &mdash; what threat of vengeance could it hold out &mdash; 
which would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer 
over that toilsome and perilous 
<pb n="447"/>  
path, to the thicket and its blood-chilling recollections?  He returns <hi rend="italic">not</hi>, let the consequences 
be what they may.  He <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not return if he would.  His sole 
thought is immediate escape.  He turns his back <hi rend="italic">for ever</hi> upon 
those dreadful shrubberies, and flees as from the wrath to come. 
</p><p>'But how with a gang?  Their number would have inspired them 
with confidence; if, indeed, confidence is ever wanting in the 
breast of the arrant blackguard; and of arrant blackguards alone 
are the supposed <hi rend="italic">gangs</hi> ever constituted.  Their number, I say, 
would have prevented the bewildering and unreasoning terror which 
I have imagined to paralyse the single man.  Could we suppose an 
oversight in one, or two, or three, this oversight would have been 
remedied by a fourth.  They would have left nothing behind them; 
for their number would have enabled them to carry <hi rend="italic">all</hi> at once. 
There would have been no need of <hi rend="italic">return</hi>. 
</p><p>'Consider now the circumstance that, in the outer garment of 
the corpse when found, "a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn 
upward from the bottom hem to the waist, wound three times 
round the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back".  This 
was done with the obvious design of affording <hi rend="italic">a handle</hi> by which 
to carry the body.  But would any <hi rend="italic">number</hi> of men have dreamed of 
resorting to such an expedient?  To three or four, the limbs of the 
corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient, but the best 
possible, hold.  The device is that of a single individual; and 
this brings us to the fact that "between the thicket and the river 
the rails of the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore 
evident traces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it"! 
But would a <hi rend="italic">number</hi> of men have put themselves to the 
superfluous trouble of taking down a fence, for the purpose of 
dragging through it a corpse which they might have <hi rend="italic">lifted over</hi> 
any fence in an instant?  Would a <hi rend="italic">number</hi> of men have so 
<hi rend="italic">dragged</hi> a corpse at all as to have left evident <hi rend="italic">traces</hi> of the 
dragging? 
</p><p>'And here we must refer to an observation of <hi rend="italic">Le 
Commerciel</hi>; an observation upon which I have already, in some 
measure, commented.  "A piece," says this journal, "of one of the 
unfortunate girl's petticoats was torn out and tied under her chin, 
and around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams.  This 
was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs." 
</p><p>'I have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never 
<hi rend="italic">without</hi> a pocket-handkerchief.  But it is not to this fact that I 
now specially advert.  That it was not through want of a 
<pb n="448"/>  
handkerchief for the purpose imagined by <hi rend="italic">Le Commerciel</hi>, that 
this bandage was employed, is rendered apparent by the handkerchief 
left in the thicket; and that the object was not "to prevent 
screams" appears, also, from the bandage having been employed in 
preference to what would so much better have answered the purpose. 
But the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in question as 
"found round the neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard 
knot".  These words are sufficiently vague, but differ materially 
from those of <hi rend="italic">Le Commerciel</hi>.  The slip was eighteen inches 
wide, and therefore, although of muslin, would form a strong band 
when folded or rumpled longitudinally.  And thus rumpled it was 
discovered.  My inference is this.  The solitary murderer, having 
borne the corpse for some distance (whether from the thicket or 
elsewhere) by means of the bandage <hi rend="italic">hitched</hi> around its middle, 
found the weight, in this mode of procedure, too much for his 
strength.  He resolved to drag the burthen &mdash; the evidence goes 
to show that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> dragged.  With this object in view, it 
became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of the 
extremities.  It could be best attached about the neck, where the 
head would prevent its slipping off.  And now the murderer 
bethought him, unquestionably, of the bandage about the loins.  He 
would have used this, but for its volution about the corpse, the 
<hi rend="italic">hitch</hi> which embarrassed it, and the reflection that it had not 
been "torn off" from the garment.  It was easier to tear a new slip 
from the petticoat.  He tore it, made it fast about the neck, and 
so <hi rend="italic">dragged</hi> his victim to the brink of the river.  That this 
"bandage", only attainable with trouble and delay, and but 
imperfectly answering its purpose &mdash; that this bandage was employed 
<hi rend="italic">at all</hi>, demonstrates that the necessity for its employment 
sprang from circumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief 
was no longer attainable &mdash; that is to say, arising, as we have 
imagined, after quitting the thicket (if the thicket it was), and 
on the road between the thicket and the river. 
</p><p>'But the evidence, you will say, of Madame Deluc (!) points 
especially to the presence of a <hi rend="italic">gang</hi> in the vicinity of the 
thicket, at or about the epoch of the murder.  This I grant.  I 
doubt if there were not a <hi rend="italic">dozen</hi> gangs, such as described by 
Madame Deluc, in and about the vicinity of the Barriere du Roule at 
<hi rend="italic">or about</hi> the period of this tragedy.  But the gang which has 
drawn upon itself the pointed animadversion, although the somewhat 
tardy and very suspicious evidence of Madame Deluc, is the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> 
gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous 
<pb n="449"/>  
old lady as 
having eaten her cakes, and swallowed her brandy, without putting 
themselves to the trouble of making her payment.  <hi rend="italic">Et hinc illae 
irae</hi>? 
</p><p>'But what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the precise evidence of Madame Deluc?  "A 
gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate 
and drank without making payment, followed in the route of the 
young man and the girl, returned to the inn <hi rend="italic">about dusk</hi>, and 
re-crossed the river as if in great haste." 
</p><p>'Now, this "great haste" very possibly seemed <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> 
haste in the eyes of Madame Deluc, since she dwelt lingeringly and 
lamentingly upon her violated cakes and ale, &mdash; cakes and ale for 
which she might still have entertained a faint hope of 
compensation.  Why, otherwise, since it was <hi rend="italic">about dusk</hi>, should 
she make a point of the <hi rend="italic">haste</hi>?  It is no cause for wonder, 
surely, that a gang of blackguards should make <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> to get 
home when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats, when storm 
impends, and when night <hi rend="italic">approaches</hi> 
</p><p>'I say <hi rend="italic">approaches</hi>; for the night had <hi rend="italic">not yet arrived</hi>. 
It was only <hi rend="italic">about dusk</hi> that the indecent haste of these 
"miscreants" offended the sober eyes of Madame Deluc.  But we are 
told that it was upon this very evening that Madame Deluc, as well 
as her eldest son, "heard the screams of a female in the vicinity 
of the inn".  And in what words does Madame Deluc designate the 
period of the evening at which these screams were heard?  "It was 
<hi rend="italic">soon after dark</hi>," she says.  But "soon <hi rend="italic">after</hi> dark" is at 
least <hi rend="italic">dark</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">"about dusk"</hi> is as certainly daylight. 
Thus it is abundantly clear that the gang quitted the Barriere du 
Roule <hi rend="italic">prior</hi> to the screams overheard (?) by Madame Deluc.  And 
although, in all the many reports of the evidence, the relative 
expressions in question are distinctly and invariably employed just 
as I have employed them in this conversation with yourself, no 
notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has, as yet, been taken by 
any of the public journals, or by any of the myrmidons of police. 
</p><p>'I shall add but one to the arguments against <hi rend="italic">a gang</hi>; but 
this <hi rend="italic">one</hi> has, to my own understanding at least, a weight 
altogether irresistible.  Under the circumstances of large reward 
offered, and full pardon to any king's evidence, it is not to be 
imagined, for a moment, that some member of <hi rend="italic">a gang</hi> of low 
ruffians, or of any body of men, would not long ago have betrayed 
his accomplices.  Each one of a gang, so placed, is not so much 
greedy of reward, or anxious for escape, as <hi rend="italic">fearful of 
betrayal</hi>.  He betrays eagerly and early that <hi rend="italic">he may not himself 
be betrayed</hi>. 
<pb n="450"/>  
That the secret has not been divulged is the very 
best of proof that it is, in fact, a secret.  The horrors of this 
dark deed are known only to <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, or two, living human beings, 
and to God. 
</p><p>'Let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long 
analysis.  We have attained the idea either of a fatal accident 
under the roof of Madame Deluc, or of a murder perpetrated in the 
thicket at the Barriere du Roule, by a lover, or at least by an 
intimate and secret associate of the deceased.  The associate 
is of swarthy complexion.  This complexion, the "hitch" in the 
bandage, and the "sailor's knot" with which the bonnet-ribbon is 
tied, point to a seaman.  His companionship with the deceased &mdash; a 
gay but not abject young girl &mdash; designates him as above the grade of 
the common sailor.  Here the well-written and urgent communications 
to the journals are much in the way of corroboration.  The 
circumstance of the first elopement, as mentioned by <hi rend="italic">Le 
Mercure</hi>, tends to blend the idea of this seaman with that of the 
"naval officer" who is first known to have led the unfortunate into 
crime. 
</p><p>'And here, most fitly, comes the consideration of the 
continued absence of him of the dark complexion.  Let me pause to 
observe that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy; it was 
no common swarthiness which constituted the <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> point of 
resemblance, both as regards Valence and Madame Deluc.  But why is 
this man absent?  Was he murdered by the gang?  If so, why are 
there only <hi rend="italic">traces</hi> of the assassinated <hi rend="italic">girl</hi>?  The scene of 
the two outrages will naturally be supposed identical.  And where 
is his corpse?  The assassins would most probably have disposed of 
both in the same way.  But it may be said that this man lives, and 
is deterred from making himself known through dread of being 
charged with the murder.  This consideration might be supposed to 
operate upon him now &mdash; at this late period &mdash; since it has been given 
in evidence that he was seen with Marie, but it would have had no 
force at the period of the deed.  The first impulse of an innocent 
man would have been to announce the outrage, and to aid in 
identifying the ruffians.  This <hi rend="italic">policy</hi> would have suggested. 
He had been seen with the girl.  He had crossed the river with her 
in an open ferry-boat.  The denouncing of the assassins would have 
appeared, even to an idiot, the surest and sole means of relieving 
himself from suspicion.  We cannot suppose him, on the night of the 
fatal Sunday, both innocent himself and incognizant of an outrage 
committed.  Yet only under such circumstances 
<pb n="451"/>  
is it possible to 
imagine that he would have failed, if alive, in the denouncement of 
the assassins. 
</p><p>'And what means are ours of attaining the truth?  We shall 
find these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we 
proceed.  Let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first 
elopement.  Let us know the full history of "the officer", 
with his present circumstances, and his whereabouts at the precise 
period of the murder.  Let us carefully compare with each other the 
various communications sent to the evening paper, in which the 
object was to inculpate <hi rend="italic">a gang</hi>.  This done, let us compare 
these communications, both as regards style and MS, with those sent 
to the morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so 
vehemently upon the guilt of Mennais.  And, all this done, let us 
again compare these various communications with the known MSS of 
the officer.  Let us endeavour to ascertain, by repeated 
questionings of Madame Deluc and her boys, as well as of the 
omnibus-driver, Valence, something more of the personal appearance 
and bearing of the "man of dark complexion".  Queries, skilfully 
directed, will not fail to elicit, from some of these parties, 
information on this particular point (or upon others) &mdash; information 
which the parties themselves may not even be aware of possessing. 
And let us now trace <hi rend="italic">the boat</hi> picked up by the bargeman on the 
morning of Monday the twenty-third of June, and which was removed 
from the barge-office, without the cognizance of the officer in 
attendance, and <hi rend="italic">without the rudder</hi>, at some period prior to the 
discovery of the corpse.  With a proper caution and perseverance we 
shall infallibly trace this boat; for not only can the bargeman who 
picked it up identify it, but the <hi rend="italic">rudder is at hand</hi>.  The 
rudder <hi rend="italic">of a sail boat</hi> would not have been abandoned without 
inquiry, by one altogether at ease in heart.  And here let me pause 
to insinuate a question.  There was no <hi rend="italic">advertisement</hi> of the 
picking up of this boat.  It was silently taken to the 
barge-office, and as silently removed.  But its owner or employer &mdash; how 
<hi rend="italic">happened</hi> he, at so early a period on Tuesday morning, to be 
informed, without the agency of advertisement, of the locality of 
the boat taken up on Monday, unless we imagine some connection with 
the <hi rend="italic">navy</hi> &mdash; some personal permanent connection leading to 
cognizance of its minute interests &mdash; its petty local news? 
</p><p>'In speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the 
shore, I have already suggested the probability of his availing 
himself <hi rend="italic">of a boat</hi>.  Now we are to understand that Marie Roget 
<hi rend="italic">was</hi> precipitated from a boat.  This would naturally 
<pb n="452"/>  
have been 
the case.  The corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow waters 
of the shore.  The peculiar marks on the back and 
shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat.  That 
the body was found without weight is also corroborative of the 
idea.  If thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached. 
We can only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to 
have neglected the precaution of supplying himself with it before 
pushing off.  In the act of consigning the corpse to the water he 
would unquestionably have noticed his oversight; but then no remedy 
would have been at hand.  Any risk would have been preferred to a 
return to that accursed shore.  Having rid himself of his ghastly 
charge, the murderer would have hastened to the city.  There, at 
some obscure wharf, he would have leaped on land.  But the boat, 
would he have secured it?  He would have been in too great haste 
for such things as securing a boat.  Moreover, in fastening it to 
the wharf, he would have felt as if securing evidence against 
himself.  His natural thought would have been to cast from him, as 
far as possible, all that held connection with his crime.  He would 
not only have fled from the wharf, but he would have cast it 
adrift.  Let us pursue our fancies. &mdash;   In the morning, the wretch 
is stricken with unutterable horror at finding that the boat has 
been picked up and detained at a locality which he is in the daily 
habit of frequenting &mdash; at a locality, perhaps, which his duty 
compels him to frequent.  The next night, <hi rend="italic">without daring to ask 
for the rudder</hi>, he removes it.  Now <hi rend="italic">where</hi> is that rudderless 
boat?  Let it be one of our first purposes to discover.  With the 
first glimpse we obtain of it, the dawn of our success shall begin. 
This boat shall guide us, with a rapidity which will surprise even 
ourselves, to him who employed it in the midnight of the fatal 
Sabbath.  Corroboration will rise upon corroboration, and the 
murderer will be traced.' 
 
</p><p>[For reasons which we shall not specify, but which to many 
readers will appear obvious, we have taken the liberty of here 
omitting, from the MSS placed in our hands, such portion as details 
the <hi rend="italic">following up</hi> of the apparently slight clue obtained by 
Dupin.  We feel it advisable only to state, in brief, that the 
result desired was brought to pass; and that the Prefect fulfilled 
punctually, although with reluctance, the terms of his compact with the 
Chevalier.  Mr Poe's article concludes with the 
following words.   &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Eds</hi>.]<ref target="P22">22</ref>

It will be understood that I speak of coincidences and <hi rend="italic">no 
more</hi>.  What I have said above upon this topic must suffice.  In my 
own heart there dwells no faith in praeter-nature.  That Nature and 
its God are two, no man who thinks will deny.  That the latter, 
creating the former, can, at will, control or modify it, is also 
unquestionable.  I say 'at will'; for the question is of will, and 
not, as the insanity of logic has assumed, of power.  It is not 
that the Deity <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> modify his laws, but that we insult him 
in imagining a possible necessity for modification.  In their 
origin these laws were fashioned to embrace <hi rend="italic">all</hi> contingencies 
which <hi rend="italic">could</hi> lie in the Future.  With God all is <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>. 
</p><p>I repeat, then, that I speak of these things only as of 
coincidences.  And further: in what I relate it will be seen that 
between the fate of the unhappy Mary Cecilia Rogers, so far as that 
fate is known, and the fate of one Marie Roget up to a certain 
epoch in her history, there has existed a parallel in the 
contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude the reason becomes 
embarrassed.  I say all this will be seen.  But let it not for a 
moment be supposed that, in proceeding with the sad narrative of 
Marie from the epoch just mentioned, and in tracing to its 
<hi rend="italic">denouement</hi> the mystery which enshrouded her, it is my covert 
design to hint at an extension of the parallel, or even to suggest 
that the measures adopted in Paris for the discovery of the 
assassin of a <hi rend="italic">grisette</hi>, or measures founded in any similar 
ratiocination, would produce any similar result. 
</p><p>For, in respect to the latter branch of the supposition, it 
should be considered that the most trifling variation in the facts 
of the two cases might give rise to the most important 
miscalculations, by diverting thoroughly the two courses of events; 
very much as, in arithmetic, an error which, in its own 
individuality, may be inappreciable, produces at length, by dint of 
multiplication at all points of the process, a result enormously at 
variance with truth.  And, in regard to the former branch, we must 
not fail to hold in view that the very Calculus of Probabilities to 
which I have referred, forbids all idea of the extension of the parallel, &mdash; 
forbids it with a positiveness strong and decided just in 
proportion as this parallel has been already long-drawn and exact. 
This is one of those anomalous propositions which, seemingly, 
appealing to thought altogether apart from the mathematical, is yet 
one which only the mathematician can fully entertain.  Nothing, for 
example, is more difficult than to convince the merely general 
reader 
<pb n="454"/>  
that the fact of sixes having been thrown twice in 
succession by a player at dice, is sufficient cause for betting the 
largest odds that sixes will not be thrown in the third attempt. 
A suggestion to this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at 
once.  It does not appear that the two throws which have been 
completed, and which lie now absolutely in the Past, can have 
influence upon the throw which exists only in the Future.  The 
chance for throwing sixes seems to be precisely as it was at any 
ordinary time &mdash; that is to say, subject only to the influence of the 
various other throws which may be made by the dice.  And this is a 
reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to 
controvert it are received more frequently with a derisive smile 
than with anything like respectful attention.  The error here 
involved &mdash; a gross error redolent of mischief &mdash; I cannot pretend to 
expose within the limits assigned me at present; and with the 
philosophical it needs no exposure.  It may be sufficient here to 
say that it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which arise 
in the path of Reason through her propensity for seeking truth 
<hi rend="italic">in detail</hi>. 
</p> 
 
<note id="P0"><seg type="note-symbol">*.</seg> <p>Upon the original publication of <hi rend="italic">Marie 
Roget</hi>, the foot-notes now appended were considered unnecessary; but the 
lapse of several years since the tragedy upon which the tale is based, 
renders it expedient to give them, and also to say a few words in 
explanation of the general design.  A young girl, <hi rend="italic">Mary Cecilia 
Rogers</hi>, was murdered in the vicinity of New York; and although her 
death occasioned an intense and long-enduring excitement, the 
mystery attending it had remained unsolved at the period when the 
present paper was written and published (November, 1842).  Herein, 
under pretence of relating the fate of a Parisian <hi rend="italic">grisette</hi>, the 
author has followed, in minute detail, the essential, while merely 
paralleling the inessential, facts of the real murder of Mary 
Rogers.  Thus all argument upon the fiction is applicable to the 
truth; and the investigation of the truth was the object. 
 
<hi rend="italic">The Mystery of Marie Roget</hi> was composed at a distance from 
the scene of the atrocity, and with no other means of investigation 
than the newspapers afforded.  Thus much escaped the writer of 
which he could have availed himself had he been upon the spot and 
visited the localities.  It may not be improper to record, 
nevertheless, that the confessions of <hi rend="italic">two</hi> persons (one of them 
the Madame Deluc of the narrative), made, at different periods, 
long subsequent to the publication, confirmed, in full, not only 
the general conclusion, but absolutely <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the chief 
hypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained.
