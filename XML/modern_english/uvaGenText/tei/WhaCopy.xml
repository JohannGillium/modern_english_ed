<head>Wharton, Edith.  "'Copy': A Dialogue."   
<lb/> <hi rend="italic"> Scribner's Magazine</hi> 27 (June 1900): 657-663. 
</head> 
<pb n="657"/>  
<p> 
MRS. AMBROSE DALE&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> forty, slender, still young&mdash;sits in her 
drawing-room at the tea-table.  The winter twilight is 
falling, a lamp has been lit, there is a fire on the hearth, 
and the room is pleasantly dim and flower-scented.  Books are 
scattered everywhere&mdash;mostly with autograph inscriptions "From 
the Author"&mdash;and a large portrait of MRS. DALE at her 
desk, with papers strewn about her, takes up one of the wall-panels.  Before MRS. DALE stands HILDA, fair and 
twenty, her hands full of letters.</hi> 
</p> 
<p>MRS. DALE.  Ten more applications for autographs?  Isn't strange that people who'd blush to borrow twenty dollars don't 
scruple to beg for an autograph? 
</p><p>HILDA <hi rend="italic"> (reproachfully)</hi>.  Oh&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  What's the difference, pray? 
</p><p>HILDA.  Only that <hi rend="italic"> your</hi> last autograph sold for fifty&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (not displeased)</hi>.  Ah?&mdash;I sent for you, Hilda, 
because I'm dining out to-night, and if there's nothing important 
to attend to among these letters you needn't sit up for me. 
</p><p>HILDA.  You don't mean to work? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Perhaps; but I sha'n't need you.  You'll see that 
my cigarettes and coffee-machine are in place, and that I don't 
have to crawl about the floor in search of my pen-wipe?  That's 
all.  Now about these letters&mdash; 
</p><p>HILDA <hi rend="italic"> (impulsively)</hi>.  Oh, Mrs. Dale&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Well? 
</p><p>HILDA.  I'd rather sit up with you. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Child, I've nothing for you to do.  I shall be 
blocking out the tenth chapter of "Winged Purposes," and it won't 
be ready for you till next week. 
</p><p>HILDA.  It isn't that&mdash;but it's so beautiful to sit here, 
watching and listening, all alone in the night, and to feel that 
you're in there <hi rend="italic"> (she points to the study-door) creating&mdash;.  
(Impulsively)</hi>.  What do I care for sleep? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (indulgently)</hi>.  Child&mdash;silly child!&mdash;  Yes, I 
should have felt so at your age&mdash;it would have been an 
inspiration&mdash; 
</p><p>HILDA <hi rend="italic"> (rapt)</hi>.  It is! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  But you must go to bed; I must have you fresh in 
the morning; for you're still at the age when one <hi rend="italic"> is</hi> fresh in 
the morning!  <hi rend="italic"> (She sighs.)</hi>  The letters?  <hi rend="italic"> (Abruptly.)</hi>  Do 
you take notes of what you feel, Hilda&mdash;here, all alone in the 
night, as you say? 
</p><p>HILDA <hi rend="italic"> (shyly)</hi>.  I have&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (smiling)</hi>.  For the diary? 
</p><p>HILDA <hi rend="italic"> (nods and blushes)</hi>. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (caressingly)</hi>.  Goose!&mdash;Well, to business.  What 
is there? 
</p><p>HILDA.  Nothing important, except a letter from Stroud &amp; 
Fayerweather to say that the question of the royalty on 
"Pomegranate Seed" has been settled in your favor.  The English 
publishers of "Immolation" write to consult you about a six-shilling edition; Olafson, the Copenhagen publisher, applies for 
permission to bring out a Danish translation of "The Idol's Feet"; 
and the editor of the <hi rend="italic"> Semaphore</hi> wants a new serial&mdash;I think 
that's all; except that <hi rend="italic"> Woman's Sphere</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> The Droplight</hi>, 
ask for interviews&mdash;with photographs&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  The same old story!  I'm so tired of it all.  <hi rend="italic"> 
(To herself, in an undertone.)</hi>  But how should I feel if it all 
stopped?  <hi rend="italic"> (The servant brings in a card.)</hi> 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (reading it)</hi>.  Is it possible?  Paul Ventnor?  
<hi rend="italic"> (To the servant.)</hi>  Show Mr. Ventnor up.  <hi rend="italic"> (To herself.)</hi>  
Paul Ventnor! 
</p><p>HILDA <hi rend="italic"> (breathless)</hi>.  Oh, Mrs. Dale&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> the</hi> Mr. Ventnor? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (smiling)</hi>.  I fancy there's only one.  <pb n="658"/>  
</p><p>HILDA.  The great, great poet?  <hi rend="italic"> (Irresolute.)</hi>  No, I don't 
dare&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (with a tinge of impatience)</hi>.  What? 
</p><p>HILDA <hi rend="italic"> (fervently)</hi>.  Ask you&mdash;if I might&mdash;oh, here in this 
corner, where he can't possibly notice me&mdash;stay just a moment?  
Just to see him come in?  To see the meeting between you&mdash;the 
greatest novelist and the greatest poet of the age?  Oh, it's too 
much to ask!  It's an historic moment. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Why, I suppose it is.  I hadn't thought of it in 
that light.  Well <hi rend="italic"> (smiling)</hi>, for the diary&mdash; 
</p><p>HILDA.  Oh, thank you, <hi rend="italic"> thank you!</hi>  I'll be off the very 
instant I've heard him speak. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  The very instant, mind.  <hi rend="italic"> (She rises, looks at 
herself in the glass, smooths her hair, sits down again, and 
rattles the tea-caddy.)</hi>  Isn't the room very warm?&mdash;  <hi rend="italic"> (She 
looks over at her portrait.)</hi>  I've grown stouter since that was 
painted&mdash;  You'll make a fortune out of that diary, Hilda&mdash; 
</p><p>HILDA <hi rend="italic"> (modestly)</hi>.  Four publishers have applied to me 
already&mdash; 
</p><p>THE SERVANT <hi rend="italic"> (announces)</hi>.  Mr. Paul Ventnor. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic"> (Tall, nearing fifty, with an incipient stoutness buttoned 
into a masterly frock-coat</hi>, VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> drops his glass and 
advances vaguely, with a short-sighted stare.)</hi> 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Mrs. Dale? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  My dear friend!  This is kind.  <hi rend="italic"> (She looks over 
her shoulder at</hi> HILDA, <hi rend="italic"> who vanishes through the door to the 
left.)</hi>  The papers announced your arrival, but I hardly hoped&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (whose short-sighted stare is seen to conceal a 
deeper embarrassment.)</hi>  You hadn't forgotten me, then? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Delicious!  Do <hi rend="italic"> you</hi> forget that you're public 
property? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Forgotten, I mean, that we were old friends? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Such old friends!  May I remind you that it's 
nearly twenty years since we've met?  Or do you find cold 
reminiscences indigestible? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  On the contrary, I've come to ask you for a dish of 
them&mdash;we'll warm them up together.  You're my first visit. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  How perfect of you!  So few men visit their women 
friends in chronological order; or at least they generally do it 
the other way round, beginning with the present day and working 
back&mdash;if there's time&mdash;to prehistoric woman. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  But when prehistoric woman has become historic 
woman&mdash;? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Oh, it's the reflection of my glory that has 
guided you here, then? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  It's a spirit in my feet that has led me, at the 
first opportunity, to the most delightful spot I know. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Oh, the first opportunity&mdash;! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  I might have seen you very often before; but never 
just in the right way. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Is this the right way? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  It depends on you to make it so. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  What a responsibility!  What shall I do? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Talk to me&mdash;make me think you're a little glad to 
see me; give me some tea and a cigarette; and say you're out to 
everyone else. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Is that all?  <hi rend="italic"> (She hands him a cup of tea.)</hi>  
The cigarettes are at your elbow&mdash;  And do you think I shouldn't 
have been glad to see you before? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  No; I think I should have been too glad to see <hi rend="italic"> 
you</hi>. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Dear me, what precautions!  I hope you always wear 
goloshes when it looks like rain, and never by any chance expose 
yourself to a draught.  But I had an idea that poets courted the 
emotions&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Do novelists? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  If you ask <hi rend="italic"> me</hi>&mdash;on paper! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Just so; that's safest.  My best things about the 
sea have been written on shore.  <hi rend="italic"> (He looks at her 
thoughtfully.)</hi>  But it wouldn't have suited us in the old days, 
would it? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (sighing)</hi>.  When we were real people! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Real people? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Are <hi rend="italic"> you</hi>, now?  I died years ago.  What you see 
before you is a figment of the reporter's brain&mdash;a monster 
manufactured out of newspaper paragraphs, with ink in its veins.  
A keen sense of copyright is <hi rend="italic"> my</hi> nearest approach to an emotion. 
<pb n="659"/>  
</p><p>VENTNOR. <hi rend="italic"> (sighing)</hi>.  Ah, well, yes&mdash;  As you say, we're 
public property. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  If one shared equally with the public!  But the 
last shred of my identity is gone. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Most people would be glad to part with theirs on 
such terms.  I have followed your work with immense interest.  
"Immolation" is a masterpiece.  I read it last summer when it first 
came out. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (with a shade less warmth)</hi>.  "Immolation" has 
been out for three years. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Oh, by Jove&mdash;no?  Surely not&mdash;  But one is so 
overwhelmed&mdash;one loses count.  <hi rend="italic"> (Reproachfully.)</hi>  Why have you 
never sent me your books? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  For that very reason. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (deprecatingly)</hi>.  You know I didn't mean it for 
you!  And <hi rend="italic"> my</hi> first book&mdash;do you remember&mdash;was dedicated to you. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  "Silver Trumpets"&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (much interested)</hi>.  Have you a copy still, by any 
chance?  The first edition, I mean?  Mine was stolen years ago.  Do 
you think you could put your hand on it? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (taking a small shabby book from the table at her 
side)</hi>.  It's here. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (eagerly)</hi>.  May I have it?  Ah, thanks.  This is 
<hi rend="italic"> very</hi> interesting.  The last copy sold in London for #40, and 
they tell me the next will fetch twice as much.  It's quite <hi rend="italic"> 
introuvable</hi>. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  I know that.  <hi rend="italic"> (A pause.  She takes the book 
from him, opens it, and reads, half to herself&mdash;)</hi> 
</p> 
<lg type="verse"> 
<l><hi rend="italic"> How much we two have seen together, 
</hi></l> 
<l>   Of other eyes unwist.

</lg> 

<p>VENTNOR.  Thin, thin&mdash;the troubadour tinkle.  Odd how little 
promise there is in first volumes! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (with irresistible emphasis)</hi>.  I thought there 
was a distinct promise in this! 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (seeing his mistake)</hi>.  Ah&mdash;the one you would never 
let me fulfil?  <hi rend="italic"> (Sentimentally.)</hi>  How inexorable you were!  You 
never dedicated a book to <hi rend="italic"> me</hi>. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  I hadn't begun to write when we were&mdash;dedicating 
things to each other. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Not for the public&mdash;but you wrote for me; and, 
wonderful as you are, you've never written anything since that I 
care for half as much as&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (interested)</hi>.  Well? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Your letters. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE  <hi rend="italic"> (in a changed voice)</hi>.  My letters&mdash;do you 
remember them? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  When I don't, I reread them. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (incredulous)</hi>.  You have them still? 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (unguardedly)</hi>.  You haven't mine, then? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (playfully)</hi>.  Oh, <hi rend="italic"> you</hi> were a celebrity 
already.  Of course I kept them!  <hi rend="italic"> (Smiling.)</hi>  Think what they 
are worth now!  I always keep them locked up in my safe over there.  
<hi rend="italic"> (She indicates a cabinet)</hi>. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (after a pause)</hi>.  I always carry yours with me. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (laughing)</hi>.  You&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Wherever I go.  <hi rend="italic"> (A longer pause.  She looks at 
him fixedly.)</hi>  I have them with me now. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (agitated)</hi>.  You&mdash;have them with you&mdash;now? 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (embarrassed)</hi>.  Why not?  One never knows&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Never knows&mdash;? 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (humorously)</hi>.  Gad&mdash;when the bank-examiner may 
come round.  You forget I'm a married man. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Ah&mdash;yes. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (sits down beside her)</hi>.  I speak to you as I 
couldn't to anyone else&mdash;without deserving a kicking.  You know how 
it all came about.  <hi rend="italic"> (A pause.)</hi>  You'll bear witness that it 
wasn't till you denied me all hope&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (a little breathless)</hi>.  Yes, yes&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Till you sent me from you&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  It's so easy to be heroic when one is young!  One 
doesn't realize how long life is going to last afterward. <pb n="660"/>   
<hi rend="italic"> (Musing.)</hi>  Nor what weary work it is gathering up the 
fragments. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  But the time comes when one sends for the china-mender, and has the bits riveted together, and turns the cracked 
side to the wall&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  And denies that the article was ever damaged? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Eh?  Well, the great thing, you see, is to keep 
one's self out of reach of the housemaid's brush.  <hi rend="italic"> (A pause.)</hi>  
If you're married you can't&mdash;always.  <hi rend="italic"> (Smiling.)</hi>  Don't you 
hate to be taken down and dusted? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (with intention)</hi>.  You forget how long ago my 
husband died.  It's fifteen years since I've been an object of 
interest to anybody but the public. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (smiling)</hi>.  The only one of your admirers to whom 
you've ever given the least encouragement! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Say rather the most easily pleased! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Or the only one you cared to please? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Ah, you <hi rend="italic"> haven't</hi> kept my letters! 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (gravely)</hi>.  Is that a challenge?  Look here, then!  
<hi rend="italic"> (He draws a packet from his pocket and holds it out to her)</hi>. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (taking the packet and looking at him 
earnestly)</hi>.  Why have you brought me these? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  I didn't bring them; they came because I came&mdash; 
that's all.  <hi rend="italic"> (Tentatively.)</hi>  Are we unwelcome? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (who has undone the packet and does not appear to 
hear him)</hi>.  The very first I ever wrote you&mdash;the day after we met 
at the concert.  How on earth did you happen to keep it?  <hi rend="italic"> (She 
glances over it.)</hi>  How perfectly absurd!  Well, it's not a 
compromising document. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  I'm afraid none of them are. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (quickly)</hi>.  Is it to that they owe their 
immunity?  Because one could leave them about like safety matches?--Ah, here's another I remember&mdash;I wrote that the day after we went 
skating together for the first time.  <hi rend="italic"> (She reads it slowly.)</hi>  
How odd!  How <hi rend="italic"> very</hi> odd! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  What? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Why, it's the most curious thing&mdash;I had a letter 
of this kind to do the other day, in the novel I'm at work on now&mdash; 
the letter of a woman who is just&mdash;just beginning&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Yes&mdash;just beginning&mdash;? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  And, do you know, I find the best phrase in it, 
the phrase I somehow regarded as the fruit of&mdash;well, of all my 
subsequent discoveries&mdash;is simply plagiarized, word for word, from 
this! 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (eagerly)</hi>.  I told you so!  You were all there! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (critically)</hi>.  But the rest of it's poorly 
done&mdash;very poorly.  <hi rend="italic"> (Reads the letter over.)</hi>  H'm&mdash;I didn't 
know how to leave off.  It takes me forever to get out the door. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (gayly)</hi>.  Perhaps I was there to prevent you! 
<hi rend="italic"> 
(After a pause.)</hi>  I wonder what I said in return? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (interested)</hi>.  Shall we look?  <hi rend="italic"> (She 
rises.)</hi>  
Shall we&mdash;really?  I have them all here, you know.  <hi rend="italic"> (She goes 
toward the cabinet.)</hi> 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (following her with repressed eagerness)</hi>. 
Oh&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> 
all!</hi> 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (throws open the door of the cabinet, revealing 
a number of packets)</hi>.  Don't you believe me now? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Good heavens!  How I must have repeated myself!  But 
then you were so very deaf. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (takes out a packet and returns to her seat.</hi>  
VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> extends an impatient hand for the letters)</hi>.  No&mdash;no; 
wait!  I want to find your answer to the one I was just reading.  
<hi rend="italic"> (After a pause.)</hi>  Here it is&mdash;yes, I thought so! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  What did you think? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (triumphantly)</hi>.  I thought it was the one in 
which you quoted "Epipsychidion"&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Mercy!  Did I <hi rend="italic"> quote</hi> things?  I don't wonder you 
were cruel. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Ah, and here's the other&mdash;the one I&mdash;the one I 
didn't answer&mdash;for a long time.  Do you remember? 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (with emotion)</hi>.  Do I remember?  I wrote it the 
morning after we heard "Isolde"&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (disappointed)</hi>.  No&mdash;no.  <hi rend="italic"> That</hi> wasn't the 
one I didn't answer!  Here&mdash;this is the one I mean. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (takes it curiously)</hi>.  Ah&mdash;h'm&mdash;this is very like 
unrolling a mummy <pb n="661"/>  &mdash;<hi rend="italic"> (he glances at her)</hi>&mdash;with a live 
grain of wheat in it, perhaps?&mdash;  Oh, by Jove! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  What? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Why, this is the one I made a sonnet out of 
afterward!  By Jove, I'd forgotten where that idea came from.  You 
may know the lines perhaps?  They're in the fourth volume of my <hi rend="italic"> 
complete edition</hi>&mdash;It's the thing beginning 
<lb/> 
<lb/> 
<hi rend="italic"> Love came to me with unrelenting eyes&mdash;</hi> 
<lb/> 
<lb/> 
one of my best, I rather fancy.  Of course, here, it's very crudely 
put&mdash;the values aren't brought out&mdash;ah! this touch is good 
though&mdash;very good.  H'm, I daresay there might be other material.  
<hi rend="italic"> (He glances toward the cabinet.)</hi> 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (dryly)</hi>.  The live grain of wheat, as you said! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Ah, well&mdash;my first harvest was sown on rocky 
ground&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> now</hi> I plant for the fowls of the air.  <hi rend="italic"> (Rising and 
walking toward the cabinet.)</hi>  When can I come and carry off all 
this rubbish? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Carry it off? 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (embarrassed)</hi>.  My dear lady, surely between you 
and me explicitness is a burden.  You must see that these letters 
of ours can't be left to take their chance like an ordinary 
correspondence&mdash;you said yourself we were public property. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  To take their chance?  Do you suppose that, in my 
keeping, your letters take any chances?  <hi rend="italic"> (Suddenly.)</hi>  Do mine&mdash; 
in yours? 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (still more embarrassed)</hi>.  Helen&mdash;!  <hi rend="italic"> (He takes 
a turn through the room.)</hi>  You force me to remind you that you and 
I are differently situated&mdash;that in a moment of madness I 
sacrificed the only right you ever gave me&mdash;the right to love you 
better than any other woman in the world.  <hi rend="italic"> (A pause.  She says 
nothing and he continues, with increasing difficulty&mdash;)</hi>  You asked 
me just now why I carried your letters about with me&mdash;kept them, 
literally, in my own hands.  Well, suppose it's to be sure of their 
not falling into some one else's? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Oh! 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (throws himself into a chair)</hi>.  For God's sake 
don't pity me! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (after a long pause)</hi>.  Am I dull&mdash;or are you 
trying to say that you want to give me back my letters? 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (starting up)</hi>.  I?  Give you back&mdash;?  God forbid!  
Your letters?  Not for the world!  The only thing I have left!  But 
you can't dream that in <hi rend="italic"> my</hi> hands&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (suddenly)</hi>.  You want yours, then? 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (repressing his eagerness)</hi>.  My dear friend, if 
I'd ever dreamed that you'd kept them&mdash;! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (accusingly)</hi>.  You <hi rend="italic"> do</hi> want them.  <hi rend="italic"> (A 
pause.  He makes a deprecatory gesture.)</hi>  Why should they be less 
safe with me than mine with you?  <hi rend="italic"> I</hi> never forfeited the right 
to keep them. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (after another pause)</hi>.  It's compensation enough, 
almost, to have you reproach me!  <hi rend="italic"> (He moves nearer to her, but 
she makes no response.)</hi>  You forget that I've forfeited <hi rend="italic"> all</hi> my 
rights&mdash;even that of letting you keep my letters. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  You <hi rend="italic"> do</hi> want them!  <hi rend="italic"> (She rises, throws all 
the letters into the cabinet, locks the door and puts the key in 
her pocket.)</hi>  There's my answer. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Helen&mdash;! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Ah, I paid dearly enough for the right to keep 
them, and I mean to!  <hi rend="italic"> (She turns to him passionately.)</hi>  Have 
you ever asked yourself how I paid for it?  With what months and 
years of solitude, what indifference to flattery, what resistance 
to affection?&mdash;Oh, don't smile because I said affection, and not 
love.  Affection's a warm cloak in cold weather; and I <hi rend="italic"> have</hi> 
been cold; and I shall keep on growing colder!  Don't talk to me 
about living in the hearts of my readers!  We both know what kind 
of a domicile that is.  Why, before long I shall become a classic!  
Bound in sets and kept on the top book-shelf&mdash;brr, doesn't that 
sound freezing?  I foresee the day when I shall be as lonely as an 
Etruscan museum!  <hi rend="italic"> (She breaks into a laugh.)</hi>  That's what I've 
paid for the right to keep your letters.  <hi rend="italic"> (She holds out her 
hand.)</hi>  And now give me mine. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Yours? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (haughtily)</hi>.  Yes; I claim them. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (in the same tone)</hi>.  On what ground? <pb n="662"/>  
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Hear the man!&mdash;Because I wrote them, of course. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  But it seems to me that&mdash;under your inspiration, I 
admit&mdash;I also wrote mine. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Oh, I don't dispute their authenticity&mdash;it's yours 
I deny! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Mine? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  You voluntarily ceased to be the man who wrote me 
those letters&mdash;you've admitted as much.  You traded paper for flesh 
and blood.  I don't dispute your wisdom&mdash;only you must hold to your 
bargain!  The letters are <hi rend="italic"> all</hi> mine. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (groping between two tones)</hi>.  Your arguments are 
as convincing as ever.  <hi rend="italic"> (He hazards a faint laugh.)</hi>  You're a 
marvellous dialectician&mdash;but, if we're going to settle the matter 
in a spirit of arbitration treaty, why, there are accepted 
conventions in such cases.  It's an odious way to put it, but since 
you won't help me, one of them is&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  One of them is&mdash;? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  That it is usual&mdash;that technically, I mean, the 
letter&mdash;belongs to its writer&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (after a pause)</hi>.  Such letters as <hi rend="italic"> 
these?</hi> 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Such letters especially&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  But you couldn't have written them if I hadn't&mdash; 
been willing to read them.  Surely there's more of myself in them 
than of you. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Surely there's nothing in which a man puts more of 
himself than in his love-letters! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (with emotion)</hi>.  But a woman's love-letters are 
like her child.  They belong to her more than to anybody else&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  And a man's? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (with sudden violence)</hi>.  Are all he risks!&mdash;  
There, take them.  <hi rend="italic"> (She flings the key of the cabinet at his 
feet and sinks into a chair.)</hi> 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (starts as though to pick up the key; then 
approaches and bends over her)</hi>.  Helen&mdash;oh, Helen! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (she yields her hands to him, murmuring:)</hi> Paul!  
<hi rend="italic"> (Suddenly she straightens herself and draws back illuminated.)</hi>  
What a fool I am!  I see it all now.  You want them for your 
memoirs! 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (disconcerted)</hi>.  Helen&mdash; 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (agitated)</hi>.  Come, come&mdash;the rule is to unmask 
when the signal's given!  You want them for your memoirs. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (with a forced laugh)</hi>.  What makes you think so? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (triumphantly)</hi>.  Because <hi rend="italic"> I</hi> want them for mine! 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (in a changed tone)</hi>.  Ah&mdash;.  <hi rend="italic"> (He moves away 
from her and leans against the mantelpiece.  She remains seated, 
with her eyes fixed on him.)</hi> 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  I wonder I didn't see it sooner.  Your reasons 
were lame enough. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (ironically)</hi>.  Yours were masterly.  You're the 
more accomplished actor of the two.  I was completely deceived. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Oh, I'm a novelist.  I can keep up that sort of 
thing for five hundred pages! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  I congratulate you.  <hi rend="italic"> (A pause.)</hi> 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (moving to her seat behind the tea-table)</hi>.  I've 
never offered you any tea.  <hi rend="italic"> (She bends over the kettle.)</hi>  Why 
don't you take your letters? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Because you've been clever enough to make it 
impossible for me.  <hi rend="italic"> (He picks up the key and hands it to her.  
Then abruptly)</hi>&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> Was</hi> it all acting&mdash;just now? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  By what right do you ask? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  By right of renouncing my claim to my letters.  Keep 
them&mdash;and tell me. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  I give you back your claim&mdash;and I refuse to tell 
you. 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (sadly)</hi>.  Ah, Helen, if you deceived me, you 
deceived yourself also. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  What does it matter, now that we're both 
undeceived?  I played a losing game, that's all. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Why losing&mdash;since all the letters are yours? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  The letters?  <hi rend="italic"> (Slowly.)</hi>  I'd forgotten the 
letters&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (exultant)</hi>.  Ah, I knew you'd end by telling me 
the truth! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  The truth?  Where <hi rend="italic"> is</hi> the truth?  <hi rend="italic"> (Half to 
herself.)</hi>  I thought I was lying when I began&mdash;but the lies turned 
into truth as I uttered them!  <hi rend="italic"> (She looks at</hi> VENTNOR.)  I <hi rend="italic"> 
did</hi> want your letters for my memoirs&mdash;I <hi rend="italic"> did</hi> think I'd kept 
them for that purpose&mdash;and I wanted to get <pb n="663"/>  mine back for 
the same reason&mdash;but now <hi rend="italic"> (she puts out her hand and picks up 
some of her letters, which are lying scattered on the table near 
her)</hi>&mdash;how fresh they seem, and how they take me back to the time 
when we lived instead of writing about life! 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (smiling)</hi>.  The time when we didn't prepare our 
impromptu effects beforehand and copyright our remarks about the 
weather! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Or keep our epigrams in cold storage and our 
adjectives under lock and key! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  When our emotions weren't worth ten cents a word, 
and a signature wasn't an autograph.  Ah, Helen, after all, there's 
nothing like the exhilaration of spending one's capital! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Of wasting it, you mean.  <hi rend="italic"> (She points to the 
letters.)</hi>  Do you suppose we could have written a word of these if 
we'd known we were putting our dreams out at interest?  <hi rend="italic"> (She 
sits musing, with her eyes on the fire, and he watches her in 
silence.)</hi>  Paul, do you remember the deserted garden we sometimes 
used to walk in? 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  The old garden with the high wall at the end of the 
village street?  The garden with the ruined box-borders and the 
broken-down arbor?  Why, I remember every weed in the paths and 
every patch of moss on the walls! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Well&mdash;I went back there the other day.  The 
village is immensely improved.  There's a new hotel with gas-fires, 
and a trolley in the main street; and the garden has been turned 
into a public park, where excursionists sit on cast-iron benches 
admiring the statue of an Abolitionist. 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  An Abolitionist&mdash;how appropriate! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  And the man who sold the garden has made a fortune 
that he doesn't know how to spend&mdash; 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (rising impulsively)</hi>.  Helen, <hi rend="italic"> (he approaches 
and lays his hand on her letters)</hi>, let's sacrifice our fortune and 
keep the excursionists out! 
</p><p>MRS. DALE <hi rend="italic"> (with a responsive movement)</hi>.  Paul, do you 
really mean it? 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (gayly)</hi>.  Mean it?  Why, I feel like a landed 
proprietor already!  It's more than a garden&mdash;it's a park. 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  It's more than a park, it's a world&mdash;as long as we 
keep it to ourselves! 
</p><p>VENTNOR.  Ah, yes&mdash;even the pyramids look small when one sees 
a Cook's tourist on top of them!  <hi rend="italic"> (He takes the key from the 
table, unlocks the cabinet and brings out his letters, which he 
lays beside hers.)</hi>  Shall we burn the key to our garden? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Ah, then it will indeed be boundless!  <hi rend="italic"> 
(Watching him while he throws the letters into the fire.)</hi> 
</p><p>VENTNOR <hi rend="italic"> (turning back to her with a half-sad smile)</hi>.  But 
not too big for us to find each other in? 
</p><p>MRS. DALE.  Since we shall be the only people there!  <hi rend="italic"> (He 
takes both her hands and they look at each other a moment in 
silence.  Then he goes out by the door to the right.  As he reaches 
the door she takes a step toward him, impulsively; then turning 
back she leans against the chimney-piece, quietly watching the 
letters burn.)</hi>
