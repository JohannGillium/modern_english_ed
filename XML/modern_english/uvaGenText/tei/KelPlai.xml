<head>PREFACE. </head>
<p>
THE author of this work offers no apology for
presenting it to the reading public, since the wide
prevalence of the evils which it exposes is sufficient
warrant for its publication. The subjects with which it deals
are of vital consequence to the human race; and it is of
the utmost importance that every effort should be made
to dispel the gross ignorance which almost universally
prevails, by the wide diffusion, in a proper manner, of
information of the character contained in this volume.
</p><p>This book has been written, not for the young only, nor
for any single class of persons, but for all who are capable
of understanding and appreciating it. The prime object
of its preparation has been to call attention to the great
prevalence of sexual excesses of all kinds, and the heinous
crimes resulting from some forms of sexual transgression,
and to point out the terrible results which inevitably follow
the violation of sexual law.
</p><p>In order to make more clear and comprehensible the
teachings of nature respecting the laws regulating the sexual
function, and the evils resulting from their violation, it
has seemed necessary to preface the practical part of the
subject by a concise description of the anatomy and physiology
of reproduction. In this portion of the work, especial
pains has been taken to avoid anything like indelicacy
of expression, yet it has not been deemed advisable
to sacrifice perspicuity of ideas to any prudish notions of
modesty. It is hoped that the reader will bear in mind
that the language of science is always chaste in itself, and
<pb n="vi"/>
that it is only through a corrupt imagination that it
becomes invested with impurity. The author has constantly
endeavored to impart information in the most straight-forward, simple, and concise manner.
</p><p>The work should be judiciously circulated, and to secure
this the publishers will take care to place it in the hands
of agents competent to introduce it with discretion; yet
it may be read without injury by any one who is sufficiently
mature to understand it. Great care has been
taken to exclude from its pages those accounts of the
habits of vicious persons, and descriptions of the mechanical
accessories of vice, with which many works upon sexual
subjects abound.
</p><p>The first editions of the work were issued with no little
anxiety on the part of both author and publishers as to
how it would be received by the reading public. It was
anticipated that no little adverse criticism, and perhaps
severe condemnation, would be pronounced by many
whose education and general mode of thought had not
been such as to prepare them to appreciate it; but it was
hoped that persons of more thoughtful and unbiased minds
would receive the work kindly, and would readily
cooperate with the publishers in its circulation. This
anticipation has been more than realized. Wherever the book
has been introduced, it has met with a warm reception;
and of the many thousand persons into whose hands the
work has been placed, hundreds have gratefully acknowledged
the benefit which they have received from its perusal,
and it is hoped that a large proportion have been
greatly benefited.
</p><p>The cordial reception which the work has met from the
press everywhere, has undoubtedly contributed in a great
measure to its popularity. The demand for the work has
exhausted numerous editions in rapid succession, and has
seemed to require its preparation in the greatly enlarged
and in every way improved form in which it now appears.
<pb n="vii"/>
The addition of two whole chapters for the purpose of
bringing the subject directly before the minds of boys and
girls in a proper manner, adds greatly to the interest and
value of the work, as there seemed to be a slight deficiency
in this particular in the former editions. </p>

<head>PREFACE TO NEW EDITION.</head>

<p>
SINCE the preceding paragraphs were written, nearly
one hundred thousand copies of this work have been
placed in the hands of interested readers in various
parts of the United States. One large edition has followed
another with such rapidity that the copper plates from
which it was printed have become considerably worn, and
for some time both author and publisher have been anxious
to put the work in a more satisfactory form. Within the
last few months, the author has been enabled to carefully
revise the book, and make it ready for the new edition.
All who have been previously acquainted with the work,
will recognize a very great improvement over previous
editions. The book has been entirely reset in beautiful,
clear, and legible type; the page has been increased in
size; the somewhat antiquated border has been dispensed
with; many portions have been rewritten, and a large
amount of new matter added, including not only additions
to nearly every subject treated, but several entirely new
chapters, which it is believed will greatly enhance the value
of the work.
<pb n="viii"/>
</p><p>Both the author and the publisher desire to express to
the great reading public their sincere thanks for the
generous support which has been accorded their efforts in behalf
of popular education upon a subject so universally ignored
and tabooed. The wall of prejudice, which in the early
years of the introduction of the work, threatened to present
a serious obstacle to its usefulness, has been gradually
broken down, and there is evidence among the more intelligent
class of people of an increasing sentiment favoring
the frank and open consideration of the subjects presented
in this work.
</p><p>The author also desires to express his thanks, and his
feeling of deep obligation to the hundreds of clergymen,
physicians, philanthropists, and other noble-minded men
and women who have faithfully seconded his efforts to
forestall vice by tearing off the flimsy gauze of secrecy, under
which it has so long sought to hide its hideous deformities.
Tens of thousands of noble youth of both sexes have,
through the kindly and unselfish aid of enlightened clergymen,
physicians, and teachers, been reached, who otherwise
would have come to years of maturity with the
same ignorance of natural laws, and the same false
conceptions which have for ages been the most powerful allies
of vice and crime.
</p><p>The work in its present form is presented to a
discriminating public with the sincere desire that its usefulness
may be still further increased, and that it may continue to
receive the encouragement and support so generously
accorded in the past.

<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
<p>
BOOKS almost without number have been written
upon the subject treated in this work. Unfortunately,
most of these works are utterly unreliable
being filled with gross misrepresentations and
exaggerations, and being designed as advertising mediums
for ignorant and unscrupulous charlatans, or worse than
worthless patent nostrums. To add to their power for
evil, many of them abound with pictorial illustrations
which are in no way conducive to virtue or morality
but rather stimulate the animal propensities, and excite
lewd imaginations. Books of this character are usually
widely circulated; and their pernicious influence is fully
as great as that of works of a more grossly obscene
character. In most of the few instances in which the
evident motive of the author or publisher is not of an
unworthy character, the manner of presenting the
subject is unfortunately such that it more frequently than
otherwise has a strong tendency in a direction exactly
the opposite of that intended and desired. The writer
of this work has endeavored to avoid the latter evil by
adopting a style of presentation quite different from that
generally pursued. Instead of restricting the reader's
attention rigidly to the sexual function in man, his mind
is diverted by frequent references to corresponding functions
in lower animals and in the vegetable kingdom.
<pb n="22"/>
By this means, not only is additional information
imparted, but the sexual function in man is divested of its
sensuality. It is viewed as a fact of natural history,
and is associated with the innocence of animal life and
the chaste loveliness of flowers. Thus the subject comes
to be regarded from a purely physiological standpoint,
and is liberated from that association with grossness
which is the active cause of sensuality.
</p><p>There are so many well-meaning individuals who
object to the agitation of this subject in any manner
whatever, that it may be profitable to consider in this
connection some of the principal objections which are
urged against imparting information on sexual subjects,
especially against giving knowledge to the young.
</p>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Sexual matters improper to be spoken of to the young</hi>.
<lb/><lb/>
This objection is often raised, it being urged that
these matters are <hi rend="italic">too delicate</hi> to be even suggested to
children; that they ought to be kept in total ignorance
of all sexual matters and relations. It is doubtless true
that children raised in a perfectly natural way would
have no sexual thoughts during the earlier years of life,
and it would be better if it might be so; but from facts
pointed out in succeeding portions of this work, it is
certain that at the present time, children nearly always
do have some ideas of sexual relations long before
puberty, and often at a very early age. It is thus
apparent that in speaking to children of sexual matters, in
a proper manner, a new subject is not introduced to
them, but it is merely presenting to them in a true light
a subject of which they already have vague ideas; and
thus, by satisfying a natural curiosity, they are saved
<pb n="23"/>
from supplying, by their imaginations, distorted images
and exaggerated conceptions, and from seeking to obtain
the desired information from evil sources whence they
would derive untold injury.
</p><p>What reason is there that the subject of the sexual
functions should be treated with such maudlin secrecy?
Why should the function of generation be regarded as
something low and beastly, unfit to be spoken of by
decent people on decent occasions? We can conceive of
no answer except the worse than beastly use to which
the function has been so generally put by man. There
is nothing about the sexual organism which makes it less
pure than the lungs or the stomach. "Unto the pure all
things are pure," may have been written especially for
our times, when there is such a vast amount of mock
modesty, when so much pretense of virtue covers such a
world of iniquity and vice. The young lady who goes
into a spasm of virtuous hysterics upon hearing the word
"leg," is perhaps just the one who at home riots her
imagination in voluptuous French novels, if she commits
no grosser breach of chastity. The parents who are the
most opposed to judiciously imparting proper information
to the young, are often those who have themselves been
guilty of gross breaches of the laws of sexual hygiene.
In the minds of such persons, the sexual organs and
functions, and everything even remotely connected with
them, are associated only with ideas of lust and gross
sensuality. No wonder that they wish to keep such
topics in the dark. With such thoughts, they cannot
well bear the scrutiny of virtue.
</p><p>Sexual subjects are not, of course, proper subjects
for conversation at all times, or at any time in a spirit of
<pb n="24"/>
levity and flippancy. This subject should always be
handled with the greatest delicacy of expression. Gross
and vulgar forms of speech in relation to sexual subjects
should never be employed in presenting the subject to
the young, and the greatest care should be taken to
avoid rousing morbid curiosity or stimulating the
passions. The object of imparting information is to allay
curiosity by gratifying it in a wholesome way, and thus
to prevent that precocious and morbid excitement of the
sexual nature which is the natural outgrowth of ignorance,
and is stimulated by those obscure hints and allusions
which come to the notice of children even at a very
early age.
</p><p>
      <hi rend="italic">Knowledge is dangerous</hi>.
<lb/><lb/>
Very true, knowledge is dangerous, but ignorance is
still more dangerous; or, rather, partial knowledge is
more dangerous than a more complete understanding of
facts. Children, young people, will not grow up in
innocent ignorance. If, in obedience to custom, they are
not encouraged to inquire of their parents about the
mysteries of life, they will seek to satisfy their curiosity
by appealing to older or better informed companions.
They will eagerly read any book which promises any
hint on the mysterious subject, and will embrace every
opportunity, proper or improper &mdash; and most likely to be
the latter &mdash; of obtaining the coveted information. Knowledge
obtained in this uncertain and irregular way must
of necessity be very unreliable. Many times &mdash; generally,
in fact &mdash; it is of a most corrupting character, and the
clandestine manner in which it is obtained is itself
corrupting and demoralizing. A child ought to be taught
<pb n="25"/>
to expect all such information from its parents, and it
ought not to be disappointed.
</p><p>Again, while it is true that knowledge is dangerous,
it is equally true that this dangerous knowledge will be
gained sometime, at any rate; and as it must come,
better let it be imparted by the parent, who can administer
proper warnings and cautions along with it, than
by any other individual. Thus may the child be
shielded from injury to which he would otherwise be
certainly exposed.
</p><p>
      <hi rend="italic">Young people should be left to find out these things for
themselves</hi>.
 <lb/><lb/>
If human beings received much of their knowledge
through instinct, as animals do, this might be a proper
course; but man gets his knowledge largely by instruction.
Young people will get their first knowledge of
sexual matters mostly by instruction from some source.
How much better, then, as we have already shown,
to let them obtain this knowledge from the most
natural and most reliable source!
</p><p>The following paragraph from Dr. Ware is to the
point: &mdash;
</p><p>"But putting aside the question whether we ought
to hide this subject wholly from the young if we
could, the truth, it is to be feared, is that we cannot
if we would. Admitting it to be desirable, every man
of experience in life will pronounce it to be
impracticable. If, then, we cannot prevent the minds of
children from being engaged in some way on this subject,
may it not be better to forestall evil impressions
by implanting good ones, or at least to mingle good ones
<pb n="26"/>
with the evil as the nature of the case admits? Let us
be at least as wise as the crafty enemy of man, and cast
in a little wheat with his tares; and among the most
effectual methods of doing this is to impart to the young
just and religious views of the nature and purpose of the
relation which the Creator has established between the
two sexes."
</p><p>When shall Information be Given? &mdash; It is a matter
of some difficulty to decide the exact age at which
information on sexual subjects should be given to the
young. It may be adopted as a safe rule, however,
that a certain amount of knowledge should be imparted
as soon as there is manifested a curiosity in this
direction. If there is reason to believe that the mind of the
child is exercised in this direction, even though he may
have made no particular inquiries, information should
not be withheld.
</p><p>How to Impart Proper Knowledge. &mdash; No little skill
may be displayed in introducing these subjects to the
mind of the young person in such a way as to avoid
rousing the passions and creating sexual excitement.
Perhaps the general plan followed in the first portion of
this work will be found a very pleasant and successful
method, if studied thoroughly, and well executed.
</p><p>All information should not be given at once. First
obtain the child's confidence, and assure him by candor
and unreserve that you will give him all needed
information; then, as he encounters difficulties, he will
resort for explanation where he knows he will receive
satisfaction. When the little one questions, answer
truthfully and carefully.
</p><p>The following paragraph from the pen of an able
physician is wisely suggestive: &mdash;
<pb n="27"/>
</p><p>"When we are little boys and girls, our first
inquiries about our <hi rend="italic">whence</hi> are answered by the authoritative
dogma of the `silver spade;' we were dug up with
that implement. By degrees the fact comes forth.
The public, however, remains for ages in the silver-spade
condition of mind with regard to the science of the fact;
and the doctors foster it by telling us that the whole
subject is a medical property.... There is nothing
wrong in the knowing; and though the passions might
be stimulated in the first moments by such information,
yet in the second instance they will be calmed by it &mdash;
and ceasing to be inflamed by the additional goad of
curiosity and imagination, they will cool down under the
hydropathic influence of science. Well-stated knowledge
never did contribute to human inflammation; and
we much question whether the whole theory of the
silver spade be not a mistake; and whether children
should not be told the truth from the first, that before
desire and imagination are born, the young mind may
receive in its cool innocency, a knowledge of the
future objects of power and faculties which are to be
subject afterward to such strong excitement."
</p><p>Eminent Testimony. &mdash; The dangers of ignorance
upon sexual topics are very ably set forth in the following
article, which recently appeared in the British
<hi rend="italic">Medical Journal</hi>, the leading medical periodical of the
age, having been called out by the exposures of the
<hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, elsewhere referred to in this volume: &mdash;
</p><p>"Recent painful disclosures have, among other
results, raised an important question, which, in the present
state of opinion, can be most readily discussed in
<pb n="28"/>
the pages of a medical journal. We refer to the complete
ignorance regarding the sexual organs and the
sexual functions which is permitted, and, indeed,
sedulously fostered, by the ordinary education received by
boys and girls in this country. Not only does our
school system provide no information on these topics
which so vitally concern the happiness of every individual,
but the slightest allusion to the subject is apt to
be rigorously prohibited, and perhaps branded as
obscenity. The result is, that there is a great deal of
ignorance on these questions, and a still greater amount
of half knowledge, which is more dangerous than either
total ignorance or the fullest information. We have the
authority of Sir James Paget for the statement that
some men grow up, and even marry, in complete sexual
ignorance; and that, while this is rare in the male sex,
it is extremely common among cultivated and refined
women.
</p><p>"The decent veil which we conspire to throw over
everything concerned with the reproductive function,
serves, beyond doubt, some useful ends, and we trust
the English people will always be characterized by their
delicacy of thought and expression in this matter. But
we are convinced that this secrecy, this conspiracy of
silence, has gone too far, and that it is productive of
serious evils. We object, in the first place, to it as
unnatural. That our educational methods and social practice
should permit men, or more frequently women, to
marry without knowing what marriage involves, is not
merely unnatural, but may be the cause of much
matrimonial unhappiness. Parents and school-masters act as
if innocence in such matters could last for life, and as if
knowledge were a crime.
<pb n="29"/>
</p><p>"But a much more serious, because infinitely more
common, evil is the objectionable mode in which sexual
knowledge generally gets access to the mind. Instead
of being conveyed in some plain and matter-of-fact manner,
it is too often gained through the corrupting medium
of lewd jest or obscene print. At the most emotional
and plastic period of life, when new instincts are swelling
up and causing great mental disquietude, we withhold
from boys and girls the knowledge which nature is
instinctively trying to impart, and we leave them to
grope their way in darkness or to seek illumination from
some unhallowed source.
</p><p>"Why do the young so often regard an obscene work
or print with such fearful but such irresistible curiosity?
Not from mere depravity, as we often assume, but
because they are thus unconsciously seeking information
which they have a right to possess, and which we are
conscientiously bound to supply in some form which will
enlighten the reason, without inflaming the imagination
and exciting the passions. Sexual knowledge is not
wrong; its tendency is not necessarily injurious; but
our mistaken methods of secrecy have undoubtedly the
most unfortunate effect of stimulating the imagination to
the highest point. We know the baleful fascination of
forbidden fruit, not because it is sweet or pleasant, but
simply because it is forbidden. This is a notable trait
in human nature; but in our attitude toward sexual
questions, we have disregarded it, or rather acted in
direct contravention of it. The sexual function is
naturally powerful; but we enormously increase its
attraction for the young by labeling it as forbidden fruit.
</p><p>"It is usually easier to indicate a disease than to
<pb n="30"/>
apply a suitable remedy, but we shall not conclude without
venturing a few suggestions. First, let us glance at
what is suggested in the very few books which touch
upon the question. Many urge that parents should convey
knowledge upon these questions to their children at
the time of life when external signs and new sensations
indicate that the sexual instinct is beginning to awake.
But many, probably the majority of parents, are not
well fitted to undertake such a duty. Our language is
badly provided with the necessary terms, and the
untrained parent, ignorant of the anatomical expression,
would find it hard to convey the necessary information
without incurring the suspicion and, in his own mind,
the reproach of indelicacy.
</p><p>"Some advise that the family medical attendant
should act in <hi rend="italic">loco parentis</hi> in this matter; but we are
certain that such action would be highly disagreeable to
the members of the profession. One suggestion alone
seems to meet the case, but, fortunately, it meets it
most thoroughly. Elementary anatomy and physiology
should form an integral part of every education. We
might begin by teaching boys and girls the bones and
skeleton, the functions of the heart, stomach, etc.; and
then, when the suitable age arrives, the structure and
functions of the sexual organs might be taken as the
natural sequel of the previous portions of the course.
In this way, the necessary knowledge would enter the
mind naturally and simply, with no false shame on the
one hand, and no fillip to the imagination on the other.
We are confident that an immense reform would thus be
easily and quietly effected, and that much evil and
suffering would be averted. We should thus convey, in
<pb n="31"/>
the most natural and unobjectional form, knowledge
which we have no right to withhold; and we should
remove the unwholesome fascination which our present
habit of secrecy imparts to sexual questions. Certain it
is that the stealthy approaches of vice are favored by
the existing system.
</p><p>"It will often be found that there is a prevalent
opinion that sexual immorality is to celibates a physical
necessity, an attribute of manliness, and even a collateral
or prevalent condition of health. This degrading error
has been so vigorously denounced by the ablest of modern
physiologists, that no one has any longer a pretext
for entertaining or promulgating it. It has been the
source of much evil, however; and wherever such an
opinion is met, it must be energetically denounced.
</p><p>"There is an aspect of the question which cannot be
overlooked, especially as recent revelations have thrown
a lurid light upon it. It has been abundantly proved
that young girls are often entrapped to their ruin in the
most utter ignorance of sexual questions, and of the
physical significance of the act to which they are enticed.
This is surely a lamentable instance of propriety over-reaching itself. Innocent ignorance is always attractive;
but if be the means of luring the innocent victim to
her doom, it is surely more dangerous. How, then, is
the girl, approaching sexual maturity, to be made
acquainted with the solemn facts of creative act, and
guarded against associating them with the base impulses
of passion? We commend this difficult question to the
thoughtful consideration of our readers. In this respect,
also, the mothers and the teachers have a very solemn
duty; and it is opportune to ask how, when, where, and
by whom it is best performed."
<pb n="32"/>
</p><p>The experience of hundreds in the circulation of the
present work has proven beyond all chance for question
the truth of the foregoing remarks, and often in a most
striking manner. Scores of persons have written us, "I
would give all I possess in this world could I have had
a copy of `Plain Facts' placed in my hands when I was
a lad," or, "Words cannot express the gratitude I would
now feel had some kind friend imparted to me the valuable
information which this book contains; it would have
saved me a life of wretchedness."
</p><p>We have had the satisfaction of knowing, in numerous
instances, that the virtue and happiness of whole families
have been secured by the timely warnings of danger
which parents have obtained from this work. We are
glad to be able to feel that it is now thoroughly
demonstrated that intelligent persons who have given this
subject thought, universally approve of the objects of
the work, and the manner of presenting the subject
adopted in it. Those who at first question the propriety
of discussing the subject so freely and thoroughly as is
here done, lose their prejudice entirely upon giving the
work a careful perusal. In numerous instances it has
occurred that those who were most decided in their
denunciations, have become the most zealous and efficient
agents in its circulation, after becoming more fully
acquainted with it.</p>

<head>Sex in Living Forms.</head>
<p>
LIFE, in its great diversity of forms, has ever been
a subject of the deepest interest to rational beings.
Poets have sung of its joys and sorrows, its brilliant
phantasies and harsh realities. Philosophers
have spent their lives in vain attempts to solve its
mysteries; and some have believed that life was nothing
more than a stupendous farce, a delusion of the senses.
Moralists have sought to impress men with the truth
that "life is real," and teeming with grave responsibilities.
Physiologists have busied themselves in observing
the phenomena of life, and learning therefrom its
laws. The subject is certainly an interesting one, and
none could be more worthy of the most careful attention.
</p><p>Living Beings. &mdash; Man possesses life in common with
other beings almost infinite in number and variety. The
hugest beast that roams the forest or plows the main is
no more a living creature than the smallest insect or
microscopic animalculum. The "big tree" of California,
and the tiny blade of grass which waves at its foot, are
alike imbued with life. All nature teems with life. The
practiced eye detects multitudes of living forms at every
glance.
</p><p>Microscopic Life. &mdash; The universe of life presents the
most marvelous manifestations of the infinite power and
wisdom of the Creator to be found in all his works. The
<pb n="34"/>
student of biology sees life in myriad forms which are
unnoticed by the casual observer. The microscope
reveals worlds of life that were unknown before the
discovery of this wonderful aid to human vision, &mdash; whole
tribes of living organisms, each of which, though
insignificant in size, possesses organs as perfect and as useful
to it, in its sphere, as do animals of greater magnitude.
</p><p>Under a powerful magnifying glass, a drop of water
from a stagnant pool is found to be peopled with curious
animated forms; slime from a damp rock, or a speck of
green scum from the surface of a pond, presents a
museum of living wonders. Through this instrument
the student of nature learns that life in its lowest form
is represented by a mere atom of living matter, an
insignificant speck of trembling jelly, transparent and
structureless, having no organs of locomotion, yet able to move
in any direction; no nerves or organs of sense, yet
possessing a high degree of sensibility; no mouth, teeth,
nor organs of digestion, yet capable of taking food,
growing, developing, producing other individuals like
itself, becoming aged, infirm, and dying, &mdash; such is the
life history of a living creature at the lower extreme of
the scale of animated being.
</p><p>As we rise higher in the scale, we find similar little
atoms of life associated together in a single individual,
each doing its proper share of the work necessary to
maintain the life of the individual as a whole, yet
retaining, at the same time, its own individual life.
</p><p>As we ascend to still higher forms, we find this
association of minute living creatures resulting in the
production of forms of increasing complicity. As the
structure of the individual becomes more complex, and
<pb n="35"/>
its functions more varied, the greater is the number of
separate, yet associated, organisms required to do the
work.
</p><p>In man, at the very summit of the scale of animate
existence, we find the most delicate and wonderfully
intricate living mechanism of all. In him, as in lower,
intermediate forms of life, the life of the individual is but
a summary of the lives of all the numberless minute
organisms of which his body is composed. The individual
life is but the aggregate life of all the millions of
distinct individuals which are associated together in the
human organism.
</p><p>Animals and Vegetables. &mdash; The first classification of
living creatures separates them into two great kingdoms,
animal and vegetable. Although it is very easy to
define the general characteristics of each of these classes
it is impossible to fix upon any single peculiarity which
will be applicable to every case. Most vegetable
organisms remain stationary; while some possess organs
of locomotion, and swim about in the water in a manner
much resembling the movements of certain animals.
Most vegetables obtain their nutriment from the earth
and the air, while animals subsist on living matter. A
few plants seem to take organic matter for food, some
even catching and killing small insects.
</p><p>It is found impossible to draw the precise line
between animals and vegetables, for the reason just
mentioned. The two kingdoms blend so intimately that in
some cases it is impossible to tell whether a certain
microscopic speck of life is an animal or a vegetable.
But since these doubtful creatures are usually so minute
that several millions of them can exist in a single drop
<pb n="36"/>
of water, it is seldom of practical importance whether
they are animal or vegetable, or sometimes one and
sometimes the other, as they have been supposed to be
by some biologists.
</p><p>Protoplasm. &mdash; All living creatures are <hi rend="italic">organized</hi>
beings. Most possess a structure and an organism more
or less complicated; but some of the lowest forms are
merely little masses of transparent, homogeneous jelly,
known as protoplasm. Some of the smallest of these
are so minute that one hundred millions of them could
occupy the space of a cube one-thousandth of an inch
on each side; yet each one runs its course of life as
regularly as man himself, performing its proper functions
even more perfectly, perhaps.
</p><p>Life Force. &mdash; To every thinking mind the question
often recurs, what makes the fragrant flower so
different from the dead soil from which it grows? the
trilling bird so vastly superior to the inert
atmosphere in which it flies? What subtle power paints
the rose, and tunes the merry songster's voice? To
explain this mystery, philosophers of olden time
supposed the existence of a certain peculiar force, which is
called life, or vital force, or vitality.
</p><p>This supposition does nothing more than furnish a
name for a thing unknown, and the very existence of
which may fairly be doubted. In fact, any attempt to
find a place for such a force, to understand its origin, or
harmonize its existence with that of other well-known
forces, is unsuccessful; and the theory of a peculiar
vital force, a presiding entity, present in every living
thing, vanishes into thin air to give place to the more
rational view of the most advanced modern scientists,
<pb n="37"/>
that vital force, so-called, is only a manifestation of the
ordinary forces of nature acting through a peculiar
arrangement of matter.
</p><p>Life and Organization. &mdash; Life depends, not upon
a peculiar force, but upon a peculiar arrangement of
matter, or organization. It is simply a peculiar
manifestation of the force possessed by atoms exhibited
through a peculiar arrangement of atoms and molecules.
This arrangement is what is known as organization;
and bodies which possess it are known as
organized or living bodies.
</p><p>The term <hi rend="italic">life</hi> may be understood as referring to the
phenomena which result from organization.
</p><p>That life results from organization, not organization
from life, is more consonant with the accepted and
established facts of science than the contrary view.
We might adduce numerous facts and arguments in
support of this view of the nature of life, but will not
dwell longer upon the subject here, as we have
considered it at some length elsewhere.
</p><p>Life Force a Mystery. &mdash; That heat and mechanical
force are produced by the action of the so-called vital
force, is seen by observation. Through experimentation
by the aid of delicate instruments, it may be shown
that vital force is also convertible into electricity. In
certain classes of animals, as the electric eel and
certain fishes, the amount of electricity generated is so
great that large animals may be paralyzed by the shock
received when they come in contact with animals possessing
this property. Certain other classes of the
animal kingdom, as the fire-fly, etc., possess the still
more remarkable property of converting vital heat into
<pb n="38"/>
light. The doctrine of the correlation of forces would
certainly lead to the supposition that the forces
mentioned are likewise converted into vital action, and
the phenomena of animal nutrition also point strongly
in this direction.
</p><p>How the common forces of nature are converted
into life force, or vital force, is a question we shall not
undertake to answer, except to say that it is through
organization. How vital force is converted into heat,
light, electricity, and magnetism, is a problem equally
difficult of solution. How gravitation acts upon matter;
how one particle of matter acts upon another;
how light travels; how force is transmitted from one
object to another, as from a driving belt to the pulley
which is propelled by it, &mdash; these are all questions
which, though apparently easy and simple, are quite
beyond the ability of the most profound scientist to answer.

<head>REPRODUCTION.</head>

<p>
<hi rend="italic">Nutrition</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reproduction</hi>[1] are the two great functions
of life, being common, not only to all animals, but to
both animals and plants, to all classes of living creatures.
The object of the first is the development and maintenance
of individual existence; the second has for its
end the production of new individuals, or the preservation
of the race. Nutrition is a purely selfish process;
reproduction is purely unselfish in its object, though the
human species, unlike the lower animals, which, while
less intelligent, are far more true to nature, too often
pervert its functions to the most grossly selfish ends.


[1] "Science and the Bible," by the author, pp. 36-46.

</p><p>Reproduction Common to All Living Things. &mdash; As
before remarked, reproduction is a function common to
all animals and to all plants. Every organized being
has the power to reproduce itself, or to produce, or aid
in producing, other individuals like itself. It is by
means of this function that plants and animals increase
or multiply.
</p><p>When we consider the great diversity of characters
illustrated in animal and vegetable life, and the infinite
variety of conditions and circumstances under which
organized creatures exist, it is not surprising that modes
of reproduction should also present great diversity, both
in general character and in detail. We shall find it
interesting and instructive to consider some of the many
different modes of reproduction, or generation, observed
in different classes of living beings, previous to entering
upon the specific study of reproduction in man. Before
<pb n="40"/>
doing this, however, let us give brief attention to a
theoretical form of generation, which cannot be called
reproduction, known as &mdash;
</p><p>Spontaneous Generation. &mdash; By this term is meant
the supposed formation of living creatures directly from
dead matter without the intervention of other living
organisms. The theory is, in substance, an old one. The
ancients supposed that the frogs and other small reptiles
so abundant in the vicinity of slimy pools and stagnant
marshes, were generated spontaneously from the mud
and slime in which they lived. This theory was, of
course, abandoned when the natural history of reptiles
became known.
</p><p>For several thousand years the belief was still held
that maggots found in decaying meat were produced
spontaneously; but it was discovered, centuries ago,
that maggots are not formed if the flesh is protected
from flies, and hence must be the larv&aelig; of a species
of this insect. A relic of the ancient belief in spontaneous
generation is still found in the supposition that horse-hair
snakes, so-called, are really formed from the hairs of
horses. This belief is quite common, but science long
ago exposed its falsity. It is now known that the
horse-hair snake is a parasitic worm, which spends part
of its existence in the stomach of a certain species of
beetle. After beginning its independent existence, it
frequents moist places, such as stagnant pools by the
road-side, watering troughs, etc. When the water dries
up, the horse-hair snake becomes dry and apparently
lifeless, and shrivels up, so that it is not readily
discovered. A new rain moistens the little creature, and
brings it into active life again so suddenly that it seems
<pb n="41"/>
like a new creation, or, according to the popular opinion,
appears to be converted from a dead hair into a living
snake.
</p><p>Germs. &mdash; When the microscope was discovered, it
revealed a whole new world of infinitesimal beings,
known as germs, or <hi rend="italic">bacteria</hi>, which were at first supposed
to be of spontaneous origin; but careful scientific
investigation has shown that even these mere specks of life
are not independent of parentage. M. Pasteur and,
more recently, Prof. Tyndall, with many other distinguished
scientists, have demonstrated this fact beyond
all reasonable chance for question.
</p><p>One fact which gave rise to the belief in the
spontaneous origin of germs, is their remarkable vitality.
These microscopic specks of life have been known to
stand a temperature of ten degrees below zero, and
considerably above the boiling point of water. A sufficiently
high degree of heat, however, or long-continued boiling,
has been proven by M. Pasteur to be fatal to them, and
by this means the doctrine of spontaneous generation
was overthrown.
</p><p>It is, then, an established law, that <hi rend="italic">every living organism
originates with some previously existing living being or
beings</hi>.
</p><p>It may be queried, If it be true that life is but a
manifestation of the ordinary forces of matter, &mdash; which
are common to both dead and living matter, &mdash; being
dependent upon arrangement, then why may it not be that
dead matter may, through the action of molecular laws,
and without the intervention of any living existence,
assume those peculiar forms of arrangement necessary to
constitute life, as supposed by the advocates of the theory
<pb n="42"/>
in question? It is true that some who recognize the fact
that life is the result of organization, maintain the doctrine
of <hi rend="italic">spontaneous generation</hi>; that is, the production of life
without any agency other than the recognized forces of
nature being brought about simply by a fortuitous
combination of atoms. Although this doctrine cannot be
said to be inconsistent with the theory of life presented,
yet it is by no means a legitimate or necessary result of
it; and observation proves its falsity.
</p><p>Origin of Life. &mdash; The testimony of all nature, as
almost universally admitted by scientific men, is that
life originated through a creative act by the first great
Cause, who gave to certain bodies the requisite arrangement
or organization to enable them to perform certain
functions, and delegated to them the power to transmit
the same to other matter, and thus to perpetuate life.
The Creator alone has the power to originate life. Man,
with all his wisdom and attainments, cannot discover the
secret of organization. He may become familiar with
its phenomena, but he cannot unravel, further, the
mystery of life. The power of organizing is possessed only
by the lower class of living or organized bodies, those
known as vegetable organisms, or plants. A grain of
wheat, a kernel of corn, a potato, when placed under
favorable conditions, takes the inert, lifeless particles of
matter which lie about it in the earth and air, and organizes
them into living substances like itself.
</p><p>To man and animals the Creator delegated the power
to form their own peculiar structures from the vitalized
tissues of plants. Thus, both animal and vegetable life
is preserved without the necessity of continued acts of
creative power, each plant and each animal possessing
<pb n="43"/>
the power, not only to preserve its own life, but also to
aid, at least, in the perpetuation of the species. The
record of creation in Genesis harmonizes perfectly with
this view, it being represented that God formed (organized
or arranged) man, animals, and vegetable productions
from the earth.
</p><p>Simplest Form of Generation. &mdash; Deep down beneath
the waters of the ocean, covering its bottom in certain
localities, is found a curious slime, which, under the
microscope, is seen to be composed of minute rounded
masses of gelatinous matter, or protoplasm. By watching
these little bodies intently for a few minutes, the
observer will discover that each is a living creature,
capable of moving, growing, and assuming a variety of
shapes. Continued observation will reveal the fact that
these little creatures multiply; and a more careful
scrutiny will enable him to see <hi rend="italic">how</hi> they increase. Each
divides into two equal parts so nearly alike that they
cannot be distinguished when apart. In this case, the
process of generation is simply the production of two
similar individuals from one.
</p><p>Low Forms of Life. &mdash; A small quantity of slime
taken from the surface of a stone near the bottom of an
old well, or on the sea-side, when placed under the
microscope, will sometimes be found to contain large
numbers of small, round, living bodies. Careful watching
will show that they also multiply by division; but
before the division occurs, two cells unite to form one by
a process called <hi rend="italic">conjugation</hi>. Then, by the division of
this cell, instead of only two cells, a large number of
small cells are formed, each of which may be considered
as a bud formed upon the body of the parent cell, and
<pb n="44"/>
then separated from it, to become by growth an individual
like its parent, and, like it, to produce its kind. In
this case, we have new individuals formed by the union
of two individuals which are to all appearance entirely
similar in every particular.
</p><p>Sex. &mdash; Rising higher in the scale of being, we find
that, with rare exceptions, reproduction is the result of
the union of two dissimilar elements. These elements
do not, in higher organisms, as in lower forms of life,
constitute the individuals, but are produced by them;
and being unlike, they are produced by special organs,
each adapted to the formation of one kind of element.
The two classes of organs usually exist in separate
individuals, thus giving rise to distinctions of <hi rend="italic">sex</hi>, an
individual possessing organs which form one kind of element
being called a male, and one possessing organs for the
formation of the other kind of element, a female. The
sexual differences between individuals of the same
species are not, however, confined to the sexual organs.
In most classes of plants and animals, other sexual
differences are very marked. In some of the lower
orders of animals, and in many species of plants, the
male and female individuals are so much unlike that for
a long time after they were well known, no sexual
relation was discovered.
</p><p>In some species of plants, as for example the pond
scums, there is apparently no distinction of sex; and
yet a union of two distinct individuals is necessary for
fecundation; and there is reason to believe that these
two individuals, though apparently in no way dissimilar,
presenting under the microscope complete identity of
appearance, are really sexually distinct, one being male
and the other female.
<pb n="45"/>
</p><p>Hermaphrodism. &mdash; An individual possessing both
male and female organs of reproduction, is called an
<hi rend="italic">hermaphrodite</hi>. Such a combination is very rare among
higher animals; but it is by no means uncommon among
plants and the lower forms of animal life. The snail,
the oyster, the earth-worm, the barnacle, and the common
tape-worm are examples of true hermaphrodites. So-called human hermaphrodites are usually individuals in
whom the sexual organs are abnormally developed, so
that they resemble those of the opposite sex, though
they really have but one sex, which can usually be
determined with certainty. Only a very few cases have
been observed in which both male and female organs
were present.
</p><p>There is now living in Germany an individual who
bears the name of a woman; but learned physicians
have decided that the person is as much man as woman,
having the organs of both sexes. What is still more
curious, this person has the feelings of both sexes, having
loved first a man, and afterward a woman. There have
been observed, also, a very few instances of individuals
in whom the sexual organs of neither sex were present.
It thus appears that a person may be of both sexes, or
of no sex at all.
</p><p>Sex in Plants. &mdash; To one unacquainted with the
mysteries of plant life and growth, the idea of attaching
sexuality to plants seems very extraordinary; but the
botanist recognizes the fact that the distinctions of sex
are as clearly maintained in the vegetable as in the
animal kingdom. The sexual organs of the higher orders
of plants are flowers. That part of the flower which
produces seeds, answers to the female; another part,
which is incapable of forming seeds, answers to the male.
<pb n="46"/>
The fertile and the sterile flowers are sometimes
produced on separate plants. Very frequently, they are
produced upon separate parts of the same plant, as in
the oak, walnut, and many other forest trees, and Indian
corn. In the latter plant, so familiar to every one, the
"tassel" contains the male flowers, and the part known
as the "silk," with the portion to which it is attached, &mdash;
which becomes the ear, &mdash; the female, or fertile flowers.
In a large number of species, the male and female organs
are combined in a single flower, making a true hermaphrodite.
</p><p>Sex in Animals. &mdash; As previously remarked, individuals
of opposite sex usually differ much more than in the
character of their sexual organs. Among higher animals,
the male is usually larger, stronger, and of coarser
structure than the female. The same contrast is observed
in their mental characters. With lower animals, especially
insects, the opposite is often observed. The
female spider is many times larger than the male. The
male ant is small in size when compared with the female.
Nevertheless, in all classes of animals, the difference in
the structure and the functions of the sexual organs is
the chief distinguishing characteristic. These differences
are not so great, however, as they might at first appear.
The male and female organs of reproduction in man and
other animals, which seem so dissimilar, when studied in
the light shed upon this subject by the science of
embryology are found to be wonderfully alike in structure,
differing far more in appearance than in reality, and
being little more than modifications of one general plan.
Every organ to be found in the one sex has an analogue
in the other which is complete in every particular,
corresponding in function, in structure, and usually in
position.
<pb n="47"/>
</p><p>Other Sexual Differences. &mdash; In this country there is
between five and six inches difference in hight, and about
twenty pounds difference in weight, between the average
man and the average woman, the average man being
about five feet, eight inches in hight, and weighing one
hundred and forty-five pounds; while the average woman
is five feet, two or two and one-half inches in hight, and
weighs one hundred and twenty-five pounds. The relation
of the sexes in hight and weight varies in degree in
different countries, but is never changed. The average
hight and weight of American men and women is considerably
above that of the average human being.
</p><p>Men and Women Differ in Form. &mdash; The differences
in form are so marked that it is possible for the skilled
anatomist to determine the sex of a human being who
has been dead for ages, by an examination of the skeleton
alone. In man, the shoulders are broad, the hips narrow,
and the limbs nearly straight with the body. In woman,
the shoulders are narrow and usually rounded, and set
farther back, the collar-bone being longer and less curved,
giving the chest greater prominence; while the hips are
broad.
</p><p>The consequence of these differences is that woman
is generally less graceful and naturally less skillful in
the use of the extremities than man, and hence less
fitted for athletic sports and feats requiring great
dexterity. A girl throws a stone awkwardly, less from
want of practice than from a natural peculiarity of
physical structure., A woman walks less gracefully than a
man, owing to the greater relative breadth of her hips,
requiring a motion of the body together with that of the
limbs. In consequence of this peculiarity, a woman is
less fitted for walking long distances.
<pb n="48"/>
</p><p>The Male and the Female Brain. &mdash; But there are
other important physical differences to which we must
call attention. Man possesses a larger brain than
woman, but she makes up the deficiency in size by
superior fineness in quality. The female brain differs
from the masculine organ of mentality in other particulars
so marked that one who has given the subject attention
can determine with perfect ease the probable sex of the
owner of almost any skull which might be presented to
him. This difference in the conformation of the skull is
undoubtedly due to a difference in mental character,
which, in turn, depends upon a difference in cerebral
development. Faculties which are generally largely
developed in one, are usually smaller in the other; and
the reverse.
</p><p>There has been much discussion as to which sex
possesses the stronger brain. The fact that the brain
of the average woman weighs but forty-two ounces,
while that of the average man weighs forty-nine ounces,
has been stated as evidence that there is a corresponding
difference in mental capacity. Those who advocate this
theory seem to have lost sight of the fact that size alone
is by no means a measure of power. The elephant
possesses a much larger brain than the largest human brain
ever weighed, and yet the intelligence of the elephant,
remarkable as it is for a beast, is infinitely inferior to
that of man. Quality as well as quantity must be taken
into consideration, and it must be shown that the physical
organization of man is finer in quality than that of
woman, before the claim of superiority can be established.
It is certainly reasonable to suppose that the
female brain, as well as the female bones and muscles,
<pb n="49"/>
is of a finer texture and more delicate organization, and
hence is possessed of greater intelligence than the male
brain of equal size.
</p><p>But the most remarkable fact of all, and one which
seems to have escaped the attention of those who have
written upon this subject, is that the comparison of the
male and female brains has been made without regard
to the relative average sizes of male and female bodies.
The average man is larger than the average woman;
he has larger bones, larger muscles, and in all respects a
much larger development; while the average woman
possesses small bones and muscles, though having a
larger proportion of adipose tissue. But the average
woman's brain, while smaller than that of the average
man, is really larger in proportion to her body.
</p><p>Thus it appears that in an argument based upon
brain work irrespective of quality, woman has the
advantage; and if it be granted that to this superior
relative size of brain is added superior quality, the weight of
argument predominates in favor of superior mental capacity
in woman rather than in man.
</p><p>From the author's standpoint, however, all these
arguments are unnecessary. That the brain of the
average woman differs in quality from the brain of the
average man, is a fact too patent to require argument
for its support. Each class of minds has its sphere, and
is in its sphere superior. Men are undoubtedly best
fitted for their sphere in life, and women for theirs;
and yet it is undoubtedly true that among women there
are to be found numerous exceptions, some seeming to
be adapted for muscular rather than feminine pursuits,
and others being vastly better fitted for some of the
<pb n="50"/>
vocations in life which are monopolized by men to a
great extent, than are some men.
</p><p>Vital Organs of Man and Woman. &mdash; The anatomist
also observes an interesting difference in the size of the
various vital organs. For example, while a woman
has a heart proportionally smaller than the same organ
in man, she has a larger liver. Thus, while less fitted
for severe physical exertion by less circulatory power,
she has superior excretory powers.
</p><p>Woman Less Muscular, More Enduring. &mdash; This
peculiarity of structure is perfectly harmonious with the
fact which experience has established so often as to
make the matter no longer a question, that woman is
less fitted for severe muscular exertion than man, but
possesses in a superior degree the quality known as
<hi rend="italic">endurance</hi>. With a less robust frame, a more delicately
organized constitution, she will endure for months what
would kill a robust man in as many weeks. More perfect
elimination of the wastes of the body secures a
higher grade of vitality. On no other hypothesis could
we account for the marvelous endurance of the feminine
part of the civilized portion of the human race, ground
down under the heel of fashion for ages, "stayed,"
"corseted," "laced," and thereby distorted and deformed in a
manner that would be fatal to almost any member of the
masculine sex.
</p><p>A Pathological Difference. &mdash; Nearly all physiologists
mention another particular in which woman differs
materially from man; viz., in naturally employing, in
respiration, chiefly the upper part of the lungs, while
man breathes chiefly with the lower part of the lungs.
For several years, we have carefully studied this ques-<pb n="51"/>
tion, and we have been unable to find any physiological
or anatomical reason sufficient to account for this
fact, if it be such.
</p><p>Why a Woman does Not Breathe Like a Man. &mdash;
It is undoubtedly true that most women do breathe
almost exclusively with the upper part of the chest; but
whether this is a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> peculiarity, or an acquired,
unnatural, and depraved one, is a question which we are
decidedly inclined to answer in harmony with the latter
supposition, basing our conclusion on the following
undeniable facts: &mdash;
</p><p>1. In childhood, and until about the age of puberty,
respiration in the boy and the girl is exactly the
same.
</p><p>2. Although there is a change in the mode of respiration
in most females, usually soon after the period of
puberty, marked by increased intercostal respiration and
diminished abdominal or deep respiration, this change
can be accounted for on other than physiological grounds.
</p><p>3. We believe the cause of this modification of
respiration is the change in dress which is usually made
about that time. The young girl is now becoming a
woman, and must acquire the art of lacing, wearing a
corset, "stays," and sundry other contrivances which
will aid in producing a "fine form," by distorting and
distroying{sic} all natural grace and beauty in the "form
divine."
</p><p>4. We have met a number of ladies whose good fortune
and good sense had delivered them from the distorting
influence of corset-wearing and tight-lacing, and
we have invariably observed that they are capable of
as deep respiration as men, and practice it naturally.
<pb n="52"/>
</p><p>We are thoroughly convinced that this so-called
physiological difference between man and woman is
really a pathological rather than a natural difference,
and is due to the evils of fashionable dress, which we
have exposed at some length in another work exclusively
devoted to that subject.[2] In short, we believe
that the only reason why women do not, under ordinary
circumstances, breathe as do men, is simply
<hi rend="italic">because they cannot</hi> breathe naturally.


[2] "Evils of Fashionable Dress, and How to Dress Healthfully."

</p><p>The Reproductive Elements. &mdash; As has been
previously observed, in all except the very lowest forms of
life, two elements are necessary to the production of a
new individual, or a reproduction of the species, &mdash; a male
element and a female element. The special organs by
means of which these elements are produced, brought
together, and developed into the new individual in a
more or less perfect state, are termed <hi rend="italic">sexual organs</hi>. As
an introduction to the specific study of the sexual
organs in the human species, let us briefly consider the &mdash;
</p><p>Sexual Organs of Plants. &mdash; Flowers are the sexual
organs of plants. Nothing is more interesting in the
natural world than the wonderful beauty, diversity, and
perfect adaptability to various conditions and functions,
which we see in the sexual parts of plants. An
exceedingly interesting line of study, which has
occupied the attention of many naturalists, is the wonderful
perfection displayed in the adaptability of the male and
female parts of plants to each other. Without burdening
the reader with unnecessary technicalities of detail,
we will briefly notice the principal parts of vegetable
sexual organs as illustrated in flowers.
<pb n="53"/>
</p><p>Complete flowers are made up of four parts, two of
which, the <hi rend="italic">stamen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pistil</hi>, are essential, while the
other two, the <hi rend="italic">calyx</hi> and <hi rend="italic">corolla</hi>, are accessory.
</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">calyx</hi> is that part which surrounds the flower
at its outer and lower part. It varies greatly in form
and color, but is most frequently of a green or greenish
color.
</p><p>Just within the calyx is the <hi rend="italic">corolla</hi>, which usually
forms the most attractive, showy, and beautiful part
of the flower. The beautifully colored petals of the
rose, geranium, dahlia, and other similiar{sic} flowers,
form their corollas.
</p><p>Vegetable Husbands. &mdash; Within the cup formed by
the calyx and corollas are placed the <hi rend="italic">stamen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pistils</hi>
of the flower, the first being the male organs proper
and the second the female organs of the flower
</p><p>The stamen is composed of a stem, or filament, at
the summit of which are placed two little sacs, called
the <hi rend="italic">anther</hi>, containing a fine, microscopic dust, the
<hi rend="italic">pollen</hi>, which contains the male reproductive element
of the flower. This part of the plant corresponds
to the male organ of reproduction in animals. A stamen
has been called, not inaptly, a vegetable husband.
Some flowers have many stamens, or vegetable
husbands, which reminds us of the custom in Thibet and
some other Eastern countries which allows a woman
to have several husbands.
</p><p>Polygamous Flowers. &mdash; The great naturalist,
Linn&aelig;us, whose name was immortalized by his careful
study and classification of organized life, made the
number of stamens possessed by various flowers the
basis of a systematic classification.
<pb n="54"/>
</p><p>For example, a flower having but one stamen was
classed as <hi rend="italic">monandria</hi> which means, literally, one
husband; one having two stamens was classified as <hi rend="italic">diandria</hi>;
flowers having a large number of male organs were
termed <hi rend="italic">polyandria</hi>, or many husbands.
</p><p>The Female Organs of Flowers. &mdash; The pistil occupies
the very center of the flower. It produces and contains
in a cell, the female element, termed the <hi rend="italic">ovule</hi>. It is
surmounted by the <hi rend="italic">style</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">stigma</hi>.
</p><p>A series of plants in which the sexual organs are not
visible to the eye are called <hi rend="italic">cryptogamia</hi>, which means,
literally, hidden marriages.
</p><p>As we proceed to study the anatomy of the human
sexual apparatus, we shall be constantly struck with the
remarkable correspondence between animals and vegetables
in the structure and functions of the sexual apparatus.
</p><p>Sexual Organs of Animals. &mdash; The male reproductive
element is called <hi rend="italic">spermatozoon</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">zoosperm</hi>. The female
element is called an <hi rend="italic">ovum</hi>, literally, an egg.
</p><p>The Spermatozoon. &mdash; The male reproductive element
of animals is formed by an organ called the <hi rend="italic">testis</hi>, or
<hi rend="italic">testicle</hi>, of which each male possesses two. They are
elastic, glandular bodies, and are formed within the
cavity of the abdomen, near the kidneys, but usually
pass out of the abdominal cavity, and descend to their
permanent position before birth. The opening in the
abdominal wall is usually completely closed in a short
time; but occasionally it remains open, giving rise to
congenital hernia, an accident in which a loop of intestine
follows the testicle down into the scrotum, either
completely or partially. In a few animals, as in the por-<pb n="55"/>
cupine, the opening is never fully closed, and the testis
remains in the cavity of the body most of the time,
passing out only at certain periods. We also occasionally
meet cases of human beings in which the testes have
never descended from their place in the abdominal cavity,
giving the individuals the appearance of eunuchs.
</p><p>When the testicles are thus retained, they are
usually imperfectly developed, and consequently the
person is likely to be sterile. This is not always the
case, however, and hence it occurs that men who apparently
have no testicles, become the fathers of children.
</p><p>In the whale, the elephant, and the seal, the testicles
remain permanently within the abdominal cavity, though
in most animals they are supported outside the body in
a sac, as in man.
</p><p>The left testicle is sometimes a little smaller than
the right, and commonly hangs a little lower. The
testicles are connected with the urinary passage by
means of two ducts, which terminate near the base of
the bladder.
</p><p>Spermatozoa. &mdash; A single spermatozoon somewhat
resembles a tadpole in appearance, having, however, a
much longer tail in proportion to the size of the body.
</p><p>Human spermatozoa are about 1/1600 of an inch in
length. Those of reptiles are very much larger. One
of the remarkable features of these minute elements is
their peculiar movements. While alive, the filamentous
tail is in constant action in a manner strongly resembling
the movements of the caudal appendage of a tadpole.
This wonderful property led the earlier observers to
believe that they were true animalcula. But they are
not to be regarded as such, though one can scarcely
<pb n="56"/>
make himself believe otherwise while watching their
lively evolutions, and apparently volitionary movements
from one point to another.
</p><p>Spermatozoa originate in the testis as cells, which
are filled with granules. After a time, each granule
acquires a long appendage, and then the cell has become
converted into a bundle of small zoosperms. Development
still continues, until finally the thin pellicle on the
outside of the bundle is ruptured, thus liberating the
spermatozoa, which speedily complete their full development.
The spermatozoon is pure protoplasm, which is
the basis of all life, and its power of spontaneous motion
is due to this fact.
</p><p>In man, the formation of spermatozoa continues with
greater or less rapidity from puberty to old age, though
at the two extremes of existence they are imperfectly
developed. When not discharged from the body, they
are said to be absorbed. Some physiologists claim that
they are composed of a substance identical with nerve
tissue, and that by absorption they play a very important
part in the development and maintenance of the
nervous system.
</p><p>It is asserted by good authorities that the reproductive
element in man is not sufficiently developed to be
really fit for the reproduction of the species before the
age of twenty-four or twenty-five. After the age of
forty-five or fifty, this element deteriorates in quality,
and is again unfitted for vigorous procreation.
</p><p>The fully developed zoosperms are suspended in a
transparent, gelatinous fluid, which, mingled with the
secretion of the prostate gland and other fluids which it
meets during its expulsion from the body, constitutes
the <hi rend="italic">semen</hi>.
<pb n="57"/>
</p><p>The Ovum. &mdash; The female element of generation, the
<hi rend="italic">ovum</hi>, is produced by an organ called the <hi rend="italic">ovary</hi>, of which
there are two in each individual. In size and form, the
ovary closely resembles the testicle. Like the latter
organ, also, it is formed within the body early in the
process of development; but instead of passing outward
and downward, as does the testicle, it remains within
the abdominal cavity, suspended in place by ligaments.
It is connected with a duct, which receives the ovum as
it is discharged, and conveys it to the uterus.
</p><p>The human ovum varies in size from 1/1240 to 1/1120 of an
inch in diameter, and consists of a single cell.
</p><p>Ovulation. &mdash; Ova are not formed in such large numbers
as zoosperms. As a general rule, in the human
female, a single ovum is developed and discharged once
in about four weeks, during the period of sexual activity.
This view is disputed by some physiologists, who claim
that ovules are constantly being formed and thrown off,
not only during that period of a woman's life during
which child-bearing occurs, but prior and subsequent to
the child-bearing period. The development of the
ovaries is symmetrical in all the higher classes of animals,
with the exception of birds, in whom the right ovary is
usually atrophied or undeveloped, allowing room for the
egg produced by this class of the animal kingdom.
</p><p>Fecundation. &mdash; It is often asked, and the question
has elicited some discussion, Which is the principal
reproductive element, the zoosperm, or the ovum? The
ancients supposed the male element to be the essential
element, being simply nourished and developed by the
female; but modern research in biological science does
not sustain this view. Probably neither one enjoys
<pb n="58"/>
special pre-eminence; for neither can undergo complete
development without the other. In very rare cases, the
ovum has been observed to undergo a certain amount of
development of itself; but a perfect individual can be
produced only by the union of the two kinds of elements,
 &mdash; a process known as <hi rend="italic">fecundation</hi>.
</p><p>The fact that the spermatozoa are swallowed up and
lost in the ovule, would rather indicate that the
spermatozoa are inferior in physiological importance to the
ovule, and that their chief action is to stimulate the
ovule to active growth and complete development.
</p><p>The instant the union between the ovum and
spermatozoa occurs, the life of a new individual begins. All
the changes which result between that moment and the
birth of the individual, are those of development only.
Indeed, the same existence continues from the instant of
the union of the two elements, not only until birth, but
through growth, the attainment of maturity, the decline
of life, and even until death.
</p><p>It is interesting to observe the different methods by
which fecundation is effected, in both plants and animals;
for this is a process common to both.
</p><p>Fecundation in Flowers. &mdash; The great naturalist, Linn&aelig;us,
was the first to explain the reproductive process
in plants. He tells us that "the flower forms the theater
of their amours; the calyx is to be considered as the
nuptial bed; the corolla constitutes the curtains; the
anthers are the testes; the pollen, the fecundating fluid;
the stigma of the pistil, the external genital aperture;
the style, the vagina, or the conductor of the prolific
seed; the ovary of the plant, the womb; the reciprocal
action of the stamens on the pistil, the accessory process
of fecundation."
<pb n="59"/>
</p><p>Thus marvelous is the analogy between the reproductive
organs and their functions in plants and animals.
Through this one vital process we may trace a close
relation between all the forms of life, from the humblest
plant, or even the mere specks of life which form the
green scum upon a stagnant pool, to man, the masterpiece
of creation, the highest of all animate creatures.
In all the realm of nature there can be found no more
remarkable evidence of the infinite skill and wisdom of
the Creator of all things.
</p><p>In many instances, the action of plants seems almost
to be prompted by intelligence. At the proper moment,
the corolla contracts in such a way as to bring the
stamens nearer to the stigma, or in contact with it, so as to
insure fecundation. In some aquatic plants, the flowers
elevate themselves above the surface of the water while
the process of fecundation is effected, submerging themselves
again immediately afterward.
</p><p>Other very curious changes occur in flowers of different
species during the reproductive act. The stigma is
observed to become moistened, and even to become distinctly
odorous. Often, too, it becomes intensely congested
with the juices of the plant, and sometimes even
acquires an uncommon and most remarkable degree of
contractility. This is the case with the stigma of the
tulip and one variety of sensitive plant, and in these
plants it is observed to occur not only after the application
of the pollen to the stigma, but when excited by
any other means of stimulation. The flowers of some
plants, during and after fecundation, also show an
increase of heat, in some cases so marked as to be readily
detected with the thermometer. This is said to be especially
the case with the <hi rend="italic">arum</hi> of Italy.
<pb n="60"/>
</p><p>In some plants in which the pistil is longer than the
stamens, thus elevating the stigma above the anthers,
the female organ is often observed to bend over and
depress itself so as to come within reach of the anthers.
</p><p>In most instances, the fecundation of flowers is chiefly
effected through a purely mechanical process, though in
these cases, also, we see a wonderful adaptation of parts
to conditions.
</p><p>Natural Adaptations. &mdash; When the male and female
parts of flowers are situated on different plants, as in the
case of the willow, the poplar, the melon vine, and many
other species, the pollen of the male flower is wafted by
the wind or a gentle breeze to the stigma of the female
flower, which will usually be found at no very great
distance, although fertilization may take place in this
way at very considerable distances. Bees, moths, and
many other species of insects, serve a very important
purpose in this work, transporting the fertilizing dust
upon their wings, antenn&aelig;, sucking tubes, and feet.
Small birds, and even the humble snail, which would
scarcely be credited with any useful function, are also
very serviceable in the same direction. The part
performed by insects in the reproductive process of many
plants is so great that they have been very poetically
termed "the marriage priests of flowers."
</p><p>Nature provides for thorough fecundation in these
cases, by placing the plants which bear the male and the
female flowers near each other. This fact accounts for
the unproductiveness of certain varieties of strawberries
unless mixed with plants of some other variety, it being
well known to nursery-men that some varieties produce
the female parts of flowers almost exclusively.
<pb n="61"/>
</p><p>Curious Modes of Fecundation in Animals. &mdash; The
nodes by which fecundation is effected in animals are
still more various and wonderful than in plants. In
some of the lower animals, as in most fish and reptiles,
both elements are discharged from the bodies of the
parents before coming in contact, there being no contact
of the two individuals. In this class of animals the
process is almost wholly analogous to fecundation in
those plants in which the male and female flowers are on
different plants or on different parts of the same plant.
In the female fish, a larger number of ova are developed
at a certain season of the year, known as the spawning
season. Sometimes the number reaches many thousands.
At the same time, the testicles of the male fish, which
are contained within the abdominal cavity, become
distended with developed zoosperms. When the female
seeks a place to deposit her eggs, the male closely
follows; and as she drops them upon the gravelly bottom,
he discharges upon them the zoosperms, by which they
are fecundated. According to the testimony of an eye-witness, the waters of the North Sea are in some places
turbid with the eggs of cod-fish during the spawning
season.
</p><p>The process is analogous in some species of frogs.
When the female is about to deposit her eggs, the male
mounts upon her back, and rides about until the eggs are
all deposited, discharging upon them the fertilizing
spermatozoa as they are laid by the female.
</p><p>The male frog is enabled to maintain its hold during
the long period occupied by the female in laying eggs,
by means of an extra development upon the first toe
of each fore-foot, which occurs at this period. At
<pb n="62"/>
the end of the breeding season, these temporary thumbs,
being no longer needed, disappear.
</p><p>In some species in which internal impregnation
occurs, there is no contact between the species, but by
some means not yet understood, the spermatozoa discharged
by the male find their way into the internal
passages of the female, where the ovules are impregnated.
</p><p>In serpents, fecundation occurs by mere contact of
the sexual organs. In snails, which have already
been mentioned as hermaphrodite animals, each
individual possessing in a perfectly developed state both
male and female organs, internal fecundation occurs after
a very curious fashion, thus described by the eminent
naturalist, Prof. T. R. Jones, F. R. S., of London: &mdash;
</p><p>"The manner in which they copulate is not a little
curious, their union being accompanied by preparatory
blandishments of a very extraordinary kind, that to a
spectator would seem rather like a combat between
mortal foes than the tender advances of two lovers.
After sundry caresses between the two parties, during
which they exhibit an animation quite foreign to
them at other times, one of the snails unfolds from the
right side of its neck, where the generative orifice is
situated, a wide sacculus, which, by becoming everted,
displays a sharp dagger-like spiculum, or dart, attached
to its walls. Having bared this singular weapon, it
endeavors, if possible, to strike it into some exposed part
of the body of its paramour, who, on the other hand,
uses every precaution to avoid the blow, by speedily
retreating into its shell. But, at length, having received
the love-inspiring wound, the smitten snail prepares to
<pb n="63"/>
retaliate, and in turn uses every effort to puncture its
assailant in a similar manner. The darts are generally
broken off in this encounter, and either fall to the
ground, or remain fixed in the wounds which they have
inflicted. After these preparatory stimulations, the
snails proceed to more effective advances. The sac of
the dart is withdrawn into the body, and another sacculus
is by a like process protruded from the common generative
aperture. Upon the last-named organ, two orifices
are seen, one of which leads to the female generative
system, while from the other a long and whip-like penis
is slowly unfolded, being gradually everted like the
finger of a glove, until it attains the length of an inch
or more. Then each of the two snails impregnates its
partner, and is itself impregnated at the same time."
</p><p>In the oyster, another hermaphrodite, self-fecundation
occurs. In the argonaut, a species of cuttle-fish,
fecundation is effected in a most extraordinary manner.
The male, which is smaller than the female, has upon
the left side of its body a little sac, in which grows a
coiled-up worm-like arm covered with suckers. This
arm is really a sac, which communicates with the testes,
and contains spermatozoa. On reaching full development,
and becoming filled with spermatozoa, this curious
arm detaches itself from the body of the argonaut, and
begins an independent life. Floating through the water,
it by and by finds a female argonaut, with which it
connects itself, and impregnates it with the spermatozoa
transported from the male.
</p><p>In the tape-worm, a parasitic creature which is
found in the human digestive canal, a very curious form
of fecundation has been noted. When liberated from
<pb n="64"/>
the egg, it consists simply of a head with hooks, by
which it attaches itself to the mucous membrane of the
intestines. From the head grows out a body, which
shortly divides into segments, which gradually increase
in number and size. Each section contains both male
and female sexual organs, and is self-fecundating. After
a time, the older segments become detached, and lead
independent lives, until all the ovules they contain have
been deposited. It has been established that more than
twenty thousand eggs are produced by a single worm.
</p><p>In higher orders of animals, fecundation takes place
within the generative passages of the female by contact
between the male and female organs. To effect this,
there are necessitated certain accessory organs, the <hi rend="italic">penis</hi>
in the male and the <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> in the female.
</p><p>Nothing in all the range of nature is more remarkable
than the adaptation of the two varieties of sexual
organs in each species. This necessary provision is both
a powerful means of securing the perpetuation of the
species, and an almost impassible barrier against amalgamation.
</p><p>The act of union, or sexual congress, is called <hi rend="italic">coitus</hi>,
or <hi rend="italic">copulation</hi>. It is accompanied by a peculiar nervous
spasm, due to the excitement of special nerves principally
located in the <hi rend="italic">penis</hi> in the male, and in the <hi rend="italic">clitoris</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> in the female. The nervous action referred to is
more exhausting to the system than any other to which
it is subject.
</p><p>Union of the Ovum and Zoosperm. &mdash; The zoosperms
not only come in contact with the ovum, but penetrate
the thin membrane which incloses its contents, and
enter its interior, where they disappear, becoming united
<pb n="65"/>
with its substance. In the ova of certain fishes, small
openings have been observed, through which the spermatozoa
find entrance. Whether such openings exist in
human ova, is an undecided question; but it is probable
that they do.
</p><p>Curious Modes of Reproduction. &mdash; A peculiar kind
of reproduction is observed in a variety of polyp, a
curious animal which very much resembles a flower in
appearance. It attaches itself to some solid object, and
then, as it grows, sends out little protuberances resembling
buds. Some of these separate and fall off, swimming
about as separate animals. These never become
like the parent polyp; but they lay eggs, which hatch,
and become stationary polypi like their grandparent,
and in their turn throw off buds to form swimming
polypi. In this case we have two kinds of generation
combined, alternating with each other.
</p><p>Parthenogenesis. &mdash; Plant-lice afford a curious
illustration of a similar generation, known as <hi rend="italic">parthenogenesis</hi>.
Males and females unite, and produce eggs. The creatures
produced by the hatching of eggs are neither males
nor perfect females. They are <hi rend="italic">imperfect females</hi>. They
are all alike, so that no sexual union occurs. Instead of
laying eggs, they produce live young like themselves,
which appear to be developed from internal buds similar
to the external buds of the polyp. After this method of
reproduction has continued for nine generations, a few
perfect individuals appear, and the first process is
repeated. While this budding process has been going on,
the original insect has continued laying; and so great is
the rapidity of this form of reproduction that it has been
estimated that even at the end of the fifth generation, a
<pb n="66"/>
single insect may be the great great grandmother of
nearly six billion young ones.
</p><p>The common honey-bee affords another illustration
like the last. A virgin queen sometimes lays eggs,
which always produce males, or drones. After union
with a male, she lays eggs in the royal cells, and these
become perfect females like herself. She also seems to
have the power to lay, at will, unfecundated eggs, from
which drones are produced.
</p><p>An analogous mode of reproduction prevails among
certain species of worms, which multiply by simple
division of the body, one portion producing the head, and
the other the tail. The individuals thus produced have
no sex, and may be called neuters. They go on and on
reproducing in this way for several generations, until
finally a new individual is produced which is sexually
complete and reproduction by means of eggs is again
begun.
</p><p>Human Beings are Developed Buds. &mdash; It has been
very aptly suggested by an eminent physiologist that the
ovum and zoosperm may be correctly considered as
internal buds. Thus it would appear that generation is
universally a process of budding. A child is but a
compound bud, an offshoot from its parents. This idea is
not a mere fancy, but has a scientific basis. As all the
exquisite details of the most beautiful flower are in
essence contained within the tiny bud which first makes
its appearance, so is the developed human being, the
full-grown man or woman, virtually contained within the
tiny cell called the ovum after it has been impregnated
or fecundated by the zoosperms. In short, men and
women are blossoms in a strictly scientific sense.
<pb n="67"/>
</p><p>The process of fecundation in hermaphrodite animals
is very peculiar. In some cases, as in the snail, the
union of two individuals is usually necessary, though
each possesses both kinds of organs. In other cases, as
in the tape-worm, the oyster, and numerous other
mollusks, a single individual has the power to fertilize
its own ova, thus being wholly independent. Human
hermaphrodites are usually so deformed that fecundation
is not effected, which is a fortunate safeguard against
the multiplication of such monstrosities.
</p><p>Complemental Males. &mdash; One species of barnacle was
for some time quite a puzzle to the zoologist, as no male
of the species could be found, hence no means by which
the eggs produced by the egg-bearing, or female, animal
could be fecundated. At last, Prof. Darwin discovered,
snugly hidden away in the corner of a little pocket in
the female, the male animal, so unlike the female that it
had never been suspected as having any relationship;
but it proved, on examination by dissection, to be a fully
developed male. In some varieties of this queer species,
the female has been observed carrying in this little
pocket two or three of these diminutive males.
</p><p>Development. &mdash; After the union of the two elements,
known as fecundation, or conception, if the conditions are
favorable, development occurs; and the little germ is in
due process of time developed into an individual which
is an exact counterpart of its parents. During this
developmental process, the embryonic being is variously
treated by different classes of animals.
</p><p>Unprotected Development. &mdash; Most fishes and reptiles
discharge their ova before fecundation, or soon after, and
pay no further attention to them. The fish deposits its
<pb n="68"/>
eggs in a little hollow scooped out in the gravelly bed
of a stream, or sows them broadcast upon the waters.
The turtle buries its eggs in the sand, and leaves them
to be hatched by the sun. The ostrich disposes of her
eggs in the same way. Many other species of animals
pay no regard to the protection of the germs which are
destined, if placed under favorable conditions, to become
individuals like themselves.
</p><p>Partial Protection of the Ovum. &mdash; There are some
exceptions, however, to this general rule among fishes
and reptiles. Even fishes manifest a degree of parental
solicitude in certain cases. The male of a species of
South American fish gathers up the eggs after fecundation
has taken place, and carries them in his mouth until
they are hatched. Another male fish carries the eggs
of his mate in a little pouch upon the lower and posterior
part of his body.
</p><p>Certain species of frogs carry their eggs wound about
their legs; others suspend them from the abdomen.
Another variety carries its young upon its back. Prof.
Wyman describes a "swamp toad" which patiently takes
the eggs of his mate, one by one, and fastens them upon
her back, observing great regularity in arrangement.
These several devices are evidently for the purpose of
protecting, in some degree, the young individuals during
the helpless stage of their existence.
</p><p>The eggs of sharks, which are few in number, are
each provided with a horny covering and four filamentous
attachments resembling the tendrils of a grape-vine,
by which they become entangled among the sea-weeds,
sad are thus protected.
</p><p>The cuttle-fish covers its eggs between the folds of
its queerly shaped body.
<pb n="69"/>
</p><p>Some species of fish gather their eggs together in
masses, and surround them by a protective covering.
A species of worm carries a whole colony of little ones
upon its back. Even the star-fish protects its eggs
with its arms; and if they become scattered, gathers
them up.
</p><p>Development in the Higher Animals and Man. &mdash;
Higher animals are less prolific, and their development
is a more complicated process, hence, their young
need greater protection; and for this reason, the ova,
instead of being discharged from the body of the female
after fecundation, are retained.
</p><p>Curious examples of internal development sometimes
occur in animals which usually deposit eggs. Snakes
have been known to produce both eggs and living
young at the same time. At the annual meeting of
the American Society for the Advancement of Science,
at Detroit, Mich., in August, 1875, we had the pleasure
of examining a specimen, exhibited by Prof. Wilder,
of a chick which had undergone a considerable degree
of development within the ovary of the hen. It had
a head, a rudimentary brain, and internal viscera, but
no feathers nor limbs. It was, in fact, an egg hatched
before it had been laid. The anomaly excited much
interest at that time, and since, among biologists.
</p><p>As we have seen that a suitable receptacle is
sometimes provided outside of the body, so now a receptacle
is needed, and is provided in the interior of the body of
the female. This receptacle is called &mdash;
</p><p>The Uterus. &mdash; This is a hollow, pear-shaped organ,
located in the median line, just behind the bladder,
between it and the rectum. It is supported in place
<pb n="70"/>
by various ligaments, and by the juxtaposition of other
organs. Its larger end is directed upward, and
communicates upon each side with a very narrow tube,
which is prolonged outward on either side until it
nearly touches the ovary of the same side. Its lower
and smaller end fills the internal extremity of the
passage previously described as the vagina. When the ovum
is matured, it escapes from the ovary into the narrow
tube referred to, called the <hi rend="italic">Fallopian tube</hi>, and passes
down into the cavity of the uterus. If fecundation
does not occur, it is expelled or absorbed after six to
twelve or fourteen days. If copulation occurs, however,
zoosperms are brought into the cavity of the
uterus, and, coming in contact with the ovum, fecundate
it. This is <hi rend="italic">conception</hi>. When the natural process
is allowed to proceed, development occurs.
</p><p>Gestation, or Pregnancy. &mdash; This is the term applied
to the process last referred to. We shall not
attempt to describe in detail this most wonderful and
intricate of all living processes; but will sketch only the
chief points, leaving the reader who would obtain a
more complete knowledge of the subject, to consult any
one of the numerous physiological and obstetrical works
which deal with it in a very exhaustive manner.
</p><p>As soon as the ovum is impregnated by the male
element, it begins a process of symmetrical division.
The first division produces two cells out of the single
one which first existed. By the next division, four
segments are produced; then eight, sixteen, etc. While
this process is going on, the ovum becomes adherent to
the internal wall of the uterus, and is soon enveloped
by its mucous membrane, which grows up about it and
incloses it.
<pb n="71"/>
</p><p>The Primitive Trace. &mdash; When the process of segmentation
has advanced to a certain point, the cells are
aggregated together in a compact layer at the surface.
Soon a straight line appears upon this layer, which is
called the <hi rend="italic">primitive trace</hi>. This delicate line becomes
the basis for the spinal column; and upon and about it
the whole individual is developed by an intricate process
of folding, dividing, and reduplication of the layer of
cells. One end of the line becomes the head, and the
other becomes the tail. Even man has a caudal
appendage at an early stage of his existence. After a
further lapse of time, little excrescences, buds, or
"pads" appear in the proper positions to represent the
arms and legs. After further development, the ends
split up into fingers and toes, and by the continued
development of the parts, perfect arms and legs are
formed.
</p><p>Curious Relation to Lower Animals. &mdash; It is a very
remarkable fact that in the lower animals we have
numerous examples in which the permanent condition of
the individual is the same as some one of the stages
through which man passes in the process of development.
The same author previously quoted makes the following
interesting statements: &mdash;
</p><p>"The webbed feet of the seal and ornithorhynchus
typify the period when the hands and feet of the human
embryo are as yet only partly subdivided into fingers
and toes. Indeed, it is not uncommon for the `web' to
persist to some extent between the toes of adults; and
occasionally children are born with two or more fingers
or toes united to their tips.
</p><p>"With the seal and the walrus, the limbs are pro-<pb n="72"/>
truded but little beyond the wrist and ankle. With the
ordinary quadrupeds, the knee and elbow are visible.
The cats, the lemurs, and the monkeys form a series in
which the limbs are successively freed from the trunk,
and in the highest apes they are capable of nearly the
same movements as the human arm and leg, which, in
their development, passed through all these stages."
</p><p>Simplicity of Early Structures. &mdash; The first structures
formed are exceedingly simple in form. It is only by
slow degrees that the great complicity which characterizes
many organs is finally attained. For example, the
heart is at first only a straight tube. By enlargement
and the formation of longitudinal and transverse
partitions, the fully developed organ is finally produced.
The stomach and intestines are also at first but a simple
straight tube. The stomach and large intestine are
formed by dilatation; and by growth of the tube in
length while the ends are confined, the small intestines
are formed. The other internal organs are successively
developed by similar processes.
</p><p>The Stages of Growth. &mdash; At first, insignificant in
size, a simple cell, the embryonic human being steadily
increases in size, gradually approximating more and
more closely to the human form, until, at the end of
about nine calendar months, or ten lunar months, the
new individual is prepared to enter the world, and begin
a more independent course of life. The following
condensation of a summary quoted by Dr. Austin Flint, Jr.,
will give an idea of the size of the developing being at
different periods, and the rate of progress: &mdash;
</p><p>At the end of the third week, the embryon is a little
less than one-fourth of an inch in length.
<pb n="73"/>
</p><p>At the end of the seventh week, it is three fourths of
an inch long. The liver, lungs, and other internal organs
are partially formed.
</p><p>At the eighth week, it is about one inch in length.
It begins to look some like a human being, but it is
impossible to determine the sex.
</p><p>At the third month, the embryon has attained the
length of from two to two and one-half inches. Its weight
is about one ounce.
</p><p>At the end of the fourth month, the embryon is
called a fetus. It is from four to five inches long, and
weighs five ounces.
</p><p>At the fifth month, the fetus is nearly a foot long,
and weighs about half a pound.
</p><p>At the sixth month, the average length of the fetus
is about thirteen inches, and its weight one and a half to
two pounds. If born, life could continue a few minutes.
</p><p>At the seventh month, the fetus is from fourteen to
fifteen inches long, and weighs from two to three pounds.
It is now viable (may live if born).
</p><p>At the eighth month, the length of the fetus is from
fifteen to sixteen inches, and its weight from three to
four pounds.
</p><p>At the ninth month, the fetus is about seventeen
inches long, and weighs from five to six pounds.
</p><p>At birth, the infant weighs a little more than seven
pounds, the usual range being from four to ten pounds,
though these limits are sometimes exceeded.
</p><p>Duration of Gestation. &mdash; The length of time required
for the development of a human being is usually reckoned
as about forty weeks. A more precise statement places
it at about two hundred and seventy-eight days. This
<pb n="74"/>
limit is often varied from. Cases have occurred in
which a much longer time has been required; and
numberless cases are recorded in which human beings have
been born several weeks before the expiration of the
usual time, as stated. There is some uncertainty
respecting the exact length of the period of gestation,
which grows out of the difficulty of determining, in many
cases, the exact time when conception took place.
</p><p>In the kangaroo, though the period required for
development is about the same as in the human female,
uterine gestation continues for only thirty-nine days.
At the end of this time, the infant kangaroo is transferred
to a pouch provided under the hinder part of the body
of the mother, which also contains the mammary glands.
To the nipple of one of these the lips of the young
animal become attached, and by a curious rhythmical
action of certain muscles, the paternal nourishment is
regularly forced into the mouth of the little one. The
eminent Prof. Owen thus remarks concerning this remarkable
mode of caring for the young: &mdash;
</p><p>"Thus aided and protected by modifications of structure,
both in the system of the mother and in its own,
designed with special reference to each others' peculiar
condition, and affording, therefore, the most irrefragible
evidence of creative foresight, the feeble offspring
continues to increase from sustenance derived exclusively
from the mother, for a period of about eight months.
The young kangaroo may then frequently be seen to
protrude its head from the mouth of the pouch, and to crop
the grass at the same time the mother is browsing.
Having thus acquired additional strength, it quits the
pouch, and hops at first with a feeble and vacillating
<pb n="75"/>
gait, but continues to return to the pouch for occasional
shelter and supplies of food, until it has attained the
weight of ten pounds. After this, it will occasionally
insert its head for the purpose of sucking, notwithstanding
another fetus may have been deposited in the pouch;
for the latter attaches itself to a different nipple from the
one which has previously been in use."
</p><p>Uterine Life. &mdash; The uterine life of the new individual
begins with the impregnation of the ovum, which occurs
the instant it is brought in contact with the zoosperms
of the male. While in the uterus, the young life is
supported wholly by the mother. She is obliged to provide
not only for her own sustenance, but for the maintenance
of her child. And she must not only eat for it, but
breathe for it as well, since it requires a constant and
adequate supply of oxygen before birth as much as
afterward.
</p><p>How the Unborn Infant Breathes. &mdash; Oxygen and
nutriment are both supplied to it through the medium of
an organ called the <hi rend="italic">placenta</hi>, which is a spongy growth,
composed almost entirely of blood-vessels, and is developed
upon the inner wall of the uterus, at the point
where the ovum attaches itself after fecundation. The
growing fetus is connected with this vascular organ by
means of a sort of cable, called the <hi rend="italic">umbilical</hi> cord. The
cord is almost entirely composed of blood-vessels, which
convey the blood of the fetus to the placenta, and return
it again. The fetal blood does not mix with that of the
mother, but receives oxygen and nourishment from it by
absorption through the thin walls which alone separate
it from the mother's blood.
</p><p>The umbilical cord contains no nerves, as there is no
<pb n="76"/>
nervous connection between the mother and the child.
The only way in which the child can be influenced by
the mother is through the medium of the blood, to
changes in which it is very susceptible, as we shall see
more clearly hereafter.
</p><p>The cord is attached to the body of the child at the
point called the <hi rend="italic">navel</hi>, being cut off at birth by the
<hi rend="italic">accoucher</hi>. With the placenta, it is expelled soon after the
birth of the child, and constitutes the shapeless mass
familiarly known as the <hi rend="italic">after-birth</hi>, by the retention of
which the most serious trouble is occasionally caused.
</p><p>Parturition, or Childbirth. &mdash; At the end of the
period of development, the young being is forcibly expelled
from the laboratory of nature in which it has been formed.
In other words, it is born; and this process is termed
<hi rend="italic">parturition</hi>. Though at first thought such an act would
seem an utter impossibility, yet it is a very admirable
illustration of nature's adaptation of means to ends.
During the months of gestation, while the uterus has
been enlarging to accommodate its daily increasing
contents, the generative passages have also been increasing
in size, and becoming soft and distensible, so that a
seeming impossibility is in due time accomplished without
physical damage, though possibly not without intense
suffering. However, it is a most gratifying fact that
modern medical science may do much to mitigate the
pains of childbirth. It is possible, by a proper course
of preparation for the expected event, to greatly lessen
the suffering usually undergone; and some ladies assert
that they have thus avoided real pain altogether.
Although the curse pronounced upon the feminine part of
the race, in consequence of the sin of Eve, implies suffer-<pb n="77"/>
ing in the parturient act, yet there is no doubt that the
greater share of the daughters of Eve are, through the
perverting and degenerating influences of wrong habits,
and especially of modern civilization, compelled to suffer
many times more than their maternal ancestor. We
have sufficient evidence of this in the fact that among
barbarian women, who are generally less perverted
physically than civilized women, childbirth is regarded with
very little apprehension, since it occasions little pain or
inconvenience. The same is true of many women among
the lower laboring classes. In short, while it is true
that more or less suffering must always accompany the
parturient act, yet the excessive pain usually attendant
upon the process is the result of causes which can in many
cases be removed by proper management beforehand and
at the time of confinement.
</p><p>After being relieved of its contents, the uterus and
other organs rapidly return to nearly their original size.
</p><p>Changes in the Child at Birth. &mdash; In the system of
the child a wonderful change occurs at the moment of
its expulsion into the outer world. For the first time,
its lungs are filled with air. For the first time, they
receive the full tide of blood. The whole course of the
circulation is changed, and an entirely new process
begins. It is surprising in how short a space of time
changes so marvelous can be wrought.
</p><p>Nursing. &mdash; The process of development is not fully
complete at birth. The young life is not yet prepared
to support itself; hence, still further provision is
necessary for it. It requires prepared food suited to its
condition. This is provided by the <hi rend="italic">mamm&aelig;</hi>, or breasts, of
the female, which are glands for secreting milk. The
<pb n="78"/>
fully developed gland is peculiar to the female; but a
few instances have been known in which it has been
sufficiently developed to become functionally active in
men, as well as in young girls, though it is usually
inactive even in women until near the close of gestation.
It is a curious fact that the breasts of a new-born child
occasionally contain milk.
</p><p>The first product of the mamm&aelig; is not the proper
milk secretion, but is a yellowish fluid, called <hi rend="italic">colostrum</hi>.
The true milk secretion begins two or three days after
delivery.
</p><p>The lacteal secretion is influenced in a very remarkable
manner by the mental conditions of the mother.
By sudden emotions of grief or anger, it has been
known to undergo such changes as to produce in the
child a fit of indigestion, vomiting, diarrhea, and even
convulsions and death. Any medicine taken by the
mother finds its way into the milk, and often affects
the delicate system of the infant more than herself.
This fact should be a warning to those nursing mothers
who use stimulants. Cases are not uncommon in
which delicate infants are kept in a state of intoxication
for weeks by the use of alcoholic drinks by the
mother. The popular notion that lager-beer, ale, wine,
or alcohol in any other form, is in any degree necessary
or beneficial to a nursing woman, is a great
error, which cannot be too often noticed and condemned.
Not only is the mother injured instead of being benefited
by such a practice, but great injury, sometimes
life-long in its consequence, is inflicted upon the babe
at the breast, who takes the intoxicating poison second
hand, and is influenced in a fourfold degree because of
its feebleness and great susceptibility.</p>

<head>ANATOMY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.</head>

<p>Having now considered the functions and something
of the structure of the principal organs of reproduction,
we may obtain a more definite idea of the relation of
the several organs of each class by a connected review
of the anatomy of the parts.
</p><p>Male Organs. &mdash; As previously stated, the external
organs of generation in the male are the <hi rend="italic">penis</hi> and the
<hi rend="italic">testicles</hi>, the latter being contained in a pouch, called
the <hi rend="italic">scrotum</hi>. The penis is the organ of urination as
well as of copulation. Its structure is cellular, and it
contains a vast number of minute coils of blood-vessels,
which become turgid with blood under the influence
of sexual excitement, producing distention and
erection of the organ. A canal passes through its
entire length, called the <hi rend="italic">urethra</hi>, which conveys both the
urine and the seminal fluid. The organ is protected by
a loose covering of integument, which folds over the
end. This fold is called the <hi rend="italic">foreskin</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">prepuce</hi>.
</p><p>The fluid formed by each testicle is conveyed by the
<hi rend="italic">vas deferens</hi>, a curved tube about two feet in length, to
the base of the bladder. Here the vas deferens joins
with another duct, which communicates with an elongated
pouch, the <hi rend="italic">vesicula seminalis</hi>, lying close to the
under side of the bladder. The single tube thus formed,
the <hi rend="italic">ejaculatory duct</hi>, conveys the seminal fluid to the
urethra, from which it is discharged.
</p><p>As the production of seminal fluid is more or less
constant in man and some animals, while its discharge is
<pb n="80"/>
intermittent, the vesicul&aelig; seminales serve as reservoirs
for the fluid, preserving it until required, or allowing
it to undergo absorption. Some claim that the zoosperms
are matured in these organs. They always contain
seminal fluid after the age of puberty. During
coition, their contents are forcibly expelled by a
spasmodic contraction of the muscles which surround them
and the ducts leading from them.
</p><p>The Prostate Gland. &mdash; Surrounding the ejaculatory
ducts and their openings into the urethra at the base of
the bladder, is the <hi rend="italic">prostate gland</hi>, which produces a peculiar
secretion that forms a considerable portion of the
seminal fluid, being mingled with the secretion of the
testes during its ejaculation. This gland sometimes
becomes the seat of rather serious disease. In old age, it
usually becomes slightly indurated, and often to such an
extent as to seriously affect the health and comfort of
the individual by interference with urination and by
occasioning pain.
</p><p>Anterior to this organ, in the urethra, is a curious
little pouch, the <hi rend="italic">utriculus</hi>, which corresponds to the
vagina and uterus in the female. Just in front of the
prostate gland are two small bodies, known as <hi rend="italic">Cowper's
glands</hi>. They secrete a fluid which combines with the
seminal secretion.
</p><p>Female Organs. &mdash; The <hi rend="italic">ovaries</hi>, <hi rend="italic">uterus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">womb</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Fallopian
tubes</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> have already been described in
part. The external organs of the female are included in
the term <hi rend="italic">vulva</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">pudenda</hi>. The most superficial parts
are the <hi rend="italic">labia</hi>, two thick folds of integument. Just
within these two are thinner folds, the <hi rend="italic">labia minora</hi>, or
<hi rend="italic">nymph&aelig;</hi>. These, together with the <hi rend="italic">clitoris</hi>, situated just
<pb n="81"/>
above, are extremely sensitive organs, being the chief
seat of sexual sense in the female. At the lower part
is the opening to the vagina, which in the virgin is
usually partially guarded by a thin membrane, the
<hi rend="italic">hymen</hi>. This is not always a reliable test of virginity,
however, as commonly regarded, since it may be
destroyed by disease or accident, and may exist even after
the occurrence of pregnancy.
</p><p>The vagina extends from the vulva to the lower end
of the uterus, which it incloses, passing between the
bladder and the rectum. The lower extremity of the
uterus presents a small opening, which leads into its
interior. Upon either side, at its upper and larger end,
is a minute opening, the mouth of the Fallopian tube.
The latter organs extend from the uterus outward nearly
to the ovaries, toward which they present a number of
small filaments, one of which is in contact with each
ovary. These filaments, together with the interior of
the tubes, are covered with a peculiar kind of cells, upon
which are minute cilia, or hairs, in constant motion.
Very curiously, they all move in the same direction,
toward the cavity of the uterus. When an ovum
escapes from the ovary in connection with menstruation,
it is by these delicate hairs propelled along a filament of
tissue to the Fallopian tube, and thence by the same
means is conveyed to the uterus. It may come in contact
with the zoosperms at any point between the ovary
and the lower orifice of the uterus, and thus undergo
fecundation.
</p><p>Puberty. &mdash; For a certain period after birth, the sexual
organs remain in a partially developed condition.
This period varies in duration with different animals, in
<pb n="82"/>
some cases being very brief, in others, comprising several
years. Upon the attainment of a certain age, the
individual becomes sexually perfect, and is then capable
of the generative act. This period is called <hi rend="italic">puberty</hi>.
</p><p>In man, puberty commonly occurs between the ages
of ten and fifteen years, varying considerably in different
climates. In this country, and in other countries of
about the same latitude, puberty usually occurs at the
age of fourteen or fourteen and one-half years in females,
and a few months later in males. In cooler climates, as
in Norway and Siberia, the change is delayed to the age
of eighteen or nineteen years. In tropical climates it is
hastened, occurring as early as nine or ten years. In
warm climates it is no uncommon thing for a girl to be
a mother at twelve; and it is stated that one of the
wives of Mahomet was a mother at ten.
</p><p>Other causes besides climate tend to hasten the
occurrence of this change, as habits, temperament,
constitutional tendency, education, and idiosyncrasy.
</p><p>Causes which Delay Puberty. &mdash; Habits of vigorous
physical exercise tend to delay puberty. For this
reason, together with others, country boys and girls
generally mature later than those living in the city by several
months, and even a year or two. Anything that tends
to excite the emotions, hastens puberty. The excitements
of city life, parties, balls, theaters, even the competition
of students in school, and the various causes of excitement
to the nervous system which occur in city life,
have a tendency to hasten the occurrence of the change
which awakens the sexual activities of the system into
life. Hence, these influences cannot but be considered
prejudicial to the best interests of the individual, men-<pb n="88"/>
tally, morally, and physically, since it is in every way
desirable that a change which arouses the passions and
gives to them greater intensity, should be delayed rather
than hastened.
</p><p>Influence of Diet on Puberty. &mdash; The dietary has a
not unimportant influence in this respect. Stimulating
foods, such as pepper, vinegar, mustard, spices, and
condiments generally, together with tea and coffee, and an
excess of animal food, have a clearly appreciable influence
in inducing the premature occurrence of puberty. On
this account, if on no other, should these articles be
prohibited to children and youth, or used very sparingly.
Those who advocate the large use of meat by children
and youth, have not studied this matter closely in all its
bearings. While it is true that children and growing
youth require an abundance of the nitrogenous elements
of food which are found abundantly in beefsteak, mutton,
fish, and other varieties of animal food, it is also true
that in taking these articles of food, they take, along
with the nutrient elements, properties of a stimulating
character, which exert a decidedly detrimental influence
upon the susceptible systems of children and youth. At
the same time, it is possible to obtain the same desirable
nitrogenous elements in oatmeal, unbolted wheat flour,
peas, beans, and other vegetable productions, which are
wholly free from injurious properties. We are positive,
from numerous observations on this subject, that a cool,
unstimulating vegetable or farinaceous diet would deter
the development of the sexual organism for several
months, and perhaps for a year or two.
</p><p>While it might not be in all cases desirable to do
this, it would at least be wise to adopt such measures in
<pb n="84"/>
cases in which the child is unavoidably exposed to influences
which have a tendency to hasten the change.
</p><p>A Caution. &mdash; It is important to add in this connection
a word of caution against the adoption of a dietary too
abstemious in character. It is necessary that an abundance
of good, wholesome food, rich in the elements of
nutrition, should be taken regularly. There is no doubt
that many young ladies have induced conditions of serious
disease by actual starvation of the system. A young
woman who attempts to live on strong tea or coffee, fine-flour bread, and sweet cake, is as certainly starving herself
as though she were purposely attempting to commit
suicide by starvation, and with as much certainty of the
same result.
</p><p>Brunettes Precocious. &mdash; It has been observed that
in girls the occurrence of puberty is earlier in brunettes
than in blondes; and in general, it makes its appearance
earlier in persons of a nervous or nervo-bilious temperament
than in persons of a lymphatic temperament or
phlegmatic nature.
</p><p>Certain nationalities and families are marked by the
earlier occurrence of puberty than others. In Jews,
the change is commonly a year or two in advance of
other nationalities in this country. It also occurs somewhat
sooner in negroes or creoles than in white persons,
the African race seeming to retain something of the
precocity occasioned by the tropical influence of its native
clime.
</p><p>Remarkable Precocity. &mdash; Cases occasionally occur in
which puberty makes its appearance at the age of three
or four years. Indeed, a case has been reported in this
country in which a female child possessed at birth all
<pb n="85"/>
the characteristics which are usually developed at
puberty. In this case the regular periodical changes began
at birth.
</p><p>Premature Development Occasions Early Decay. &mdash;
A fact which is of too great importance to be allowed to
pass unnoticed, is that whatever occasions early or premature
sexual development, also occasions premature decay.
Females in whom puberty occurs at the age of ten or
twelve, by the time their age is doubled, are shriveled
and wrinkled with age. At the time when they should
be in their prime of health and beauty, they are prematurely
old and broken. Those women who mature late,
retain their beauty and their strength many years after
their precocious sisters have become old, decrepit, and
broken down. Thus, the matrons of thirty and forty
years in colder climates are much more attractive in
appearance than the maidens of sixteen; while quite the
reverse is true in this and other countries where sexual
development is unduly hastened.
</p><p>Early Puberty a Cause for Anxiety. &mdash; The unnaturally
early appearance of puberty is a just cause for
apprehension, since it usually indicates all inherent
weakness of the constitution. When there are reasons for
fearing its occurrence, active measures should be taken
to occasion delay if possible. We call especial attention
to this point, since there are many who erroneously
suppose the early occurrence of puberty to be a sign of
superior vigor.
</p><p>Changes which Occur at Puberty. &mdash; The changes
which occur in the two sexes at this period have been
thus described: &mdash;
</p><p>"In both sexes, hair grows on the skin covering the
<pb n="86"/>
<hi rend="italic">symphysis pubis</hi>, around the sexual organs, and in the
axill&aelig; (armpits). In man, the chest and shoulders
broaden, the larynx enlarges, and the voice becomes
lower in pitch from the elongation of the vocal cords;
hair grows upon the chin, upper lip, and cheeks, and
often exists upon the general surface of the body more
abundantly than in woman." The sexual organs undergo
enlargement, and are more frequently excited. The
testicles first begin the secretion of the seminal fluid.
</p><p>"In woman, the pelvis and abdomen enlarge, but the
whole frame remains more slender, the muscles and
joints less prominent, the limbs more rounded and
tapering [than in the male]. Locally, both external
and internal organs undergo a considerable and rapid
enlargement. The mamm&aelig; enlarge, the ovarian vesicles
become dilated, and there is established a periodical
discharge of one or more ova, accompanied, in most
cases, by a sanguineous fluid from the cavity of the
uterus."
</p><p>These changes, so varied and extraordinary, often
occur within a very short space of time; and as they
are liable to serious derangement, especially in the
female, great care should be taken to secure for the
individual the most favorable conditions until they are
successfully effected. It is, however, a fact deserving
of mention, that many of the ills which are developed at
this particular period are quite as much the result of
previous indiscretions and mismanagements as of any
immediate cause. A few suggestions with regard to the
proper treatment of individuals at this age may be in
place: &mdash;
</p><p>1. Do not allow the boy or girl to be overworked,
<pb n="87"/>
either mentally or physically. Great and important
changes are occurring within the body, and nature should
not be overtaxed.
</p><p>2. Keep the mind occupied. While excessive labor
should be avoided, idleness should be as carefully
shunned. Some light, useful employment or harmless
amusement &mdash; better some kind of work &mdash; should keep
the mind fully occupied with wholesome subjects.
</p><p>3. Abundant exercise out-of-doors is essential for
both sexes. Sunshine and fresh air are as necessary to
the development of a human being as for the expanding
of a flower bud.
</p><p>4. Watch carefully the associations of the youth.
This should be done at all times, but especially just at
the critical period in question, when the general physical
disturbances occurring in the system react upon the
mind, and make it peculiarly susceptible to influences
of every sort, especially those of an evil character.
</p><p>5. None too much care can be exercised at this
important epoch of human life, provided it is properly
applied; but nothing could be more disastrous in its
consequences than a weak solicitude which panders to
every whim and gratifies every perverted appetite.
Such care is a fatal error.
</p><p>Menstruation. &mdash; The functional changes which occur
in the female are much more marked than those of the
male. As already intimated, the periodical development
and discharge of an ovum by the female, which occurs
after puberty, is accompanied by the discharge of a
bloody fluid, which is known as the <hi rend="italic">flowers</hi>, <hi rend="italic">menses</hi>, or
<hi rend="italic">catamenia</hi>. The accompanying symptoms together are
termed the process of menstruation, or being unwell. This
<pb n="88"/>
usually occurs, in the human female, once in about four
weeks. In special cases, the interval may be a week
less or a week longer; or the variation may be even
greater. Dalton describes the process as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"When the expected period is about to come on, the
female is affected by a certain degree of discomfort and
lassitude, a sense of weight in the pelvis, and more or
less disinclination to society. These symptoms are in
some cases slightly pronounced, in others more troublesome.
An unusual discharge of vaginal mucus then
begins to take place, which soon becomes yellowish or
rusty brown in color, from the admixture of a certain
proportion of blood; and by the second or third day, the
discharge has the appearance of nearly pure blood. The
unpleasant sensations which were at first manifest, then
usually subside; and the discharge, after continuing for
a certain period, begins to grow more scanty. Its color
changes from a pure red to a brownish or rusty tinge,
until it finally disappears altogether, and the female
returns to her ordinary condition."
</p><p>The menstrual function continues active from puberty
to about the forty-fifth year, or during the period of
fertility. When it finally disappears, the woman is no
longer capable of bearing children. The time of
disappearance is termed the "change of life," or <hi rend="italic">menopause</hi>.
Exceptional cases occur in which this period is greatly
hastened, arriving as early as the thirty-fifth year, or
even earlier. Instances have also been observed in
which menstruation continued as late as the sixtieth
year, and even later; but such cases are very rare; and
if procreation occurs, the progeny is feeble and senile.
</p><p>With rare exceptions, the function is suspended
<pb n="89"/>
during pregnancy, and usually, also, during the period
of nursing.
</p><p>Nature of Menstruation. &mdash; There has been a great
amount of speculation concerning the cause and nature
of the menstrual process. No entirely satisfactory
conclusions have been reached, however, except that it is
usually accompanied by the maturation and expulsion
from the ovary of an ovum, which is termed <hi rend="italic">ovulation</hi>.
But menstruation may occur without ovulation, and <hi rend="italic">vice
versa</hi>.
</p><p>Menstruation is not peculiar to the human female,
being represented in the higher animals by what is familiarly
termed "the rut." This is not usually a bloody
discharge, however, as in the human female, though
such a discharge has been observed in the monkey.
</p><p>It has been quite satisfactorily settled that the
discharge of the ovum from the ovary generally takes place
about the time of the cessation of the flow. Immediately
after the discharge, the sexual desires of the female
are more intense than at other times. This fact is
particularly manifest in lower animals. The following
remark by Prof. Dalton is especially significant to those
who care to appreciate its bearing: &mdash;
</p><p>"It is a remarkable fact, in this connection, that the
female of these [domestic] animals will allow the
approaches of the male only during and immediately after
the cestrual period [rut]; that is, just when the egg is
recently discharged, and ready for impregnation. At
other times, when sexual intercourse would be necessarily
fruitless, the instinct of the animal leads her to
avoid it; and the concourse of the sexes is accordingly
made to correspond in time with the maturity of the
egg and its aptitude for fecundation."
<pb n="90"/>
</p><p>The amount of fluid lost during the menstrual flow
varies greatly with different individuals. It is estimated
at from three ounces to half a pint. In cases of deranged
function, it may be much greater than this. It is not
all blood, however, a considerable portion being mucus.
It is rather difficult to understand why the discharge of
so considerable a quantity of blood is required. There
is no benefit derived from a very copious discharge, as
some suppose. Facts seem to indicate that in general,
those enjoy the best health who lose but small quantities
of blood in this manner.
</p><p>Some recent observations respecting the nature of
menstruation, have unsettled the old theories respecting
this function, and given rise to much discussion.
The most plausible theory, and one which differs very
materially from the old, is that of L&oelig;wenthal. The
views promulgated by this author are of so much interest
that we take this opportunity of presenting them at
some length in the following translation recently
published in the Detroit <hi rend="italic">Lancet</hi>: &mdash;
</p><p>1. Menstruation recurs periodically. It is marked
by an individual periodicity. Any deviation from the
ordinary rhythm (due to strong psychical influences,
changes of the mode of life, etc.) will, in a short time
after removal of the cause, return to the special normal
periodicity.
</p><p>2. The kind and duration of the flow is different in
different women.
</p><p>3 Anatomical and physiological changes take place
in the mucous membrane of the uterus as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>.) There is a thickening of the mucous membrane,
which commences about ten days before the menstrua-<pb n="91"/>
tion, and is analogous to decidual formation in the
early stages of pregnancy.
</p><p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>.) During the flow, disintegration of the outer
layer of the mucous membrane takes place, which is
completed in ten days.
</p><p>(<hi rend="italic">c</hi>.) The swelling of the mucous membrane at first
takes place especially in the outer layer, and affects the
lymph vessels, which are dilated, and not the blood-vessels; the latter only enlarge at a later period, that is,
just before the flow commences. <hi rend="italic">Congestion does not
cause the thickening of the mucous membrane</hi>.
</p><p>(<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.) The increase in the thickness of the mucous
membrane is confined to the body of the uterus; the
cervix is not involved.
</p><p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>.) The other sexual organs, and the system in
general, are influenced more or less by the menstrual
process. The ovaries (one or the other) increase in
size, due to a ripe Graafian follicle ready to burst.
This does not take place during the time that the membrane
swells, but at the time of the flow of blood.
</p><p>During the menstrual process we have infiltration
and swelling for ten days, then hemorrhage for four to
five days, and finally return to the normal, <hi rend="italic">restitutio ad
integrum</hi>, for four to five days, the whole process
occupying about twenty days. The infiltration and swelling
must, under all circumstances, be looked upon as the
primary impulse, as the flow of blood can only take
place after the former has existed for some time.
</p><p>As the different theories do not explain the many
phenomena of menstruation, especially the two factors, &mdash;
that the congestion and hemorrhage cause the rupture
of a Graafian follicle, or that the latter causes the hemor-<pb n="92"/>
rhage, &mdash; we must conclude that a third factor plays an
important part, and that this third factor is the product
of ovulation, &mdash; the unimpregnated ovule.
</p><p>The whole menstrual process might be considered as
follows: &mdash;
</p><p>1. The Graafian follicle ruptures, and the ovule
passes down into the uterus.
</p><p>2. In the first appropriate fold of the uterine mucous
membrans (generally near the mouth of the tube), the
ovule is imbedded, and causes by its presence a swelling
of the mucous membrane; that is, the menstrual decidua.
</p><p>3. If the ovule becomes impregnated, the menstrual
decidua is developed into the true decidua of pregnancy.
</p><p>4. If in a certain time, which represents its vitality,
the ovule is not impregnated, it dies, and thus causes
congestion and disintegration of the menstrual decidua;
that is, the menstrual flow.
</p><p>5. The congestion reacts on the cause of its origin, the
ovaries, and brings about a rupture of a follicle, which, in
the meantime, has ripened. (This does not exclude any
other cause which might bring about menstrual congestion,
as a cause of a ruptured follicle.)
</p><p>This view not only explains all contradiction, but
also solves many doubtful questions in a satisfactory
manner.
</p><p>The basis of this view is: &mdash;
</p><p>1. That the unimpregnated ovule becomes imbedded.
</p><p>2. That after this imbedding, and only then, it has a
certain limited individual life power.
</p><p>Many objections might be urged against this theory.
Some authorities claim that impregnation always takes
<pb n="93"/>
place at the ovary, and that extra-uterine pregnancy
tends to prove this; but as extra-uterine pregnancy
occurs once in ten thousand cases, the chances are ten
thousand times greater that impregnation does take place
in the uterus. Gerbe-Coste have claimed that the ovule
of a rabbit is covered with an albuminous layer as soon
as it leaves the Fallopian tubes, and that this layer
prevents the passage through it of spermatozoa;
consequently, impregnation can take place only in the tubes.
This layer may disappear later, however, as we know
that nature, instead of preventing impregnation by such
means, always furnishes aids to facilitate it. Nor can
we assume that a human being can be compared to the
lower animals; but that a fundamental difference exists.
</p><p>The lower animals have one or two rutting seasons a
year, and their power to multiply is limited to this time.
The human species is always ready to impregnate or
become impregnated. The rutting season of animals depends
on the duration of pregnancy in every species,
and is always at such a time that the birth of the young
takes place when there is an abundance of food. With
man this is not necessary. He is independent of seasons.
Male and female animals are in heat at the same time,
the ovule and the spermatozoa are supplied at the same
time; no social obstacles exist; the female, ready for
impregnation, is impregnated at the time. In the human
species, man certainly has no period of heat, and the
ripe ovule is not brought immediately in contact with
spermatozoa; if the power to propagate the species is
not to be reduced to a minimum, it is necessary that one
or the other components of reproduction must have a
longer life power, so that impregnation can take place at
any time.
<pb n="94"/>
</p><p>The female element has the undoubted advantage as
it furnishes the egg, the material to build up an embryo;
while the semen is only a secondary factor, which merely
starts the development of the ovule. Everything tends
to prove that the ovule which is not immediately
impregnated, must have an equal, if not a longer life power
than the semen which is deposited in the genital parts.
The two components of the future embryo not being
present at the same time, and impregnation being possible
at all times, it follows that <hi rend="italic">one must wait for the other</hi>.
The ovule being the larger, and placed in a soil which it
needs for its future growth, is therefore probably the
component part which waits for the other, as the spermatozoa
are soon destroyed when removed from the
spermatic canal. If the ovule has to wait for the
spermatozoa, it can only do so in the uterus, as it is forced
there, not having power to move of its own accord,
whether impregnated before reaching the uterus or not.
</p><p>The following conditions are necessary for the
embedding of the ovule and the next menstrual process: &mdash;
</p><p>1. The ovule must be perfectly ripe.
</p><p>2. It must pass from the follicle at a time when it
has the best chance to soon reach the uterus through the
Fallopian tubes during menstruation.
</p><p>3. The place of imbedding must be ready, and prepared
to form the menstrual decidua.
</p><p>If these conditions are not present, the next
menstruation will be abnormal. To this category belongs
amenorrh&oelig;a.
</p><p>1. No ripe ovule is developed, or it is of diminished
vitality, and consequently is not imbedded; or if imbedded,
after a few hours or days it dies, and a real men-<pb n="95"/>
strual decidua has not been developed; consequently no
hemorrhage takes place. If during the short time the
ovule is in the uterus, spermatozoa should enter,
pregnancy might take place, which explains those rare cases
of pregnancy occurring during amenorrh&oelig;a. During
lactation, the absence of or weak ovules would explain
the absence of menstruation, and the occasional occurrence
of pregnancy at this time.
</p><p>2. If during menstruation, from some cause no ripe
ovule is present, none can be imbedded, no menstrual
decidua is formed, and the next menstrual does not appear.
The menstrual congestion which aids the development
of the Graafian follicle and ripening of the ovule
being absent, the ovules are weak, do not become
imbedded, or if they do, die in a short time. The
amenorrh&oelig;a continues until a strong, healthy ovule is again
imbedded, and then dies, causing the menstruation.
This also explains why pregnancy can occur after long-continued amenorrh&oelig;a.
</p><p>3. If the healthy ovule is formed, and passes into
the uterus, the latter does not allow its imbedding, on
account of severe endometritis, profuse secretion, etc.
The physiological amenorrh&oelig;a during pregnancy can be
readily explained in the same manner, the uterus is
occupied; and if during persistent development of ovules,
one should be really imbedded, and become impregnated,
we would have a case of twin pregnancy, where one
fetus is fully developed and the other imperfectly; or a
case where one child is born a few weeks or months
after the other. In some women, also, there is no tendency
to hemorrhage; they have ovulation, but no real
menstruation; they have, instead, a recurring leucorrh&oelig;a,
so-called "white menstruation."
<pb n="96"/>
</p><p>Cases occur where two or more causes are present to
prevent imbedding of an ovule, and to cause amenorrh&oelig;a.
</p><p>Anomalies of menstruation, such as profuse and
irregularly recurring hemorrhages, can be readily
explained, as they have no connection with menstruation
at all, in fact, often occurring during amenorrh&oelig;a, and
are due to other diseases (tumors, ulcers, displacements,
etc.).
</p><p>The following points also go to prove the correctness
of the view that the ovule becomes imbedded, etc.: &mdash;
</p><p>Many observers have recorded that young girls,
some four weeks before the first appearance of menstruation,
have all the nervous symptoms which are found
later with every recurring menstruation. A ripe follicle
has burst, the ovule becomes imbedded, and in four
weeks causes the first menstruation.
</p><p>Immediately after childbirth, ovulation and imbedding
may take place, as is proven by the occurrence of
pregnancy a few weeks after childbirth, and before the
recurrence of menstruation. The irregularity of menstruation
before the climacteric period, only proves the
theory, as the ovule does not have the same extrafollicular
vital power, and the thickening of the albuginea
often prevents rupture of a Graafian follicle.
</p><p>The experiments of Lawson Tait have caused him to
conclude that the anticipated climacteric period always
occurs with certainty when <hi rend="italic">both tubes are removed</hi>. This
goes to prove the correctness of the L&oelig;wenthal theory,
as no ovule can get into the uterus, even if a third ovary
exist, or some ovarian stroma remains behind, and
consequently menstruation cannot occur.
</p><p>The well-founded fact that impregation is most liable
<pb n="97"/>
to occur immediately after menstruation, also tends to
prove the correctness of the theory, as the further
removed from menstruation, the less vital power is
possessed by the ovule, and pregnancy is not so liable to
occur.
</p><p>The theory of L&oelig;wenthal leads him to conclude that
menstruation is not physiological, but pathological, and
not necessary to health; that menstrual blood is normal
blood, and does not contain any poisonous substance
that must be eliminated from the system; that in
amenorrh&oelig;a, emmenagogues are useless or harmful, as some
constitutional disease (chlorosis, hysteria, etc.) causes
amenorrh&oelig;a; but the latter causes no disease itself.
Amenorrh&oelig;a simply indicates some disease of the system,
and should be looked upon as a powerful <hi rend="italic">aid</hi> to re-invigorate the body, not be <hi rend="italic">fought as a foe</hi>. A woman
is not healthy because she menstruates, but in spite of
it. He does not want to stop all women from menstruating,
but simply suggests a reform in the treatment of
the disorders of menstruation. He reports cases of
chronic invalids with pain and nervous disturbances
after menstruation, which had been subjected to all
kinds of treatment without benefit, until he lessened
menstruation by quiet and hot water injections, with
wonderful result. The cases all recovered, although he
checked menstruation so much that only two drachms of
blood were lost.
</p><p>The object is to diminish the hemorrhage as much as
possible; it cannot be entirely stopped, as the decay of
the menstrual decidua will always cause some bleeding,
but this should be limited to a discharge of bloody
<pb n="98"/>
</p><p>The above quotation embodies views which are
certainly of great interest from a variety of standpoints,
and it is to be hoped that they may be confirmed by
further observations.
</p><p>Extra-Uterine Pregnancy. &mdash; Sometimes the ovum
becomes fecundated before reaching the uterus, and
instead of passing onward into that organ as usual,
remains in its position in the Fallopian tube or even on
the surface of the ovary. Occasionally an ovum falls
into the cavity of the abdomen instead of passing into
the tube. Even in this situation it may be fecundated.
Impregnated ova thus left in abnormal positions,
undergo a greater or less degree of development. They
commonly result in the death of the mother.
</p><p>Twins. &mdash; The human female usually matures but one
ovum at each menstrual period, the two ovaries acting
alternately. Occasionally two ova are matured at once.
If fecundation occurs, the result will be a development
of two embryos at the same time. In rare cases, three
or even four ova are matured at once, and by fecundation,
produce a corresponding number of embryos.
As many as five children have been born alive at one
birth, but have not lived more than a few minutes.
</p><p>The occurrence of multiple pregnancies may be
explained by the supposition that ova matured subsequent
to the first fecundation are also fecundated.
</p><p>In lower animals, the uterus is often divided into
two long segments, which afford room for the development
of a number of young at once. Some ancient
writers make most absurd statements with regard to the
fecundity of women. One declares that the simultaneous
birth of seven or eight infants by the same mother
<pb n="99"/>
was an ordinary occurrence with Egyptian women!
Other statements still more extravagant are made by
writers. For example: A traveler in the seventeenth
century wrote that he saw, in the year 1630, in a church
near the Hague, a tablet on which was an inscription
stating that a certain noted countess gave birth at
once, in the year 1276, to 365 infants, who were all
baptized and christened, the males being all called John,
and the females, Elizabeth. They all died on the day
of their birth, with their mother, according to the
account, and were buried in the church, where the tablet
was erected to their memory.
</p><p>Superfetation. &mdash; It occasionally happens that a child
is born of the same mother a few weeks or a few months
subsequent to the previous childbirth, but not
sufficiently long afterward to make it possible to consider
the second child the result of a second period of
gestation. These curious cases are accounted for by the
supposition that superfetation may occasionally occur, that
is, the second ovule may pass down into the womb, and
become impregnated, some time after the development of
the first has begun. This certainly must be a very
unusual circumstance, but that it has occurred, is attested
by testimony which cannot be doubted. In one case,
reported by Dr. Janeway, surgeon in the late war, one
of two infants born of a mulatto mother under these
peculiar circumstances was a negro, while the other was
nearly white, &mdash; a fact which offered the most indisputable
evidence, not only of the distinct paternity of the
two infants as to time, but also as to individuals.
</p><p>Monsters. &mdash; Defects and abnormalities in the development
of the embryo produce all degrees of deviation
<pb n="100"/>
from the typical human form. Excessive development
may result in an extra finger or toe, or in the
production of some peculiar excrescence. Deficiency of
development may produce all degrees of abnormality
from the simple hare-lip to the most frightful deficiency,
as the absence of a limb, or even of a head. It is in
this manner that those unfortunate individuals known
as hermaphrodites are formed. An excessive development
of some parts of the female generative organs
gives them a great degree of similarity to the external
organs of the male. A deficient development of the
masculine organs renders them similar in appearance to
those of the female. Excessive development, shown in a
peculiar manner, produces both kinds of organs in the
same individuals in a state more or less complete.
</p><p>Such curious cases as the Carolina twins and Chang
and Eng were formerly supposed to be the result of the
union of two separate individuals. It is now believed
that they are developed from a single ovum. It has
been observed that the primitive trace (described in a
previous section) sometimes undergoes partial division
longitudinally. If it splits a little at the anterior end,
the individual will have a single body with two heads.
If a partial division occurs at each end, the resulting
being will possess two heads and two pair of legs
joined to a single body. More complete division
produces a single trunk with two heads, two pair of arms
and two pairs of legs, as in the case of the Carolina
twins. Still more complete division many result in the
formation of two perfect individuals almost entirely
independent of each other, physiologically, but united by
a narrow band, as in the remarkable Siamese twins, Chang
and Eng.
<pb n="101"/>
</p><p>Strange Freaks of Development. &mdash; In a curious case
reported not a great while ago, a partially developed
infant was amputated from the cheek of a child some time
after birth.
</p><p>A few cases have been reported in which partially
developed human beings have been found in various
parts of the bodies of individuals, which were not
produced by any reproductive process, as they have been
found in individuals of both sexes. These remarkable
cases are undoubtedly the result of the inclosure of one
embryo within another.
</p><p>The precise cause of these strange modifications of
development is as yet, in a great degree, a mystery.
</p><p>Hybrids. &mdash; It is a well-known law of biology that no
progeny result from union of animals of different species.
Different varieties or races of the same species may form
a fertile union, the result of which is a cross between its
two parents, possessing some of the qualities of each.
Such a cross is called a <hi rend="italic">mongrel</hi>. All the varieties of
dogs are produced by crossing different races, and so are
mongrels. The various mixed races of men, such as
mulattoes and half-breeds, are also mongrels. The mule is
the product of a union between the horse and the ass, and
is a true hybrid. The offspring of hybrids are sterile,
almost without exception; for the reason that they do
not produce mature elements of generation. In the
mule, the zoosperms are either entirely absent, or else
very imperfectly developed; hence the fact that a colt
having a mule for its sire is one of the rarest of curiosities,
though a few instances have been reported. This
is a wise law of nature to preserve the purity of species.
</p><p>Law of Sex. &mdash; If there is a law by which the sex of
<pb n="102"/>
the developing embryo is determined, it probably has
not yet been discovered. The influence of the will, the
predominant vitality of one or the other of the parents,
and the period at which conception occurs, have all been
supposed to be the determining cause. A German
physician some time since advanced the theory that the two
testicles and ovaries produce elements of different sexual
character, the right testicle forming zoosperms capable
of producing only males, and the right ovary producing
ova with the same peculiarity. The left testicle and the
left ovary he supposed to form the female elements. He
claimed to have proved his theory by experiments upon
animals. Even if true, this theory will not be made of
practical importance. It is, in fact, nothing more than
a revival of an old theory held by physicians who flourished
more than two thousand years ago.
</p><p>Controlling Sex. &mdash; More recently another German
physician has advanced the theory that the sex may be
controlled at will by observing the time of fecundation.
He asserts that when fecundation occurs shortly after
menstruation, the result will be a female; but if
impregnation occurs later in the month, and prior to the three
or four days preceding the next menstrual period, a
male will almost certainly be produced. This theory
was proposed by Prof. Thury of the academy of Geneva,
who claims to have thoroughly tested it in a great variety
of ways, and always with an affirmative result. Dr.
Heitzman, of New York, an instructor in pathological
histology, and an eminent physiologist, informs us that
he has thoroughly tested this theory, and finds it entirely
reliable. There are numerous facts which seem to
corroborate its truth, and future investigations may give
to it the dignity of an established physiological fact.
<pb n="103"/>
</p><p>Floss, an eminent European author, claims to show
by a comparison of the statistics of male and female
births in various countries, that sex depends largely upon
the food supply, females being relatively most numerous
when food is abundant, while males predominate during
periods of scarcity of food. Some curious experiments
were made a few years ago by a learned entomologist, in
the feeding of the larva of insects, which seemed to
indicate that those larva which received the most food,
developed into females; while those which had the least
food, developed into males. Facts well known to bee-keepers also indicate that an extra supply of food and
better opportunities for development, is possibly the
principal cause which gives origin to sexually perfect
bees from larva which would otherwise produce ordinary
workers.
</p><p>The facts just given would seem to support the
theory of Floss, but the equally eminent Dr. Preussen
maintains that males, and not females, are the result of
a better food supply to the mother.
</p><p>There is good ground for the theory that the relative
ages of the parents has much to do with influencing the
sex of the offspring; for example, statistics collected in
Germany show that when the mother is older than the
father, the number of female births is considerably in
excess. This is equally true when the father and
mother are of the same age. When the father's age is
in excess of that of the mother, the male births are in
excess of the females, the proportion of cases increasing
with the predominance of the father's age above that of
the mother. This would seem to agree perfectly with
the well-known fact that male births are usually slightly
<pb n="104"/>
in excess of the female. This theory would be the
natural result of the prevailing custom in society by which
the age of the husband usually exceeds that of the wife.
</p><p>Heredity. &mdash; The phenomena of heredity are among
the most interesting of biological studies. It is a matter
of common observation that a child looks like its
parents. It even happens that a child resembles an
uncle or a grandparent more nearly than either parent.
The same peculiarities are often seen in animals.
</p><p>The cause of this resemblance of offspring to parents
and ancestors has been made a subject of careful study
by scientific men. We shall present the most recent
theory suggested, which, although it be but a theory,
presents such an array of facts in its support, and
explains the phenomena in question so admirably, that it
must be regarded as something more than a plausible
hypothesis. It is the conception of one of the most
distinguished scientists of the age. The theory is known
as the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">pangenesis</hi>, and is essentially as
follows: &mdash;
</p><p>Pangenesis. &mdash; It is a fact well known to physiologists
that every part of the living body is made up of cellular
elements which have the power to reproduce themselves
in the individual, thus repairing the damage resulting
from waste and injury. Each cell produces cells like
itself. It is further known that there are found in the
body numerous central points of growth. In every
group of cells is found a central cell from which the
others originate, and which determines the form of their
growth. Every minute structure possesses such a center.
A simple proof of this fact is found in the experiment
in which the spur of a cock was grafted upon the
<pb n="105"/>
ear of an ox. It lived in this novel situation eight
years, attaining the length of nine inches, and nearly a
pound in weight. A tooth has been made to grow upon
the comb of a cock in a similar manner. The tail of a
pig survived the operation of transplanting from its
proper position to the back of the animal, and retained
its sensibility. Numerous other similar illustrations
might be given.
</p><p>Gemmules. &mdash; The doctrine of pangenesis supposes
that these centers of nutrition form and throw off not
only cells like themselves, but very minute granules,
called <hi rend="italic">gemmules</hi>, each of which is capable, under suitable
circumstances, of developing into a cell like its parent.
</p><p>These minute granules are scattered through the
system in great numbers. The essential organs of
generation, the testicles in the male and the ovaries in the
female, perform the task of collecting these gemmules,
and forming them into sets, each of which constitutes a
reproductive element, and contains, in rudimentary form,
a representative of every part of the individual, including
the most minute peculiarities. Even more than this:
it is supposed that each ovum and each zoosperm
contains not only the gemmules necessary to reproduce the
individuals who produced them, but also a number of
gemmules which have been transmitted from the individual's
ancestors.
</p><p>If this theory be true, &mdash; and we can see no sound
objection to it, &mdash; it is easy to understand all the problems
of heredity. The gemmules must be very small indeed,
but it may be suggested that the moleculos{sic} of matter
are smaller still, so this fact is no objection to the theory.
</p><p>It will be seen, then, that each spermatozoon, or
<pb n="106"/>
zoosperm, actually contains, in an embryonic condition,
every organ and tissue of the individual producing it.
The same is true of the ovum. In other words, the
reproductive elements are complete representatives, in
miniature, of the parents, and contain all the elements
for producing an offspring possessing the same peculiarities
as the parents. Various modifying circumstances
sufficiently explain the dissimilarities between parents
and children.
</p><p>This theory is strikingly confirmed by the fact,
previously mentioned, that in certain cases the ovum alone, a
single reproductive element, may undergo a degree of
development approaching very near completion. It is
supposed that fecundation is chiefly necessary to give
to the gemmules the requisite amount of nourishment to
insure development.
</p><p>As we shall see hereafter, this matter has a very
important bearing upon several practical questions.
</p><p>Circumcision. &mdash; The fold of integument called the
<hi rend="italic">prepuce</hi>, which has been previously described, has upon
its inner surface a large number of glands which produce
a peculiar secretion. Under certain circumstances, and
from inattention to personal cleanliness, this secretion
may accumulate, and then often becomes the cause of
irritation and serious disease. To prevent such disorders,
and to insure cleanliness, the Jewish law required the
removal of the prepuce, which constituted the rite
of circumcision. The same practice is followed by
several modern nations dwelling in tropical climates; and
it can scarcely be doubted that it is a very salutary
one, and has contributed very materially to the maintenance
of that proverbial national health for which the
<pb n="107"/>
Jews are celebrated. Eminent physicians have
expressed the opinion that the practice would be a
salutary one for all men.
</p><p>It is doubtful, however, whether as much harm as
good does not result from circumcision, since it has been
shown by extensive observation among the Jews that
very great contraction of the meatus, or external orifice
of the urethra, is exceedingly common among them, being
undoubtedly the result of the prolonged irritation and
subsequent cicatricial contraction resulting from circumcision
in infancy.
</p><p>The maintenance of scrupulous cleanliness, by daily
cleansing, is an imperative duty.
</p><p>In some countries, females are also circumcised by
removal of the nymph&aelig;. The object is the same as
that of circumcision in the male. The same evils result
from inattention to local cleanliness, and the same measure
of prevention, daily cleansing, is necessitated
by a similar secretion. Local cleanliness is neglected
by both sexes. Daily washing should begin with infancy,
and continue through life, and will prevent much
disease.
</p><p>Castration. &mdash; This operation consists in the removal
of the testes of the male. It does not at once obliterate
the sexual sense, especially if performed after puberty,
but of course renders the individual impotent, or incapable
of reproduction. Persons upon whom it has been
performed are called eunuchs. It was a very common
custom in ancient times, being usually prompted by
the jealousy of rulers, who allowed no males but
eunuchs to associate with their wives and concubines.
The effect upon the male is to render him effeminate in
<pb n="108"/>
appearance and weak in mind. If performed before
puberty, the growth of the beard is scanty, and the
voice never acquires that deepness of tone natural to the
masculine voice.
</p><p>Spaying. &mdash; An analogous operation, termed <hi rend="italic">spaying</hi>,
is performed upon females, consisting in the removal of
the ovaries; effects similar to those in the male, <hi rend="italic">sterility</hi>
without entire immediate loss of sexual sense, being the
usual result. Spaying is much more frequently
performed than castration, and is now employed as a
means of relieving certain forms of intractable disease of
the womb and ovaries. The credit of first employing
this operation in cases of this kind is due to Dr. Battey,
of Georgia. Castration is still practiced in some Eastern
countries.</p>

<head>Sexual Hygiene.</head>
<p>
JUST in proportion as the perpetuation of the race
is more important than the existence of any single
individual, the organs of reproduction may in a
certain sense be said to rank higher than any
other portions of the human frame, since to them is
intrusted the important duty of performing that most
marvelous of all vital processes, the production of human
beings. That this high rank in the vital economy is
recognized by nature, is shown by the fact that she has
attached to the abuse of the generative function the
most terrible penalties which can be inflicted upon a
living being. The power of abuse seems to be almost
exclusively confined to man; hence, we find him about
the only one of all living creatures subject to the awful
penalties of sexual transgression.
</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">use</hi> of the reproductive function is perhaps the
highest purely physical act of which man is capable; its
<hi rend="italic">abuse</hi> is certainly one of the most grievous outrages
against nature which it is possible for him to perpetrate.
No observing person can doubt that the sexual relations
of men and women determine in a great degree their
happiness or misery in life. This subject, then, deserves
due attention and careful consideration. It is of no use
to scout it; for it will inevitably obtrude itself upon us.
no matter how sedulously we attempt to avoid it. It

<pb n="110"/>
can be rightly considered only with the most perfect
candor, with the mind unbiased by passion, and prayerfully
anxious to know and <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what is right.
</p><p>In the following paragraphs of this section are
considered some of the evils out of which grows much of
the sexual suffering of men and women: &mdash;
</p><p>Sexual Precocity. &mdash; There are two periods in human
life when the sexual instincts should be totally dormant;
and they are so when nature is not perverted. The
first is the period reaching from infancy to puberty.
The second is the period reached in advanced age.
</p><p>If raised strictly in accordance with natural law,
children would have no sexual notions or feelings before
the occurrence of puberty. No prurient speculation
about sexual matters would enter their minds. Until
that period, the reproductive system should lie dormant
in its undeveloped state. No other feeling should be
exhibited between the sexes than that brotherly and
sisterly affection which is so admirable and becoming.
</p><p>Fortunate, indeed, would it be for humanity if this
natural state always existed; but it is a lamentable fact
that it is rarely seen in modern homes. Not infrequently,
evidences of sexual passion are manifested
before the child has hardly learned to walk. It has
been suggested that this precocity is nothing remarkable
or unnatural, since it is often seen in little lambs and
other young animals. To this it is only necessary to
reply that the development of the sexual instincts
perfectly corresponds with the longevity of the animal; if
short-lived, like the sheep, only a short period intervenes
between birth and the attainment of the sexual appetite
and virility. If the animal is intended for long life, as
<pb n="111"/>
is the case with man, these manifestations are delayed
until a much later period, or should be. Certain insects
perform the sexual act as soon as they acquire their
perfect form; but they perish as soon as the act is completed.
</p><p>Astonishing Ignorance. &mdash; It is astonishing how
ignorant and indifferent the majority of people are upon
this subject. A friend related to us an incident which
fairly illustrates the terrible apathy which prevails
among parents. While teaching a country school, he
learned that a large number of children, boys and girls,
of ages varying from eight to twelve and fourteen years,
were in the habit of collecting together in barns and other
secluded places, and in a state of nudity imitating the
"Black Crook," with all possible additional nastiness.
Horrified at such a monstrous evil, he hastened to inform
the parents of the corruption in their midst. Imagine
his astonishment when he was met with an indifferent
laugh, and the response, "Pooh! it's only natural;
perfectly harmless; <hi rend="italic">just like little pigs!</hi>" &mdash; as though pigs
were models for human beings!
</p><p>It is not pleasant to consider what must have been
the moral status of parents who could hold such views;
and it is no wonder that they should produce such
children. Doubtless they learned too late, that those
"natural" manifestations were the outgrowth of incipient
vices, planted and fostered by themselves, which in
later years destroyed shame, and gave loose rein to lust.
</p><p>Premature Passion. &mdash; Often the manifestation of sexual
precocity is less gross, but almost equally fraught
with danger, nevertheless. Dr. Acton, a distinguished
English surgeon, whom we shall frequently quote, makes
the following excellent remarks upon this subject: &mdash;
<pb n="112"/>
</p><p>"Slight signs are sufficient to indicate when a boy
has this unfortunate tendency. He shows marked
preferences. You will see him single out one girl, and
evidently derive an unusual pleasure (for a boy) in
her society. His penchant does not take the ordinary
form of a boy's good nature, but little attentions that
are generally reserved for a later period prove that
his feeling is different, and sadly premature. He may
be apparently healthy, and fond of playing with other
boys; still there are slight, but ominous indications of
propensities fraught with danger to himself. His play
with the girl is different from his play with his brothers.
His kindness to her is a little too ardent. He follows
her, he does not know why. He fondles her with a
tenderness painfully suggestive of a vague dawning of
passion. No one can find fault with him. He does
nothing wrong. Parents and friends are delighted at
his gentleness and politeness, and not a little amused at
the early flirtation. If they were wise, they would
rather feel profound anxiety; and he would be an
unfaithful or unwise medical friend who did not, if an
opportunity occurred, warn them that such a boy,
unsuspicious and innocent as he is, ought to be carefully
watched and removed from every influence calculated to
foster his abnormal propensities.
</p><p>"The premature development of the sexual inclination
is not alone repugnant to all we associate with the
term childhood, but is also fraught with danger to dawning
manhood. On the judicious treatment of a case such
as has been sketched, it probably depends whether the
dangerous propensity shall be so kept in check as to
preserve the boy's health and innocence, or whether one
<pb n="113"/>
more shattered constitution and wounded conscience
shall be added to the victims of sexual precocity and
careless training. It ought not to be forgotten that in
such cases a quasi-sexual power often accompanies these
premature sexual inclinations. Few, perhaps, except
medical men, know how early in life a mere infant may
experience erections. Frequently it may be noticed
that a little child, on being taken out of bed in the
morning, cannot make water at once. It would be well
if it were recognized by parents and nurses that this
often depends upon a more or less complete erection."
</p><p>We have been not more disgusted than shocked to
see parents, whose intelligence ought to teach them
better, not only winking at, but actually encouraging,
these premature manifestations of passion in their
children. They may yet learn, by bitter experience, the
folly of their course, unless they make the discovery in
time to avert the calamitous results which threaten the
future of their children, by careful reformatory training.
</p><p>Inherited Passion. &mdash; It is important to inquire into
the cause of this precocity. Said a father of our acquaintance,
when remonstrated with for encouraging his infant
son in a ridiculous flirtation, "I did just so when I was
of his age." In this case the cause was evident. The
child was only acting out the disposition bequeathed him
by his parent. How often do the secret follies of parents
stand out in bold relief in their children. Such a legacy
is nothing to be proud of.
</p><p>We again quote from Dr. Acton some observations
on the causes of this disorder, &mdash; for a grave disorder it
is, &mdash; as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"I should specify <hi rend="italic">hereditary</hi> predisposition as by no
<pb n="114"/>
means the least common. . . . I believe that, as in
body and mind, so also in the passions, the sins of the
father are frequently visited on the children. No man
or woman, I am sure, can have habitually indulged the
sexual passions . . . without, at least, running the
risk of finding that a disposition to follow a similar
career has been inherited by the offspring. It is in this
way only that we can explain the early and apparently
almost irresistible propensity in generation after
generation to indulge similar habits and feelings."
</p><p>Various Causes of Sexual Precocity. &mdash; Another very
powerful predisposing cause of sexual precocity will be
alluded to under the head of "Marital Excesses." The
irritation caused by worms in the rectum, by local
irritation or uncleanliness, or by irritation of the bladder,
are exciting causes which are not infrequent. The latter
cause is indicated by another symptom; the frequent
wetting of the bed at night. Such a symptom doubly
demands immediate attention.
</p><p>The juvenile parties so common now-a-days, where
little ones of both sexes, of ages varying from four or
five years to ten or twelve, with wonderful precocity
and truthfulness, imitate the conduct of their elders at
fashionable dinners, cannot be too much deprecated.
Such associations of the sexes have a strong tendency
to develop prematurely the distinctive peculiarities of
the sexes. This is well evidenced by the fact that on
such occasions one of the most common and popular
entertainments is sham marriages. Parents greatly err
in encouraging or allowing their children to engage in
amusements of so dangerous a character. They are
productive of no good, and are almost without exception
productive of positive and serious injury.
<pb n="115"/>
</p><p>Modern modes of life, improper clothing, the forcing
system of cramming in schools, the immodest example
of older persons, and especially the irritating, stimulating
articles of diet which are daily set before children, as
well as older people, undoubtedly have a powerful
influence in stimulating the development of the sexual
passions. This subject is again referred to under the
heading, "Chastity."
</p><p>Obscene books and papers, lewd pictures, and evil
communications are telling causes which will be further
noticed elsewhere.
</p><p>Senile Sensuality. &mdash; As with childhood, old age is a
period in which the reproductive functions are quiescent,
unless unnaturally stimulated. Sexual life begins with
puberty, and, in the female, ends at about the age of
forty-five years, at the period known as the <hi rend="italic">menopause</hi>,
or <hi rend="italic">turn of life</hi>. At this period, according to the plainest
indications of nature, all functional activity should cease.
If this law is disregarded, disease, premature decay,
possibly local degenerations, will be sure to result.
Nature cannot be abused with impunity.
</p><p>The generative power of the male is retained somewhat
longer than that of the female, and by stimulation
may be indulged at quite an advanced age, but only at
the expense of shortening life, and running the risk of
sudden death. Says Parise, "One of the most important
pieces of information which a man in years can attain, is
`to learn to become old betimes,' if he wishes to attain
old age. Cicero, we are told, was asked if he still
indulged in the pleasures of love. `Heaven forbid!'
replied he, `I have forsworn it as I would a savage and a
furious master.' "
<pb n="116"/>
</p><p>Some learned physicians place the proper limit of
man's functional activity at fifty years, if he would not
render himself guilty of shortening his days by sensuality.
Other reasons for this course will appear hereafter.
</p><p>Satyriasis. &mdash; When the passions have been indulged,
and their diminishing vigor stimulated, a horrid disease,
<hi rend="italic">satyriasis</hi>, not infrequently seizes upon the imprudent
individual, and drives him to the perpetration of the
most loathsome crimes and excesses. Passions cultivated
and encouraged by gratification through life, will thus
sometimes assert a total supremacy in old age.</p>

<head>MARRIAGE.</head>

<p>The scope and plan of this work will allow of but the
briefest possible consideration of this subject, upon
which volumes have been written, and much to no purpose
other than the multiplication of books. We shall devote
no space to a consideration of the origin of the institution,
its expediency, or varied relations, as these topics
are foreign to the character of this work.
</p><p>The primary object of marriage was, undoubtedly,
the preservation of the race, though there are other
objects which, under special circumstances, may become
paramount even to this. These latter we cannot consider,
as only the physical relations of marriage come
properly within our province.
</p><p>The first physiological question to be considered is
concerning the proper age for marriage.
</p><p>Time to Marry. &mdash; Physiology fixes with accuracy the
earliest period at which marriage is admissible. This
period is that at which the body attains complete
development, which is not before twenty in the female,
and twenty-four in the male. Even though the growth
maybe completed before these ages, ossification of the
bones is not fully effected, so that development is
incomplete.
</p><p>Among most modern nations, the civil laws fixing
the earliest date of marriage seem to have been made
without any reference to physiology, or with the
mistaken notion that puberty and nubility are identical.
It is interesting to note the different ages established
by different nations for the entrance of the married state.
<pb n="118"/>
The degenerating Romans fixed the ages of legal marriage
at thirteen for females, and fifteen for males.
The Grecian legislator, Lycurgus, placed the ages at
seventeen for the female, and thirty-seven for the male.
Plato fixed the ages at twenty and thirty years. In
Prussia, the respective ages are fifteen and nineteen
in Austria, sixteen and twenty; in France, sixteen
and eighteen, respectively.
</p><p>Says Mayer, "In general, it may be established
that the normal epoch for marriage is the twentieth
year for women, and the twenty-fourth for men."
</p><p>Application of the Law of Heredity. &mdash; A moment's
consideration of the physiology of heredity will disclose
a sufficient reason why marriage should be deferred until
the development of the body is wholly complete.
The matrimonial relation implies reproduction.
Reproduction is effected through the union of the ovum
with the zoosperm. These elements, as we have
already seen, are complete representatives of the
individuals producing them, being composed &mdash; as supposed
 &mdash; of minute gemmules, which are destined to be
developed into cells and organs in the new being, each
preserving its resemblance to the cell within the parent
which produced it. The perfection of the new being,
then, must be largely dependent on the integrity and
perfection of the sexual elements. If the body is still
incomplete, the reproductive elements must also be
incomplete, and, in consequence, the progeny must be
equally immature.
</p><p>Early Marriage. &mdash; The preceding paragraph
contains a sufficient reason for condemning early marriage;
that is, marriage before the ages mentioned. It is prob-<pb n="119"/>
able that even the ages of twenty and twenty-four are
too early for those persons whose development is
uncommonly slow. But there are other cogent reasons for
discountenancing early marriages, also drawn from the
physiology of reproduction, to say nothing of the many
reasons which might be urged on other grounds.
</p><p>1. During the development of the body, all its
energies are required in perfecting the various tissues and
organs. There is no material to be spared for any
foreign purpose.
</p><p>2. The reproductive act is the most exhaustive of all
vital acts. Its effect upon an undeveloped person is to
retard growth, weaken the constitution, and dwarf the
intellect.
</p><p>3. The effects upon the female are even worse than
those upon the male; for, in addition to the exhaustion
of nervous energy, she is compelled to endure the burdens
and pains of child-bearing when utterly unprepared
for such a task, to say nothing of her unfitness for the
other duties of a mother. With so many girl-mothers in
the land, is it any wonder that there are so many
thousands of unfortunate individuals who never seem to get
beyond childhood in their development? Many a man
at forty years is as childish in mind, and as immature in
judgment, as a well-developed lad of eighteen should be.
They are like withered fruit plucked before it was ripe;
they can never become like the mellow and luscious
fruit allowed to mature properly. They are unalterably
molded; and the saddest fact of all is that they will
give to their children the same imperfections; and the
children will transmit them to another generation, and
so the evil will go on increasing, unless checked by
extinction of the line.
<pb n="120"/>
</p><p>Mutual Adaptation. &mdash; Another question of very great
importance is that of the mutual adaptation of
individuals. To this question we can devote but a very
brief consideration, and that will be more of the nature
of criticism than of a set of formal rules for governing
matrimonial alliances.
</p><p>A Dangerous Doctrine. &mdash; A writer of some note,
whose work on this and kindred subjects has had quite
an extensive circulation, advocates with great emphasis
the theory that parties contemplating marriage should
in all cases select for partners, individuals as nearly like
themselves as possible. Exact duplicates would, in his
opinion, make the most perfect union attainable. To
make his theory practicable, he is obliged to fall back
upon phrenology; and directs that a man seeking a wife,
or a woman seeking a husband, should obtain a phrenological
chart of his head, and then send it around until a
counterpart is found. If the circle of one's acquaintance
is so fortunate as to contain no one cursed with the
same propensities or idiosyncrasies as himself, the
newspapers are to be brought into requisition as a medium of
advertising.
</p><p>If so strange a doctrine as this were advocated by an
obscure individual in some secluded hamlet, or found
only in the musty volumes of some forgotten author, it
surely would be unworthy of notice; but coming as it
does from a quite popular writer, and being coupled
with a great amount of really valuable truth, it is
sufficiently important to deserve refutation. A brief glance
at the practical working of the theory will be a sufficient
exposure of its falsity.
</p><p>According to this rule, a man or woman of large
<pb n="121"/>
combativeness should select a partner equally inclined
to antagonism; then we should have &mdash; what? the elements
of a happy, contented, harmonious life? &mdash; No;
instead, either a speedy lawsuit for divorce, or a
continual domestic broil, the nearest approach to a mundane
purgatory possible. The selfish, close-fisted, miserly
money-catcher must marry a woman equally sordid and
stingy. Then together they could hoard up &mdash; for moths
and rust to destroy, or for interested relatives to quarrel
over &mdash; their beloved greenbacks and their glittering dollars,
each scrimping the other down to the finest point above
starvation and freezing, and finally dying, to be forgotten
by their fellow-men as soon as dead, and sent among the
goats at the great Assizes. A shiftless spendthrift must
choose for a helpmeet (?) an equally slovenly, thriftless
wife. A man with a crotchet should select a partner
with the same morbid fancy. A man whose whole
mental composition gravitates behind his ears, must find
a mate with the same animal disposition. An individual
whose mental organization is sadly unbalanced, is
advised to seek for a wife a woman with the same deficiencies
and abnormalities.
</p><p>Any one can see at a glance the domestic disasters
which such a plan of proceeding would entail. Men and
women of unbalanced temperaments would become more
unbalanced. An individual of erroneous tendencies,
instead of having the constant check of the example and
admonitions of a mate of opposite tendencies, would be,
by constant example, hastened onward in his sinful
ways. Thus, to all but a very small proportion of
humanity, the married state would be one of infelicity and
degeneration.
<pb n="122"/>
</p><p>And what would be the progeny of such unions?
The peculiarities and propensities of the parents, instead
of being modified and perhaps obliterated in the children
by corresponding differences in character, would be
doubly exaggerated. The children of selfish parents
would be thieves; those of spendthrifts, beggars; those
of crotchety parents, monomaniacs; those born of sensual
parents, beastly debauchees. A few generations of such
a degenerating process would either exterminate the
race, or drive it back to Darwin's ancestral ape.
</p><p>It must not be inferred from our strictures upon the
theory mentioned, that we would advocate the opposite
course, that is, the contraction of marriage by individuals
of wholly dissimilar tastes, aims, and temperaments.
Such alliances would doubtless be quite as wretched in
their results as those of an opposite character. It is
with this as with nearly all other subjects; the true
course lies between the two extremes. Parties who are
negotiating a life partnership, should be careful to assure
themselves that there exists a sufficient degree of
congeniality of temperament to make such close and
continued association agreeable.
</p><p>Disparity of Age. &mdash; Both nature and custom seem
to indicate that the husband should be a little older than
the wife. Several reasons might be given for this, but
we need not mention them. When, however, the difference
of ages reaches such an extreme as thirty, forty,
even fifty or more years, nature is abused, good taste
is offended, and even morality is shocked. Ill-sorted
alliances are disastrous to both parties, and scarcely
more to one than the other.
</p><p>Unions of an opposite character to those just consid-<pb n="123"/>
ered, wherein a young man marries a woman much older
than himself, are more rare than those of the other class.
They are, perhaps, less deplorable in their physical
effects, but still highly reprehensible. They are seldom
prompted by pure motives, and can be productive of no
good. Children resulting from such unions are notably
weak, unbalanced, and sorry specimens of humanity.
</p><p>A Domestic Purgatory. &mdash; We have scarcely referred
to the domestic misery which may result from these
disgraceful unions. If a young girl is brought home by
a widower to preside over his grown-up daughters, each
of whom is old enough to be her mother, all the elements
are provided for such a domestic hell as could
only be equaled by circumstances precisely similar. If
children are born, neither father nor mother is fit to act
the part of a parent to them. The father, by reason of
his age, is fitful, uncertain, and childish; to-day too
lenient, to-morrow too exacting. The mother is pettish,
childish, indulgent, impatient, and as unskilled in
government as unfit for motherhood. In the midst of all
this misrule, the child grows up undisciplined, uncultivated,
unsubdued, &mdash; a misery to his parents, a disgrace to
his friends, a dishonor to himself.
</p><p>"What shall I do with him? and what will he do
with me?" was the question asked by a girl of eighteen
whose parents were urging her to marry an old man;
and every young woman would do well to propound the
same question under similar circumstances.
</p><p>Were we disposed to define more specifically the
conditions necessary to secure the most harmonious
matrimonial unions, it would be useless to do so; for
unions of this sort never have been, and never will be &mdash;
<pb n="124"/>
with rare exceptions &mdash; formed in accordance with a
prescribed method, independent of any emotional bias. Nor
is it probable that such a plan would result in remedying,
in any appreciable degree, existing evils. It is a fact
too patent to be ignored, that a very large share of the
unhappiness in the world arises from ill-mated marriages;
but it is also true that nearly the whole of this unhappiness
might be averted if the parties themselves would
endeavor to lessen the differences between them by
mutual approximation.
</p><p>Courtship. &mdash; We cannot well avoid devoting a few
paragraphs to a part of the subject so important as this,
especially as it affords an opportunity for pointing out
some evils too patent and too perilous to be ignored.
</p><p>Courting, in the sense in which we use the word, is
distinctly an American custom. The social laws of
other civilized countries are such as to preclude the
possibility of the almost unrestrained association of the
sexes in youth which we see in this country. We do
not offer this fact as an argument in favor of foreign
social customs, by any means, although in this one
particular they often present great advantages, since in the
majority of instances other evils as great, or even greater,
are encouraged. We mention the fact simply for the
purpose of bringing into bold relief the evils of the
characteristic American looseness in this particular.
</p><p>Courtship in France. &mdash; A French matron would be
horrified at the idea that a young man should ask her
daughter to accompany him alone on an evening ride, to
a lecture, concert, or other place of amusement, and
much more should he ask the privilege of sitting up all
night in the parlor with the light turned down, after the
<pb n="125"/>
rest of the family had retired. Among respectable
people in France, such liberties are not tolerated; and a
young man who should propose such a thing would be
dismissed from the house instantly, and regarded as
unfit for association with virtuous people. If a young man
calls upon a young lady for the purpose of making her
acquaintance, he sees both her and her mother, or an
aunt or older sister. He never sees her alone. If he
invites her to ride, or to accompany him to an entertainment
of any sort, he must always invite her lady friend
also; she goes along at any rate. There is afforded no
chance for solitary moonlight strolls or rides, nor any
other of the similar opportunities made so common by
American courting customs.
</p><p>We are no advocates of the formal modes of contracting
matrimonial alliances common among many nations,
and illustrations of which we find in all ages of the
world. For example, among the ancient Assyrians it
was a custom to sell wives to the highest bidder, at
auction, the sums received for the handsomest ones being
given to the less favored ones as a dowry, to secure a
husband for every woman. The same custom prevailed
in Babylon in ancient times, and has been practiced in
modern times in Russia. At St. Petersburg, not many
years ago, an annual sale of wives was held on Whit
Sunday, after the same plan followed by the Assyrians.
</p><p>A Jewish Custom. &mdash; Among the early Jews it seems
to have been the custom for parents to select wives for
their sons. In the case of Isaac, this important matter
was intrusted to an old and experienced servant, who
was undoubtedly considered much more competent to
select a wife for the young man than he was himself.
<pb n="128"/>
The same custom has been handed down, even to the
present time among some oriental nations. In many
cases the parties are not allowed to see each other until
after the wedding ceremony is completed. The Hungarians
often betroth their children while they are yet in
their cradles, as did the Mexicans and Brazilians of the
last century. In some countries it has even been
customary to betroth girls conditionally before they were
born.
</p><p>The primitive Moravians seem to have adhered to
the ancient Jewish custom in some degree, though making
the selection of a wife a matter of chance. The old
people did all the courting there was done, which was
not much. When a young man desired a wife, a helpmeet
was selected for him by casting lots among the
marriageable young ladies of the community, and the
young man was obliged to abide by the decision, it
being supposed that Providence controlled the selection.
We are not prepared to say that the young man ran any
greater risk of getting an uncongenial or undesirable life
companion by this mode of selection than by the more
modern modes in vogue among us.
</p><p>As before remarked, we do not present these customs
as illustrations of what might be considered a proper
mode of conducting the preliminary steps of matrimonial
alliances. On the contrary, we unhesitatingly pronounce
them decidedly objectionable, on moral grounds if not on
others, and we can readily see that such unions must
have been in many cases exceedingly unsatisfactory.
</p><p>But still more objectionable must have been the
loose customs which have prevailed among some nations
as, for instance, in Congo, where wives are taken on
<pb n="127"/>
trial. If, after two or three years, both parties are satisfied,
they are married. If they are not suited, each
tries it again with another partner, so continuing the
experiments until a congenial mate is found. In some
parts of South America, a similar custom has prevailed,
as well as in other countries. In an early day a practice
not unlike this was common in Scotland.
</p><p>An Immoral Custom. &mdash; In Finland, a custom known
as "the week of the breeches," allows young folks a
week's trial to see whether they can agree within the
limits of a single couch, before the matrimonial knot is
tied. In Wales, a similar practice was until recently in
vogue, under the name of "bundling." Indeed, it has
not been a full generation since an identical practice,
known as "tarrying," prevailed among the Anglo-Americans
in some sections of this country, which allowed
the courting couple to occupy the same bed as a test of
their congeniality, before being tied up for life.
</p><p>While traveling in Europe a few years since, the
author met in Sweden a very intelligent native physician
who had practiced his profession for many years among
his countrymen, and from whom the fact was learned
that the custom referred to in the preceding paragraph
is still prevalent in many parts of the rural districts of
that country.
</p><p>Prevailing Customs of Evil Tendency. &mdash; All virtuous
and enlightened people will exclaim against such loose
practices as these; and yet we inquire, in all seriousness,
Are not many of the common practices of most young
persons while courting as unnecessary, and in quality as
improper, as those last mentioned? What possible
good, we inquire, can come from the not uncommon cus-<pb n="128"/>
tom among young persons of sitting up half the night, or
all the night, as is not infrequently done, with the
light turned down or completely extinguished, hugging
and kissing and talking sentimental moonshine until
they are mutually disgusted and wearied with such
mawkish maneuvers?
</p><p>"Why," says one, "it is necessary that young people
should get acquainted with each other in order to know
whether there will be mutual congeniality or not," to
which we need only reply that such circumstances are
the most unfavorable that could be imagined for becoming
really acquainted. Both are in a state of mind
which is very correctly characterized as "soft." Neither
is natural; neither appears natural. Each does his best
to appear unnatural. If an individual possesses noble
and admirable traits of character, they are not likely to
be drawn out by such experiences as these.
</p><p>This argument is precisely the one which was probably
urged in favor of experimental marriages, and of
the customs known as "bundling," "tarrying," and "the
week of the breeches," among the nations maintaining
them. Said they, Matrimony is a very momentous
matter, and it is of the greatest importance that the
individuals should become well acquainted with each
other before it is too late to remedy a mistake.
</p><p>It will be responded that those customs placed before
the ardent, unsophisticated young people, temptations to
commit gross immoralities.
</p><p>Granting this to be true, we inquire, Is not the same
objection valid in the other case? What better opportunity
for a breach of morals could be desired than is
granted to young persons during courtship in this coun-<pb n="129"/>
try? The thousands of sad cases of shipwrecked virtue
which date their overthrow from such occasions as have
been described, furnish the only answer needed. If
moral principle is weak, such practices will in no degree
serve to increase its strength. The associations, the
mental state, and the physical conditions are all such as
to stimulate the baser passions; and that this is the
exact effect, thousands of young men can testify.
Indeed, from the confidences reposed in us as a physician,
we have received the most indisputable evidence that
this effect is not confined to the male sex. The peculiarly
languid, spiritless feelings which a young lady experiences
the day succeeding a night spent with her intended, or
perhaps a mere admirer, in the manner described, means
something more than physical exhaustion from want of
sleep, as many of them are very well aware. Under
existing circumstances, the wonder to us is not that
there are so many lapses from virtue among American
young women, but that there are no more.
</p><p>But the effects upon both sexes, even when no overt
sin is committed, is most pernicious, both mentally and
physically, besides being in no small degree sinful
according to the interpretation of the law given by Christ.
</p><p>The author has met numerous instances in which the
first departures from the path of purity were induced by
the familiarities indulged during flirtation or courtship.
Little by little the barriers were broken down, until at
last all reserve was gone, and the grossest immoralities
were practiced, in some instances for months and even
years.
</p><p>Long Courtships. &mdash; Chiefly for the reasons presented
in the preceding paragraphs, we are opposed to long
<pb n="130"/>
courtships and long engagements. They are productive
of no good, and are not infrequently the occasion of
much evil. There may be circumstances which render
a prolonged engagement necessary and advisable; but,
in general, they are to be avoided.
</p><p>On the other hand, hasty marriages are still more to
be deprecated, especially when, as is too commonly the
case, the probability is so great that passion is the
actuating motive far more than true love. Marriage is
a matter of most serious consequence, and deserving of
the most careful deliberation. Too often, matrimony is
entered upon without any more substantial assurance of
happiness as the result, than the individual has of
securing a valuable prize who buys a ticket in a lottery
scheme. In the majority of cases, young people learn
more of each other's real character within two weeks
after marriage than they discovered during many
months of courting.
</p><p>Advice about Getting Married. &mdash; To every young
man and woman we say, Look well before you leap;
consider well, carefully, and prayerfully. A reckless
leap in the dark is a fearful risk, and will be far more
likely to land you in a domestic purgatory than
anywhere else. Do not be dazzled by a handsome face, an
agreeable address, a brilliant or piquant manner. Choose
modesty, simplicity, sincerity, morality, &mdash; qualities of
heart and mind, &mdash; rather than exterior embellishments.
</p><p>"It is folly," suggests a friend, "to give advice on
these subjects; for no one will follow advice on this
point, no matter how sensible and reasonable he may
be on all other subjects. The emotions carry the individual
away, and the reason loses control." This is too true,
<pb n="131"/>
in nearly all cases. We believe in affection. The
emotions have their part to act. We have no sympathy
with the theories of those who will have all marriages
made by rule. But reason must be allowed a voice in
the matter; and although there may be a time when
the overwhelming force of the emotions may relegate
reason and judgment into the background, there has
been a time previous when the judgment might have
held control. Let every young person be most scrupulously
careful how he allows emotional excitement to
gain the ascendency. When reason is once stifled, the
individual is in a most precarious situation. It is far
better and easier to prevent the danger than to escape
from it.
</p><p>Flirtation. &mdash; We cannot find language sufficiently
emphatic to express proper condemnation of one of the
most popular forms of amusement indulged in at the
present day in this country, under the guise of innocent
association of the sexes. By the majority of people,
flirtation is looked upon as harmless, some even considering
it useful, claiming that the experience gained by
such associations is valuable to young persons, by making
them familiar with the customs of society and the ways
of the world. We have not the slightest hesitation in
pronouncing flirtation pernicious in the extreme. It exerts
a malign influence alike upon the mental, the moral, and
the physical constitution of those who indulge it. The
young lady who has become infatuated with a passion
for flirting, courting the society of young men simply
for the pleasure derived from their attentions, is educating
herself in a school which will totally unfit her for
the enjoyment of domestic peace and happiness should
<pb n="132"/>
she have all the conditions necessary for such enjoyment
other than those which she herself must furnish. More
than this, she is very likely laying the foundation for
lifelong disease by the dissipation, late hours, late
suppers, evening exposures, fashionable dressing, etc., the
almost certain accompaniments of the vice we are
considering. She is surely sacrificing a life of real, true
happiness for the transient fascinations of unreal enjoyment,
pernicious excitement.
</p><p>It may be true, and undoubtedly is the case, that by
far the greater share of the guilt of flirtation lies at the
door of the female sex; but there do exist such detestable
creatures as male flirts. In general, the male flirt
is a much less worthy character than the young lady
who makes a pastime of flirtation. He is something
more than a flirt. In nine cases out of ten, he is a rake
as well. His object in flirting is to gratify a mean
propensity at the expense of those who are pure and
unsophisticated. He is skilled in the arts of fascination
and intrigue. Slowly he winds his coils about his
victim, and before she is aware of his real character, she
has lost her own. Such wretches ought to be punished
in a purgatory by themselves, made seven times hotter
than for ordinary criminals.
</p><p>Society is full of these lecherous villains. They
insinuate themselves into the drawing-rooms of the most
respectable families; they are always on hand at social
gatherings of every sort. They haunt the ball-room,
the theater, and even the church when they can forward
their infamous plans by seeming to be pious. Not
infrequently they are well supplied with a stock of pious
cant, which they employ on occasion to make an impres-<pb n="133"/>
sion. They are the sharks of society, and often seize in
their voracious maws the fairest and brightest ornaments
of a community. The male flirt is a monster. Every
man ought to despise him; and every woman ought to
spurn him as a loathsome social leper.
</p><p>Any young man who has been heartlessly jilted by
a young woman upon whom he has placed his affections,
should waste no time in regrets that his suit has been
refused, but should consider himself in the highest
degree fortunate that he has not been permitted to form a
life-long alliance with one who was utterly unworthy of
the affections of any honest man. So also the young
lady whose affections have been trifled with by one of
those heartless fops who consider the breaking of hearts
an enjoyable pastime, should not regret her experience
as a loss, but rather regard it as a fortunate deliverance
from a life of wretchedness certain to result to any
woman who places her happiness in the keeping of one
of those shallow-brained and heartless individuals.
</p><p>Youthful Flirtations. &mdash; Flirting is not confined to
young men and women. The contagion extends to little
boys and girls, whose heads ought to be as empty of all
thoughts of sexual relations as the vacuum of an air-pump is of air. The intimate association of young boys
and girls in our common schools, and, indeed, in the
majority of educational institutions, gives abundant
opportunity for the fostering of this kind of a spirit, so
prejudicial to healthful mental and moral development. Every
educator who is alive to the objects and interests of his
profession, knows too well the baneful influence of these
premature and pernicious tendencies. Many times has
the teacher watched with a sad heart the withering of
<pb n="134"/>
all his hopes for the intellectual progress of a naturally
gifted scholar, by this blighting influence.
</p><p>The most dangerous period for boys and girls exposed
to temptations of this sort is that just following
puberty, or between the ages of twelve and eighteen or
twenty. This period, a prominent educator in one of our
Western States once denominated, not inappropriately,
"the agonizing period of human puppyhood." If this
critical period is once safely passed, the individual is
comparatively safe; but how many fail to pass through
the ordeal unseared!
</p><p>The most painful phase of this subject is the tacit &mdash;
even, in many cases, active &mdash; encouragement which too
many parents give their children in this very direction,
seemingly in utter ignorance of the enormity of the evil
which they are winking at or fostering. Parents need
enlightenment on this subject, and ought to be aroused
to the fact that it is one of the most momentous questions
that can arise in the rearing and training of children.
</p><p>Polygamy. &mdash; One hundred years ago the public
discussion of the propriety or impropriety of a plurality of
wives would have been impossible. Polygamy had not
obtained a foot-hold as an institution in any civilized
land. Being well known as not uncommon among certain
heathenish and barbarous tribes, it was looked upon
as a heathenish and debasing institution, the outgrowth
of ignorance and gross sensuality, and a relic of a sensual
age. Now, this is no longer true. Even in this, the
most enlightened of all lands, where there are most
ample facilities for culture, for moral and mental
development, polygamy holds up its hideous head in defiance
<pb n="135"/>
of all the laws of God and man. It is true that the
perpetrators of this foul crime against humanity and Heaven
have been driven by the indignation of outraged decency
to seek a lurking place in the far-off wilderness of the
Western territories; yet the foul odors from this festering
sore are daily becoming more and more putrescent,
and in spite of the distance, are contaminating, the
already not overstrict morals of the nation.
</p><p>No better evidence of the blighting, searing effect of
this gross social crime could be found than in the fact
that not only is polygamy coming to be winked at as
something not so very bad, after all, but men from whom
we have a right to expect something better, are coming
forward in its defense.
</p><p>A Defense of Polygamy. &mdash; We have just been perusing
a work written for the express purpose of justifying
and advocating polygamy, by an evangelical clergyman.
He was evidently not willing to own his work,
however, since his name is carefully excluded from the
title page, and his publisher put under an oath of
secrecy. The arguments which he makes in favor of
polygamy are chiefly the following: &mdash;
</p><p>1. That it is approved by the Bible.
</p><p>2. That a robust man requires more than one woman
to satisfy his sexual demands.
</p><p>3. That there are more women than men; and since
every woman has a right to have a husband, the only
way all can be supplied is to allow several women, two
or more, according to the capacity of the man, or as they
can agree, to form a marriage partnership with one man.
</p><p>4. That the great men of all ages have been polygamists
in fact, if not by open profession.
<pb n="136"/>
</p><p>5. That monogamy is a relic of the paganism of
the ancient Greeks and Romans, with whom it originated.
</p><p>6. That it is the only proper and effective cure
for the "social evil," and all its attendant vices and
dire diseases.
</p><p>Arguments of Polygamists Answered. &mdash; As this
work has had quite a circulation, bearing the imprint
of a well-known Boston publisher, and has not received
any answer that we are aware of, we deem it worth
while to give these arguments, which are very strongly
presented, at least a passing notice. We will consider
them in the order in which they are stated above.
</p><p>1. We deny most emphatically the assertion that
polygamy is either taught or approved by the Bible.
It was tolerated in a people who had long been in the
darkness of Egyptian bondage, but never approved.
Indeed, the inspired writers have evidently taken
pains to give numerous examples of the evils growing
out of that violation of the laws of God and nature.
</p><p>2. The second argument is based upon the asserted
fact that man naturally possesses stronger sexual
demands than woman; that these demands are imperative;
and that it is not only impossible, but in the highest
degree injurious, to restrain them.
</p><p>While it is true, as a fact affirmed by constant
observation, that men have stronger passions than
women, in general, and that many men demand of
wives a degree of sexual indulgence which is the cause
of serious injury to them, and even impossible for
them to grant without doing themselves the greatest
wrong, it is by no means proven either that these de-<pb n="137"/>
mands are imperative, that they are natural, or that they
are not injurious to the man as well as the woman, much
less beneficial to either. On the contrary, there is as
great a weight of evidence as could be required that
restraint, self-control, and moderation in the exercise of
the sexual instinct, are in the highest degree beneficial to
man, as well as to woman, and are necessary for his
highest development.
</p><p>3. While it is true there are a few more adult women
than men, the difference is not sufficiently great to
require the introduction of polygamy as a remedy for
enforced celibacy. At any rate, this would be unnecessary
until all bachelors had been provided with wives, when
there would be found no necessity for further provision,
since there are large numbers of women who are utterly
unfit to marry, who would be injured by so doing, and
would only serve to degenerate the race, besides making
themselves more wretched than they already are.
</p><p>Again, it is a well-known fact that more males than
females are born, the preponderance of adult females
being caused by a greater mortality among male children,
together with the losses from accidents and war. By a
correct observance of the laws of health, together with
the abolition of wars, the disparity in relative numbers
of the sexes would disappear. Indeed, it might happen
that men would be in the preponderance.
</p><p>Still again, it is only in a few very populous and
long-settled communities that there are more women
than men, as in the States of Massachusetts, Connecticut,
and a few others of the Eastern States, and a few
countries of Europe. In all newly settled countries, the
reverse is true. The inquiry naturally arises, What
<pb n="138"/>
shall be done under these circumstances? Shall a
woman be allowed more than one husband, as is actually
the case in some countries? "Oh! no;" our polygamist
replies, "a woman is not capable of loving more than
one man, and is not even able to satisfy the sexual
demands of a single husband; so, of course, a plurality
of husbands is out of the question. A man is capable
of loving any number of women, being differently
constituted from a woman; and so the same rule does not
apply."
</p><p>The writer evidently confounds love with lust. He
will grant unstinted indulgence to the lusts of man, but
requires woman to be restrained, offering as an apology
for such a manifestly unfair and unphilosophical discrimination,
that "man is differently constituted from a woman
sexually, requiring more active exercise of the sexual
functions," &mdash; a conclusion which could be warranted
only by the selection, as a typical specimen of the male
part of humanity, of a man with an abnormal development
of the animal propensities.
</p><p>A correct understanding and application of the laws
of sexual hygiene would effectually sweep away every
vestige of argument based on this foundation.
</p><p>4. In proof of tho propriety of polygamy, as well as
of its necessity, the author referred to cites the well-known fact that Plato, Aristotle, Bacon, Alexander,
C&aelig;sar, Napoleon, Burns, Byron, Augustus, Webster,
and numerous others of the noted men of all ages have
been incontinent men. The fact that these men were
guilty of crime does not in the least degree detract from
the enormity of sin. It is equally true that many great
men have been addicted to intemperance and other
<pb n="139"/>
crimes. Alexander was a Sodomite as well as a lecherous
rake. Does this fact afford any proof that those
crimes are virtues instead of vices? Such argument is
hardly worthy of serious refutal, since it stultifies itself.
</p><p>5. The fact that monogamy was practiced among the
ancient Greeks and Romans, is in no way derogatory of
it as an institution. Even if it could be shown that it
originated with those nations, still this would in no way
detract from its value or respectability. Do not we owe
much to those grand old pagans who laid the foundation
for nearly all the modern sciences, and established
better systems of political economy, and better schools for
uniform culture of the whole individual, than any the
world has seen since? But monogamy did not originate
with the Greeks, neither was it invented by the Romans,
nor by any other nation. It originated with the great
Originator of the human race. It is an institution which
has come down to us, not from Greece or Rome, but
from Paradise.
</p><p>If it was so important that man should have more
than one woman to supply his sexual demands, why
was the Creator so short-sighted as to make but one
Eve? It would have been as easy to remove two or
three or half a dozen ribs from Adam's side as one; and
as the whole world had yet to be populated, a plurality
of wives would certainly have accelerated the process.
Surely, if polygamy was ever required or excusable, it
ought to have been allowed at the start.
</p><p>Again, when Noah went into the ark, taking with
him an assortment of all species of animals, he took some
kinds by pairs and some by sevens, from which we
might suspect, at least, that he observed the laws of
<pb n="140"/>
nature respecting polygamous and monogamous animals.
But he took only one wife for himself, and only one for
each of his sons. Why not two or half a dozen instead?
Polygamy would certainly have accelerated the repopulation
of the earth most wonderfully; but Noah was
monogamous. To say, in view of such facts, that
monogamy originated with the paganism of ancient Greece
and Rome, is blasphemy.
</p><p>6. The argument that polygamy will cure the "social
evil" is exactly equivalent to the argument that the
removal of all restraint from the sale and manufacture
of intoxicating drinks, thus making them cheap and
common, is the best remedy for intemperance. An
equally good argument might be made for the cure of
theft, murder, and every other vice and crime, by a
similar plan. Such reasoning is the veriest sophistry.
None but a biased mind could produce such flimsy
arguments.
</p><p>But we forbear. We have already given this subject
more attention than it is worthy of, though we have
failed to characterize the vice of polygamy as it deserves.
Our chief apology for noticing the subject is the fact
that sensual men sometimes set up some of the same
arguments as an apology for their vices.
</p><p>Polyandry. &mdash; Perhaps we should add a word or two
respecting this custom, which seems to be a still greater
outrage against nature than that of polygamy, being the
possession of a plurality of husbands by one woman.
This practice is in vogue in several countries at the
present time, being very common in Thibet, where it is
not an unusual thing for a woman, in marrying the
eldest of a family of brothers, to include in the contract all
<pb n="141"/>
the other brothers as well. Polyandry was also common
among the ancient Medes. Indeed, the Medes practiced
both polygamy and polyandry. A man was not considered
respectable unless he had at least seven wives;
neither were women considered worthy of general esteem
unless they had as many as five husbands. In that
country, the fact that a woman was already married
was in no degree a barrier to subsequent marriages,
even while the husband was living, and without the
trouble of a divorce. Those who maintain the propriety
of polygamy, would do well to consider the historic facts
respecting the opposite practice. There appear to be as
good grounds for believing one to have a basis in the
human constitution as the other.
</p><p>Queer Family Arrangements. &mdash; An African tribe
described by Livingstone have very singular social
customs. Children are the property of the mother's brother,
and the father is required to pay a fine for each one who
dies. The king's oldest half-sister is next to him in
authority, and after his death, selects a king from among
his sons. She cannot marry, but is allowed a morganatic
alliance with a slave. Any children born to her are put
to death at birth.
</p><p>Divorce. &mdash; Another of the crying evils of the day,
and one which menaces in a most alarming manner the
most sacred interests of society, is the facility with
which divorces may be obtained. In some States, the
laws regulating divorce are so notoriously loose that
scores and even hundreds of people visit the States
referred to every year with no other object than to obtain
a dissolution of the bonds of matrimony. The effect of
this looseness in the laws is to encourage hasty, incon-<pb n="142"/>
siderate marriages, and to make escape from an uncongenial
partner so easy that the obligation to cultivate
forbearance, and to acquire mutual adaptation, which may
not at first exist, is wholly overlooked.
</p><p>The Bible rule for divorce, laid down by the great
Teacher, is little regarded in these degenerate days. He
made adultery the only legitimate cause for divorce;
yet we now see married people breaking asunder their
solemn marriage ties on the occurrence of the most trivial
difficulties. If a couple become tired of each other, and
desire a change, all they have to do is to forward the fee
to a New York or Chicago lawyer, and they will receive
back in a short time the legal papers duly signed, granting
them the desired annulment of their vows.
</p><p>Although countenanced by human laws, there can be
no doubt that this shameless trifling with a divine
institution is regarded by High Heaven as the vilest
abomination. In no direction is there greater need of
reformatory legislation than in this. The marriage
contract should be recognized in our laws as one which
cannot be made and broken so lightly as it now is. It
should be annulled only for the most serious offenses.
The contrary course, now pursued so frequently, is most
detrimental to morals. Our divorce laws virtually offer
a premium for unchastity.
</p><p>Not infrequently we see, among the advertisements
in the newspapers, notices like the following: "The
undersigned is prepared to furnish divorces to parties
desiring the same at moderate rates, in short time and
without publicity.  &mdash;  &mdash;   &mdash;  &mdash; ."
</p><p>The animus of these advertisements is fraud. The
parties so engaged are the vilest scoundrels; and that
<pb n="143"/>
they are allowed to continue to ply their nefarious
vocation is a foul blot upon the enlightened civilization
of a so-called Christian country. A publisher who will
insert such a notice in his journal, would advertise a
brothel if he dared. While there is so much interest in
the suppression of obscene literature, we would suggest
that the proper authorities should likewise direct their
attention to the suppression of unlawful divorces, and
the proper punishment of the villains engaged in
forwarding this nefarious business.
</p><p>Who May not Marry. &mdash; Many writers devote much
space in laying down rules which are to be implicitly
followed by those seeking life partners. We have
attempted nothing of the sort, both from its impracticability,
and from the fact that such rules are never
followed; and if the attempt should be made to follow
the prescribed rules, we are not sure that more good
than harm would be the result. Hence, we shall content
ourselves with calling attention to a few facts of great
importance respecting the conditions which imperatively
forbid marriage, and which cannot be violated without
the certain entailment of great suffering.
</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Persons suffering with serious disease of a character
communicable to others by contagion or by hereditary
transmission</hi>.
</p><p>Many people wonder why it is that diseases are so
much more numerous and varied in modern times than
in the earlier ages of the race. There has been an
evident increase of diseases within a few centuries.
While there are, undoubtedly, numerous influencing
causes, one which cannot be overlooked is the hereditary
transmission of disease, which preserves those disorders
<pb n="144"/>
already existing, and adds new ones which originate
from new exciting causes. By this means, the human
race is undoubtedly being weakened, human life shortened,
and diseases multiplied. Compare the average
age of human beings of the present day, less than forty
years, with the longevity of the early members of the
race, who lived more than as many score of years. Some
mighty deteriorating influence has been at work; and
we hazard nothing in the assertion that the marriage of
diseased persons, and kindred violations of the laws of
human hygiene, have been not unimportant factors in
producing this most appalling diminution in the length
of human life.
</p><p>Among the diseases which are most certain to be
transmitted, are pulmonary tuberculosis, or consumption,
syphilis, cancer, leprosy, epilepsy, and some other
nervous disorders, some forms of skin disease, and insanity.
The list might be extended; but these are the most common.
Persons suffering with these disorders have no
right to marry, for at least four reasons: &mdash;
</p><p>(1.) It is a sin against the offspring of such unions,
who have a right to be born well, but are forced to come
into the world with weakly constitutions, diseased frames,
and the certainty of premature death. The children of
consumptive and syphilitic parents rarely survive infancy.
If they do, it is only to suffer later on, as they surely
will, and perhaps to communicate the same destructive
diseases to other human beings; but these diseases rarely
extend beyond the third generation, the line becoming
extinct. The most heart-rending spectacles we have
ever met have been the children of parents suffering with
the diseases mentioned. Their appearance is character-<pb n="145"/>
istic; no physician of experience can fail to detect the
sins of a profligate parent in a syphilitic child. Every
feature indicates the presence of a blighting curse.
</p><p>There are those who assert that a man who has
suffered with disease of the character last mentioned, may
marry after the lapse of two or three years from the
disappearance of the active symptoms of the malady. Such
assertions we consider as most dangerous and pernicious.
The individuals who make them are well acquainted
with the fact that, of all diseases, this is the most
difficult to eradicate when once the system has become
thoroughly infected by it. Not only three years, but thirty,
may elapse after active symptoms disappear; yet the
disease may break out again in a new and still more
serious and complicated form. It may even lie entirely
dormant or latent in the system of the parent during his
lifetime, but break out in all its terrible destructiveness
in his children. A man or woman who has once suffered
with this fell disease, is contaminated for life; and it is
a crime for such an one to entail upon innocent, unoffending
human beings such a terrible legacy. Such a person
has no right to marry; or if married, has no right to
perpetuate the results of his sins in offspring. It is <hi rend="italic">never
safe</hi> to say to a man who has once been infected, You
are cured. If a cure ever takes place, it is exceedingly
rare.
</p><p>A worn-out debauchee certainly has no right to
marry. As a medical writer has remarked: "Marriage
is not a hospital or an infirmary for the treatment of
disease, or a reformatory institution for the moral leper.
More intelligent and just public opinion will do away
with such outrages."
<pb n="146"/>
</p><p>(2.) It is a crime against the race. One of the primary
objects of marriage is reproduction. As members
of the human race, it is the duty of parents to produce
a high type of human beings, at least to do all in their
power to produce healthy offspring. If they cannot do
this, and are aware of the fact, they are guilty of abuse
of the reproductive function in bringing sickly offspring
into the world to suffer.
</p><p>(3.) It is injurious to the contracting parties themselves.
If a person has a communicable disease, as
syphilis, leprosy, and some bad forms of skin disease,
the disease will certainly be communicated to the wife
or husband, and so a double amount of suffering will be
entailed. The dread disease, consumption, rightly called
the scourge of civilization, is now well known to be
communicable. A few years ago we were consulted by an
old gentleman, a native of Canada, who was suffering
with pulmonary disease. We inquired respecting the
history of the malady. Said he, "Doctor, it may seem
strange, but I believe I <hi rend="italic">inherited</hi> consumption from my
wife, who died of consumption a few years ago."
Excepting the wrong use of the term <hi rend="italic">inherit</hi>, we were not
prepared to dispute the old gentleman's ideas respecting
the origin of his disease. Living for years in close
association with his wife, who was slowly dying with disease
of the lungs, it was quite possible for him to have
received the disease from her. So many cases of this kind
have been reported that it is now generally believed by
medical men that consumption is communicable from
one person to another by the reception into the system
of the well person of the exhalations from the lungs of
the person affected.
<pb n="147"/>
</p><p>Physical Influence of Marriage. &mdash; Another point
worthy of mention here is the well-known fact that the
intimate association of married people modifies even the
physical form of both. Almost every one has noticed
how much alike in appearance married people often
come to be who have lived many years together. This
physical change undoubtedly extends farther than to the
features only. The whole constitution is modified.
</p><p>A remarkable illustration is found in the frequent
observation that the children of a woman by a second
husband often resemble in appearance the first husband
much more than their own father. It has been observed
that the children of negro women, even by husbands of
pure negro blood, are much lighter in color than usual, if
she has had a child by a white man previously.
</p><p>The same fact is observed in lower animals. In
England, some years ago, a cross was effected between
a male zebra and several young mares. Not only the
hybrid colts resulting from this union, but all the colts
afterward foaled by the same mares, from other horses,
were striped like the zebra.
</p><p>In view of these facts, it is evident that the system
of the wife, at least, may be profoundly affected by
constitutional weaknesses, as well as by other individual
peculiarities possessed by her husband.
</p><p>No person suffering with a contagious or infectious
disease, has any right to communicate the same to
another. Indeed, it is the moral duty of every person so
affected to do all in his power for the protection of others
from the same cause of suffering.
</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Persons having a marked hereditary tendency to
disease, must not marry those having a similar tendency</hi>.
<pb n="148"/>
</p><p>Every physician knows too well the powerful influence
of hereditary causes in determining the length of human
life. Persons, one or both of whose parents have died
of consumption, are very likely to die of the same
disease, and frequently at about the same age. The children
of such parents are commonly feeble and puny,
and die early, if they survive infancy. When both parents
possess the consumptive tendency, the chance for
life in the offspring is very poor indeed. The same may
be said of those suffering with cancer, epilepsy, insanity,
etc. Persons with a strong tendency to any one of the
diseases mentioned, should in no case marry. If there
is but a slight morbid tendency, marriage may be admissible,
but only with a partner possessing robust health.

</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Should cousins marry</hi>?
</p><p>Writers have devoted a good deal of attention to this
subject, and we have been shown statistics, reports of
imbecile asylums, etc., for the purpose of proving that
the marriage of cousins results in the production of
idiots, and children defective in other ways; but the
results of a more careful examination of the subject
invalidate the views heretofore held, and it must be
acknowledged that when both parties are healthy, there is
no more liability of mental incompetency in the children
of cousins, than in the offspring of persons more remotely
related. It must be added, however, that there are
other reasons why the marriage of cousins is not to be
generally recommended. Besides the fact that the feeling
existing between cousins is often only that which is
felt by brothers and sisters for each other, there is the
still more important fact that on account of the blood
relation, unions of this kind are more apt than others to
<pb n="149"/>
bring together persons having similar morbid tendencies.
</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Persons having serious congenital deformities should
not marry</hi>.
</p><p>The reason for this rule is obvious. Persons suffering
with serious congenital defects, as natural blindness
deafness, deformity of the limbs, or defective development
of any part, will be more or less likely to transmit
the same deformities or deficiencies to their children.
There are, of course, cases of natural blindness, as well
as of disability in other respects, to which this rule does
not apply, the natural process of development not being
seriously defective. It has even been observed that
there is a slight tendency to the reproduction in the
offspring, of deformity which has been artificially produced
in the parents, and has existed for a long time.
</p><p>Many ancient nations observe this rule. Infants
born cripples were strangled at birth or left to die. A
Spartan king was once required by his people to pay
a heavy fine for taking a wife who was inferior in size.
</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Criminals should not marry</hi>.
</p><p>It has been satisfactorily shown by thorough and
scientific investigation that criminals often receive their
evil proclivities from their parents. What are known as
the criminal classes, which are responsible for the greater
part of the crime committed, are constantly and greatly
on the increase. There is no doubt but that inheritance
is largely responsible for the continued increase of crime
and criminals. A drunkard begets in his child a thirst
for liquor, which is augmented by the mother's use of
ale or lager during gestation and nursing, and the child
enters the world with a natural taste for intoxicants.
A thief transmits to his offspring a secretive, dishonest,
<pb n="150"/>
sneaking disposition; and the child comes into the world
ticketed for the State prison by the nearest route. So
with other evil tendencies. By legislation or by some
other means, measures should be speedily adopted for the
prevention of this increase of criminals, if there is any
feasible plan which can be adopted. We offer no
suggestion on this point, but it is one well worthy of the
consideration of philanthropic statesmen.
</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">Persons who are greatly disproportionate in size
should not marry</hi>.
</p><p>While good taste would suggest the propriety of this
rule, there are important physiological reasons for its
observance. While the lack of physical adaptitude may
be the occasion of much suffering and unhappiness in
such unions, especially on the part of the wife, being
even productive of most serious local disease, and sometimes
of sterility, it is in childbirth that the greatest
risk and suffering is incurred. More might be said on
this point, but this is sufficient for those who are willing
to profit by a useful hint.
</p><p>7. <hi rend="italic">Persons between whom there is a great disparity of
age should not marry</hi>.
</p><p>The reasons for this have already been given at
length, and we will not repeat. In general, the husband
should be older than the wife, from two to five years.
The husband may often be ten or twelve years the
senior of the wife; but when more than that, the union
is not likely to be a profitable or happy one, if it is not
absolutely productive of suffering and unhappiness.
The ancient Greeks required that the husband should
be twenty years older than the wife; but this custom
was no more reasonable than that of another nation
<pb n="151"/>
which required that only old and young should marry, so
that the sobriety of the old might restrain the frivolity
of the young.
</p><p>8. <hi rend="italic">Persons who are extremely unlike in temperament
should not marry</hi>.
</p><p>Persons who are so unlike in temperament and tastes
as to have no mutual enjoyments, no congeniality of feeling,
will be incompatible as husband and wife, and the
union of such persons will be anything but felicitous.
No definite rule can be laid down; but those seeking a
companion for life would do well to bear this caution in
mind, at the same time remembering that too great
similarity of character, especially when there are prominent
defects, is equally undesirable.
</p><p>9. <hi rend="italic">Marriage between widely different races is unadvisable</hi>.
</p><p>While there is no moral precept directly involved in
marriage between widely different nations, as between
whites and blacks or Indians, experience shows that such
marriages are not only not conducive to happiness, but
are detrimental to the offspring. It has been proven
beyond room for question that mulattoes are not so long-lived as either blacks or whites.
</p><p>10. <hi rend="italic">Persons who are unable to sustain themselves or a
family should not marry</hi>.
</p><p>Both moral and social obligations &mdash; if the two obligations
may exist independently &mdash; forbid marriage to a
young man who is scarcely able to provide for himself,
much less to support a wife and family. The theory
advocated by some, that two can live almost as cheaply
as one, so that a saving will be made by a union of two
in marriage, is a most fallacious one. There may be
<pb n="152"/>
occasional exceptions, but in general, young people who
marry with this idea in their heads, find that they have
reasoned not wisely. It will not be disputed that a
married couple may live upon what is often spent foolishly
by a young man; but a young man can be economical
if he will; and if he does not learn economy before
marriage, it is likely that he never will learn it.
</p><p>The marriage of paupers, to beget pauper children
and foist them upon the community for support, is an
outrage against society. We believe it is not improper to
speak out plainly upon this subject, and in no uncertain
tone, notwithstanding the popular prejudice which cries,
"Hush, be quiet; do n't interfere with individual rights,
do n't disturb the peace of society," whenever anything
is said that has a bearing on a regard for propriety in
matters relating to one of the most ancient, the most
sacred, and the most abused of all divinely appointed
human institutions. We have never been able to account
for this strange averseness to the consideration of
this phase of the matrimonial question, and the
determined effort often made to ignore it whenever it is
broached. We purpose to speak out, notwithstanding
the feeling referred to, since we believe this to be a
crying evil; and we have no fears but that we shall have
the hearty indorsement of every individual who can so
far lay aside his prejudices as to allow his native
common sense a fair chance to influence his judgment.
</p><p>In the country of Iceland, a land which is scarcely
more than semi-civilized, if a young man wishes to
marry, the first thing to be considered is his pecuniary
situation. Before he can take to himself a wife, he
must appear before the proper authority, and present
<pb n="153"/>
evidence that he is able to support a wife and family in
addition to providing for himself. Even the barbarous
natives of Patagonia show an equal degree of good sense,
the chief of each tribe requiring that every young man
who wishes to marry shall first prove himself competent
to provide for a family, having attained the requisite
degree of proficiency in hunting and fishing, and having
possessed himself of at least two horses and the necessary
equipments.
</p><p>In this country, &mdash; a civilized, so-called Christian
country, blessed with all the enlightenment of the nineteenth
century, &mdash; what do we see? Instead of any regulation
of the sort, there is the utmost indifference to
such clearly important considerations. If young people
profess to love each other, and wish to marry, no one
of their friends thinks of asking, "How are they going
to live after they are married? Has the young man a
trade? Has the young lady been so educated as to be
self-sustaining if necessary? Has the young man a
home or the wherewithal to obtain one? Has he a good
situation, with prospects of being able to support his
wife comfortably and provide for a family?" These or
similar questions, are sometimes asked, but little respect
is paid to them by any one, least of all by the young
people themselves, who ought to be most interested.
The minister never inquires respecting the propriety of
the wedding at which he is to officiate, and invokes the
blessings of Heaven upon a union which, for ought he
knows, may be the grossest violation of immutable laws
Heaven-implanted in the constitution of the human race.
The friends tender their congratulations and wishes of
"much joy," when in three cases out of four the con-<pb n="154"/>
ditions are such that a preponderance of grief is an
inevitable certainty, and "much joy" an utter impossibility.
</p><p>There are exceptions to all general rules; but it is a
fact of which almost any one may convince himself, that
the majority of men and women do not rise much higher
than the level reached at marriage. If a young man has
no trade then, it is more than probable that he will
never be master of one. If he has not fitted himself for
a profession, he will most likely never attain to such a
rank in society. He will, in all probability, be a common
laborer, living "from hand to mouth," with nothing
laid by for a rainy day.
</p><p>A wag says that a young couple just married, and
for the first time awakened to the full consciousness of
the fact that they must provide for themselves or starve,
held the following dialogue: <hi rend="italic">Husband</hi>. &mdash; "Well, wife,
what are we going to do? How shall we live?" <hi rend="italic">Wife</hi>.
 &mdash; "Oh, my dear, we shall get along very well, I am
sure; you love me, do n't you?" <hi rend="italic">H</hi>. &mdash; "Certainly, dear,
but we cannot live on love." <hi rend="italic">W</hi>. &mdash; "We can live on
bread and water; so long as we have each other, it
does n't matter much what we have to eat." <hi rend="italic">H</hi>. &mdash;
"That's so, my dear; well, you furnish the bread, and
I will skirmish around after the water." This exact
dialogue may never have taken place; but the circumstances
which might have called it out have occurred
thousands of times. How many times has a dependent
woman, who had hastily married an improvident husband,
awakened at the end of a short honey-moon to find
that she had only a limber stick or a broken reed to lean
upon, instead of a self-reliant, independent, self-sustain-<pb n="155"/>
ing man, able to provide for her the comforts of a home,
and to protect her from the rudeness and suffering of
privation and want!
</p><p>In our estimation, it is as much a sin for a man to
assume the obligation of caring for a wife and family
when he has no reasonable grounds for believing himself
able to do so, as for a man to go in debt a few hundreds
or thousands of dollars, and agree to pay the same when
required, though perfectly well aware that he will probably
be unable to do so. Hence we say again, with emphasis,
The improvident should not marry; and we shall
insist upon urging this truth, notwithstanding the fact
that the very class of persons referred to are usually of
all classes the most anxious to enter the matrimonial
state at the earliest possible moment, and the most certain
to bring into the world large families of children
still more improvident than themselves.
</p><p>11. <hi rend="italic">Do not marry a person whose moral character will
not bear the closest scrutiny</hi>.
</p><p>By this we do not mean that absolute perfection
should be required, as this would interdict marriage
altogether; but we wish to warn every young man against
marrying a young woman who treats lightly or contemptuously
matters which should be treated with profound
respect; who uses the name of the Deity flippantly or
rudely; who treats her parents disrespectfully; who
never cares to talk of subjects of a spiritual nature; who
is giddy, gay, dressy, thoughtless, fickle. Such a young
woman will never make a loving, patient, faithful, helpful
wife.
</p><p>We wish also to warn every young woman against
choosing for a husband a man who has a strong leaning
<pb n="156"/>
toward infidelity; who does not believe in human
responsibility; who makes a mock of religion; who is addicted
to profanity; who is either grossly intemperate or given
to moderate tippling, be it ever so little, so long as he
does not believe in and practice total abstinence; who
uses tobacco; who is a jockey, a fop, a loafer, a scheming
dreamer, or a speculator; who is known to be unchaste,
or who has led a licentious life.
</p><p>The man who has no love for his Maker will be
likely to have little for his wife and children. He who
does not acknowledge his responsibility to a higher
Power, will soon forget his obligation to the wife he has
promised to love and cherish. The man who is not
willing to sacrifice the gratification afforded by such
pernicious habits as dram-drinking and tobacco-using to
insure the comfort and happiness of his wife and children,
is too selfish to make any woman a kind husband.
</p><p>There is no greater error abroad than that held by
not a few, that "a reformed rake makes the best husband."
The man whose affections have been consumed
in the fires of unhallowed lust, is incapable of giving a
pure-minded woman the love that she expects and
deserves. A person cannot pass through the fire
unscathed. The scars burned into the character by the
flames of concupiscence are as deep and lasting as those
inflicted upon the body, and even more so. Only "in
the regeneration" will the marks and scars of the
reformed reprobate be wholly effaced.
</p><p>We willingly grant that there have been numerous
instances in which noble women have, by years of patient
effort, reformed their erring husbands, and restored them
to the paths of virtue and sobriety from which they had
<pb n="157"/>
wandered. We do not deny that it can be done again
but we do not hesitate to say that the experiment is a
most perilous one for any woman to undertake, and one
which not more than one woman in a hundred can bring
to a successful termination. The hazard is terrible.
Perhaps it is on this very account that many young
women run the risk; but they rarely understand what
they are doing. The woman who marries a drunkard,
will, ten chances to one, die a heart-broken drunkard's
wife, or follow her husband to a drunkard's grave. It
is never safe for a woman to marry a man who has been
for years a habitual drunkard, since he may relapse at
any time; and the man who has only indulged moderately,
should be thoroughly reformed and tested before
the chances are taken "for better or for worse." Let
him prove himself well first. A proposition to reform
on condition of marriage should be dismissed with
disdain. If a young man will not determine to do right
because it is right, his motives are sordid; and the
probability is very great that so soon as some stronger
incentive appeals to his selfishness, he will forget his
vows and promises, and relapse into his former vices.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="6" id="d14"><pb n="158"/>
<head>CONTINENCE.</head>

<p>Continence differs from chastity in being entire
restraint from sexual indulgence under all circumstances,
while chastity is only restraint from unlawful indulgence.
Many of the observations on the subject of "Chastity"
apply with equal force to continence. The causes of
incontinence are the same as those of unchastity. The same
relation also exists between mental and physical continence
as between mental and physical chastity.
</p><p>The subject of continence evidently has a somewhat
wider scope than that of chastity, as generally understood;
but as we have considered the latter subject so fully, we
shall devote less space to this, leaving the reader to
make the application of such preceding remarks as
reason may suggest to him are equally appropriate here.
</p><p>Without stopping to consider the various circumstances
under which absolute continence is expedient, or
desirable, or morally required, we will proceed at once
to examine the question, Is continence harmful?
</p><p>Continence Not Injurious. &mdash; It has been claimed by
many, even by physicians, and though with slight show
of reason, that absolute continence, after full development
of the organs of reproduction, could not be maintained
without great detriment to health. It is needless to
enumerate all the different arguments employed to
support this position, since they are, with a few exceptions,
too frivolous to deserve attention. We shall content
ourselves chiefly with quotations from acknowledged
authorities, by which we shall show that the popular
notions upon this subject are wholly erroneous. Their
<pb n="159"/>
general acceptance has been due, without doubt, to the
strong natural bias in their favor. It is an easy matter
to believe what agrees well with one's predilections. A
bare surmise, on the side of prejudice, is more telling
than the most powerful logic on the other side.
</p><p>"We know that this opinion is held by men of the
world, and that many physicians share it. This belief
appears to us to be erroneous, without foundation, and
easily refuted."[3]


[3] Mayer.

</p><p>The same writer claims "that no peculiar disease
nor any abridgement of the duration of life can be
ascribed to such continence." He proves his position by
appealing to statistics, and shows the fallacy of
arguments in support of the contrary view. He further
says, &mdash;
</p><p>"It is determined, in our opinion, that the commerce
of the sexes has no necessities that cannot be restrained
without peril."
</p><p>"A part has been assigned to <hi rend="italic">spermatic plethora</hi> in
the etiology of various mental affections. Among others,
priapism has been attributed to it. In our opinion, this
malady originates in a disturbance of the cerebral nerve
power; but it is due much less to the retention of sperm
than to its exaggerated loss; much less to virtuous
abstinence than to moral depravity."
</p><p>There has evidently been a wide-spread deception
upon this subject. "Health does not absolutely require
that there should ever be an emission of semen, from
puberty to death, though the individual live a hundred
years; and the frequency of involuntary nocturnal
emissions is an indubitable proof that the parts, at least,
<pb n="160"/>
are suffering under a debility and morbid irritability
utterly incompatible with the general welfare of the
system."
</p><p>Continence does not Produce Impotence. &mdash; It has
been declared that strict continence would result in
impotence. The falsity of this argument is clearly shown
by the following observations: &mdash;
</p><p>"There exists no <hi rend="italic">greater error</hi> than this, not one
more opposed to physiological truth. In the first place,
I may state that I have, after many years' experience,
never seen a single instance of atrophy of the generative
organs from this cause. I have, it is true, met the
complaint; but in what class of cases does it occur? &mdash; It
arises, in all instances, from the exactly opposite cause,
abuse; the organs become worn out, and hence arises
atrophy. Physiologically considered, it is not a fact
that the power of secreting semen is annihilated in well-formed adults leading a healthy life, and yet remaining
continent. No continent man need be deterred by this
apocryphal fear of atrophy of the testes, from living a
chaste life. It is a device of the unchaste, a lame excuse
for their own incontinence, unfounded on any physiological
law."[4]


[4] Acton.

</p><p>The eminent Dr. Joseph Hutchinson, of London,
states emphatically that impotence is never the result of
continence. It is unquestionably true, however, that
serious injury may result from prolonged and ungratified
sexual excitement, often greater than from frequent
gratification in a normal way; nevertheless, this is no
apology for incontinence, as the troublesome excitement
is not a physiological condition, but is the result of a bad
<pb n="161"/>
mental state, the mind being allowed to run upon sensual
subjects, which is, beyond question, mentally and morally,
as well as physically, wrong. Sexual excitement
arising from constipation of the bowels, or from any form
of local disease, is a morbid condition which is aggravated
rather than relieved by gratification. Hence a morbid
desire for sexual gratification is under no circumstances
an apology for indulgence.
</p><p>A Hint from Lower Animals. &mdash; The truth of these
statements has been amply confirmed by experiments
upon animals, as well as by the experience of some of
the most distinguished men who have ever lived, among
whom may be mentioned Sir Isaac Newton, Kant,
Paschal, Fontenaille, and Michael Angelo. These men
never married, and lived continent lives. Some of them
lived to a very great age, retaining to the last their
wonderful abilities. In view of this fact, there is
certainly no danger that any young man will suffer injury
by the restraining of his passions within the limits of
divine and natural law.
</p><p>The complaint is made by those whose lives have
been far otherwise than continent, that abstinence
occasions suffering from which indulgence gives relief.
The writer just referred to (Acton) further says that
when such a patient consults a medical man, "he should
be told &mdash; and the result would soon prove the correctness
of the advice &mdash; that attention to diet, gymnastic exercise,
and self-control will most effectually relieve the symptoms."
</p><p>Difficulty of Continence. &mdash; Some there are who urge
that self-denial is difficult; that the natural promptings
are imperious. From this they argue that it cannot but
<pb n="162"/>
be right to gratify so strong a passion. "The admitted
fact that continence, even at the very beginning of
manhood, is frequently productive of distress, &mdash; is often a
struggle hard to be borne, still harder to be completely
victorious in, &mdash; is not to be at all regarded as an argument
that it is an <hi rend="italic">evil</hi>."[5]


[5] Acton.

</p><p>If rigid continence is maintained from the first, the
struggle with the passions will not be nearly so severe
as after they have once been allowed to gain the ascendency.
On this point, the following remarks are very
just: &mdash;
</p><p>"At the outset, the sexual necessities are not so
uncontrolled as is generally supposed, and they can be put
down by the exercise of a little energetic will. There
is, therefore, as it appears to us, as much injustice in
accusing nature of disorders which are dependent upon
the genital senses, badly directed, as there would be in
attributing to it a sprain or a fracture accidentally
produced."[6]


[6] Mayer.

</p><p>It would be just as reasonable to offer the appetite
for liquor as an apology for its use, and a good evidence
of the physiological necessity for alcoholic stimulants, as
to argue that sexual indulgence is a physiological need
for the individual, whereas no such necessity exists
unless produced by erotic thoughts or other conditions
within the individual's own control, or by morbid or
diseased conditions which require medical treatment for
their removal, and which will be aggravated, rather than
alleviated, by the gratification of the desire for indulgence.
</p><p>Helps to Continence. &mdash; As already indicated, and as
every individual with strong passions knows, the war-<pb n="163"/>
fare with passion is a serious one if a person determines
to lead a continent life. He needs the help of every aid
that he can gain. Some of these may be named as follows: &mdash;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Will.</hi> &mdash; A firm determination must be formed to
lead a life of purity; to quickly quench the first suggestions
of impurity; to harbor no unchaste desire; to purge
the mind of carnal thoughts; in short, to cleave fast to
mental continence. Each triumph over vicious thoughts
will strengthen virtue; each victory won will make the
next one easier. So strong a habit of continence may be
formed that this alone will be a bulwark against vice.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Diet.</hi> &mdash; He who would keep in subjection his animal
nature, must carefully guard the portal to his stomach.
The blood is made of what is eaten. Irritating food will
produce irritating blood. Stimulating foods or drinks
will surely produce a corresponding quality of blood.
Irritating, stimulating blood will irritate and stimulate
the nervous system, and especially the delicate nerves
of the reproductive system, as previously explained.
Only the most simple and wholesome food should be
eaten, and that only in such moderate quantities as are
required to replenish the tissues. The custom of making
the food pungent and stimulating with condiments, is
the great, almost the sole, cause of gluttony. It is one
of the greatest hinderances to virtue. Indeed, it may
with truth be said that the devices of modern cookery
are most powerful allies of unchastity and licentiousness.
This subject is particularly deserving of careful, candid,
and studious attention, and only needs such investigation
to demonstrate its soundness.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Exercise.</hi> &mdash; Next to diet as an aid to continence,
<pb n="164"/>
perhaps of equal importance with it, is exercise, both
physical and mental. It is a trite proverb, the truth of
which every one acknowledges, that "Satan finds some
mischief still for idle hands to do," and it is equally true
that he always has an evil thought in readiness to
instill into an unoccupied mind. A person who desires to
be pure and continent in body and mind, must flee idleness
as he would the devil himself; for the latter is
always ready to improve upon the advantages afforded
by an idle moment, an hour given to reverie
</p><p>We have the strongest testimony from the most
eminent physicians in regard to the efficacy of exercise
in overcoming abnormal sexual desires. Mr. Acton
relates the following statement made to him by a gentleman
who has become distinguished in his profession: &mdash;
</p><p>" `You may be surprised, Mr. Acton,' said he, `by
the statement I am about to make to you, that before
my marriage I lived a perfectly continent life. During
my university career, my passions were very strong,
sometimes almost uncontrollable, but I have the
satisfaction of thinking I mastered them; it was, however
by great efforts. I obliged myself to take violent
physical exertion; I was the best oar of my year, and
when I felt particularly strong sexual desire, I sallied
out to take my exercise. I was victorious always, and
I never committed fornication. You see in what vigorous
health I am; it was exercise alone that saved me.' "
</p><p>Says Carpenter, on the same subject, in a text-book
for medical students, "Try the effect of close mental
application to some of those ennobling pursuits to which
your profession introduces you, in combination with
vigorous bodily exercise, before you assert that the
appetite is unrestrainable, and act upon that assertion."
<pb n="165"/>
</p><p>Walking, riding, rowing, and gymnastics are among
the best modes of physical exercise for sedentary persons;
but there is no better form of exercise than working
in the garden. The cultivation of small fruits,
flowers, and other occupations of like character, really
excel all other modes of physical exercise for one who
can engage in them with real pleasure. Even though
distasteful at first, they may become very attractive and
interesting if there is an honest, persevering desire to
make them so.
</p><p>The advantages of exercises of this kind are evident.
1. They are useful as well as healthful; while they call
into action a very large number of muscles by the varied
movements required, the expenditure of vital force is
remunerated by the actual value of the products of the
labor; so that no force is wasted; 2. The tillage of
the soil and the dressing of vines and plants bring one
in constant contact with nature in a manner that is
elevating and refining, or at least affords the most
favorable opportunities for the cultivation of nobility and
purity of mind, and elevated principles.
</p><p>Exercise carried to such excess as to produce
exhaustion, is always injurious. The same is true of
mental labor as of physical exercise. Plenty of sleep,
and regular habits of retiring and rising, are important.
Dozing is bad at any time; for it is a condition in which
the will is nearly dormant, though consciousness still
lingers, and the imagination is allowed to run wild, and
often enough it will run where it ought not. Late study,
or late hours spent in any manner, is a means of
producing general nervous irritability, and sexual excitement
through reflex influence.
<pb n="166"/>
</p><p>The author has made these suggestions to a large
number of young men who were suffering from the
results of sexual excesses, and whose lives had been made
wretched by the clamorings of artificially stimulated
passions, and has frequently witnessed the best results.
Not a little earnestness and moral courage were required
on the part of the patient, however, to secure a rigid
carrying out of the principles here laid down. The
fascination of a passion long indulged, is likely to gain
the mastery over any man who is not thoroughly in
earnest to secure a physical as well as a mental and
moral reform. But one who will engage earnestly and
persistently in the effort, will find himself uniformly
successful in conquering the clamorings of a depraved
instinct, and each effort will give him new courage, and
add to his ability to win future victories.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Bathing.</hi> &mdash; A daily bath with cool or tepid water,
followed by vigorous rubbing of the skin with a coarse
towel and then with the dry hand, is a most valuable
aid. The hour of first rising is generally the most
convenient time. How to take different kinds of baths is
explained in other works devoted to the subject.[7] General
and local cleanliness are indispensable to general
and local health.


[7] See "Uses of Water," "Home Hand-Book of Domestic Hygiene
and Rational Medicine," and other works by the author.

</p><p><hi rend="italic">Religion.</hi> &mdash; After availing himself of all other aids to
continence, if he wishes to maintain purity of mind as
well as physical chastity, &mdash; and one cannot exist long
without the other, &mdash; the individual must seek that most
powerful and helpful of all aids, Divine grace. If, in the
conflict with his animal nature, man had only to contend
<pb n="167"/>
with the degrading influences of his own propensities
the battle would be a serious one, and it is doubtful
whether human nature alone &mdash; at least in any but rare
cases &mdash; would be able to gain the victory; but in addition
to his own inherent tendencies to evil, man is
assailed at every point by unseen agencies that seek to
drag him down and spoil his soul with lust. These
fiendish influences are only felt, not seen, from which
some argue that they do not exist. Such casuists must
find enormous depths for human depravity. But who
has not felt the cruel power of these unseen foes? Against
them, there is but one safe, successful weapon, &mdash; "the
blood of Christ, which cleanseth from all sin."
</p><p>The struggling soul, beset with evil thoughts, will
find in prayer a salvation which all his force of will, and
dieting, and exercising will not, alone, insure him. Yet
prayer alone will not avail; faith and works must always
be associated. All that one can do to work out his own
salvation, he must do; then he can safely trust in God
to do the rest, even though the struggle seems almost a
useless one; for when the soul has been long in bondage
to concupiscence, the mind a hold of foul and lustful
thoughts, a panorama of unchaste imagery, these hateful
phantoms will even intrude themselves upon the sanctity
of prayer, and make their victim mentally unchaste
upon his knees. But Christ can pity even such; and
these degraded minds may yet be pure if, with the
psalmist, they continue to cry with a true purpose and
unwavering trust, "Create in me a clean heart, O God,
and renew a right spirit within me." "Purge me with
hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me and I shall be
whiter than snow."
<pb n="168"/>
</p><p>At the first suggestion of an evil thought, send up a
mental prayer to Him whose ear is always open. Prayer
and impurity are as incompatible as oil and water. The
pure thoughts that sincere prayer will bring, displace
the evil promptings of excited passion. But the desire
for aid must be sincere. Prayer will be of no avail
while the mind is half consenting to the evil thought.
The evil must be loathed, spurned, detested.
</p><p>It would seem almost unnecessary to suggest the
impropriety of resorting to prayer alone when sexual
excitability has arisen from a culpable neglect to remove
the physical condition of local excitement by the means
already mentioned. Such physical causes must be well
looked after, or every attempt to reform will be fruitless
God requires of every individual to do for himself all
that he is capable of doing; to employ every available
means for alleviating his sufferings.</p>

<head>Unchastity.</head>
<p>
THOU shalt not commit adultery." "Whosoever
looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath
committed adultery with her already in his heart."
</p><p>In these two scriptures we have a complete
definition of unchastity. The seventh commandment,
with the Saviour's commentary upon it, places clearly
before us the fact that chastity requires purity of
thought as well as of outward acts. Impure thoughts
and unchaste acts are alike violations of the seventh
commandment. As we shall see, also, unchastity of
the mind is a violation of nature's law as well as of
moral law, and is visited with physical punishment
commensurate to the transgression.
</p><p>Mental Unchastity. &mdash; It is vain for a man to suppose
himself chaste who allows his imagination to run
riot amid scenes of amorous associations. The man
whose lips delight in tales of licentiousness, whose eyes
feast upon obscene pictures, who is ever ready to
pervert the meaning of a harmless word or act into
uncleanness, who finds delight in reading vivid portrayals
of acts of lewdness, &mdash; such a one is not a virtuous man.
Though he may never have committed an overt act of
unchastity, if he cannot pass a handsome female in the
street without, in imagination, approaching the secrets of
her person, he is but one grade above the open libertine,
and is as truly unchaste as the veriest debauchee.

<pb n="170"/>
</p><p>Man may not see these mental adulteries, he may
not perceive these filthy imaginings; but One sees
and notes them. They leave their hideous scars upon
the soul. They soil and mar the mind; and as the
record of each day of life is photographed upon the
books of heaven, they each appear in bold relief, in
all their innate hideousness.
</p><p>O purity! how rare a virtue! How rare to find a
face which shows no trace of sensuality! One turns
with sadness from the thought that human "forms divine"
have sunk so low. The standard of virtue is
trailing in the dust. Men laugh at vice, and sneer at
purity. The bawdy laugh, the ribald jest, the sensual
glance, the obscene song, the filthy tale, salute the
eyes and ears at every street corner, in the horse-car,
on the railroad train, in the bar-room, the lecture hall,
the workshop. In short, the works and signs of vice
are omnipresent.
</p><p>Foul thoughts, once allowed to enter the mind,
stick like the leprosy. They corrode, contaminate,
and infect like the pestilence; naught but Almighty
power can deliver from the bondage of concupiscence a
soul once infected by this foul blight, this mortal contagion.
</p><p>Mental Uncleanness. &mdash; It is a wide-spread and deadly
error, that only outward acts are harmful; that only
physical transgression of the laws of chastity will
produce disease. We have seen all the effects of physical
abuse resulting from mental sin alone.
</p><p>"I have traced serious affections and very great
suffering to this cause. The cases may occur at any
period of life. We meet with them frequently among
<pb n="171"/>
such as are usually called, or think themselves, continent
young men. There are large classes of persons who
seem to think that they may, without moral guilt, excite
their own feelings or those of others by loose or libidinous
conversation in society, provided such impure
thoughts or acts are not followed by masturbation or
fornication. I have almost daily to tell such persons
that physically, and in a sanitary point of view, they
are ruining their constitutions. There are young men
who almost pass their lives in making carnal acquaintances
in the street, but stop just short of seducing girls;
there are others who haunt the lower class of places of
public amusement for the purpose of sexual excitement,
and live, in fact, a thoroughly immoral life in all respects
except actually going home with prostitutes. When
these men come to me, laboring under the various forms
of impotence, they are surprised at my suggesting to
them the possibility that the impairment of their powers
is dependent upon these previous vicious habits."[8]


[8] Acton.

</p><p>"Those lascivious <hi rend="italic">day-dreams</hi> and amorous reveries,
in which young people, and especially the idle and the
voluptuous and the sedentary and the nervous, are
exceedingly apt to indulge, are often the source of general
debility and effeminacy, disordered functions, premature
disease, and even premature death, without the actual
exercise of the genital organs! Indeed, this unchastity
of thought, this adultery of the mind, is the beginning
of immeasurable evil to the human family."[9]


[9] Graham.

</p><p>Certain phrenologists contend that the controlling
center of the sexual passions is the cerebellum, or little
brain, which is situated at the lower and back part of
<pb n="172"/>
the head. They apparently love to dwell upon the theme,
and ride their hobby upon all possible occasions, often in
the most disgusting manner, and always leaving the
impression that they must be themselves suffering from
perversion of the very function of which they speak.
</p><p>There may be some doubt whether the function
called amativeness is located in the cerebellum at all;
at least, it is perfectly certain that amativeness is not
the exclusive function of the cerebellum. Says Carpenter,
the learned physiologist, "The seat of the sexual
sensation is no longer supposed to be in the cerebellum
generally, but probably in its central portion, or some
part of the medulla oblongata."
</p><p>The cerebellum is intimately connected with the
principal vital organs; hence, if it is largely developed,
the individual will possess a well-developed physical
organism, and a good degree of constitutional vigor.
He will have vigorous health, and probably strong sexual
powers, not, however, as a special function, but
for the same reason that he will have a good digestion.
</p><p>To the majority of mankind, apparently, amativeness,
or sexual love, means lust. The term has been
lowered and debased until it might almost be considered
practically synonymous with sensuality. The first step
toward reform must be a recognition of a higher and
purer relation than that which centers every thought
upon the gratification of the animal in human nature.
If one may judge from the facts which now and then
come to the surface in society, it would appear that
the opportunity for sensual gratification had come to
be, in the world at large, the chief attraction between
<pb n="173"/>
the sexes. If to these observations we add the filthy
disclosures constantly made in police courts and scandal
suits, we have a powerful confirmation of the
opinion. Even ministers, who ought to be "ensamples
to the flock," are rather "blind leaders of the blind,"
and fall into the same ditch with the rest.
</p><p>Filthy Dreamers. &mdash; This perversion of a natural
instinct, and these sudden lapses from virtue which
startle a small portion of the community, and afford a
filthy kind of pleasure to the other part, are but the
outgrowths of mental unchastity. "Filthy dreamers,
before they are aware, become filthy in action. The
thoughts mold the brain, as certainly as the brain molds
the thoughts. Rapidly down the current of sensuality
is swept the individual who yields his imagination
to the contemplation of lascivious themes. Before he
knows his danger, he finds himself deep in the mire
of concupiscence. He may preserve a fair exterior;
but the deception cannot cleanse the slime from his
putrid soul. How many a church member carries under
a garb of piety a soul filled with abominations, no
human scrutiny can tell. How many pulpits are filled
by "whited sepulchers," only the Judgment will disclose.
</p><p>Unchaste Conversation. &mdash; "Out of the abundance of
the heart the mouth speaketh." "Every idle word
that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof
in the day of Judgment." "By thy words thou shalt
be condemned." Matt. 12:34, 36, 37. In these three
brief sentences, Christ presents the whole moral aspect
of the subject of this paragraph. To any one who
will ponder well his weighty words, no further remark
is necessary. Let filthy talkers but consider for a
<pb n="174"/>
moment what a multitude of "idle," unclean words are
waiting for account in the final day; and then let
them consider what a load of condemnation must roll
upon their guilty souls when strict justice is meted
out to every one before the bar of Omnipotence, and in
the face of all the world &mdash; of all the universe.
</p><p>The almost universal habit among boys and young
men of relating filthy stories, indulging in foul jokes,
making indecent allusions, and subjecting to lewd
criticism every passing female, is a most abominable sin.
Such habits crush out pure thoughts; they annihilate
respect for virtue; they make the mind a quagmire of
obscenity; they lead to overt acts of lewdness.
</p><p>But boys and youth are not alone in this. More
often than otherwise, they gain from older ones the
phraseology of vice. And if the sin is loathsome in such
youthful transgressors, what detestable enormity must
characterize it in the old!
</p><p>Foul Gossip. &mdash; And women, too, are not without
their share in this accursed thing, this ghost of vice
which haunts the sewing-circle and the parlor as well as
the club-room. They do not, of course, often descend to
those depths of vulgarity to which the coarser sex will
go, but couch in finer terms the same foul thoughts, and
hide in loose insinuations more smut than words could
well express. Some women, who think themselves rare
paragons of virtue, can find no greater pleasure than in
the discussion of the latest scandal, speculations about
the chastity of Mrs. A or Mr. B, and gossip about the
"fall" of this man's daughter or the amorous adventures
of that woman's son.
</p><p>Masculine purity loves to regard woman as chaste in
<pb n="175"/>
mind as well as in body, to surround her with conceptions
of purity and impregnable virtue; but the conclusion is
irresistible that those who can gloat over others' lapses
from virtue, and find delight in such questionable
entertainments as the most recent case of seduction, or the
newest scandal, have need to purify their hearts and re-enforce their waning chastity. Nevertheless, a writer
says, and perhaps truly, that "the women comprise
about all the real virtue there is in the world."
Certainly, if they were one-half as bad as the masculine
portion of humanity, the world would be vastly worse
than it is.
</p><p>Causes of Unchastity. &mdash; Travelers among the North
American Indians have been struck with the almost
entire absence of that abandonment to vice which might
be expected in a race uninfluenced by the moral
restraints of Christianity. When first discovered in their
native wilds, they were free from both the vices and the
consequent diseases of civilization. This fact points
unmistakably to the conclusion that there must be something
in the refinements and perversions of civilized life which
is unfavorable to chastity, notwithstanding all the
restraints which religion and the conventionalisms of
society impose. Can we find such influences? &mdash; Yes;
they abound on every hand, and leave their blight in
most unwelcome places, oft unsuspected, even, till the
work of ruin is complete.
</p><p>Libidinous Blood. &mdash; In no other direction are the
effects of heredity to be more distinctly traced than in
the transmission of sensual propensities. The children
of libertines are almost certain to be rakes and prostitutes.
History affords numerous examples in illustration of this
<pb n="176"/>
fact. The daughter of Augustus was as unchaste as her
father, and her daughter was as immoral as herself.
The sons of David showed evident traces of their father's
failing. Witness the incest of Amnon, and the voluptuousness
of Solomon, who had seven hundred wives and
three hundred concubines. Solomon's son was likewise
a noted polygamist, of whom the record says, "He
desired many wives." His son's son manifested the same
propensity in taking as many wives as the debilitated
state of his kingdom enabled him to support. But perhaps
we may be allowed to trace the origin of this libidinous
propensity still farther back. A glance at the
genealogy of David will show that he was descended
from Judah through Pharez, who was the result of an
incestuous union between Judah and his daughter-in-law.
</p><p>Is it unreasonable to suppose that the abnormal passion
which led David to commit the most heinous sin of
his life in his adultery with Bath-sheba, and subsequently
procuring the death of her husband, was really an
hereditary propensity which had come down to him through
his ancestors, and which, under more favorable
circumstances, was more fully developed in his sons? The
trait may have been kept dormant by the active and
simple habits of his early years, but asserted itself in
full force under the fostering influence of royal idleness
and luxury. In accordance with the known laws of
heredity, such a tendency would be the legitimate result
of such a combination of circumstances.
</p><p>The influence of marital excesses, and especially
sexual indulgence during pregnancy, in producing vicious
tendencies in offspring, will be fully dwelt upon
elsewhere in this work, and need not be considered here
<pb n="177"/>
further than simply to call attention to the subject.
Physiology shows conclusively that thousands of parents
whose sons have become libertines and their daughters
courtesans, have themselves implanted in their characters
the propensity which led to their unchastity.
</p><p>Early Causes. &mdash; The frequent custom of allowing
children of the opposite sex to sleep together, even until
eight or ten years of age, or longer, is a dangerous one.
We have known of instances in which little boys of seven
or eight have been allowed to sleep with girls of fourteen
or sixteen, and in some cases most shameful lessons were
taught, and by persons who would not be suspected of
such an impropriety.
</p><p>In a case which was under the author's care some
time ago, a young woman, upwards of twenty years of
age, who had been regarded in her community as a model
of propriety, and whose character was, in the eyes of her
friends, beyond reproach, had ruined her life, and brought
herself almost to the verge of insanity by sexual familiarity
with a little boy less than one-third her own age,
who had for years been allowed to sleep with her.
</p><p>The sexes should be carefully separated from each
other, at least as early as three or four years of age,
under all circumstances which could afford opportunity
for observing the physical differences of the sexes, or in
any way serve to excite those passions which at this
tender age should be wholly dormant.
</p><p>Diet vs. Chastity. &mdash; From earliest infancy to impotent
old age, under the perverting influence of civilization,
there is a constant antagonism between diet and purity.
Sometimes &mdash; rarely, we hope &mdash; the helpless infant imbibes
the essence of libidinous desires with its mother's milk,
<pb n="178"/>
and thence receives upon its forming brain the stamp of
vice. When old enough to take food in the ordinary
way, the infant's tender organs of digestion are plied
with highly seasoned viands, stimulating sauces, animal
food, sweetmeats, and dainty tidbits in endless variety.
Soon tea and coffee are added to the list. Salt, pepper,
ginger, mustard, condiments of every sort, deteriorate
his daily food. If, perchance, he does not die at once
of indigestion, or with his weakened forces fall a speedy
victim to the diseases incident to infancy, he has his
digestive organs impaired for life at the very outset of his
existence.
</p><p>Exciting stimulants and condiments weaken and
irritate his nerves, and derange the circulation. Thus,
indirectly. they affect the sexual system, which suffers
through sympathy with the other organs. But a
more direct injury is done. Flesh, condiments, eggs
tea, coffee, chocolate, and all stimulants have a powerful
influence directly upon the reproductive organs.
They increase the local supply of blood; and through
nervous sympathy with the brain, the passions are
aroused.
</p><p>Overeating, eating between meals, hasty eating,
eating indigestible articles of food, ices, late suppers,
etc., react upon the sexual organs with the utmost
certainty. Any disturbance of the digestive function
deteriorates the quality of the blood. Poor blood, filled
with crude, poorly digested food, is irritating to the
nervous system, and especially to those extremely delicate
nerves which govern the reproductive function.
Irritation provokes congestion; congestion excites sexual
desires; excited passions increase the local disturbance;
<pb n="179"/>
and thus each reacts upon the other, ever increasing the
injury and the liability to future damage.
</p><p>When children are raised upon such articles, or upon
food with which they are thoroughly mingled, what
wonder that they occasionally "turn out bad"! How
many mothers, while teaching their children the principles
of virtue in the nursery, unwittingly stimulate their
passions at the dinner table until vice becomes almost a
physical necessity!
</p><p>Thus these exciting causes continue their insidious
work through youth and more mature years. Right
under the eyes of fathers and mothers they work the
ruin of their children, exciting such storms of passion as
are absolutely uncontrollable.
</p><p>Nothing tends so powerfully to keep the passions in
abeyance as a simple diet, free from condiments,
especially when coupled with a generous amount of exercise.
</p><p>Clerical Lapses. &mdash; Our most profound disgust is justly
excited when we hear of laxity of morals in a clergyman.
We naturally feel that one whose calling is to
teach his fellow-men the way of truth and right and
purity, should himself be free from taint of immorality.
But when we consider how these ministers are fed, we
cannot suppress a momentary disposition to excuse, in
some degree, their fault. When the minister goes out
to tea, he is served with the richest cake, the choicest
jellies, the most pungent sauces, and the finest of fine-flour bread-stuffs. Little does the indulgent hostess
dream that she is ministering to the inflammation of
passions which may imperil the virtue of her daughter,
or even her own. Salacity once aroused, even in a
minister, allows no room for reason or for conscience. If
<pb n="180"/>
women wish to preserve the virtue of their ministers, let
them feed them more in accordance with the laws of
health. Ministers are not immaculate.
</p><p>The remedy for the dangers to chastity arising
from this source, is pointed out in the paragraphs on
"Continence."
</p><p>Tobacco and Vice. &mdash; Few are aware of the influence
upon morals exerted by that filthy habit, tobacco-using.
When acquired early, it excites the undeveloped organs;
arouses the passions, and in a few years converts the
once chaste and pure youth into a veritable volcano of
lust, belching out from its inner fires of passion, torrents
of obscenity and the sulphurous fumes of lasciviousness.
If long continued, the final effect of tobacco is emasculation;
but this is only the necessary consequence of previous
super-excitation. The lecherous day-dreams in which
many smokers indulge, are a species of fornication for
which even a brute ought to blush, if such a crime were
possible for a brute. The mental libertine does not
confine himself to bagnios and women of the town. In the
foulness of his imagination, he invades the sanctity of
virtue wherever his erotic fancy leads him.
</p><p>When a boy places the first cigar or quid of tobacco
to his lips, he takes &mdash; if he has not previously done so &mdash;
the first step in the road to infamy; and if he adds wine
or beer, he takes a short cut to the degradation of his
manhood by the loss of virtue.
</p><p>We are aware that we have made a grave charge
against tobacco, and we have not hesitated to state the
naked truth; yet we do not think we have exaggerated, in
the least, the pernicious influence of this foul drug. As
much, or nearly as much, might be said against the use
of liquor, on the same grounds.
<pb n="181"/>
</p><p>Obscene Books. &mdash; Another potent enemy of virtue is
the obscene literature which has flooded the land for
many years. Circulated by secret agencies, these books
have found their way into the most secluded districts.
Nearly every large school contains one of these emissaries
of evil men and their Satanic master. Some idea of the
enormity and extent of this evil may be gained from the
following quotations from a published letter of Mr.
Anthony Comstock: who has been for some time employed
by the Young Men's Christian Association in suppressing
the traffic by arresting the publishers and destroying
their goods: &mdash;
</p><p>"I have succeeded in unearthing this hydra-headed
monster in part, as you will see by the following statement,
which, in many respects, might be truthfully
increased in quantity. These I have seized and
destroyed: &mdash;
</p><p>"Obscene photographs, stereoscopic and other
pictures, more than one hundred and eighty-two thousand;
obscene books and pamphlets, more than five tons;
obscene letter-press in sheets, more than two tons;
sheets of impure songs, catalogues, handbills, etc., more
than twenty-one thousand; obscene microscopic watch
and knife charms, and finger-rings, more than five thousand;
obscene negative plates for printing photographs
and stereoscopic views, about six hundred and twenty-five; obscene engraved steel and copper plates, three
hundred and fifty; obscene lithographic stones destroyed,
twenty; obscene wood-cut engravings, more than five
hundred; stereotype plates for printing obscene books,
more than five tons; obscene transparent playing-cards,
nearly six thousand; obscene and immoral rubber arti-<pb n="182"/>
cles, over thirty thousand; lead molds for manufacturing
rubber goods, twelve sets, or more than seven hundred
pounds; newspapers seized, about four thousand six
hundred; letters from all parts of the country ordering
these goods, about fifteen thousand; names of dealers in
account-books seized, about six thousand; lists of names
in the hands of dealers, that are sold as merchandise to
forward circulars or catalogues to, independent of letters
and account-books seized, more than seven thousand.
</p><p>"These abominations are disseminated by these men
by first obtaining the names and addresses of scholars
and students in our schools and colleges, and then
forwarding circulars. They secure thousands of names in
this way, either by sending for catalogues of schools,
seminaries, and colleges, under a pretense of sending a
child to school; or else by sending out a circular
purporting to be getting up a directory of all the scholars
and students in schools and colleges in the United
States; or of taking the census of all the unmarried
people, and offering to pay five cents per name for lists so
sent. I need not say that the money is seldom or never
sent, but I do say that these names, together with those
that come in reply to advertisements, are sold to other
parties; so that when a man desires to engage in this
nefarious business, he has only to purchase a list of these
names, and then your child, be it son or daughter, is
liable to have thrust into its hands, all unknown to you,
one of these devilish catalogues.
</p><p>"Since the destruction of the stereotype plates of
old books, secret circulars have been discovered of a
notice to dealers that twelve new books are in course of
preparation, and will soon be ready for delivery."
<pb n="183"/>
</p><p>Says Hon. C. L. Merriam, as quoted by a recent
writer: "We find that the dealers in obscene literature
have organized circulating libraries, which are under the
charge of the most vicious boys in the schools, boys
chosen and paid by the venders, who circulate among
the students, at ten cents a volume, any of the one
hundred and forty-four obscene books heretofore published
in New York City."
</p><p>Largely through the influence of Mr. Comstock, laws
have been enacted which promise to do much toward
checking this extensive evil, or at least causing it to
make itself less prominent. Our newspapers still abound
with advertisements of various so-called medical works,
"Marriage Guides," etc., which are fruits of the same
"upas-tree" that Mr. Comstock has labored so faithfully
to uproot.
</p><p>Sentimental Literature. &mdash; It is a painful fact, however,
that the total annihilation of every foul book which
the law can reach will not effect the cure of this evil; for
our modern literature is full of the same virus. It is
necessarily presented in less grossly revolting forms,
half concealed by beautiful imagery, or embellished by
wit; but yet, there it is, and no law can reach it. The
works of our standard authors in literature abound in
lubricity. Popular novels have doubtless done more to
arouse a prurient curiosity in the young, and to excite
and foster passion and immorality, than even the obscene
literature for the suppression of which such active measures
have recently been taken. The more exquisitely
painted the scenes of vice, the more dangerously
enticing. Novel-reading has led thousands to lives of
dissoluteness.
<pb n="184"/>
</p><p>City and school libraries, circulating libraries, and
even Sunday-school libraries, are full of books which,
though they may contain good moral teaching, contain,
as well, an element as incompatible with purity of morals
as is light with midnight darkness. Writers for children
and youth seem to think a tale of "courtship, love, and
matrimony" entirely indispensable as a medium for conveying
their moral instruction
</p><p>"Religious Novels." &mdash; Some of these "religious novels"
are actually more pernicious than the fictions of
well-known novelists who make no pretense to having
religious instruction a particular object in view. Sunday-school libraries are not often wholly composed of this
class of works; but any one who takes the trouble to
examine the books of such a library, will be able to select
the most pernicious ones by the external appearance.
The covers will be well worn, and the edges begrimmed
with dirt from much handling. Children soon tire of the
shallow sameness which characterizes the "moral" parts
of most of these books, and skim lightly over them,
selecting and devouring with eagerness those portions
which relate the silly narrative of some love adventure.
This kind of literature arouses in children premature
fancies and queries, and fosters a sentimentalism which
too often occasions most unhappy results. Through
their influence, young girls are often led to begin a life
of shame long before their parents are aware that
a thought of evil has ever entered their minds.
</p><p>The following words from the pen of a forcible
writer[10] present this matter in none too strong a light: &mdash;


[10] T, DeWitt Talmage.

</p><p>"You may tear your coat or break a vase, and repair
<pb n="185"/>
them again; but the point where the rip or the fracture
took place will always be evident. It takes less than
an hour to do your heart a damage which no time can
entirely repair. Look carefully over your child's
library; see what book it is that he reads after he has
gone to bed, with the gas turned, upon the pillow. Do
not always take it for granted that a book is good
because it is a Sunday-school book. As far as possible,
know <hi rend="italic">who</hi> wrote it, who illustrated it, who published it,
who sold it.
</p><p>A Modern Plague. &mdash; "It seems that in the literature
of the day, the ten plagues of Egypt have returned, and
the frogs and lice have hopped and skipped over our
parlor tables.
</p><p>"Parents are delighted to have their children read,
but they should be sure as to what they read. You do
not have to walk a day or two in an infested district to
get the cholera or typhoid fever; and one wave of moral
unhealth will fever and blast the soul forever. Perhaps,
knowing not what you did, you read a bad book. Do
you not remember it altogether? &mdash; Yes; and perhaps
you will never get over it. However strong and exalted
your character, never read a bad book. By the time
you get through the first chapter, you will see the drift.
If you find the marks of the hoofs of the devil in the
picture, or in the style, or in the plot, away with it.
</p><p>"But there is more danger, I think, from many of the
family papers, published once a week, in those stories of
vice and shame, full of infamous suggestions, going as
far as they can without exposing themselves to the
clutch of the law. I name none of them; but say that
on some fashionable tables there lie `family newspapers'
that are the very vomit of the pit.
<pb n="186"/>
</p><p>"The way to ruin is cheap. It costs three dollars to
go to Philadelphia; six dollars to Boston; thirty-three
dollars to Savannah; but, by the purchase of a bad
paper for ten cents, you may get a through ticket to hell,
by express, with few stopping-places, and the final
halting like the tumbling of the lightning train down the
draw-bridge at Norwalk-sudden, terrific, deathful,
never to rise."
</p><p>Idleness. &mdash; This evil is usually combined with the
preceding. To maintain purity, the mind must be
occupied. If left without occupation, the vacuity is
quickly filled with unchaste thoughts. Nothing can be
worse for a child than to be reared in idleness. His
morals will be certain to suffer. Incessant mental
occupation is the only safeguard against unchastity.
Those worthless fops who spend their lives in "killing
time" by lounging about bar-rooms, loafing on street
corners, or strutting up and down the boulevard, are
anything but chaste. Those equally worthless young
women who waste their lives on sofas or in easy-chairs,
occupied only with some silly novel, or idling away life's
precious hours in reverie, &mdash; such creatures are seldom
the models of purity one would wish to think them.
If born with a natural propensity toward sin, such a life
would soon engender a diseased, impure imagination, if
nothing worse.
</p><p>Dress and Sensuality. &mdash; There are two ways in which
fashionable dress leads to unchastity; viz., 1. By its
extravagance; 2. By its abuse of the body.
</p><p>How does extravagance lead to unchastity? &mdash; By
creating the temptation to sin. It affects not those
gorgeously attired ladies who ride in fine carriages, and
<pb n="187"/>
live in brown-stone fronts, who are surrounded with all
the luxuries that wealth can purchase &mdash; fine apparel is
no temptation to such. But to less favored, though not
less worthy ones, these magnificent displays of millinery
goods and fine trappings are most powerful temptations.
The poor seamstress, who can earn by diligent toil
hardly enough to pay her board bill, has no legitimate
way by which to deck herself with the finery she
admires. Plainly dressed as she must be if she remains
honest and retains her virtue, she is scornfully ignored
by her proud sisters. Everywhere she finds it a generally
recognized fact that "dress makes the lady." On the
street, no one steps aside to let her pass, no one stoops to
regain for her the package that slips from her weary
hands. Does she enter a crowded car? No one offers
her a seat, though she is trembling with fatigue, while
the showily dressed woman who follows her is accommodated
at once. She marks the difference; she does
not pause to count the cost, but barters away her self-respect to gain the respect, or deference, of strangers.
</p><p>How Young Women Fall. &mdash; It has been authoritatively
stated that there are, in our large cities, hundreds
of young women who, being able to earn barely enough
to buy food and fuel and pay the rent of a dismal attic,
take the advice offered by their employers, "Get some
gentleman friend to dress you for your company."
Others spend all their small earnings to keep themselves
"respectably" dressed, and share the board and lodgings
of some young <hi rend="italic">rou&eacute;</hi> as heartless as incontinent. Persons
unaccustomed to city life, and thousands of people in
the very heart of our great metropolis, have no conception
of the frightful prevalence of this kind of prostitu-<pb n="188"/>
tion. Young women go to our large cities as pure as
snow. They find no lucrative employment. Daily
contact with vice obtunds their first abhorrence of it.
Gradually it becomes familiar. A fancied life of ease
presents allurements to a hard-worked sewing-girl.
Fine clothes and comfortable lodgings increase the
temptation. She yields, and barters her body for a home
without the trouble of a marriage ceremony.
</p><p>Wealthy women could do more to cure the "social
evil" by adopting plain attire, than all the civil
authorities by passing license laws or regulating ordinances.
Have not Christian women a duty here? A few years
ago, some Nashville ladies made a slight move in the
right direction, as is indicated in the following paragraph;
but we have not heard that their example has been followed: &mdash;
</p><p>"The lady members of the First Baptist Church, of
Nashville, Tenn., have agreed that they will dispense
with all finery on Sunday, wearing no jewels but consistency,
and hereafter appear at church in plain calico
dresses."
</p><p>A more radical reform would have been an extension
of the salutary measure to all other days of the week as
well as Sunday; though we see no reason for restricting
the material of clothing to calico, which might, indeed,
be rather insufficient for some seasons of the year.
</p><p>Fashion and Vice. &mdash; Let us glance at another way
in which dress lends its influence to vice, by obstructing
the normal functions of the body. 1. Fashion requires
a woman to compress her waist with bands or corsets.
In consequence, the circulation of the blood toward the
heart is obstructed. The venous blood is crowded back
<pb n="189"/>
into the delicate organs of generation. Congestion
ensues, and with it, through reflex action, the unnatural
excitement of the animal propensities. 2. The manner of
wearing the clothing, suspending several heavy garments
from the hips, increases the same difficulty by bringing
too large a share of clothing where it is least needed,
thus generating unnatural local heat. 3. The custom of
clothing the feet and limbs so thinly that they are
exposed to constant chilling, by still further unbalancing
the circulation, adds another element to increase
the local mischief.
</p><p>All these causes combined, operating almost
constantly, &mdash; with others that might be mentioned, &mdash; produce
permanent local congestion, with ovarian and
uterine derangements. The latter affections have long
been recognized as the chief pathological condition in
hysteria, and especially in that peculiar form of disease
known as <hi rend="italic">nymphomania</hi>, under the excitement of which
a young woman, naturally chaste and modest, may be
impelled to the commission of the most wanton acts.
The pernicious influence of fashionable dress in occasioning
this disorder cannot be doubted.
</p><p>Reform in Dress Needed. &mdash; The remedy for these
evils, the only way to escape them, is reformation. The
dress must be so adjusted to the body that every organ
will be allowed free movement. No corset, band, belt,
or other means of constriction, should impede the circulation.
Garments should be suspended from the shoulders
by means of a waist, or by proper suspenders. The
limbs should be as warmly clad as any other portion of
the body. How best to secure these requirements of
health may be learned from several excellent works on
<pb n="190"/>
dress reform, any of which can be readily obtained of
the publishers of this work or their agents.
</p><p>Fashionable Dissipation. &mdash; The influence of so
important an agent for evil in this direction as fashionable
dissipation, cannot be ignored. By fashionable dissipation
we mean that class of excesses in the indulgence in
which certain classes, usually the more wealthy or
aristocratic, pride themselves. Among this class of persons
a man who is known to be a common drunkard would
not be recognized; such a person would be carefully
shunned; yet a total abstainer would be avoided with
almost equal care, and would be regarded as a fanatic or
an extremist at least. With this class, wine-drinking is
considered necessary as a matter of propriety. Along
with wine are taken a great variety of highly seasoned
foods, spices, and condiments in profusion, with rich
meats and all sorts of delicacies, rich desserts, etc.,
which can hardly be considered much less harmful than
stimulants of a more generally recognized character.
</p><p>These indulgences excite that part of the system
which generally needs restraint rather than stimulation.
A participant, an ex-governor, recently described to us a
grand political dinner given in honor of a noted American
citizen, which began at 5 P. M. and continued until
nearly midnight, continuous courses of food, wines, etc.,
being served for nearly six hours. Similar scenes have
been enacted in a score of our large cities for the same
ostensible purpose. Knowing that public men are
addicted to such gormandizing on numerous occasions, we
do not wonder that so many of them are men of loose
morals.</p>
<pb n="191"/>
<p>The Influence of Luxury. &mdash; The tendency of luxury
is toward demoralization. Rome never became dissipated
and corrupt until her citizens became wealthy, and
adopted luxurious modes of living. Nothing is more
conducive to sound morals than full occupation of the mind
with useful labor. Fashionable idleness is a foe to
virtue. The young man or the young woman who
wastes the precious hours of life in listless dreaming, or
in that sort of senseless twaddle which forms the bulk of
the conversation in some circles, is in very great danger
of demoralization. Many of the usages and customs of
fashionable society seem to open the door to vice, and
to insidiously, and at first unconsciously, lead the young
and inexperienced away from the paths of purity and
virtue. There is good evidence that the amount of
immorality among what are known as the higher classes,
is every year increasing. Every now and then a scandal
in high life comes to the surface; but the great mass
of corruption is effectually hidden from the general
public. Open profligacy is of course frowned upon in
all respectable circles; and yet wealth and accomplishments
will cover a multitude of sins.
</p><p>This freedom allowed to the vile and vicious is one
of the worst features of fashionable society. Such
persons carry about them a moral atmosphere more deadly
than the dreaded upas-tree.
</p><p>Round Dances. &mdash; Whatever apologies may be offered
for other forms of the dance as a means of exercise under
certain restrictions, employed as a form of calisthenics,
no such excuse can be framed in defense of "round
dances," especially of the waltz. In addition to the
associated dissipation, late hours, fashionable dressing,
midnight feasting, exposures through excessive exertions,
<pb n="192"/>
improper dress, etc., it can be shown most clearly
that dancing has a direct influence in stimulating the
passions, and provoking unchaste desires, which too
often lead to unchaste acts, and are in themselves
violations of the requirements of strict morality, and
productive of injury to both mind and body.
</p><p>Said the renowned Petrarch, "The dance is the spur
of lust, &mdash; a circle of which the devil himself is the
center. Many women that use it have come dishonest
home, most indifferent, none better."
</p><p>A Woman's View of Dancing. &mdash; We quote the following
from a letter written to a friend by a woman
of great ability and strength of mind, of unblemished
character and national reputation, and in response to his
request for her opinion of the dance. The statements
made in this remarkable letter are so clear and convincing
that every parent ought to read it: &mdash;
</p><p>"I will venture to lay bare a young girl's heart and
mind by giving my own experience in the days when I
waltzed.
</p><p>"In those days I cared little for Polka or Varsovienne,
and still less for the old-fashioned `Money Musk' or
`Virginia Reel,' and wondered what people could find to
admire in those `slow dances.' But in the soft floating
of the waltz I found a strange pleasure, rather difficult
to intelligibly describe. The mere anticipation fluttered
my pulse, and when my partner approached to claim my
promised hand for the dance, I felt my cheeks glow a
little sometimes, and I could not look him in the eyes
with the same frank gayety as heretofore.
</p><p>"I am speaking openly and frankly, and when I say
that I did not understand what I felt, or what were the
<pb n="193"/>
real and greatest pleasures I derived from this so-called
dancing, I expect to be believed. But if my cheeks
grew red with uncomprehended pleasure then, they grow
pale with shame to-day when I think of it all. It was
the physical emotions engendered by the contact of
strong men that I was enamored of, &mdash; not of the dance,
nor even of the men themselves.
</p><p>"Girls talk to each other. I was still a school-girl,
although mixing so much with the world. We talked
together. We read romances that fed our romantic
passions on seasoned food, and none but ourselves knew
what subjects we discussed. Had our parents heard us,
they would have considered us on the high road to ruin.
</p><p>"Yet we had been taught that it was right to dance;
our parents did it, our friends did it, and we were
permitted. I will say also that all the girls with whom I
associated, with the exception of one, had much the same
experience in dancing.
</p><p>"Married now, with home and children around me,
I can at least thank God for the experience which will
assuredly be the means of preventing my little daughters
from indulging in any such dangerous pleasure.
</p><p>"I doubt if my experience will be of much service,
but it is the candid truth, from a woman who, in the
cause of all the young girls who may be contaminated,
desires to show just to what extent a young mind may
be defiled by the injurious effects of round dances. I
have not hesitated to lay bare what are a young girl's
most secret thoughts, in the hope that people will stop
and consider, at least, before handing their lilies of
purity over to the arms of any one who may choose to
blow the frosty breath of dishonor on their petals."
<pb n="194"/>
</p><p>Much more might be added on this important subject,
would the limits of this work allow; but this must
suffice. We beg the reader to consider carefully and
prayerfully the facts presented before deciding that
dancing is so harmless as many persons suppose.
</p><p>Physical Causes of Unchastity. &mdash; Some of the physical
causes of impurity in women have been previously
referred to, since it is through physical injuries that
unhealthful clothing exerts its influence. Too little is
generally known of the intimate connection between
physical and mental conditions. Doubtless, many vices
originate in physical imperfections. Indeed, when the
full bearing of physical influences upon the mind is
allowed, it is difficult to avoid pleading extenuating
circumstances in the cases of the greater share of
transgressors of both moral and civil laws. This principle is
especially applicable to sexual relations.
</p><p>In males, one of the most general physical causes of
sexual excitement is <hi rend="italic">constipation</hi>. The vesicula seminalis,
in which the seminal fluid is stored, is situated, as will
be remembered, at the base of the bladder. It thus has
the bladder in front and the rectum behind. In constipation,
the rectum becomes distended with feces &mdash; effete
matter which should have been promptly evacuated, instead
of being allowed to accumulate. This hardened
mass presses upon the parts most intimately concerned
in the sexual act, causing excessive local excitement.
When this condition is chronic, as in habitual constipation,
the unnatural excitement often leads to most serious
results. One of these is the production of a horrible
disease, <hi rend="italic">satyriasis</hi>, the nature of which has been
previously indicated.</p>
<pb n="195"/>
<p><hi rend="italic">Constipation</hi> in females has the same tendency, though
the dangers are not quite so great. The irritation is
sufficient, however, to lead to excitement of the passions.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Intestinal worms</hi> often produce the same result in
children.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Local uncleanliness</hi> is another very frequent cause
which is often overlooked. The natural local secretions
quickly become a source of great irritation if not removed
by daily washing. Certain anatomical peculiarities
sometimes exist in the male, which greatly aggravate
this difficulty, and for which circumcision, or an equivalent
operation, is the remedy.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Irritation of the bladder</hi>, producing incontinence of
urine, is another enemy to chastity. It should receive
prompt attention and treatment. In children, this
irritability is indicated by wetting of the bed at night.
In cases of this kind, allow the child little drink in the
latter portion of the day. See that the bladder is
emptied just before he goes to bed. Wake him once
or twice during the night, and have him urinate. Use all
possible means to remove the cause of irritation by
giving him plenty of out-of-door exercise and a very
simple, though nutritious, diet. Avoid meat, eggs, and
condiments.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Leucorrh&oelig;a</hi> is a cause as well as a result of unchastity
in females. The discharge produces abnormal excitement,
and attracts the attention of the individual to the
parts, causing relief to be sought by rubbing, and thus
still further excitement is provoked, and all evil practice
begun.
</p><p>Modern Modes of Life. &mdash; Aside from all the causes
already enumerated, there are many other conditions
<pb n="196"/>
and circumstances, the result of modern habits of living,
that tend directly toward the excitement of sensuality.
Superheated rooms, sedentary employments, the development
of the mental and nervous organizations at the
expense of the muscular, the cramming system in schools,
too long confinement of school-children in a sitting
position, the allowance of too great freedom between the
sexes in the young, the demoralizing influence of many
varieties of public amusement, balls, church fairs, and
other like influences too numerous to mention, all tend
in the one direction, that of abnormal excitation and
precocious development of the sexual functions.
</p><p>It is not an exaggeration to say that for one conforming
to modern modes of living, eating, sleeping, and
drinking, absolute chastity is next to an absolute
impossibility. This would certainly be true without a special
interposition of Providence; but Providence never works
miracles to obviate the results of voluntary sin.
</p><p>Nervous Irritability. &mdash; One of the results of the fast
life led by the majority of persons in civilized countries,
is the production of what has been denominated the <hi rend="italic">neurotic
temperament</hi>, a condition in which the nervous system
is unduly active and excitable. This condition is always
accompanied by a deficiency of nerve tone. This means
that the nerve centers which control the various functions
of the body are more excitable and less under control of
the will and other dominating and governing centers
than in health. The consequence of this condition is a
tendency to irregularity in the activity of the various
vital functions, especially an exaggeration of the activity
of those functions which are particularly called out by
the emotions and propensities. This depraved condition
<pb n="197"/>
of the body constitutes a physical bias in the direction of
vice and crime of all sorts. All the violent passions, such
as irritability of temper and sensuality, are more readily
excited to activity, and when in action, are more intense
than in a healthy individual. This lowered nerve tone
is also accompanied by a lowered mental tone, and a
corresponding lowering of moral tone; so that while the
propensities are unnaturally strong, the will by which
they should be controlled is unusually weak. This state
of things renders the individual an easy prey to vice,
and particularly to that most overmastering of all the
passions, sensuality. From this same morbid condition
comes a growing tendency to the drink habit, and the
ready acquirement of the use of tobacco and other
narcotics, which in turn steadily increase the morbid
condition referred to, and thus accelerate the tendency in the
direction of sensuality and vice.
</p><p>This tendency among civilized people is to be
combated by having greater attention given to health culture;
to the training of the muscles by thorough and systematic
gymnastic exercise; to the connection of manual labor
and manual training departments with our educational
institutions; and to the encouragement of agricultural
and other forms of muscular employment. The mind
need not be trained less, but the body, more. Indeed,
a better kind of mental discipline would prove one of the
most effective means of checking the development of this
morbid tendency. Self-control and self-discipline should
be cultivated from the earliest period in the education
of every child.
</p><p>It is indisputable that sexual vices are far less prevalent
among those barbarous tribes who live much in the
<pb n="198"/>
open air and obtain their sustenance by such arduous
means as hunting and the gathering of the meager
products of the forest and the untilled soil, than among
civilized people; and it is also a fact that among civilized
people, sensuality is far more prevalent with the
nervous, excitable classes &mdash; those who are inferiorly
developed physically, and whose occupations are not
laborious &mdash; than among the agricultural population, and
other classes whose occupation calls for vigorous exercise
of the muscles. The most effective method of antagonizing
vice among these classes, is to improve their condition
physically, and to give muscular employments to antidote
the tendency in their constitutions by which they become
dangerous to the moral health of the community.</p>

<head>THE SOCIAL EVIL.</head>

<p>Illicit intercourse has been a common vice of
humanity from the earliest period of history. At the present
moment, it is a loathsome ulcer, eating at the heart of
civilization; a malignant leprosy, which shows its hideous
deformities amidst the fairest results of modern culture.
Our large cities abound with dens of vice whose <hi rend="italic">habitu&eacute;s</hi>
shamelessly promenade the most public streets, and
flaunt their infamy in the face of every passer-by. In
many large cities, especially in those of Continental
Europe, these holds of vice are placed under the
supervision of the law by the requirement that every keeper
of a house of prostitution must pay a license; in
other words, must buy the right to lead his fellow-men
"down to the lowest depths of hell."
</p><p>In small cities, as well as in large ones, in fact, from
the great metropolis down to the country village, the
haunts of vice are found. Every army is flanked by
bands of courtesans. Wherever men go, loose women
follow, penetrating even to the wildness of the miner's
camp, far beyond the verge of civilization.
</p><p>But brothels and traveling strumpets do not fully
represent the vast extent of this monster evil. There is
a class of immoral women &mdash; probably exceeding in numbers
the grosser class just referred to &mdash; who consider
themselves respectable, indeed, who are so considered by
the public. Few are acquainted with their character.
They live in elegant style, and mingle in genteel society.
Privately, they prosecute the most unbounded licentiousness,
for the purpose of gain, or merely to gratify their
<pb n="200"/>
lewdness. "Kept mistresses" are much more numerous
than common prostitutes.
</p><p>The numerous scandal and divorce suits which expose
the infidelity of husbands and wives, are sufficient
evidence that illicit commerce is not confined to the
unmarried; but so many are the facilities for covering
and preventing the results of sins of this description that
it is impossible to form any just estimate of their
frequency. The incontinence of husbands and the unchastity
of wives will only appear in their enormity at that
awful day when every one shall "stand before the
judgment-seat," and receive the penalty of his guilty
deeds.
</p><p>Unchastity in Ancient Times. &mdash; We would fain
believe the present to be the most licentious age the
world has ever known; that in the nineteenth century
the climax of evil has been reached; that the libidinous
blood of all ages has culminated to produce a race of
men more carnal than all their predecessors. It is a
sickening thought that any previous epoch could have been
more vile than this; but history presents facts which
disclose in ancient times periods when lust was even more
uncontrolled than now; when vice was universal; and
when virtue was a thing unknown. A few references
to historical facts will establish this point. We do not
make these allusions in any way to justify the present
immorality, but to show the part which vice has acted
in the overthrow of nations.
</p><p>From the Sacred Record we may judge that before
the flood, a state of corruption prevailed which was even
greater and more general than any that has ever since
been reached; only eight persons were fit to survive the
<pb n="201"/>
calamity which swept into eternity that lustful generation
with their filthy deeds.
</p><p>But men soon fell into vice again; for we find among
the early Assyrians a total disregard of chastity. Their
kings reveled in the grossest sensuality.
</p><p>No excess of vice could surpass the licentiousness of
the Ptolemies, who made of Alexandria a bagnio, and all
Egypt a hot-bed of vice. Herodotus relates that "the
pyramid of Cheops was built by the lovers of the daughter
of this king; and that she never would have raised
this monument to such a hight except by multiplying her
prostitutions." History also relates the adventures of
that queenly courtesan, Cleopatra, who captivated and
seduced by her charms two masters of the world, and
whose lewdness surpassed even her beauty.
</p><p>Tyre and Sidon, Media, Ph&oelig;nicia, Syria, and all the
Orient were sunk in sensuality. Fornication was made
a part of their worship. Women carried through the
streets of the cities the most obscene and revolting
representations. Among all these nations a virtuous woman
was not to be found; for, according to Herodotus, the
young women were by the laws of the land "obliged,
once in their lives, to give themselves up to the desires of
strangers in the temple of Venus, and were not permitted
to refuse any one."[11]


[11] Bourgeois.

</p><p>St. Augustine speaks of these religious debaucheries
as still practiced in his day in Ph&oelig;nicia. They were
even continued until Constintine destroyed the temples
in which they were prosecuted, in the fourth century.
</p><p>Among the Greeks the same corruptions prevailed in
the worship of Bacchus and Phallus, which was cele-<pb n="202"/>
brated by processions of half-nude girls "performing
lascivious dances with men disguised as satyrs." In
fact, as X. Bourgeois says, "Prostitution was in repute
in Greece." The most distinguished women were courtesans,
and the wise Socrates would be justly called, in
modern times, a libertine.
</p><p>The abandonment to lust was, if possible, still more
complete in the times of the Roman emperors. Rome
astonished the universe "by the boldness of its turpitudes,
after having astonished it by the splendor of its
triumphs."
</p><p>The great C&aelig;sar was such a rake that he has been
said to have "merited to be surnamed every woman's
husband." Antony and Augustus were equally notorious.
The same sensuality pervaded the masses as reigned in
the courts, and was stimulated by the erotic poems of
Ovid, Catullus, and other poets of the time.
</p><p>Tiberius displayed such ingenuity in inventing
refinements in impudicity that it was necessary to coin
new words to designate them. Caligula committed the
horrid crime of incest with all his sisters, even in public.
His palace was a brothel. The Roman empress,
Messalina, disguised herself as a prostitute, and excelled
the most degraded courtesans in her monstrous debaucheries.
The Roman emperor, Vitellius, was accustomed
to take an emetic after having eaten to repletion, to
enable him to renew his gluttony. With still grosser
sensuality he stimulated his satiated passions with philters
and various aphrodisiac mixtures.
</p><p>Nero, the most infamous of the emperors, committed
rapes on the stage of the public theaters of Rome,
disguised as a wild beast.
<pb n="203"/>
</p><p>If this degraded voluptuousness had been confined to
royalty, some respect might yet be entertained for the
virtue of the ancients; but the foul infection was not
restrained within such narrow bounds. It invaded
whole empires until they fell in pieces from very rottenness.
</p><p>In the thirteenth century, virtue was almost as scarce
in France as in ancient Greece. Nobles held as
mistresses all the young girls of their domains. About
every fifth person was a bastard. Just before the
Revolution, chastity was such a rarity that, according to
one writer, a woman was actually obliged to apologize
for being virtuous!
</p><p>In these disgusting facts we find one of the most
potent agents in effecting the downfall of the nations.
Licentiousness sapped their vitality and weakened their
prowess. The men who conquered the world were led
captive by their own beastly passions. Thus the
Assyrians, the Medes, the Grecians, the Romans, successively
fell victims to their lusts, and gave way to more
virtuous successors. Even the Jews, the most enlightened
people of their age, fell more than once through
this same sin, coupled with idolatry, of which their
seduction by the Midianites is an example.
</p><p>Surely, modern times present no worse spectacles of
carnality than these; and will it be claimed that anything
so vile is seen among civilized nations at the present
day? But though there may be less grossness in the
sensuality of to-day, the moral turpitude of men may be
even greater than that of ancient times. Enlightened
Christianity has raised the standard of morality. Christ's
commentary upon the seventh commandment requires
<pb n="204"/>
a more rigorous chastity than ancient standards
demanded, even among the Jews; for had not David,
Solomon, and even the pious Jacob more wives than
one? Consequently, a slight breach of chastity now
requires as great a fall from virtue as a greater lapse in
ages past, and must be attended with as severe a moral
penalty.
</p><p>State of Modern Society. &mdash; But we are not quite
certain that the condition of modern society as regards
chastity is much superior to that of periods of the
world to which reference has been made. While on
a tour through Europe, a few years ago, the author
took some pains to gather facts upon this point from
various authentic sources, and was amazed at the
enormous prevalence of sexual crimes in the great and
oldest centers of modern civilization. In Paris, the
places of amusement and public resort are thronged
with brazen courtesans, watching for victims; and in
the numerous picture shops which line the <hi rend="italic">Rue de Rivoli</hi>,
the most obscene pictures and photographs are exposed
for sale, with almost no attempt at secrecy. In Stockholm,
the government statistics show more than forty
per cent of all the births to be illegitimate, and in
Vienna the state of morals is no better, and venereal
diseases are so nearly universal that a physician of
wide acquaintance with the inhabitants of this great
German metropolis, has declared that three-fourths of
the entire population are syphilized.
</p><p>In Naples, lasciviousness stalks abroad at all
hours of the day and night. Women sell their souls
for a few farthings, and the debauched people vie
with one another in imitating the horrible obscenities
<pb n="205"/>
and sexual sins of the Roman Sodom and Gomorrah &mdash;
Pompeii and Herculaneum &mdash; and that with the terrible
judgment which fell upon these dens of iniquity daily
before their eyes, while just above them still towers the
stern old Vesuvius, from whose fiery bowels were in
olden times poured out the vials of Almighty wrath,
and in which are still heard the mutterings of a day
of wrath sure to come.
</p><p>The Pall Mall Gazette Exposures. &mdash; In London, the
boasted "center of modern civilization," the number of
women who are leading lives of shame and ignominy
is sufficiently great to people a large city or a small
province. In no city are the signs of vice and ignorance
more plainly seen than in the metropolis of the
world. Within a few weeks of the present writing,
the whole of Christendom has been more than startled
by the horrible revelations of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>,
a few extracts from which will give the reader an
opportunity to form something of an idea of the ghastly
exhibition of worse than beastly sensuality which stands
at the very center of modern culture and civilization, and
according to the reports referred to, is even fostered by
princes and royal personages, as well as the professional
libertine and wealthy debauchee.

            "THE MAIDEN TRIBUTE OF MODERN BABYLON.

</p><p>"In ancient times, if we may believe the myths
of Hellas, Athens, after a disastrous campaign, was
compelled by her conqueror to send once every nine
years a tribute to Crete of seven youths and seven
maidens. The doomed fourteen, who were selected by
lot amid the lamentations of the citizens, returned no
<pb n="206"/>
more. The vessel that bore them to Crete unfurled
black sails as the symbol of despair, and on arrival, her
passengers were flung into the famous Labyrinth of
D&aelig;dalus, there to wander about blindly until such time
as they were devoured by the Minotaur, a frightful
monster, half man, half bull, the foul product of an
unnatural lust. `The labyrinth was as large as a town,
and had countless courts and galleries. Those who
entered it could never find their way out again. If they
hurried from one to another of the numberless rooms,
looking for the entrance door, it was all in vain. They
only became more hopelessly lost in the bewildering
labyrinth, until at last they were devoured by the Minotaur.'
</p><p>"Twice, at each ninth year, the Athenians paid
the maiden tribute to King Minos, lamenting sorely the
dire necessity of bowing to his iron law. When the
third tribute came to be exacted, the distress of the
city of the Violet Crown was insupportable. From the
King's palace to the peasant's hamlet, everywhere were
heard cries and groans and the choking sob of despair,
until the whole air seemed to vibrate with the sorrow
of an unutterable anguish. Then it was that the hero
Theseus volunteered to be offered up among those who
drew the black balls from the brazen urn of destiny, and
the story of his self-sacrifice, his victory, and his
triumphant return, is among the most familiar of the tales
which, since the childhood of the world, have kindled
the imagination and fired the heart of the human race.
The labyrinth was cunningly wrought like a house, says
Ovid, with many rooms and winding passages, that so
the shameful creature of lust, whose abode it was to be,
<pb n="207"/>
should be far removed from sight. And what happened
to the victims &mdash; the young men and maidens &mdash; who were
there interned, no one could surely tell. Some say that
they were done to death; others that they lived in
servile employments to old age. But in this alone do
all the stories agree, that those who were once caught in
the coils, could never retrace their steps, so `inextricable'
were the paths, so `blind' the footsteps, so `innumerable'
the ways of wrong-doing.
</p><p>"The fact that the Athenians should have taken so
bitterly to heart the paltry maiden tribute that once in
nine years they had to pay to the Minotaur, seems
incredible, almost inconceivable. This very night in London,
and every night, year in and year out, not seven
maidens only, but many times seven, selected almost as
much by chance as those who in the Athenian market-place drew lots as to which should be flung into the
Cretan labyrinth, will be offered up as the Maiden Tribute
of Modern Babylon. Maidens they were when this
morning dawned, but to-night their ruin will be accomplished,
and to-morrow they will find themselves within
the portals of the maze of London brotheldom. Within
that labyrinth wander, like lost souls, the vast host of
London prostitutes, whose number no man can compute,
but who are probably not much below 50,000 strong.
Many, no doubt, who venture but a little way within
the maze, make their escape. But multitudes are swept
irresistibly on and on, to be destroyed in due season, to
give place to others, who also will share their doom.
The maw of the London Minotaur is insatiable, and none
that go into the secret recesses of his lair return again.
After some years of dolorous wandering in this palace of
<pb n="208"/>
despair, &mdash; for `hope of rest to solace there is none, nor
e'en of milder pang,' save the poisonous anodyne of
drink, &mdash; most of those insnared to-night will perish,
some of them in horrible torture. Yet, so far from this
great city's being convulsed with woe, London cares for
none of these things, and the cultured man of the world,
the heir of all the ages, the ultimate product of a long
series of civilizations and religions, will shrug his
shoulders in scorn at the folly of any one who ventures
in public print to raise even the mildest protest against
a horror a thousand times more horrible than that which
in the youth of the world, haunted like a nightmare the
imagination of mankind."
</p><p>The writer in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> classifies the
crimes exposed by the investigation as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>1. The sale and purchase and violation of children.
</p><p>2. The procuration of virgins.
</p><p>3. The entrapping and ruin of women.
</p><p>4. The internal slave trade in girls.
</p><p>5. Atrocities, brutalities, and unnatural crimes.
</p><p>The writer details numerous cases in which girls
varying in age from eleven to fifteen were purchased for
immoral purposes at prices ranging from a sovereign to
several pounds. In most of these cases, the children
were wholly unaware of the nature of the transaction,
and were procured for wealthy and worn-out debauchees,
some of whom were willing to pay as high as &pound;20 or
&pound;30 for a "good mark," which means, in the language
of the London brothel, a good-looking little girl.
</p><p>The revelations made by the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, and confirmed
by the investigation which followed the disclosure,
indicate that this business is carried on in London on a very
<pb n="209"/>
large scale, thousands of little girls being annually
enticed from home for immoral purposes, or purchased
from drunken fathers and mothers, who never inquire
concerning their whereabouts after they are out of their
sight. The horrible fact was also elicited by investigation
that there are persons in London who make a regular
business of rearing girls for the brothel market. The
atrocities practiced upon them are too horrible for
description in a work like this, but it would be well for
mothers to read carefully the following paragraph from
the <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>: &mdash;
</p><p>"The Responsibility of Mothers. &mdash; The ignorance of
these girls is almost incredible. It is one of the greatest
scandals of Protestant training that parents are allowed
to keep their children in total ignorance of the simplest
truths of physiology, without even a rudimentary
conception of the nature of sexual morality. Catholic children
are much better trained; and whatever may be the case
in other countries, the chastity of Catholic girls is much
greater than that of Protestants in the same social strata.
Owing to the soul-and-body-destroying taciturnity of
Protestant mothers, girls often arrive at the age of legal
womanhood in total ignorance, and are turned loose to
contend with all the wiles of the procuress and the
temptations of the seducer without the most elementary
acquaintance with the laws of their own existence.
<hi rend="italic">Experientia docet</hi>; but in this case the first experience
is too often that of violation. Even after the act has
been consummated, all that they know is that they got
badly hurt; but they think of it and speak of it exactly
in the same way as if it meant no more for them than
the pulling out of a tooth. Even more than the scandal-<pb n="210"/>
ous state of the law, the culpable refusal of mothers to
explain to their daughters the realities and the dangers
of their existence, contributes to fill the brothels of
London."
</p><p>The committee appointed to investigate the charges
of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, which included Cardinal Manning,
Archbishop of Canterbury, and other eminent gentlemen,
reported as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"After carefully sifting the evidence of witnesses,
and the material before us, and without guaranteeing
the accuracy of every particular, we are satisfied that,
taken as a whole, the statements in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>
on this question are substantially true."
</p><p>Nor are these terrible practices confined to the Old
World. Any one who is at all acquainted with the police
records of our large cities, must be fully aware of the
fact that crimes approximately as enormous in extent, if
not fully as great, are perpetrated constantly in New
York and other great American cities. In her address
presented at the eleventh annual meeting of the National
Woman's Christian Temperance Union, held at Philadelphia,
Miss Frances E. Willard, the President of that
great organization, in dwelling upon the need of an active
department for the suppression of the social evil,
remarked as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"The effect upon our minds of such unspeakable
disclosures as those of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi>, and the
horrible assurances given us by such authority as Dr.
Elizabeth Blackwell, that we should uncap perdition in
the same direction were the hidden life of our own great
cities known, has so stirred the heart of womanhood
throughout this land? that we are, I trust, ready for an
<pb n="211"/>
advance. Had we to-day the right woman in this place
of unequaled need and opportunity, we could be instrumental
in the passage of such laws as would punish the
outrage of defenseless girls and women by making the
repetition of such outrage an impossibility. Women
only can induce lawmakers to furnish this most availing
of all possible methods of protection to the physically
weak. Men alone will never gain the courage thus to
legislate against other men. Crimes against women
seem to be upon the increase everywhere. Three years
ago the Chicago <hi rend="italic">Inter Ocean</hi> gathered from the press in
three weeks, forty cases of the direst outrage, sixteen of
the victims being girls. In a majority of cases, where
the gentler sex is thus hunted to its ruin, or lured to the
same pit in a more gradual way, strong drink is the
devil's kindling-wood of passion, as everybody knows.
Hence the relation of this most sacred work to that of
the W. C. T. U. is so close that the press, through some
of its noblest representatives, has, in the last year,
appealed to us to ignore the tempted and the fallen of
our own sex no longer. It is not by the vain attempt
to re-introduce the exploded harem method of secluding
women that they are to be saved. It is rather by holding
men to the same standard of morality which, happily
for us, they long ago prescribed for the physically
weaker, that society shall rise to higher levels, and by
punishing with extreme penalties such men as inflict
upon women atrocities compared with which death would
be infinitely welcome. When we remember the
unavenged murder of Jennie Cramer, of New Haven, and
the acquittal of the ravishers of Emma Bond, a cultivated
school-teacher of Illinois; when we reflect that the <hi rend="italic">Pall
<pb n="212"/>
Mall Gazette</hi> declares `the law is framed to enable
dissolute men to outrage girls of thirteen with impunity;'
that in Massachusetts and Vermont it is a greater crime
to steal a cow than to abduct and ruin a girl; and that
in Illinois; seduction is not recognized as a crime, it is a
marvel not to be explained, that we go on the even tenor
of our way, too delicate, too refined, too prudish to make
any allusion to these awful facts, much less to take up
arms against these awful crimes.
</p><p>"We have been the victims of conventional cowardice
too long. Let us signalize the second century of
temperance reform by a fearless avowal of our purpose to
take up the work of promoting social purity by the
inculcation of right principles, and the serious demand for
more equitable laws."
</p><p>We have seen how universal is the social evil,
that it is a vice almost as old as man himself, which
shows how deeply rooted in his perverted nature it has
become. The inquiry arises, What are the causes of so
monstrous a vice, so gross an outrage upon nature's
laws, so withering a blight upon the race?
</p><p>Causes of the Social Evil. &mdash; A vice that has be
come so great an evil, even in these enlightened times,
as to defy the most skillful legislation, which openly
displays its gaudy filthiness, and mocks at virtue with a
lecherous stare, must have its origin in causes too
powerful to be ignored.
</p><p>Precocious Sexuality. &mdash; The causes of a too early
development of sexual peculiarities, as manifested in
infantile flirtations and early signs of sexual passion,
were dwelt upon quite fully in a previous connection,
and we need not repeat them here. Certain it is that
<pb n="213"/>
few things can be more dangerous to virtue than the
premature development of those sentiments which belong
only to puberty and later years. It is a most
unnatural, but not uncommon, sight to see a girl of
tender age evincing all those characteristics which mark
the wanton of older years.
</p><p>Man's Lewdness. &mdash; It cannot be denied that men are
in the greatest degree responsible for the social evil.
The general principle holds true here as elsewhere, that
the supply is regulated by the demand. If the patrons
of prostitution should withdraw their support by a
sudden acquisition of virtue, how soon would this vilest
of traffics cease! The inmates of brothels would
themselves become continent, if not virtuous, as the result of
such a spasm of chastity in men.
</p><p>Again, the ranks of fallen women, which are rapidly
thinned by loathsome diseases and horrid deaths, are
largely recruited from that class of unfortunates for
whose fall faithless lovers or cunning, heartless libertines
are chiefly responsible. The weak girl who, through
too much trust, has been deceived and robbed of her
dearest treasure, is disowned by relatives, shunned by
her acquaintances, and turned out upon a cold world
without money, without friends, without a character.
What can she do? Respectable employment she cannot
find; for rumor follows her. There seems to be but one
door open, the one which she herself so unintentionally
opened. In despair, she enters the "open road to hell,"
and to her first sad error adds a life of shame. Meanwhile,
the villain who betrayed her maintains his standing
in society, and plies his arts to win other victims.
Is there not an unfair discrimination here? Should not
<pb n="214"/>
the seducer be blackened with an infamy at least as
deep as that which society casts upon the one betrayed?
</p><p>Fashion. &mdash; The temptation of dress, fine clothing,
costly jewelry, and all the extravagances in which rich
ladies array themselves, is in many cases too powerful
for the weakened virtue of poor seamstresses, operatives,
and servant girls, who have seen so much of vice as to
lose that instinctive loathing for it which they may have
once experienced. Thinking to gain a life of ease, with
means to gratify their love of show, they barter away
their peace of mind for this world, all hope for the next,
and only gain a little worthless tinsel, the scorn of their
fellow-creatures, and a host of loathsome diseases.
</p><p>Lack of Early Training. &mdash; It is needless to demonstrate
a fact so well established as that the future character
of an individual depends very largely upon his
early training. If purity and modesty are taught from
earliest infancy, the mind is fortified against the assaults
of vice. If, instead, the child is allowed to grow up
untrained, if the seeds of vice which are sure to fall
sooner or later in the most carefully kept ground, are
allowed to germinate, if the first buds of evil are allowed
to grow and unfold, instead of being promptly nipped, it
must not be considered remarkable that in later years
rank weeds of sin should flourish in the soul, and bear
their hideous fruit in shameless lives.
</p><p>Neglect to guard the avenues by which evil may
approach the young mind, and to erect barriers against
vice by careful instruction and a chaste example, leaves
many innocent souls open to the assaults of evil, and an
easy prey to lust. If children are allowed to get their
training in the street, at the corner grocery, or hovering
<pb n="215"/>
around saloons, they will be sure to develop a vigorous
growth of the animal passions. The following extract
is from the writings of one whose pen has been an
inestimable blessing to American youth: &mdash;
</p><p>"Among the first lessons which boys learn of their
fellows are impurities of language; and these are soon
followed by impurities of thought. . . . When this is
the training of boyhood, it is not strange that the
predominating ideas among young men, in relation to the
other sex, are too often those of impurity and sensuality.
. . . We cannot be surprised, then, that the history of
most young men is, that they yield to temptation in a
greater or less degree and in different ways. With
many, no doubt, the indulgence is transient, accidental,
and does not become habitual. It does not get to be
regarded as venial. It is never yielded to without
remorse. The wish and the purpose are to resist; but
the animal nature bears down the moral. Still, transgression
is always followed by grief and penitence.
</p><p>"With too many, however, it is to be feared it is
not so. The mind has become debauched by dwelling
on licentious images, and by indulgence in licentious
conversation. There is no wish to resist. They are
not overtaken by temptation; for they seek it. With
them the transgression becomes habitual, and the stain
on the character is deep and lasting."[12]


[12] Ware.

</p><p>Poverty. &mdash; The pressing influence of poverty has
been urged as one cause of prostitution. It cannot be
denied that in many cases, in large cities, this may be
the immediate occasion of the entrance of a young girl
upon a life of shame; but it may still be insisted that
<pb n="216"/>
there must have been, in such cases, a deficiency in
previous training; for a young woman, educated with a
proper regard for purity, would sooner sacrifice life
itself than virtue. Again, poverty can be no excuse;
for in every city there are made provisions for the relief
of the needy poor, and none who are really worthy need
suffer.
</p><p>Ignorance. &mdash; Perhaps nothing fosters vice more than
ignorance. Prostitutes come almost entirely from the
more ignorant classes, though there are, of course, many
exceptions. Among the lowest classes, vice is seen in
its grossest forms, and is carried to the greatest lengths.
Intellectual culture is antagonistic to sensuality. As a
general rule, in proportion as the intellect is developed,
the animal passions are brought into subjection. It is
true that some very intellectual men have been great
libertines, and that the licentious Borgias and Medicis of
Italy encouraged art and literature; but these are only
apparent exceptions; for who knows to what greater
depths of vice these individuals might have sunk had it
not been for the restraining influence of mental culture.
</p><p>Says Deslandes, "In proportion as the intellect
becomes enfeebled, the generative sensibility is
augmented." The animal passions seem to survive when
all higher intelligence is lost. We once saw an illustration
of this fact in an idiot who was brought before a
medical class in a clinic at Bellevue Hospital, New York.
The patient had been an idiot from birth: and presented
the most revolting appearance, seemingly possessing
scarcely the intelligence of the average dog; but his
animal propensities were so great as to be almost
uncontrollable. Indeed, he showed evidences of having
<pb n="217"/>
been a gross debauchee, having contracted venereal
disease of the worst form. The general prevalence of
extravagant sexual excitement among the insane is a
well-known fact.
</p><p>Disease. &mdash; Various diseases which cause local irritation
and congestion of the reproductive organs are the
causes of unchastity in both sexes, as previously
explained. It not infrequently happens that by constantly
dwelling upon unchaste subjects until a condition of
habitual congestion of the sexual organs is produced,
young women become seized with a furor for libidinous
commerce, which nothing but the desired object will
appease, unless active remedial measures are adopted
under the direction of a skillful physician. This disease,
known as <hi rend="italic">nymphomania</hi>, has been the occasion of the
fall of many young women of the better classes who
had been bred in luxury and idleness, but were never
taught even the first lesson of purity or self-control.
Constipation, piles, worms, pruritis of the genitals; and
some other less common diseases of the urinary and
genital systems, have been causes of sexual excitement
which has resulted in moral degradation.
</p><p>Results of Licentiousness. &mdash; Apparently as a safeguard
to virtue, nature has appended to the sin of illicit
sexual indulgence, as penalties, the most loathsome,
deadly, and incurable diseases known to man. Some of
these, as <hi rend="italic">gonorrh&oelig;a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">chancroid</hi>, are purely local
diseases; and though they occasion the transgressor a
vast amount of suffering, they may be cured and leave
no trace of their presence except in the conscience of the
individual. Such a result, however, is by no means the
usual one. Most frequently, the injury done is more or
<pb n="218"/>
less permanent; sometimes it amounts to loss of life or
serious mutilation, as in cases we have seen. And one
attack secures no immunity from subsequent ones, as a
new disease may be contracted upon every exposure.
</p><p>By far the worst form of venereal disease is <hi rend="italic">syphilis</hi>,
a malady which was formerly confounded with the two
forms of disease mentioned, but from which it is essentially
different. At first, a very slight local lesion, of
no more consequence &mdash; except from its significance &mdash;
than a small boil, it rapidly infects the general system,
poisoning the whole body, and liable forever after to
develop itself in any one or more of its protean forms.
The most loathsome sight upon which a human eye can
rest is a victim of this disease who presents it well
developed in its later stages. In the large hospitals
of this country and various European cities, we have
seen scores of these unfortunates of both sexes, exhibiting
the horrid disease in all phases. To describe them
would be to place before our readers a picture too
revolting for these pages. No pen can portray the woe-begone faces, the hopeless air, of these degraded sufferers
whose repentance has come, alas! too late. No words
can convey an adequate idea of their sufferings. What
remorse and useless regrets add to the misery of their
wretched existence as they daily watch the progress of a
malignant ulceration which is destroying their organs of
speech, or burrowing deep into the recesses of the skull,
penetrating even to the brain itself! Even the bones
become rotten; foul running sores appear on different
portions of the body, and may even cover it entirely.
Perhaps the nose, or the tongue, or the lips, or an eye,
or some other prominent organ, is lost. Still the miser-<pb n="219"/>
able sufferer lingers on, life serving only to prolong the
torture. To many of them, death would be a grateful
release, even with the fires of retributive justice before
their eyes; for hell itself could scarcely be more awful
punishment than that which they daily endure.
</p><p>Thousands of Victims. &mdash; The venturesome youth
need not attempt to calm his fears by thinking that these
are only exceptional cases; for this is not the truth. In
any city, one who has an experienced eye can scarcely
walk a dozen blocks on busy streets without encountering
the woeful effects of sexual transgression. Neither
do these results come only from long-continued violations
of the laws of chastity. The very first departure from
virtue may occasion all the worst effects possible.
</p><p>Effects of Vice Ineradicable. &mdash; Another fearful feature
of this terrible disease is that when once it invades
the system, its eradication is impossible. No drug, no
chemical, can antidote its virulent poison, or drive it
from the system. Various means may smother it, possibly
for a lifetime; but yet it is not cured, and the
patient is never safe from a new outbreak. Prof. Bumstead,
an acknowledged authority on this subject, after
observing the disease for many years, says that he "never,
after treatment, however prolonged, promises immunity
for the future."[13] Dr. Van Buren, professor of
surgery at Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New
York, bears the same testimony.


[13] "Venereal Disease."

</p><p>Prof. Van Buren also says that he has often seen the
disease occur upon the lips of young ladies who were
entirely virtuous, but who were engaged to men who
had contracted the disease, and had communicated it to
<pb n="220"/>
them in the act of kissing. Virtuous wives have not
infrequently had their constitutions hopelessly ruined
by contracting the disease from husbands who had
themselves been inoculated either before or after marriage,
by illicit intercourse. Several such unfortunate
cases have fallen under our observation, and there is
reason to believe that they are not infrequent.
</p><p>The Only Hope. &mdash; The only hope for one who has
contracted this disease is to lead a life of perfect continence
ever after, and by a most careful life, by conforming
strictly to the laws of health, by bathing and dieting,
he may possibly avoid the horrid consequences of the
later stages of the malady. Mercury will not cure it,
nor will any other poison, as before remarked.
</p><p>The following strong testimony on this subject we
quote from an admirable pamphlet by Prof. Fred. H.
Gerrish, M. D.: &mdash;
</p><p>"The diseases dependent upon prostitution are
appallingly frequent, a distinguished surgeon recently
declaring that one person in twenty in the United States
has syphilis, &mdash; a malady so ineradicable that a profound
observer has remarked that `a man who is once thus
poisoned, will die a syphilitic, and in the day of
Judgment he will be a syphilitic ghost.' Prof. Gross says:
`What is called scrofula, struma, or tuberculosis, is, I
have long been satisfied from careful observation of the
sick and a profound study of the literature of the subject,
in a great majority of cases, if not invariably, merely
syphilis in its more remote stages.' Though there are
doubtless many of us who believe that a not inconsiderable
proportion of scrofulous and phthisical cases are
clearly due to other causes than syphilis, we must admit
<pb n="221"/>
that this statement contains a very large element of
truth."
</p><p>Hereditary Effects of Venereal Disease. &mdash; The
transgressor is not the only sufferer. If he marries, his
children, if they survive infancy, are likely, in later years,
to show the effects of their father's sin, exhibiting the
forms of the disease seen in its later stages. Scrofula,
consumption, cancer, rickets, diseases of the brain and
nerves, decay of the bones by caries or necrosis, and other
diseases arise in this way.
</p><p>But it generally happens that the child dies before
birth, or lingers out a miserable existence of a few days
or weeks thereafter. A most pitiable sight these little
ones are. Their faces look as old as children of ten or
twelve. Often their bodies become reduced before death
to the most wretched skeletons. Their hollow, feeble
cry sends a shudder of horror through the listener, and
impresses indelibly the terrible consequences of sexual
sin. Plenty of these scrawny infants may be seen in
the lying-in hospitals.
</p><p>No one can estimate how much of the excessive
mortality of infants is owing to this cause.
</p><p>In children who survive infancy, its blighting influence
may be seen in the notched, deformed teeth, and other
defects; and very often it will be found, upon looking
into the mouth of the child, that the soft palate, and
perhaps the hard palate as well, is in a state of ulceration.
There is more than a suspicion that this disease may be
transmitted for several generations, perhaps remaining
latent during the lifetime of one, and appearing in all its
virulence in the next.
</p><p>Origin of the Foul Disease. &mdash; Where or when the
<pb n="222"/>
disease originated, is a mystery. It is said to have been
introduced into France from Naples by French soldiers.
That it originated spontaneously at some time can
scarcely be doubted, and that it might originate under
circumstances of excessive violation of the laws of
chastity is rendered probable by the fact that gonorrh&oelig;a,
or an infectious disease exactly resembling it, is often
caused by excessive indulgence, from which cause it not
infrequently occurs in the newly married, giving rise to
unjust suspicion of infidelity on both sides.
</p><p>Read the following from a noted French physician: &mdash;
</p><p>"The father, as well as the mother, communicates
the syphilitic virus to the children. These poor little
beings are attacked sometimes at their birth; more often
it is at the end of a month or two that these morbid
symptoms appear.
</p><p>"I recall the heart-rending anguish of a mother
whom I assisted at her fifth confinement. She related
to me her misfortune: `I have already brought into the
world four children. Alas! they all died during the
first months of their existence. A frightful eruption
wasted them away, and killed them. Save me the one
that is about to be born!' cried she, in tears. The child
that I delivered was sickly and puny. A few days after
its birth, it had purulent ophthalmia; then, crusted and
ulcerated pustules, a few at first, numerous afterward,
covered the entire surface of the skin. Soon this miserable
little being became as meager as a skeleton, hideous
to the sight, and died. Having questioned the husband,
he acknowledged to me that he had had syphilis."[14]


[14] Bourgeois.

<pb n="223"/>
</p><p>Cure of the Social Evil. &mdash; With rare exceptions,
the efforts of civil legislation have been directed toward
controlling or modifying this vice, rather than extirpating it.
</p><p>Among other devices adopted with a view to effect
this, and to mitigate in some degree the resulting evils,
the issuing of licenses for brothels has been practiced in
several large cities. One of the conditions of the license
makes it obligatory upon the keepers of houses of ill-repute and their inmates to submit to medical examination
at stated intervals. By this means, it is expected
to detect the cases of foul disease at the outset, and thus
to protect others by placing the infected individuals
under restraint and treatment. It will be seen that for
many reasons such examinations could not be effective &mdash;
but, even if they were, the propriety of this plan of
dealing with the vice is exceedingly questionable, as
will appear from the following considerations: &mdash;
</p><p>1. The moment that prostitution is placed under the
protection of law by means of a license, it at once loses
half its disrepute, and becomes respectable, as do
gambling and liquor-selling under the same circumstances.
</p><p>2. Why should so vile a crime as fornication be
taken under legal protection more than stealing or the
lowest forms of gambling! Is it not a lesser crime against
human nature to rob a man of his money by theft or by
deceit and trickery, than to snatch from him at one fell
swoop his health, his virtue, and his peace of mind?
Why not as well have laws to regulate burglary and
assassination, allowing the perpetrators of those crimes
to ply their chosen avocations with impunity under certain
prescribed restrictions, &mdash; if robbery, for instance, re-<pb n="224"/>
quiring the thief to leave his victim money enough to
make his escape to another country; or, if murder,
directing the assassin to allow his intended victim time
to repeat a sufficient number of <hi rend="italic">Ave Marias</hi> to insure his
safe transit through purgatory or to pay a priest for
doing the same? Such a course would not be inconsistent
with the policy which legalizes that infamous traffic
in human souls, prostitution.
</p><p>3. By the use of certain precautionary measures, the
fears of many will be allayed, so that thousands whose
fear of the consequences of sin would otherwise have
kept them physically virtuous, at least, erroneously
supposing that the cause for fear has been removed, will
rush madly into a career of vice, and will learn only too
late the folly of their course.
</p><p>Prevention the Only Cure. &mdash; Those who have once
entered upon a career of sensuality, are generally so
completely lost to all sense of purity and right that there
is little chance for reforming them. They have no
principle to which to appeal{.} The gratification of lust so
degrades the soul and benumbs the higher sensibilities
that a votary of voluptuousness is a most unpromising
subject for reformatory efforts. The old adage that an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure is strikingly
exemplified in this case. The remedy must be applied
before the depths have been reached. It was well said
by a celebrated physician to a young man beginning a
life of vice, "You are entering upon a career from which
you will never turn back."
</p><p>Early Training. &mdash; The remedy, to be effective, must
be applied early, the earlier the better. Lessons on
chastity may be given in early infancy. The remedy
<pb n="225"/>
may be applied even farther back than this; children
must be virtuously generated.
</p><p>Children should be early taught to reverence virtue,
to abhor lust; and boys should be so trained that they
will associate with the name of woman only pure, chaste,
and noble thoughts. Few things are more deeply injurious
to the character of woman, and more conducive to
the production of foul imaginations in children, than the
free discussion of such subjects as the latest scandal
and like topics. The inquisitive minds and lively
imaginations of childhood penetrate the rotten mysteries of
such foul subjects at a much earlier age than many
persons imagine. The inquiring minds of children will be
occupied in some way, and it is of the utmost importance
that they should be early filled with thoughts that will
lead them to noble and pure actions.
</p><p>The White Cross Army. &mdash; This is the name of an
association first organized in England in 1883 by the
Bishop of Durham, Rt. Rev. J. B. Lightfoot, D. D.,
well known through his excellent commentaries on the
New Testament. The Y. M. C. A. of New York has
recently undertaken to effect an organization of the
same sort in this country. The object of the association
is thus stated in its constitution: "The object of this
Army shall be the promotion of purity among young
men, the elevation of public opinion regarding the
question of personal purity, and the maintenance of the
same standard for men and women."
</p><p>All who join the organization are required to sign
the following pledge: &mdash;
</p><p>"I promise by the help of God &mdash;
</p><p>"1. To treat all women with respect, and
endeavor to protect them from wrong and degradation.
<pb n="296"/>
</p><p>"2. To endeavor to put down all indecent language
and coarse jests.
</p><p>"3. To maintain the law of purity as equally binding
upon men and women.
</p><p>"4. To endeavor to spread these principles among
my companions, and to try to help my younger brothers.
</p><p>"5. To use every possible means to fulfill the
command, `Keep THYSELF pure.' "
</p><p>At a meeting held for the purpose of organizing this
association in the city of New York, March, 1885,
remarks were made by the Rev. Dr. B. F. DeCosta,
elucidating the objects of the organization as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"If a woman sins, you know what becomes of her. Is
there any place for her except the street? If a man sins,
where does he find his place? Does he not find it in
the highest society and the best and purest homes,
while the miserable victim of his lust is trodden
underfoot? What are you going to do about that, young
men? Are you going to tolerate a double standard!
If there be manhood among you, I call upon you to treat
woman as you would be treated yourself. If a woman
falls, she falls forever. Her own sex disown her, and
reduce her to despair. Though she reform, and rise to
a true and pure life, &mdash; become as pure as Mary Magdalene,
aye, as chaste as the icicles upon the temple of
Diana, her own sex refuse to receive her, and scarce
allow her to come into their kitchens to scrub the floor.
Now I say to you, young men, be pure on account of
her. Whom do I mean? Mother? Sister? Yes, and
another. Sometime there will be one whom you will
regard with the tenderest love and affection as the
personification of purity, beauty, and truth. You may not
<pb n="227"/>
have found her yet, but you will find her. What do
you desire her to think of you? If she loves you truly,
you know she will consider you the epitome of goodness,
honor, and truth. Will you not so live that when the
time comes, you may go to her with a clean and pure
heart, so that she may know that you are all her fancy
paints you? God forbid that you should go to her and
tell her a lie under whose cloud you must live for a
lifetime."
</p><p>Branch associations of this organization should be
formed in every town and city and village in the United
States. Those who wish further information concerning
it, should address the Young Men's Christian Association
23d St. &amp; Fourth Ave., N. Y City.
</p><p>Teach Self-Control. &mdash; One important part of early
training is the cultivation of self-control, and a habit of
self-denial, whenever right demands it. Another most
essential part of a child's moral training is the cultivation
of right motives. To present a child no higher motives
for doing right than the hope of securing some pleasant
reward, or the fear of suffering some terrible punishment,
is the surest way to make of him a supremely selfish
man, with no higher aim than to secure good to himself,
no matter what may become of other people. And if he
can convince himself that the pleasure he will secure by
the commission of a certain act will more than counter-balance the probable risk of suffering, he will not hesitate
to commit it, leaving wholly out of consideration
the question, Is it right, or noble, or pure? A love
of right for its own sake is the only solid basis upon
which to build a moral character. Children should not
be taught to do right in order to avoid a whipping, or
<pb n="298"/>
imprisonment in a dark closet, &mdash; a horrid kind of punishment
sometimes resorted to, &mdash; or even to escape "the
lake of fire and brimstone." Neither should they be
constantly coaxed to right doing by promised rewards, &mdash;
a new toy, a book, an excursion, or even the pleasures of
a future life. All these incentives are selfish, and
invariably narrow the character and belittle life when made
the <hi rend="italic">chief</hi> motives of action. But rather begin at the
earliest possible moment to instill into the mind a love
for right, and truth, and purity, and virtue, and an
abhorrence for their contraries; then will he have a worthy
principle by which to square his life; then will he be
safe from the assaults of passion, of vice, of lust. A
mind so trained stands upon an eminence from which all
evil men and devils combined cannot displace it, so long
as it adheres to its noble principles.
</p><p>Mental Culture. &mdash; The cultivation of the physical
organization must not be neglected. Healthful mental
discipline should receive equal attention. By healthful
mental discipline is not meant that kind of superficial
"cramming" and memorizing which constitute the training
of the average school, but sound culture; a directing
of the mind from facts to underlying principles; a
development of the reasoning powers so as to bring the
emotions and passions into subjection; the acquirement
of the power to concentrate the mind, one of the best
methods of cultivating self-control, &mdash; these are some of
the objects and results of sound culture of the mind.
</p><p>To supply the mind with food for pure thoughts, the
child should bc early inspired with a love for nature. The
perceptives should be trained, the child taught to observe
closely and accurately. The study of the natural sci-<pb n="229"/>
ences is a most valuable means of elevating the mind
above grossness and sensuality. To be successful in this
direction, parents must cultivate a love for the same
objects themselves. Take the little ones into the country,
if they are not so fortunate as to live there, and in
the midst of nature's glories, point their impressible
minds upward to the Author of all the surrounding
loveliness. Gather flowers and leaves, and call attention to
the peculiarities and special beauties of each, and thus
arouse curiosity and cultivate habits of close observation
and attention.
</p><p>Early Associations. &mdash; As children grow older, watch
their associations. Warn them of evil influences and
evil practices. Make home so attractive that they will
enjoy it better than any other place. Cultivate music;
its mellowing, harmonizing, refining influence is too
great to be prudently withheld. Children naturally love
music; and if they cannot hear it at home, they will go
where they can hear it. Supply attractive books of
natural history, travels, interesting and instructive
biographies, and almost any other books but love-sick novels,
and sentimental religious story-books. Guard against
bad books and bad associates as carefully as though they
were deadly serpents; for they are, indeed, the artful
emissaries of the "old serpent" himself. A taste once
formed for reading light literature destroys the relish
for solid reading; and usually the taste, once lost, is
never regained. The fascination of bad companionship
once formed around a person, is broken with the greatest
difficulty. Hence the necessity of watching for the
very beginnings of evil, and promptly checking them.
</p><p>The mind should be thus fortified against the triffles
<pb n="230"/>
and follies of fashionable life. It should be elevated
into a sphere far above that occupied by those who pass
their time in fashionable drawing-rooms in silly twaddle,
with thrumming a piano, with listless day-dreaming, or
in the gratification of perverted tastes and depraved
instincts in any other of the ways common to fashionable life.</p>

<head>SOLITARY VICE.</head>

<p>If illicit commerce of the sexes is a heinous sin, self-pollution, or masturbation, is a crime doubly abominable.
As a sin against nature, it has no parallel except in
sodomy (see Gen. 19:5; Judges 19:22). It is the
most dangerous of all sexual abuses because the most
extensively practiced. The vice consists in an excitement
of the genital organs produced otherwise than in
the natural way. It is known by the terms, self-pollution, self-abuse, masturbation, onanism, manustupration,
voluntary pollution, and solitary or secret vice.
The vice is the more extensive because there are almost
no bounds to its indulgence. Its frequent repetition fastens
it upon the victim with a fascination almost irresistible!
It may be begun in earliest infancy, and may continue
through life.
</p><p>Even though no warning may have been given, the
transgressor seems to know, instinctively, that he is
committing a great wrong, for he carefully hides his
practice from observation. In solitude he pollutes himself,
and with his own hand blights all his prospects for
both this world and the next. Even after being solemnly
warned, he will often continue this worse than beastly
practice, deliberately forfeiting his right to health and
happiness for a moment's mad sensuality.
</p><p>Alarming Prevalence of the Vice. &mdash; The habit is by
no means confined to boys; girls also indulge in it,
though, it is to be hoped, to a less fearful extent than
boys, at least in this country. A Russian physician,
quoted by an eminent medical professor in New York,
<pb n="232"/>
states that the habit is universal among girls in Russia.
It seems impossible that such a statement should be
credible; and yet we have not seen it contradicted. It
is more than probable that the practice is far more
nearly universal everywhere than even medical men are
willing to admit. Many young men who have been addicted
to the vice, have, in their confessions, declared
that they found it universal in the schools in which they
learned the practice.
</p><p>Dr. Gardner speaks of it as "the secret cause of
much that is perverting the energies and demoralizing
the minds of many of our fairest and best." He further
says: &mdash;
</p><p>"Much of the worthlessness, lassitude, and physical
and mental feebleness attributable to the modern woman,
are to be ascribed to these habits as their initial cause."
"Foreigners are especially struck with this fact as the
cause of much of the physical disease of our young
women. They recognize it in the physique, in the
sodden, colorless countenance, the lack-luster eye, in the
dreamy indolence, the general carriage, the constant
demeanor indicative of distrust, mingled boldness and
timidity, and a series of anomalous combinations which
mark this genus of physical and moral decay."
</p><p>The extent to which the vice is practiced by an
individual is in some cases appalling. Three or four
repetitions of the act daily are not uncommon; and the
following from Dr. Copland is evidence of much deeper
depravity: &mdash;
</p><p>"There can be no doubt that the individual who has
once devoted himself to this moloch of the species
becomes but too frequently its slave to an almost incredible
<pb n="233"/>
degree. A patient who was sent to London for my
advice, confessed that he had practiced this vice seven or
eight times daily from the age of thirteen until twenty-four; and he was then reduced to the lowest state of
mental weakness, associated with various bodily infirmities;
indeed, both mental power and physical existence
were nearly extinguished."
</p><p>In a case which came under the author's care some
time ago, that of a young woman, the vice had been
practiced ten to fourteen times daily for weeks at a time.
The patient had become a bed-ridden invalid, and was
reduced to the most wretched condition physically and
mentally; and it was only by the most earnest and
persistent effort that she was rescued from the miserable
state into which she had fallen.
</p><p>Testimony of Eminent Authors. &mdash; Says a medical
writer, "In my opinion, neither the plague, nor war, nor
small-pox, nor similar diseases, have produced results so
disastrous to humanity as the pernicious habit of Onanism;
it is the destroying element of civilized societies, which is
constantly in action, and gradually undermines the
health of a nation."
</p><p>"The sin of self-pollution, which is generally considered
to be that of Onan, is one of the most destructive
evils ever practiced by fallen man. In many respects it
is several degrees worse than common whoredom, and
has in its train more awful consequences, though practiced
by numbers who would shudder at the thought of
criminal connection with a prostitute."[15]


[15] Dr. Adam Clarke.

</p><p>"However revolting to the feelings it may be to
enter upon such a subject, it cannot be passed over in
<pb n="234"/>
silence without a great violation of duty. Unhappily, it
has not been hitherto exhibited in the awful light in
which it deserves to be shown. <hi rend="italic">The worst of it is that it
is seldom suspected</hi>. There are many pale faces and
languid, nervous feelings attributed to other causes, when
all the mischief lies here."[16]


[16] Sir W. C. Ellis.

</p><p>We scarcely need add further evidence of the fearful
extent of this evil, but will conclude with the following: &mdash;
</p><p>"The pernicious and debasing practice of masturbation
is a more common and extensive evil with youth of
both sexes than is usually supposed." "A great number
of the evils which come upon the youth at and after the
age of puberty, arise from masturbation, persisted in, so
as to waste the vital energies and enervate the physical
and mental powers of man." "Many of the weaknesses
commonly attributed to growth and the changes in the
habit by the important transformation from adolescence
to manhood, are justly referable to this practice."[17]


[17] Boston <hi rend="italic">Medical and Surgical Journal</hi>.

</p><p>Not a Modern Vice. &mdash; That this vice is not entirely
a modern one is proved by the fact that in many ancient
writings directions are given for treating its effects.
Even Moses seems to have recognized disorders of this
class. Hippocrates and others devoted considerable
attention to them.
</p><p>Victims of All Ages. &mdash; The ages at which the habit
may be practiced include almost the whole extent of
human life. We have seen it in infants of only three or
four years, and in old men scarcely less than sixty, in
both extremes marked by the most unmistakable and
lamentable consequences. Cases have been noted in
which the practice was begun as early as two years of
<pb n="235"/>
age. It is common among African boys at nine and ten
years of age, according to Dr. Copland.
</p><p>The author has met cases in which the vice was still
practiced at so advanced an age as sixty years. The
horrible state of depravity of both mind and body
reached by the individual after such a lifetime of vice
can be more readily imagined than described.
</p><p>Unsuspected Rottenness. &mdash; Parents who have no
suspicion of the evil, who think their children the
embodiment of purity, will find by careful observation and
inquiry, &mdash; though personal testimony cannot be relied
upon, &mdash; that in many instances their supposed virtuous
children are old in corruption. Such a revelation has
brought dismay into many a family, in some cases only
too late.
</p><p>Not long since a case came under our care which well
illustrates the apathy and blindness of parents with
respect to this subject. The parents of a young man
whose mind seemed to be somewhat disordered, sent
word to us through a friend respecting his condition,
asking advice. We suspected from the symptoms
described the real cause of the disease, and urged prompt
attention to the case. In a short time the young man
was placed under our immediate care without encouragement
of a cure, and we gave the case still closer study.
The characteristic symptoms of disease from self-abuse
were marked, but the father was positive that no influence
of that kind could have been at work. He had watched
his son narrowly from infancy, and did not believe it
possible for him to have been guilty. In addition, the
young man had long been remarkable for his piety, and
he did not believe there could be any possibility of his
being guilty of so gross a crime.
<pb n="236"/>
</p><p>A short time sufficed, however, to secure the
indisputable evidence of the fact by his being caught in the
act by his nurse.
</p><p>This young man was a sad example of what havoc is
made with the "human form divine" by this debasing
vice. Once a bright boy, kind, affectionate, active,
intelligent, the pride of a loving mother and the hope of a
doting father, his mind had sunken to driveling idiocy.
His vacant stare and expressionless countenance betokened
almost complete imbecility. If allowed to do so,
he would remain for hours in whatever position his last
movement left him. If his hand was raised, it remained
extended until placed in a position of rest by his attendant.
Only with the utmost difficulty could he be made
to rise in the morning, to eat, drink, or walk. Only by
great efforts could he be aroused from his lethargy
sufficiently to answer the most simple question. The
instinctive demands of decency in regarding the calls of
nature were not respected. In short, the distinguishing
characteristics of a human being were almost wholly
obliterated, leaving but a physical semblance of humanity, &mdash;
a mind completely wrecked, a body undergoing
dissolution while yet alive, a blasted life, no hope for
this world, no prospect for the next. In the insane
asylums of the country may be seen hundreds of these poor
victims in all stages of physical and mental demoralization.
</p><p>Causes of the Habit. &mdash; It is needless to recapitulate
all the causes of unchastity which have previously been
quite fully dwelt upon, nearly all of which are predisposing
or exciting causes of solitary as well as social
vice. Sexual precocity, idleness, pernicious literature,
<pb n="237"/>
abnormal sexual passions, exciting and irritating food,
gluttony, sedentary employment, libidinous pictures,
and many abnormal conditions of life are potent causes
in exciting the vile practice; but by far the most frequent
causes are evil associations, wicked or ignorant
nurses, and local disease, or abnormality. These latter
we will consider more particularly, as they have not
been so fully dwelt upon elsewhere.
</p><p>Evil Associations. &mdash; A child may have been reared
with the greatest care. From infancy he may have been
carefully shielded from all pernicious influences, so that
at the age of ten or twelve, when he is for the first time
sent to school, he may be free from vice; but when he
associates with his fellow-students, he soon finds them
practicing a habit new to him, and being unwarned, he
speedily follows their filthy example, and quickly becomes
fascinated with the vice. Thousands have taken
their first lessons in this debasing habit at school.
Teachers and scholars testify that it is often
practiced even in school hours, almost under the teacher's
eyes; but where the infection most quickly spreads is
in the sleeping apartments, where more than one occupy
the same bed, or where several sleep in the same room.
</p><p>Nothing is more indispensable to purity of body and
of morals than a private sleeping-room, and a single bed
for each student. Such an arrangement would protect
the youth from the reception of much evil, and would
allow an opportunity for privacy which every young
man or youth needs for his spiritual as well as physical
benefit. Not the least benefit of the latter class is the
opportunity for a thorough cleansing of the whole body
every morning, which is almost as indispensable to purity
<pb n="238"/>
of morals as to cleanliness of body. The same suggestion
is fully as applicable to the sleeping arrangements
of girls. The exceptional cases in which this plan would
not be the best are very few indeed.
</p><p>Corruption in Schools. &mdash; Says Dr. Acton, "I cannot
venture to print the accounts patients have given me of
what they have seen or even been drawn into at schools.
I would fain hope that such abominations are things of
the past." The entrance of a single corrupt boy into a
school which may have been previously pure, &mdash; though
such schools must be extremely rare, &mdash; will speedily corrupt
almost the entire membership. The evil infection
spreads more rapidly than the contagion of small-pox or
yellow fever, and it is scarcely less fatal.
</p><p>This danger exists, not in public or city schools alone,
but in the most select and private schools. A father
who had kept his two sons under the care of a private
governess for several years, and then placed them in a
small school taught by a lady, and composed of a few
small children from the most select families, was greatly
astonished when informed by a physician that his sons
showed symptoms of the effects of self-abuse. He was
totally incredulous; but an investigation showed that
they had already practiced the vile habit for several
years, having learned it of an infantile school-mate.
</p><p>We were acquainted with one instance in which a
primary school in a secluded and select community was
nearly broken up by the introduction of this vile habit
through a corrupt student. Many a watchful teacher
has seen the light of growing intelligence suddenly dim
and wane in the eye of his favorite student just when he
was giving the most promise of developing unusual tal-<pb n="239"/>
ents in literature, mathematics, or some one of the natural
or physical sciences, and has been compelled to
watch the devastating influence of this deadly upas-tree
that often claims the best and fairest human flowers as
its victims.
</p><p>Wicked Nurses. &mdash; In those cases in which the habit
is acquired at a very early age, the work of evil is
usually wrought by the nurse, perhaps through ignorance of
the effects of the habit. Incredible as it seems, it is
proved by numerous instances that it is not an uncommon
habit for nurses to quiet small children by handling or
titillating their genital organs. They find this a speedy
means of quieting them, and resort to it regardless or
ignorant of the consequences.
</p><p>Not an Uncommon Case.-Prof. Lusk, of Bellevue
Hospital College, New York, related to his medical class
in our hearing a case which came under his observation
in which all the children in a large family had been
taught the habit by a wicked nurse for the purpose of
keeping them quiet after they were put to bed. The
vileness that would lead a person to thus rob childhood
of its innocence, and blast its prospects for this life and
the next, is base enough for the commission of almost
any crime. Indeed, the crime could hardly have been
a worse one had the nurse referred to in the above case
in cold blood cut the throats of those innocent children;
perhaps it might have been better for the children.
</p><p>A gentleman once declared that if he should detect
a person teaching this crime to his child, he would shoot
him on the spot; and if homicide is allowable under any
circumstances, it seems to us it would be extenuated by
such an aggravation. If occasional bad associations will
<pb n="240"/>
work an immense damage to the youthful character,
what terrible injury may be wrought by an agent of sin,
an instructor in vice, who is within the household, who
presides in the nursery, and exerts a constant influence!
No one can estimate it.
</p><p>Acton remarks on this point: "I need hardly point
out how very dangerous this is. There seems hardly
any limit to the age at which a young child can be initiated
into these abominations, or to the depth of degradation
to which it may fall under such hideous teaching.
Books treating of this subject are unfortunately too full
of accounts of the habits of such children."
</p><p>In not a few instances the "hired man" has been
the means of communicating to innocent little boys the
infamous knowledge which, fortunately, they had not
acquired in babyhood. With no knowledge of the evil
they are committing, they begin the work of physical
damnation which makes a hell of life, and leads to
endless death.
</p><p>The "hired girl" is often an equally efficient agent
for evil in the instruction of little girls in this debasing
vice. Some time ago, the very intelligent parents of a
bright family of children were awakened to the importance
of this subject by the perusal of the first edition
of this work, and upon investigation were horrified to
find that their oldest child, a promising daughter of ten,
was already a victim to the vile practice, having been
initiated by a "hired girl." After using in vain every
means he could bring to bear upon the case, the father
brought her to us, and with tears in his eyes gave his
story. After telling of his unsuccessful attempts to
effect a reform, he declared that he would far prefer
<pb n="241"/>
to place his daughter in the grave than to see her
grow up a wretched victim of this vice. We were
most happy to be able, after a few weeks' treatment
to restore her to her parents, as we hope, permanently
reformed. Not a few such cases are constantly coming
to the attention of the medical profession.
</p><p>The Instructor in Vice. &mdash; Are these lines perused
by any one who has ever taught another this vice so
vile, and so certainly followed by penalties so terrible, &mdash;
penalties not upon the instigator but upon the hapless
victim? Let such a person clothe himself in sackcloth
and ashes, and do penance for the remainder of his life.
The only way in which he can hope to atone, even in
some small degree, for such a heinous crime, is by doing
all in his power to warn those in danger against this sin.
When all men receive their just deserts, what will be the
punishment of such a one who has not, by thorough
repentance and a life spent in trying to undo the work of
ruin so foully wrought, in some measure disburdened
himself of the consequences of his act!
</p><p>Sending children very early to bed before they are
weary, "to get them out of the way," or for punishment,
is a grave error, as this may give rise to the vice.
Confining children alone in a room by themselves is an
equally reprehensible practice, as it favors the commission
of the act, at least, and may afford a favorable opportunity
for its discovery. Allowing children to form a habit
of seeking solitude is an evil of the same nature.
</p><p>Local Disease. &mdash; In the male, a tight or long foreskin
is a frequent cause of the habit. The constant contact
of the prepuce with the most sensitive part of the organ
increases its sensibility. The secretion is retained, and
<pb n="242"/>
accumulates, often becoming hardened. In this manner,
irritation is set up, which occasions uncomfortable
feelings, and attracts the hands to the part. Owing to the
great degree of excitement due to irritation, but a slight
provocation is necessary to arouse voluptuous sensations,
and then the terrible secret is revealed. The child
readily discovers how to reproduce the same, and is not
slow to commit a frequent repetition of the act; and
thus the habit is formed.
</p><p>An Illustrative Case. &mdash; A case in which the vice
originated in this manner was recently under the author's
observation. The patient was a man of considerable
intellectual power and culture, but showed unmistakable
signs of his early indiscretion. He stated that although
he mingled quite freely with other boys of his age, he
obtained no knowledge of the habit from others. He often
heard allusions which he did not understand, and of
which he did not, fortunately, discover the meaning.
But he was afflicted with congenital <hi rend="italic">phimosis</hi>, the prepuce
being so tight that retraction was impossible. This,
together with a bladder irritation, &mdash; which occasioned
nocturnal incontinence of urine, &mdash; constipation, and highly
seasoned food, produced so much local irritation as to
occasion frequent erections, and an increased secretion.
He soon noticed that there was an accumulation of
hardened secretion beneath the foreskin, and in
attempting to remove this, he accidentally provoked
voluptuous sensations. He speedily abandoned himself
to the habit, often repeating it several times a day.
Beginning at the age of twelve years, he continued it for
three or four years.
</p><p>Soon after acquiring the habit, he became aware of
<pb n="243"/>
its tendencies, through reading books upon the subject;
but he found himself so completely enslaved that
reformation seemed impossible. One resolution to reform
after another was formed, only to be speedily broken.
His unwholesome diet, habitual constipation, and
especially the unfortunate organic difficulty in his genital
organs, produced an almost constant priapism, which
was only relieved, and then but temporarily, by the act
of pollution. His sedentary habits increased the difficulty
to an extreme degree.
</p><p>In the meantime, his constitution, naturally weak,
was being gradually undermined. He suffered from
constant headache, heart-burn, pains in the back and
limbs, weakness, and lassitude. Yet he attributed none
of these ailments to the true cause. After the lapse of
three or four years thus spent, and after repeated
ineffectual attempts, by a powerful effort of the will, by the
aid of prayer, and by adopting a more wholesome diet,
he succeeded in getting the mastery of his vice. But
the local difficulties still continued in a great degree, and
under particularly aggravated circumstances occasioned
a relapse at long intervals. After a time the local
difficulties grew less and less, and enabled him to gain
a complete victory over the habit, though the result of
previous sin still remained, for which he desired treatment.
</p><p>This case will serve as a fair illustration of many of
similar character, in which the child accidentally makes
the discovery which leads him to work his own ruin.
</p><p>Other Physical Causes. &mdash; Constipation, piles irritable
bladder, fissure of the anus, local uncleanliness, and
pruritis of the genital organs, will produce the habit in
<pb n="244"/>
both males and females in the manner described. Sleeping
on feather beds increases the local congestion, and
thus favors the exciting influences of all the above-named causes. It may, perhaps, itself be the exciting
cause.
</p><p>We once treated a patient who was affected with
stone in the bladder, and who asserted that the constant
irritation which he suffered in the end of the penis was
only relieved by friction. This might readily be the
cause of masturbation, though in this case the vice had
been acquired many years before, and was still continued
in spite of all efforts to reform.
</p><p>Lying upon the back or upon the abdomen frequently
leads to self-abuse, by provoking sexual excitement.
Certain kinds of exercise, climbing in particular, have been
attended by the same results. It is said that children
sometimes experience genital excitement amounting to
pleasure as the result of whipping.
</p><p>The author has met only two cases of this sort. In
one, a boy acquired the habit of masturbation through
experiencing voluptuous sensations while climbing, the
ultimate effect of which was an obstinate case of epilepsy.
Another lad experienced a high degree of sexual excitement
when spanked by his teacher; and in still another
case, the excitement resulted from horseback-riding.
</p><p>Influence of Stimulants. &mdash; The use of stimulants of
any kind is a fruitful cause of the vice. Tea and coffee
have led thousands to perdition in this way. The
influence of tobacco is so strongly shown in this direction
that it is doubtful if there can be found a boy who has
attained the age of puberty, and has acquired the habit
of using tobacco, who is not also addicted to this vile
<pb n="245"/>
practice. Candies, spices, cinnamon, cloves, peppermint,
and all strong essences powerfully excite the genital
organs, and lead to the same result.
</p><p>It should be further added that there is evidence
that a powerful predisposition to this vice is transmitted
to the children of those who have themselves been
guilty of it.
</p><p>Scythians. &mdash; "In the Caucasus there are individuals
who lose the attributes of virility before old age; their
beard falls off; their genital organs atrophy; their
amorous desires disappear; their voice becomes feeble; their
body loses its force and energy; and at last they come
to a condition where they assume a feminine costume,
and assimilate to women in many of their occupations.
The disease has been described by both Herodotus and
Hippocrates. According to Herodotus, the disease was
a punishment upon the Scythians for pillaging the temple
at Ascalon. Hippocrates says that these impotent
Scythians were called Anandrii, and he says that the
disease was excited by excessive riding on horseback
According to Allemand, the disease is caused by seminal
emissions produced by horseback-riding. Moreau,
just cited, refers to Esquirol, Morel, Moreau (de Tours),
Luys, Azam, etc. Dr. Hammond, in a recent paper on
this subject, delivered before the American Neurological
Association, states that in New Mexico, among the
Pueblo Indians, who are the descendants of the Aztecs,
there exist what are called `Mujerados,' which means,
literally, `womaned,' or feminine. These Mujerados
have protuberant abdomens, well-developed mammary
glands, rounded and soft limbs, shrunken genital organs.
high, thin, cracked voices, and pubes devoid of hair.
<pb n="246"/>
Dr Hammond describes two cases to whom this
description is applied, although one did not have any
unusual development of the mammary glands. One
had been a Mujerado for seven and the other for ten
years; both dressed like women and one appeared like
a woman, both dressed and undressed. A Mujerado is
found, he asserts) in every Pueblo tribe, and is an
important person in the religious ceremonies, which are
conducted very secretly in the spring. In order to
make a Mujerado, a very strong man is selected;
masturbation is performed upon him many times a day; he
has to ride almost continuously on horseback, without
saddle. By this process the genital organs become
much excited, and seminal losses are produced; the
nutrition of the organs is interfered with; they grow
smaller and weaker, and, in time, desire and power
cease; then follow the changes in character, the desire
to dress like a woman, and to engage in feminine
occupations, just as with the Scythians; courage and
manhood are lost; wives and children, with those who have
them, pass from their control. The Mujerado is held
in honor, although men do not associate with him &mdash; only
women. The only difference between these Mujerados
and the Anandrii of the Scythians is, that in the case
of the Scythians the condition is brought on accidentally,
as a result of excessive horseback-riding, while in
the case of the Indians it is brought on intentionally
for religious purposes, the philosophy in both cases
being the same &mdash; excessive equitation following masturbation,
masturbation bringing on an unnaturally excitable
condition of the parts, and preparing them for
involuntary emissions after excessive horseback-riding."[18]

</p><p>Sexual Perversion. &mdash; The same author quoted above,
remarks as follows upon this point: &mdash;
</p><p>"I was at one time consulted by a man whose
constant desire was to attain sexual gratification, not in
the normal way or by masturbation, but by performing
the masturbating act on some other person; and, in his
case, it had become a mania practically, so that he was
a great sufferer, and very earnestly sought relief. The
patient had a number of symptoms of nervous trouble,
of which this, on which he specially sought advice, was
one. I saw the patient but once, and do not know the
result of the plan of treatment proposed. In this case
there was a combination of mental and physical infirmities.
I am pursuaded that a nervous constitution and
excessive nervous susceptibility going on to debility,
tend to induce the habit of `mental masturbation,' as
well as both natural and unnatural excess in sexual
indulgence. The strong, the phlegmatic, the healthy,
the well-balanced temperaments &mdash; those who live outdoors
and work with the muscles more than with the
mind &mdash; are not tormented with sexual desire to the same
degree or in the same way as the hysterical, the
sensitive, the nervous &mdash; those who live indoors and use mind
much and muscle very little. Dr. Boteler, who has
had much experience as a physician among the North
American Indians, tells me that Indian boys do not
masturbate, and do not, as a rule, in most of the
tribes, commit excesses in sexual indulgence prior to
marriage; and it is quite safe to assume, reasoning
deductively and inductively from a general knowledge of
the nervous, from observation among savages and
semi-savages, among the negroes, and among the strong,
<pb n="248"/>
healthy farming population in all civilized countries, that
those who live outdoors and have well-balanced constitutions
of the old-fashioned sort, are not annoyed by
sexual desire when they have no opportunities for
gratification, nor to the same degree as the delicate, finely
organized lads of our cities and of the higher civilization."
</p><p>Signs of Self-Abuse. &mdash; The net which this vice weaves
around its victim is so strong, and its meshes are so
elaborately interwoven with all his thoughts, his habits,
and his very being, when it has been long indulged, that
it is important to be able to detect it when first acquired,
as it may then be much more easily overcome than at
any subsequent period. It is often no easy matter to
do this, as the victim will resort to all manner of cunning
devices to hide his vice, and will not scruple to falsify
concerning it, when questioned. To be able to accomplish
this successfully, requires a careful study, first, of
the signs by which those who indulge in the practice
may be known, and, secondly, of the habits of the individuals.
</p><p>In considering the subject, it will be found that there
are two classes of signs, as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>1. Those which may arouse suspicion; but any one
of which, taken singly, would not be an evidence of
practice.
</p><p>2. Those which may be regarded as positive. Several
suspicious signs together may constitute a positive sign.
Under these two heads, we will consider the signs of
this vile habit.
</p><p>It is well to bear in mind the fact that one or two
suspicious signs are not evidence of the disease. It is
<pb n="249"/>
likewise well to remember that the habit may be found
where least looked for, and where one would have a right
to expect perfect purity. Prejudice must be allowed no
voice upon either side. A writer has said that every
young person under puberty ought to be suspected of
the disease. We can hardly indorse this remark in full,
but it would be at least wise for every guardian of
children to criticise most carefully their habits, and to
quickly detect the first indications of sinful practices.
Parents must not think that their children, at least, are
too good to engage in such sinful abuses. It is most
probable that <hi rend="italic">their</hi> children are very like those of their
neighbors; and any amount of natural goodness is not a
protection against this insidious vice when it presents
itself as a harmless pleasure to the unwarned and ignorant
child.
</p><p>Suspicious Signs. &mdash; The following symptoms, occurring
in the mental and physical character and habits of a
child or young person, may well give rise to grave
suspicions of evil, and should cause parents or guardians to
be on the alert to root it out if possible: &mdash;
</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">General debility</hi>, coming upon a previously healthy
child, marked by emaciation, weakness, an unnatural
paleness, colorless lips and gums, and the general
symptoms of exhaustion, when it cannot be traced to any
other legitimate cause, as internal disease, worms, grief,
overwork, poor air, or poor food, and when it is not
speedily removed by change of air or appropriate remedial
measures, may be safely attributed to solitary vice,
no matter how far above natural suspicion the individual
may be. Mistakes will be rare indeed when such a
judgment is pronounced under the circumstances named.
<pb n="250"/>
</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Early symptoms of consumption</hi>, or what are
supposed to be such, as cough, and decrease in flesh, with
short breathing and soreness of the lungs or muscles of
the chest, are often solely the result of this vice. That
such is the case may be considered pretty surely
determined if physical examination of the lungs reveals no
organic disease of those organs. But it should be
remembered that solitary vice is one of the most
frequent causes of early consumption. Several cases which
strikingly prove this, have fallen under our own observation.
</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Premature and defective development</hi> is a symptom
closely allied to the two preceding. When it cannot be
traced to such natural causes as overstudy, overwork,
lack of exercise, and other influences of a similar nature,
it should be charged to self-abuse. The early exercise
of the genital organs hastens the attainment of puberty
in many cases, especially when the habit is acquired
early; but at the same time it saps the vital energies so
that the system is unable to manifest that increased
energy in growth and development which usually occurs
at this period. In consequence, the body remains small,
or does not attain that development which it otherwise
would. The mind is dwarfed as well as the body.
Sometimes the mind suffers more than the body in lack
of development, and sometimes the reverse is true.
This defective development is shown in the physical
organization of males, in the failure of the voice to
increase in volume and depth of tone as it should, in
deficient growth of the beard, and in failure of the chest to
become full and the shoulders broad. The mind and
character show the dwarfing influence by failure to
<pb n="251"/>
develop those qualities which especially distinguish a
noble manhood. In the female, defective development
is shown by menstrual derangements, by defective
growth either in stature, or as shown in unnatural
slimness, and in a failure to develop the graces and
pleasing character which should distinguish early
womanhood. Such signs deserve careful investigation;
for they can only result from some powerfully blighting
influence.
</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Sudden change in disposition</hi> is a sign which may
well arouse suspicion. If a boy who has previously
been cheerful, pleasant, dutiful, and gentle, suddenly
becomes morose, cross, peevish, irritable, and disobedient,
be sure that some foul influence is at work with
him. When a girl, naturally joyous, happy, confiding,
and amiable, becomes unaccountably gloomy, sad, fretful,
dissatisfied, and unconfiding, be certain that a blight of
no insignificant character is resting upon her. Make a
careful study of the habits of such children; and if there
is no sudden illness to account for the change in their
character, it need not require long deliberation to arrive
at the true cause; for it will rarely be found to be
anything other than solitary indulgence.
</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Lassitude</hi> is as unnatural for a child as for a young
kitten. A healthy child will be active, playful, full of
life and animal spirits. If a young child manifests
indisposition to activity, a dislike for play, lifelessness and
languor, suspect his habits, if there is no other
reasonable cause to which to attribute his unnatural want of
childish sprightliness.
</p><p>6. In connection with the preceding symptom will
generally be found, instead of that natural brilliancy of
<pb n="252"/>
expression in the eyes and countenance, an unnatural
dullness and vacantness altogether foreign to childhood.
This is a just ground for suspicion.
</p><p>7. <hi rend="italic">Sleeplessness</hi> is another symptom of significance.
Sound sleep is natural for childhood; and if sleeplessness
be not occasioned by dietetic errors, as eating indigestible
food, eating between meals, or eating late suppers,
it may justly be a cause for suspicion of evil habits.
</p><p>8. <hi rend="italic">Failure of mental capacity</hi> without apparent cause,
should occasion suspicion of evil practices. When a
child who has previously learned readily, mastered his
lessons easily, and possessed a retentive memory, shows
a manifest decline in these directions, fails to get his
lessons, becomes stupid, forgetful, and inattentive, he has
probably become the victim of a terrible vice, and is on
the road to speedy mental as well as physical ruin.
Watch him.
</p><p>9. <hi rend="italic">Fickleness</hi> is another evidence of the working of
some deteriorating influence; for only a weak mind is
fickle.
</p><p>10. <hi rend="italic">Untrustworthiness</hi> appearing in a child should
attract attention to his habits. If he has suddenly become
heedless, listless, and forgetful, so that he cannot be
depended upon, though previously not so, lay the blame
upon solitary indulgence. This vice has a wonderful
influence in developing untruthfulness. A child previously
honest, will soon become an inveterate liar under its
baneful influence.
</p><p>11. <hi rend="italic">Love of solitude</hi> is a very suspicious sign.
Children are naturally sociable, almost without exception.
They have a natural dread of being alone. When a
child habitually seeks seclusion without a sufficient cause,
<pb n="253"/>
there are good grounds for suspecting him of sinful habits.
The barn, the garret, the water-closet, and sometimes
secluded places in the woods are favorite resorts
of masturbators. They should be carefully followed and
watched, unobserved.
</p><p>12. <hi rend="italic">Bashfulness</hi> is not infrequently dependent upon
this cause. It would be far from right to say that every
person who is excessively modest or timid is a masturbator;
but there is a certain timorousness which seems
to arise from a sense of shame or fear of discovery that
many victims of this vice exhibit, and which may be
distinguished from natural modesty by a little experience.
One very common mode of manifestation of this timidity
is the inability to look a superior, or any person who is
esteemed pure, in the eye. If spoken to, instead of looking
directly at the person to whom he addresses an answer,
the masturbator looks to one side, or lets his eyes
fall upon the ground, seemingly conscious that the eye
is a wonderful tell-tale of the secrets of the mind.
</p><p>13. <hi rend="italic">Unnatural boldness</hi>, in marked contrast with the
preceding sign, is manifested by a certain class of
victims. It can be as easily distinguished, however, as
unnatural timidity. The individual seems to have not the
slightest appreciation of propriety. He commits openly
the most uncouth acts, if he does not manifest the most
indecent unchastity of manner. When spoken to, he
stares rudely at the person addressing him, often with a
very unpleasant lear upon his countenance. In some
few cases there seems to be a curious combination of
conditions. While mentally fearful, timid, and hesitating,
the individual finds himself, upon addressing a
person, staring at him in the most ungainly manner.
<pb n="254"/>
He is conscious of his ill manners, but is powerless to
control himself. This sign is one which could hardly
be of use to any except a very close observer, however,
as few can read upon the countenance the operations of
the mind.
</p><p>14. <hi rend="italic">Mock piety</hi> &mdash; or perhaps we should more properly
designate it as mistaken piety &mdash; is another peculiar
manifestation of the effects of this vicious practice. The
victim is observed to become transformed, by degrees,
from a romping, laughing child, full of hilarity and frolic,
to a sober and very sedate little Christian, the
friends think, and they are highly gratified with the
piety of the child. Little do they suspect the real cause
of the solemn face; not the slightest suspicion have they
of the foul orgies practiced by the little sinner. By the
aid of friends, he may soon add hypocrisy to his other
crimes, and find in assumed devotion a ready pretense
for seeking solitude. Parents will do well to investigate
the origin of this kind of religion in their children.
</p><p>15. <hi rend="italic">Easily frightened</hi> children are abundant among
young masturbators, though all easily frightened persons
are not vicious. It is certain, however, that the vice
greatly exaggerates natural fear, and creates an unnatural
apprehensiveness. The victim's mind is constantly
filled with vague forebodings of evil. He often looks
behind him, looks into all the closets, peeps under the
bed, and is constantly expressing fears of impending
evil. Such movements are the result of a diseased
imagination, and they may justly give rise to suspicion.
</p><p>16. <hi rend="italic">Confusion of ideas</hi> is another characteristic of the
devotee of this artful vice. If he attempts to argue, his
points are not clearly made. He may be superficially
<pb n="255"/>
quick and acute, but is incapable of deep thought or
abstruse reasoning, and is often very dull of apprehension.
Ideas are not presented in logical order, but seem to fall
out promiscuously, and fairly represent the condition of
a disordered brain. Attempts at joking are generally
failures, as the jest is sure to be inappropriate or vulgar,
and no one but himself sees any occasion for laughter,
except at his stupidity. Such individuals are not scarce.
</p><p>17. Boys in whom the habit has become well developed,
sometimes manifest a decided aversion to the society
of girls; but this is not nearly so often the case as
some authors seem to indicate. It would rather appear
that the opposite is more often true. Girls usually show
an increasing fondness for the society of boys, and are
very prone to exhibit marked evidences of real wantonness.
</p><p>18. <hi rend="italic">Round shoulders</hi> and a stooping posture in sitting
are characteristics of young masturbators of both sexes.
Whenever a child seats himself, the head and shoulders
droop forward, giving to the spine a curved appearance.
</p><p>19. <hi rend="italic">Weak backs, pains in the limbs, and stiffness of the
joints</hi>, in children, are familiar signs of the habit. To
the first of these conditions is due the habitual stooping
posture assumed by these children. The habit referred
to is not the only cause of these conditions; but its
causative occurrence is sufficiently frequent to give it no
small importance as a suspicious indication.
</p><p>20. <hi rend="italic">Paralysis</hi> of the lower extremities, coming on
without apparent cause, is not infrequently the result of
solitary indulgence, even in very small children. We
have seen several cases in which this condition was
traced to the habit of masturbation, in children under
six years of age.
<pb n="256"/>
</p><p>21. The <hi rend="italic">gait</hi> of a person addicted to this vice will
usually betray him to one who has learned to distinguish
the peculiarities which almost always mark the
walk of such persons. In a child, a dragging, shuffling
walk is to be suspected. Boys, in walking rapidly,
show none of that elasticity which characterizes a
natural gait, but walk as if they had been stiffened in the
hips, and as though their legs were pegs attached to the
body by hinges. The girl wriggles along in a style
quite as characteristic, though more difficult to detect
with certainty, as girls are often so "affected" in
their walk. Unsteadiness of gait is an evidence seen
in both sexes, especially in advanced cases.
</p><p>22. <hi rend="italic">Bad positions</hi> in bed are evidences which should
be noticed. If a child lies constantly upon its abdomen,
or is often found with its hands about the genitals, it
may be at least considered in a fair way to acquire the
habit, if it has not already done so.
</p><p>23. <hi rend="italic">Lack of development of the breasts</hi> in females,
after puberty, is a common result of self-pollution. Still
it would be entirely unsafe to say that every female
with small mammary glands had been addicted to this
vice, especially at the present time, when a fair natural
development is often destroyed by the constant pressure
and heat of "pads." But this sign may well be
given a due bearing.
</p><p>24. <hi rend="italic">Capricious appetite</hi> particularly characterizes
children addicted to secret vice. At the commencement of
the practice, they almost invariably manifest great voracity
for food, gorging themselves in the most gluttonous
manner. As the habit becomes fixed, digestion becomes
impaired, and the appetite is sometimes almost wanting,
and at other times almost unappeasable.
<pb n="257"/>
</p><p>25. One very constant peculiarity of such children
is their extreme fondness for unnatural, hurtful, and
irritating foods. Nearly all are greatly attached to salt,
pepper, spices, cinnamon, cloves, vinegar, mustard,
horseradish, and similar articles, and use them in most
inordinate quantities. A boy or girl who is constantly
eating cloves or cinnamon, or who will eat salt in quantities
without other food, gives good occasion for suspicion.
</p><p>26. <hi rend="italic">Eating clay, slate-pencils, plaster, chalk</hi>, and other
indigestible articles is a practice to which girls who
abuse themselves are especially addicted. The habit
sometimes becomes developed to such a wonderful extent
that the victims almost rival the clay-eaters of the
Amazon in gratifying their propensity.
</p><p>27. Disgust for simple food is one of the traits which
a victim of this vice is likely to possess. He seems to
loathe any food which is not rendered hot and stimulating
with spices and other condiments, and cannot be
induced to eat it.
</p><p>28. <hi rend="italic">The use of tobacco</hi> is good presumptive evidence
that a boy is also addicted to a practice still more filthy.
Exceptions to this rule are very rare indeed, if they
exist, which we somewhat doubt. The same influences
which would lead a boy to the use of tobacco, would also
lead him to solitary vice, and each sin would serve to
exaggerate the other.
</p><p>29. <hi rend="italic">Unnatural paleness</hi> and colorless lips, unless they
can be otherwise accounted for, may be attributed to
secret sin. The face is a great tell-tale against this class
of sinners. Justice demands, however, that an individual
should be given the benefit of a doubt so long as
there is a chance for the production of these symptoms
<pb n="258"/>
by any other known cause, as overwork, mental anxiety,
or dyspepsia.
</p><p>30. <hi rend="italic">Acne</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">pimples</hi> on the face, is also among the
suspicious signs, especially when it appears upon the
forehead as well as upon other portions of the face.
Occasional pimples upon the chin are very common in
both sexes at puberty and for a few years afterward,
but are without significance, except that the blood may
be somewhat gross from unwholesome diet or lack of
exercise.
</p><p>31. <hi rend="italic">Biting the finger nails</hi> is a practice very common
in girls addicted to this vice. In such persons there
will also be found, not infrequently, slight soreness or
ulceration at the roots of the nails, and warts, one or
more, upon one or both the first two fingers of the hand,
usually the right.
</p><p>32. The eyes often betray much. If, in addition to
want of lustre and natural brilliancy, they are sunken,
present red edges, are somewhat sore, perhaps, and are
surrounded by a dark ring, the patient, especially if a
child, should be suspected and carefully watched. It
should be observed, however, that dyspepsia, debility
from any cause, and especially loss of sleep, will produce
some or all of these signs, and no one should be accused
of the vice upon the evidence of these indications alone;
neither could he be justly suspected so long as his
symptoms could be accounted for by legitimate causes.
</p><p>33. An habitually moist, cold hand, is a suspicious
circumstance in a young person who is not known to be
suffering from some constitutional disease.
</p><p>34. Palpitation of the heart, frequently occurring,
denotes a condition of nervous disturbance which has
<pb n="259"/>
some powerful cause, and which may often be found to
be the vice in question.
</p><p>35. <hi rend="italic">Hysteria</hi> in females may be regarded as a suspicious
circumstance when frequently occurring on very
slight occasions, and especially if there is no hereditary
tendency to the disease.
</p><p>36. <hi rend="italic">Chlorosis</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">green sickness</hi>, is very often caused
by the unholy practice under consideration. It is very
commonly attributed, when occurring in young women,
to menstrual derangements; but it is only necessary to
remember that these menstrual irregularities are in many
cases the result of the same habit, as has been already
pointed out.
</p><p>37. <hi rend="italic">Epileptic fits</hi> in children are not infrequently the
result of vicious habits.
</p><p>38. <hi rend="italic">Wetting the bed</hi> is an evidence of irritation which
may be connected with the practice; it should be looked
after.
</p><p>39. <hi rend="italic">Unchastity of speech</hi> and fondness for obscene
stories betray a condition of mind which does not often
exist in youth who are not addicted to this vice.
</p><p>As previously remarked, no single one of the above
signs should be considered as conclusive evidence of
the habit in any individual; but any one of them may,
and should, arouse suspicion and watchfulness. If the
habit really exists, but a short time will elapse before
other signs will be noticed; and when several point in
the same direction, the evidence may be considered
nearly, if not quite, conclusive. But persistent
watching will enable the positive signs to be detected sooner
or later, and then there can no longer be doubt. It is,
of course, necessary to give the individual no suspicion
<pb n="260"/>
that he is being watched, as that would put him so
effectually on his guard as, possibly, to defy detection.
</p><p>Positive Signs. &mdash; The absolutely positive signs of
solitary vice are very few. Of course the most certainly
positive of all is detection in the act. Sometimes this is
difficult, with such consummate cunning do the devotees
of the Moloch pursue their debasing practice. If a child
is noticed to seek a certain secluded spot with considerable
regularity, he should be carefully followed and secretly
watched, for several days in succession if need be. Many
children pursue the practice at night after retiring. If the
suspected one is observed to become very quickly quiet
after retiring, and when looked at, appears to be asleep,
the bedcloths should be quickly thrown off under some
pretense. If, in the case of a boy, the penis is found in
a state of erection, with the hands near the genitals, he
may certainly be treated as a masturbator without any
error. If he is found in a state of excitement, in connection
with the other evidences, with a quickening circulation,
as indicated by the pulse, or in a state of
perspiration, his guilt is certain, even though he may
pretend to be asleep; no doubt he has been addicted to
the vice for a considerable time to have acquired so
much cunning. If the same course is pursued with
girls, under the same circumstances, the clitoris will be
found congested, with the other genital organs, which
will also be moist from increased secretion. Other
conditions will be as nearly as possible the same as those in
the boy.
</p><p>Stains upon the night-shirt or sheets, occurring
before puberty, are certain evidences of the vice in boys,
as they are subject, before that time, to no discharge
<pb n="261"/>
which will leave a stain resembling that from the seminal
fluid, except the rare one from piles. In the very
young, these stains do not occur; but when the habit is
acquired before puberty, a discharge resembling semen
takes place before the ordinary period. Of course the
stains from urine will be easily distinguished from others.
The frequent occurrence of such stains after puberty is
a suspicious circumstance. A discharge in some respects
similar may occur in girls.
</p><p>Before puberty, the effect of the vice upon the genital
organs is to cause an unnatural development, in both
sexes, of the sensitive portions. When this is marked,
it is pretty conclusive evidence of the vice. In girls,
the vagina often becomes unnaturally enlarged, and
leucorrh&oelig;a is often present. After puberty, the organs
in males often diminish in size, and become unnaturally
lax and shrunken.
</p><p>All these signs should be thoroughly mastered by
those who have children under their care, and if not
continually watching for them, which would be an
unpleasant task, such should be on the alert to detect
the signs at once when they appear, and then carefully
seek for others until there is no longer any doubt about
the case.</p>

<head>RESULTS OF SECRET VICE.</head>

<p>The physician rarely meets more forlorn objects
than the victims of prolonged self-abuse. These
unfortunate beings he meets every day of his life, and listens
so often to the same story of shameful abuse and
retributive suffering, that he dreads to hear it repeated. In
these cases, there is usually a horrid sameness &mdash; the
same cause, the same inevitable results. In most cases,
the patient need not utter a word; for the physician can
read in his countenance his whole history, as can most
other people at all conversant with the subject.
</p><p>In order to secure the greatest completeness consistent
with necessary brevity, we will describe the effects
observed in males and those in females under separate
heads, noticing the symptoms of each morbid condition
in connection with its description.

EFFECTS IN MALES.
</p><p>We shall describe, first, the local effects, then the
general effects, physical and mental.
</p><p>Local Effects. &mdash; Excitement of the genital organs
produces the most intense congestion. No other organs
of the body are capable of such rapid and enormous
engorgement. When the act is frequently repeated,
this condition becomes permanent in some of the tissues,
particularly in the mucous membrane lining the urethra.
This same membrane continues into, and lines throughout,
the bladder, kidneys, and all the urinary organs, together
with the visicul&aelig; seminales, the ejaculatory ducts, the
vasa deferentia, and the testes. In consequence of this
<pb n="263"/>
continuity of tissue, any irritation affecting one part is
liable to extend to another, or to all the rest. We
mention this anatomical fact here as a help to the
understanding of the different morbid conditions which
will be noticed.
</p><p>Urethral Irritation. &mdash; The chronic congestion of the
urethra after a time becomes chronic irritability. The
tissue is unusually sensitive, this condition being often
indicated by a slight smarting in urination. It often
extends throughout the whole length of the urethra, and
becomes so intense that the passage of a sound, which
would occasion little if any sensation in a healthy organ,
produces the most acute pain, as we have observed in
numerous instances, even when the greatest care was
used in the introduction of the instrument.
</p><p>Shooting pains are often felt in the organ, due to this
irritation. The pain is of a smarting character, and is in
some cases most felt at the root, in others, at the head.
It often darts from one point to another. Just before
and just after urination the pain is most severe.
</p><p>Stricture. &mdash; Long-continued irritation of the mucous
membrane of the urethra produces, ultimately, inflammation
and swelling of the same in some portion of its extent.
This condition may become permanent, and then
constitutes real stricture, a most serious disease. More
often the swelling is but transient, being due to some
unusual excess, and will subside. Sometimes, also, a
temporary stricture is produced by spasmodic contraction
of the muscular fibers surrounding the urethra, which is
excited by the local irritation. This kind of stricture
is often met in the treatment of spermatorrh&oelig;a.
</p><p>Enlarged Prostate. &mdash; This painful affection is a fre-<pb n="264"/>
quent result of the chronic irritation in the urethra,
which the gland surrounds, the morbid action being
communicated to it by its proximity. A diseased action
is set up, which results in enlargement and hardening.
It is felt as a hard body just anterior to the anus, and
becomes by pressure the source of much additional mischief.
Sometimes the disease progresses to dangerous
ulceration. It is attended by heat, pressure, and pain
between the anus and the root of the penis.
</p><p>Permanent enlargement of the prostate is a very
serious matter, since it interferes with the proper
discharge of urine from the bladder, which ultimately leads
to disease of the bladder itself, and may result even in
death. This condition is the result of other forms of
sexual excess as well as self-abuse.
</p><p>Urinary Diseases. &mdash; The same congestion and irritability
extend to the bladder and thence to the kidneys,
producing irritation and inflammation of those organs.
Mucus is often formed in large quantities; sometimes
much is retained in the bladder. Earthy matter is
deposited, which becomes entangled in the mucus, and
thus a concretion, or stone, is produced, occasioning
much suffering, and perhaps death.
</p><p>We saw, not long since, a case of this kind. The
patient was nearly sixty years of age, and had practiced
masturbation from childhood. In consequence of his
vice, a chronic irritation of the urethra had been
produced, which was followed by enlargement of the
prostate, then by chronic irritation of the bladder, and the
formation of stone. His sufferings were most excruciating
whenever he attempted to urinate, which was only
accomplished with the greatest difficulty and suffering.
<pb n="265"/>
</p><p>One of the unpleasant results of irritation of the
lining membrane of the bladder is inability to retain the
urine long, which requires frequent urination, and often
causes incontinence of urine.
</p><p>Priapism. &mdash; This same morbid sensitiveness may produce
priapism, or continuous and painful erection, one of
the most "terrible and humiliating conditions," as Dr.
Acton says, to which the human body is subject. The
horrid desperation of patients suffering under this
condition, is almost inconceivable. It is, fortunately, rare, in
its most severe forms; but hundreds suffer from it to a
most painful degree as one of the punishments of the
transgression of nature's laws; and a most terrible
punishment it is.
</p><p>Piles, Prolapsus of Rectum, etc. &mdash; As the result of
the straining caused by stricture, piles, prolapsus of the
rectum, and fissure of the anus are not infrequently
induced, as the following case observed at Charity
Hospital, New York, illustrates: &mdash;
</p><p>The patient had a peculiar deformity of the genital
organs, <hi rend="italic">hypospadias</hi>, which prevented sexual intercourse,
in consequence of which he gave himself up to the
practice of self-abuse. He had become reduced to the
most deplorable condition of both mind and body, and
presented a most woe-begone countenance. In addition to
his general ailments, he suffered from extreme prolapsus
of the rectum, and a most painful anal fissure. His
condition was somewhat bettered by skillful surgical
treatment.
</p><p>Extension of Irritation. &mdash; Serious and painful as are
the affections already noticed, those which arise from
the extension of the congestion and irritation of the
<pb n="266"/>
urethra to those other organs most intimately connected
with the function of generation, are still more dreadful to
themselves, and far more serious in their consequences.
The irritation extends into the ejaculatory ducts,
thence backward into the seminal vesicles, and downward
through the vasa deferentia to the testes. These
organs become unnaturally excited, and their activity is
increased. The testicles form an abnormal amount of
spermatozoa; the seminal vesicles secrete their peculiar
fluid too freely. From these two sources combined, the
vesicles become loaded with seminal fluid, and this
condition gives rise to a great increase of sexual excitement.
</p><p>In cases of long standing, the irritation of the
urethra at the openings of the ejaculatory ducts, a point
just in front of the bladder, advances to inflammation
and ulceration. Here is now established a permanent
source of irritation, by which the morbid activity of the
testes and seminal vesicles is kept up and continually
increased. This condition is indicated by frequent
twitching of the ejaculatory and compressor muscles in
the perineum. It is also indicated by a burning sensation
at the root of the penis after urination, which, in
severe cases, amounts to very serious pain.
</p><p>Atrophy, or Wasting of the Testes. &mdash; The first
result of the irritation communicated to the testes, is,
as already remarked, increased activity; but this is
attended by swelling in some cases, more or less pain,
tenderness, and after a time, diminution in size.
</p><p>This degenerative process likewise affects the seminal
fluid, which becomes more or less deteriorated and
incapable of producing healthy offspring, even while it
<pb n="267"/>
retains the power of fecundating the ovum, which it also
ultimately loses, if the disease is not checked by proper
treatment, when the individual becomes hopelessly
impotent, &mdash; a happy result for the race; for it prevents the
possibility of his imparting to another being his debilitated
constitution.
</p><p>Varicocele. &mdash; This morbid condition consists in a
varicose state of the spermatic veins. It is almost
always found upon the left side, owing to an anatomical
peculiarity of the spermatic vein of that side. It has
been supposed to be a result of masturbation and its
effects, but is certainly caused otherwise in many cases.
It is not infrequently found in these patients; but Prof.
Bartholomew contends that even in such cases we should
"consider its presence, in general, as accidental."
Atrophy of the left testicle is often produced by the
pressure of the distended veins; but this does not
certainly occasion impotence. It sometimes occurs
simultaneously on both sides, and certainly greatly aggravates
the effects of self-abuse, if it is not itself an effect of the
vice.
</p><p>Nocturnal Emissions. &mdash; Seminal emissions during
sleep, usually accompanied by erotic dreams, are known
as nocturnal pollutions or emissions, and are often called
<hi rend="italic">spermatorrh&oelig;a</hi>, though there is some disagreement
respecting the use of the latter term. Its most proper
use is when applied to the entire group of symptoms
which accompany involuntary seminal losses.
</p><p>The masturbator knows nothing of this disease so
long as he continues his vile practice; but when he
resolves to reform, and ceases to defile himself
voluntarily, he is astonished and disgusted to find that the
<pb n="268"/>
same filthy pollutions occur during sleep without his
voluntary participation. He now begins to see something
of the ruin he has wrought. The same nightly
loss continues, sometimes being repeated several times
in a single night, to his infinite mortification and chagrin.
He hopes the difficulty will subside of itself, but his
hope is vain; unless properly treated, it will probably
continue until the ruin which he voluntarily began is
completed.
</p><p>This disease is the result of sexual excesses of any
kind; it is common in married men who have abused
the marriage relation, when they are forced to temporary
continence from any cause. It also occurs in those
addicted to mental unchastity, though they may be
physically continent. It is not probable that it would
ever occur in a person who had been strictly continent
and had not allowed his mind to dwell upon libidinous
imaginations.
</p><p>Exciting Causes. &mdash; The exciting causes which serve
to perpetuate this difficulty are chiefly two; viz., local
irritation and lewd thoughts.
</p><p>The first cause is usually chiefly located in the
urethra, and especially at the mouths of the ejaculatory
ducts. Distention of the seminal vesicles, with a
superabundance of seminal fluid, also acts as a source of
irritation. Constipation, worms, and piles have an irritating
influence, which is often very seriously felt.
</p><p>Unchaste thoughts act detrimentally in a twofold
way. They first stimulate the activity of the testes,
thus increasing the overloading of the seminal vesicles.
Lascivious thoughts during wakefulness are the chief
cause of lascivious dreams.
<pb n="269"/>
</p><p>Emissions do not usually occur during the soundest
sleep, but during that condition which may be characterized
as dozing, which is most often indulged early
in the morning after the soundest sleep is passed. This
fact has an important bearing upon treatment, as will be
seen hereafter.
</p><p>At first, the emissions are always accompanied by
dreams, the patient usually awaking immediately
afterward; but after a time they take place without dreams
and without awaking him, and are unaccompanied by
sensation. This denotes an advanced stage of the complaint.
</p><p>Certain circumstances greatly increase the frequency
of the emissions, and thus hasten the injury which they
are certain to accomplish if not checked; as neglect to
relieve the bladder and bowels at night, late suppers,
stimulating foods and drinks, and anything that will
excite the genital organs. Of all causes, amorous or erotic
thoughts are the most powerful. Tea and coffee, spices
and other condiments, and animal food have a special
tendency in this direction. Certain positions in bed
also serve as exciting or predisposing causes; as sleeping,
upon the back or the abdomen. Feather-beds and
pillows and too warm covering in bed are also injurious
for the same reason.
</p><p>In frequency, emissions will vary in different persons
from an occasional one at long and irregular intervals,
to two or three a week, or several &mdash; as many as four in
one case we have met &mdash; in a single night.
</p><p>The immediate effect of an emission will depend upon
the frequency of occurrence and the condition of the
individual. If very infrequent, and occurring in a com-<pb n="270"/>
paratively robust person, after the seminal vesicles have
become distended with seminal fluid, the immediate
effect of an emission may be a sensation of temporary
relief. This circumstance has led certain persons to
suppose that emissions are natural and beneficial. This
point will receive attention shortly.
</p><p>If the emissions are more frequent, or if they occur
in a person of a naturally feeble constitution, the
immediate effect is lassitude, languor, indisposition, and often
inability to perform severe mental or physical labor,
melancholy, amounting often to despair and even leading
to suicide, and an exaggeration of local irritation, and of
all the morbid conditions to be noticed under the head
of "General Effects." Headache, indigestion, weakness
of the back and knees, disturbed circulation, dimness of
vision, and loss of appetite are only a few of these.
</p><p>Are Occasional Emissions Necessary or Harmless?
 &mdash; That an individual may suffer for years an involuntary
seminal loss as often as once a month without apparently
suffering very great injury, seems to be a settled fact
with physicians of extensive experience, and is well
confirmed by observation; yet there are those who
suffer severely from losses no more frequent than this.
But when seminal losses occur more frequently than
once a month, they will certainly ultimate in great
injury, even though immediate ill effects are not noticed
as in exceptional cases they may not be. If argument
is necessary to sustain this position, as it hardly seems
to be, we would refer to the fact that seminal losses
rarely occur in those who are, and always have been,
continent both mentally and physically. They occur
the most infrequently in those who most nearly ap-<pb n="271"/>
proach the standard of perfect chastity; so that
whenever they occur, they may be taken as evidence of
ill-health or some form of sexual excess. This fact
clearly shows that losses of this kind are not natural.
</p><p>Emissions not Necessary to Health. &mdash; If it be
argued that an occasional emission is necessary to relieve
the overloaded seminal vesicles, we reply, The same
argument has been used as an apology for unchastity;
but it is equally worthless in both instances. It might
be as well argued that vomiting is a necessary physiological
and healthful act, and should occur with regularity,
because a person may so overload his stomach as to
make the act necessary as a remedial measure. Vomiting
is a diseased action, a pathological process, and is
occasioned by a voluntary transgression of the
individual. Hence, it is as unnecessary as gluttony, and
must be wasteful of vitality, even though rendered
necessary under some circumstances. So with emissions.
If a person allows his mind to dwell upon unchaste
subjects, indulges in erotic dreams, and riots in mental
lasciviousness, he may render an emission almost
necessary as a remedial effort. Nevertheless, he will suffer
from the loss of nervous energy just the same as though
he had not, by his own concupiscence, rendered it in
some degree necessary. And as it would have been
infinitely better for him to have retained and digested
food in his stomach instead of ejecting it, &mdash; provided it
were wholesome food, &mdash; so it would have been better for
him to have retained in his system the seminal fluid,
which would have been disposed of by the system, and
probably utilized to very great advantage in the repair
of the tissues.
<pb n="272"/>
</p><p>Eminent Testimony. &mdash; An eminent English physician,
Dr. Milton, who has treated many thousands of cases of
this disease, remarks in a world upon the subject as
follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"Anything beyond one emission a month requires
attention. I know this statement has been impugned,
but I am quite prepared to abide by it. I did not put
it forward till I considered I had quite sufficient evidence
in my hands to justify me in doing so."
</p><p>"An opinion prevails, as most of my readers are aware,
among medical men, that a few emissions in youth do
good instead of harm. It is difficult to understand how
an unnatural evacuation can do good, except in the case
of unnatural congestion. I have, however, convinced
myself that the principle is wrong. Lads never really
feel better for emissions; they very often feel decidedly
worse. Occasionally they may fancy there is a sense of
relief, but it is very much the same sort of relief that
a drunkard feels from a dram. In early life the stomach
may be repeatedly overloaded with impunity; but I
suppose few would contend that overloading was therefore
good. The fact is that emissions are invariably
more or less injurious; not always visibly so in youth,
nor susceptible of being assessed as to the damage
inflicted by any given number of them, but still contributing,
each in its turn, a mite toward the exhaustion and
debility which the patient will one day complain of."
</p><p>Diurnal Emissions. &mdash; As the disease progresses, the
irritation and weakness of the organs become so great
that an erection and emission occur upon the slightest
sexual excitement. Mere proximity to a female, or the
thought of one, will be sufficient to produce a pollution,
<pb n="273"/>
attended by voluptuous sensations. But after a time
the organs become so diseased and irritable that the
slightest mechanical irritation, as friction of the clothing,
the sitting posture, or riding horseback, will produce
a discharge which may or may not be attended
by sensation of any kind. Frequently, a burning or
more or less painful sensation occurs. After a time,
erection no longer takes place. Even straining at stool
will produce the discharge, or violent efforts to retain
the feces when there is unnatural looseness.
</p><p>The amount of the discharge may vary from a few
drops to one or two drams, or even more. The character
of the discharge is of considerable importance. When
it occurs under the circumstances last described, viz.,
without erection or voluptuous sensations, it may be of
a true seminal character, or it may contain no spermatozoa.
This point can be determined by the microscope
alone. The discharge is the result of sexual excitement
or irritation, nevertheless, and indicates a most deplorable
condition of the genital organs. The patient is
sometimes unnecessarily frightened by it, and often
exaggerates the amount of the losses, and the symptoms
arising from them. However, when a single nocturnal
emission occasions such detrimental results, what must
be the effect of repeated discharges occurring several
times a day, or every time an individual relieves his
bowels, urinates, or entertains an unvirtuous thought!
If the losses were always seminal, the work of ruin would
soon be complete; fortunately, those discharges which
are the most frequent are only occasionally of a true
seminal character. It is not so, however, as has been
claimed by some writers, one at least, that they are
<pb n="274"/>
never seminal, as we have proved by repeated microscopic
examinations.
</p><p>Causes of Diurnal Emissions. &mdash; The causes of these
discharges are spasmodic action of the muscles involved
in ejaculation, which is occasioned by local irritation,
and pressure upon the seminal vesicles by the distended
rectum or bladder. They denote a condition of debility
and irritation which may well occasion grave alarm.
</p><p>In occasional instances, the internal irritation reaches
such a hight that blood is discharged with the seminal
fluid.
</p><p>Spontaneous ejaculation as the result of a depraved
state of mind is not infrequent in women who give themselves
up to evil thoughts. The observations of the
author will support the view that this form of disease is
more frequent in women than in men. Women whose
sexual organs have been weakened by abuse are most
likely to suffer in this way, as also from involuntary
ejaculation occurring at night.
</p><p>Internal Emissions. &mdash; As the disease progresses,
external discharges finally cease, in some cases, or partially
so, and the individual is encouraged by that circumstance
to think that he is recovering. He soon discovers his
error, however, for he continues to droop, even though
the discharges apparently cease altogether. This seems
a mystery until some medical friend or a medical work
calls his attention to the fact that the discharges now
occur internally instead of externally, the seminal fluid
passing back into the bladder, and being voided with the
urine, a microscopic examination of which shows the
presence of zoosperms.
</p><p>An Important Caution. &mdash; It is necessary, however,
<pb n="275"/>
to caution the reader not to pronounce every whitish
sediment or flocculent matter found in the urine to be
a seminal discharge, for the great majority are of a
different character. They are most frequently simply
mucus or phosphates from the bladder. Seminal fluid
cannot be distinguished from mucus by any other than
a careful microscopic examination. A microscope of
good quality, and capable of magnifying at least one
hundred and fifty diameters, is required, together with
considerable skill in the operator. Quacks have done
an immense amount of harm by frightening patients into
the belief that they were suffering from discharges of
this kind, when there was, in fact, nothing more than a
copious deposit of phosphates, which is not at all
infrequent in nervous people, especially after eating.
</p><p>When the condition described does really exist,
however, the patient cannot make too much haste to put
himself under the care of a competent physician for
treatment. If there is even a reasonable suspicion that
it may exist, he should have his urine carefully examined
by one competent to criticise it intelligently.
</p><p>Spermatorrh&oelig;a. &mdash; By many authors, the term <hi rend="italic">spermatorrh&oelig;a</hi>
is confined entirely to this stage of the disease.
It is said that in many cases the forcible interruption
of ejaculation has been the cause of this unfortunate
condition. Such a proceeding is certainly very
hazardous.
</p><p>One more caution should be offered; viz., that the
occasional presence of spermatozoa in the urine is not a
proof of the existence of internal emissions, as a few
zoosperms may be left in the urethra after a voluntary
or nocturnal emission, and thus find their way into the
urine as it is discharged from the bladder.
<pb n="276"/>
</p><p>Impotence. &mdash; In the progress of the disease, a point
is finally reached when the victim not only loses all desire
for the natural exercise of the sexual function, but
when such an act becomes impossible. This condition
may have been reached even before all the preceding
symptoms have been developed. Ultimately it becomes
impossible to longer practice the abominable vice itself,
on account of the great degeneration and relaxation of
the organs. The approach of this condition is indicated
by increasing loss of erectile power, which is at first only
temporary, but afterward becomes permanent. Still the
involuntary discharges continue, and the victim sees
himself gradually sinking lower and lower into the pit which
his own hands have dug. The misery of his condition
is unimaginable, &mdash; manhood lost, his body a wreck, and
death staring him in the face.
</p><p>This is a brief sketch of the local effects of the
horrid vice of self-abuse. The description has not been at
all overdrawn. We have yet to consider the general
effects, some of which have already been incidentally
touched upon in describing nocturnal emissions, with
their immediate results.
</p><p>General Effects. &mdash; The many serious effects which
follow the habit of self-abuse, in addition to those
terrible local maladies already described, are the direct
result of two causes in the male; viz., &mdash;
</p><p>1. Nervous exhaustion.
</p><p>2. Loss of the seminal fluid.
</p><p>There has been much discussion as to which one of
these was the cause of the effects observed in these
cases. Some have attributed all the evil to one cause,
and some to the other. That the loss of semen is not
<pb n="277"/>
the only cause, nor, perhaps, the chief source of injury,
is proved by the fact that most deplorable effects of the
vice are seen in children before puberty, and also in
females, in whom no seminal discharge nor anything analogous
to it occurs. In these cases, it is the nervous
shock alone which works the evil.
</p><p>Again, that the seminal fluid is the most highly
vitalized of all the fluids of the body, and that its rapid
production is at the expense of a most exhaustive effort
on the part of the vital forces, is well attested by all
physiologists.
</p><p>The nervous shock accompanying the exercise of
the sexual organs, either natural or unnatural, is the
most profound to which the system is subject. The
whole nervous system is called into activity; and the
effects are occasionally so strongly felt upon a weakened
organism that death results in the very act. The subsequent
exhaustion is necessarily proportionate to the
excitement.
</p><p>It need not be surprising, then, that the effects of
the frequent operation of two such powerful influences
combined should be so terrible as they are found to be.
</p><p>General Debility. &mdash; Nervous exhaustion and the
loss of the vivifying influence of the seminal fluid,
produce extreme mental and physical debility, which
increases as the habit is practiced, and is continued by
involuntary emissions after the habit ceases. If the
patient's habits are sedentary, and if he had a delicate
constitution at the start, his progress toward the grave
will be fearfully rapid, especially if the habit were
acquired young, as it most frequently is by such boys,
they being generally precocious. Extreme emacia-<pb n="278"/>
tion, sallow or blotched skin, sunken eyes, surrounded
by a dark or blue color, general weakness, dullness,
weak back, stupidity, laziness, or indisposition to activity
of any kind, wandering and illy defined pains, obscure
and often terrible sensations, pain in back and limbs,
sleeplessness, and a train of morbid symptoms too long
to mention in detail, attend the sufferers.
</p><p>Consumption. &mdash; It is well recognized by experienced
medical men that this vice is one of the most
frequent causes of consumption. At least, such would
seem to be the declaration of experience, and the
following statistical fact adds weight to the conclusion: &mdash;
</p><p>"Dr. Smith read a paper before a learned medical
association a few years since, in which he pointed out
the startling fact that in one thousand cases of consumption,
five hundred and eighteen had suffered from some
form of sexual abuse, and more than four hundred had
been addicted to masturbation, or suffered from nocturnal
emissions."[19]


[19] Acton.

</p><p>"Most of those who early become addicted to self-pollution, are soon afterward the subjects, not merely of
one or more of the ailments already noticed, but also of
enlargements of the lymphatic and other glands, ultimately
of <hi rend="italic">tubercular deposits in the lungs</hi> and other
viscera, or of scrofulous disease of the vertebr&aelig; or bones,
or of other structures, more especially of the joints."[20]


[20] Copland.

</p><p>Many young men waste away and die of symptoms
resembling consumption which are solely the result of
the loathsome practice of self-abuse. The real number
of consumptives whose disease originates in this manner
can never be known.
<pb n="275"/>
</p><p>Dyspepsia. &mdash; Indigestion is frequently one of the
first results. Nervous exhaustion is always felt by the
stomach very promptly. When dyspepsia is once really
established, it reacts upon the genital organs, increasing
their irritability as well as that of all the rest of the
nervous system. Now there is no end to the ills which
may be suffered; for an impaired digestion lays the
system open to the inroads of almost any and every
malady.
</p><p>Heart Disease. &mdash; Functional disease of the heart,
indicated by excessive palpitation on the slightest
exertion, is a very frequent symptom. Though it unfits the
individual for labor, and causes him much suffering, he
would be fortunate if he escaped with no disease of a
more dangerous character.
</p><p>Throat Affections. &mdash; There is no doubt that many of
the affections of the throat in young men, and older ones,
which pass under the name of "clergyman's sore throat,"
are the direct result of masturbation and emissions.
</p><p>Dr. Acton cites several cases in proof of this, and
quotes the following letter from a young clergyman: &mdash;
</p><p>"When I began the practice of masturbation, at the
age of sixteen, I was in the habit of exercising my voice
regularly. The first part in which I felt the bad effects
of that habit was in the organs of articulation. After
the act, the voice wanted tone, and there was a disagreeable
feeling about the throat which made speaking a
source of no pleasure to me as it had been. By-and-by
it became painful to speak after the act. This arose
from a feeling as if a morbid matter was being secreted
in the throat, so acrid that it sent tears to the eyes
when speaking, and would have taken away the
<pb n="280"/>
breath if not swallowed. This, however, passed away
in a day or two after the act. In the course of years,
when involuntary emissions began to impair the
constitution, this condition became permanent. The throat
always feels very delicate, and there is often such
irritability in it, along with this feeling of the secretion
of morbid matter, as to make it impossible to speak
without swallowing at every second or third word.
This is felt even in conversation, and there is a great
disinclination to attempt to speak at all. In many
instances, in which the throat has been supposed to give
way from other causes, I have known this to be the real
one. May it not be that the general irritation always
produced by the habit referred to, shows itself also in
this organ, and more fully in those who are required
habitually to exercise it?"
</p><p>Nervous Diseases. &mdash; There is no end to the nervous
affections to which the sufferer from this vice is subjected.
Headaches, neuralgias, symptoms resembling hysteria,
sudden alternations of heat and cold, irregular flushing
of the face, and many other affections, some of the more
important of which we will mention in detail, are his
constant companions.
</p><p>Epilepsy. &mdash; This disease has been traced to the vile
habit under consideration in so many cases that it is now
very certain that in many instances this is its origin.
It is of frequent occurrence in those who have indulged
in solitary vice or any other form of sexual excess.
We have met a number of cases in which the disease
was due to this cause.
</p><p>Failure of Special Senses. &mdash; Dimness of vision,
amaurosis, spots before the eyes, with other forms of ocular
<pb n="281"/>
weakness, are common results of this vice. The same
degeneration and premature failure occur in the organs
of hearing. In fact, sensibility of all the senses becomes
in some measure diminished in old cases.
</p><p>Spinal Irritation. &mdash; Irritation of the spinal cord, with
its resultant evils, is one of the most common of the
nervous affections originating in this cause. Tenderness
of the spine, numerous pains in the limbs, and spasmodic
twitching of the muscles, are some of its results. Paralysis,
partial or complete, of the lower limbs, and even of
the whole body, is not a rare occurrence. We have seen
a number of cases in which this was well marked. Two
of the patients were small boys who began to excite the
genital organs at a very early age. In one, the paralytic
condition was complete when he was held erect.
The head fell forward, the arms and limbs hung down
helpless, the eyes rolled upward, and the saliva dribbled
from his mouth. When lying flat upon his back, he had
considerable control of his limbs. In this case, a
condition of priapism seems to have existed almost from birth,
owing to congenital phimosis. His condition was somewhat
improved by circumcision.
</p><p>In another case, in which phimosis also existed,
there was paralysis of a few of the muscles of the leg,
which produced club-foot. Circumcision was also
performed in this case, and the child returned in a few
weeks completely cured, without any other application,
though it had previously been treated in a great variety
of ways without success, all the usual remedies for club-foot proving ineffectual. Both of these cases appeared
in the clinic of Dr. Sayre at Bellevue Hospital, and were
operated upon by him.
<pb n="282"/>
</p><p>A few years ago, we observed several cases of spinal
disease which could be traced to no origin but masturbation.
Two patients were small boys, naturally quite
intelligent. They manifested all the peculiarities of
locomotor ataxia in older persons, walking with the
characteristic gait. The disease was steadily progressing in
spite of all attempts to stay it. An older brother had
died of the same malady, paralysis extending over the
whole body, and finally preventing deglutition, so that
he really starved to death.
</p><p>Insanity. &mdash; That solitary vice is one of the most
common causes of insanity, is a fact too well established
to need demonstration here. Every lunatic asylum
furnishes numerous illustrations of the fact. "Authors are
universally agreed, from Galen down to the present day,
about the pernicious influence of this enervating indulgence,
and its strong propensity to generate the very
worst and most formidable kinds of insanity. It has
frequently been known to occasion speedy and even
instant insanity."[21]


[21] Arnold.

</p><p>"Religious insanity," so-called, may justly be
attributed to this cause in a great proportion of cases. The
individual is conscience-smitten in view of his horrid
sins, and a sense of his terrible condition &mdash; ruined for
both worlds, he fears &mdash; goads him to despair, and his
weakened intellect fails, reason is dethroned, and he
becomes a hopeless lunatic. His friends, knowing nothing
of the real cause of his mysterious confessions of
terrible sin, think him over-conscientious, and lay the blame
of his insanity upon religion, when it is solely the result
of his vicious habits, of which they are ignorant.
<pb n="283"/>
</p><p>In other cases, the victim falls into a profound
melancholy from which nothing can divert him. He never
laughs; does not even smile. He becomes more and
more reserved and taciturn, and perhaps ends the scene
by committing suicide. This crime is not at all uncommon
with those who have gone the whole length of the
evil road. They find their manhood gone, the vice in
which they have so long delighted is no longer possible,
and in desperation they put an end to the miserable
life which nature might end in a few months if not
thus violently superseded.
</p><p>Idiocy. &mdash; If the practice is continued uninterruptedly
from boyhood to manhood, imbecility and idiocy are the
result. Demented individuals are met in no small
numbers in hospitals and asylums, and out of them as
well, who owe to this vice their awful condition. Plenty
of the half-witted men one meets in the every-day walks
of life, have destroyed the better half of their understanding
by this wretched practice.
</p><p>A Victim's Mental Condition Pictured. &mdash; The mental
condition of a victim of this vice cannot be better
described than is done in the following paragraphs by
one, himself a victim, though few of these unfortunate
individuals would be able to produce so accurate and
critical a portrait of themselves as is here drawn by M.
Rosseau, as quoted by Mr. Acton: &mdash;
</p><p>"One might say that my heart and my mind do not
belong to the same person. My feelings, quicker than
lightning, fill my soul; but instead of illuminating, they
burn and dazzle me. I feel everything; I see nothing.
I am excited, but stupid; I cannot think except in cold
blood. The wonderful thing is that I have sound enough
<pb n="284"/>
tact, penetration, even <hi rend="italic">finesse</hi>, if people will wait for me. I
make excellent impromptus at leisure; but at the moment
I have nothing ready to say or do. I should converse
brilliantly by post, as they say the Spaniards play at
chess. When I read of a Duke of Savoy who turned
back after starting on his journey to say, `In your
teeth! you Paris shop-keeper!' I said, `That is like
me!' "
</p><p>"But not only is it a labor to me to express, but also
to receive, ideas. I have studied men, and I think I am
a tolerably good observer; yet I can see nothing of
what I do see. I can hardly say that I see anything
except what I recall; I have no power of mind but in
my recollection. Of all that is said, of all that is done,
of all that passes in my presence, I feel nothing, I
appreciate nothing. The external sign is all that strikes
me. But after a while it all comes back to me."


EFFECTS IN FEMALES.

</p><p>Local Effects. &mdash; The local diseases produced by the
vice in females are, of course, of a different nature from
those seen in males, on account of the difference in
organization. They arise, however, in the same way,
congestions at first temporary, ultimately becoming
permanent, and resulting in irritation and various disorders.
</p><p>Leucorrh&oelig;a. &mdash; The results of congestion first appear
in the mucous membrane lining the vagina, which is
also injured by mechanical irritation, and consists of a
catarrhal discharge which enervates the system. By
degrees the discharge increases in quantity and virulence,
extending backward until it reaches the sensitive womb.
</p><p>Contact with the acrid, irritating secretions of the
<pb n="285"/>
vagina produces soreness of the fingers at the roots of
the nails, and also frequently causes warts upon the
fingers. Hence the value of these signs, as previously
mentioned.
</p><p>Uterine Disease. &mdash; Congestion of the womb is also
produced by the act of abuse; and as the habit is
continued, it also becomes permanent. This congestion,
together with the contact of the acrid vaginal discharge,
finally produces superficial ulceration or abrasion upon
the neck of the womb, together with other diseases.
</p><p>Another result of congestion is all kinds of menstrual
derangements after puberty, the occurrence of which
epoch is hastened by the habit.
</p><p>Prolapsus and various displacements are produced in
addition to these menstrual irregularities. The most
common forms of displacement resulting from self-abuse,
are retroflexion and retroversion, which are usually
accompanied by congestion and enlargement of the womb,
catarrh of the lining membrane of the womb, and relaxation
of the vagina. When these conditions are present
in a young woman, together with the enlargement of the
labia and clitoris, they may be looked upon as positive
evidence of the existence of the habit. After a large
experience in this class of cases, in which an opinion of
the nature of the case has been based upon the symptoms
named, the author has never found such an opinion
erroneous.
</p><p>Sterility. &mdash; Sterility, dependent on a total loss of
sexual desire and inability to participate in the sexual
act, is another condition which is declared by medical
authors to be most commonly due to previous habits of
self-abuse. In consequence of overexcitement, the organs
<pb n="286"/>
become relaxed, the natural tone is lost, and they become
so much depleted that they are unable to respond to the
natural stimulus, and the sexual act is not only not
accompanied by sensation, but is even attended by
disgust and a sense of extreme exhaustion. Among many
cases of this sort which have come to the notice of the
author, in only one or two has he been unable to trace
the abnormal conditions to the practice of self-abuse in
early life.
</p><p>Atrophy of Mamm&aelig;. &mdash; Closely connected with other
local results is the deficient development of the breasts
when the vice is begun before or at puberty, and atrophy
if it is begun or continued after development has
occurred. As previously remarked, this is not the sole
cause of small mamm&aelig;? but it is one of the great causes.
</p><p>Pruritis, or Itching Genitals. &mdash; This is an affection
not infrequent in these subjects. Continued congestion
produces a terrible itching of the genitals, which increases
until the individual is in a state of actual frenzy, and
the disposition to manipulate the genitals becomes
irresistible, and is indulged even in the presence of friends
or strangers, and though the patient be at other times a
young woman of exceptional modesty. In cases of this
kind, marked hypertrophy of the organ of greatest
sensibility has been observed, and in some cases amputation
of this part has been found the only cure.
</p><p>Nocturnal Ejaculation in Females. &mdash; A disorder
analogous to nocturnal emissions in the male, occurs in
females who have been addicted to this vice. An erotic
dream is accompanied by ejaculation, which is followed
on the succeeding day by all the unpleasant symptoms
of nervous irritability, headache, backache, etc., which
are experienced by males subject to seminal losses.
<pb n="287"/>
</p><p>General Effects. &mdash; The general effects in the female
are much the same as those in the male. Although
women suffer no seminal loss, they suffer the debilitating
effects of leucorrh&oelig;a, which is in some degree injurious
in the same manner as seminal losses in the male. But
in females the greatest injury results from the nervous
exhaustion which follows the unnatural excitement.
Nervous diseases of every variety are developed.
Emaciation and debility become more marked even than in
the male, and the worst results are produced sooner,
being hastened by the sedentary habits of these females.
Insanity is more frequently developed than in males.
</p><p>Spinal irritation is so frequent a result that a recent
surgical author has said that "spinal irritation in girls
and women is, in a majority of cases, due to self-abuse.[22]


[22] Davis.

</p><p>A Common Cause of Hysteria. &mdash; This, too, is one
of the most frequent causes of hysteria, chorea, and
epilepsy among young women, though not often recognized.
</p><p>A writer, quoted several times before in this work,
remarks as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"This is not a matter within the scope of general
investigation; truth is not to be expected from its
<hi rend="italic">habitu&eacute;s</hi>; parents are deceived respecting it, believing
rather what they wish than what they fear. Even the
physician can but suspect, till time develops more fully
by hysterias, epilepsies, spinal irritations, and a train of
symptoms unmistakable even if the finally extorted
confession of the poor victim did not render the matter clear.
Marriage does, indeed, often arrest this final catastrophe,
and thus apparently shifts the responsibility upon other
<pb n="288"/>
shoulders, and to the `injurious effects of early
marriages,' to the `ills of maternity,' are ascribed the results
of previous personal abuse.
</p><p>"For statistics and further information on this all-important subject, we must refer the reader to the opinions
of physicians who have the charge of our retreats
for the insane, lunatic asylums, and the like; to the
discriminating physicians of the families of the upper
classes, &mdash; stimulated alike by food, drinks, scenes where
ease is predominant, where indolence is the habit, and
novel-reading is the occupation, &mdash; for further particulars
on a subject here but barely alluded to."[23]


[23] Gardner.

EFFECTS UPON OFFSPRING.

</p><p>If sterility does not result, children are liable to be
"delicate, puny, decrepit, or subject to various congenital
maladies, especially of the nervous system, to idiocy
from deficient development of the brain, to hydrocephalus,
to epilepsy, convulsions, palsy. The scrofulous
diathesis, tubercular and glandular maladies, diseases of
the vertebr&aelig; and of the joints, softening of the central
portions of the brain, and tuberculous formations in the
membranes, palsy and convulsions, chorea, inflammations
of the membranes or substance of the brain or spinal
cord, and numerous other affections to which infants and
children are liable, very commonly result from the
practice of self-pollution by either of the parents previous to
marriage. But the evil does not always stop at this
epoch of existence; it often extends throughout the life
of the offspring, or it appears only with puberty and
mature age."
</p><p>Neglect Dangerous. &mdash; Too frequently, the victim of
<pb n="289"/>
self-abuse, when he finds himself suffering from the first
results of his sin, neglects to adopt any measures for the
cure of the disease. Not understanding its inveterate
character, he labors under the delusion that it will cure
itself in time. This is a fatal mistake. The diseased
conditions induced by this vice never improve themselves.
Their constant tendency is to increase in virulence
and inveteracy. The necessity of taking prompt
measures for relief is too apparent to need especial
emphasis.</p>

<head>TREATMENT FOR SELF-ABUSE AND
ITS EFFECTS.</head>

<p>After having duly considered the causes and effects
of this terrible evil, the question next in order for
consideration is, How shall it be cured? When a person
has, through ignorance or weakness, brought upon himself
the terrible effects described, how shall he find relief
from his ills, if restoration is possible? To the
answer of these inquiries, most of the remaining pages
of this work will be devoted. But before entering upon
a description of methods of <hi rend="italic">cure</hi>, a brief consideration
of the subject of <hi rend="italic">prevention</hi> of the habit will be in order.


PREVENTION OF SECRET VICE.

</p><p>For the rising generation, those yet innocent of the
evil practices so abundant in this age of sensuality, how
the evil habit may be prevented is the most important
of all questions connected with this subject. This topic
should be especially interesting to parents; for even
those who are themselves sensual, have seen enough of
the evils of such a life to wish that their children may
remain pure. There are, indeed, rare exceptions to this
rule; for we sometimes learn of parents who have
deliberately led their own children into vice, as though
they desired to make them share their shame and
wretchedness.
</p><p>Cultivate Chastity. &mdash; From earliest infancy, all those
influences and agencies which cultivate chastity, should
be brought into active exercise. These we need not
repeat here, having previously dwelt upon them so
<pb n="291"/>
fully. The reader is recommended to re-peruse the
portion of the work devoted to this subject, in connection
with the present section. If parents have themselves
indulged in this vice, they should use special care
that all the generative and gestative influences brought
to bear upon their children are the purest possible, so
that they may not inherit a predisposition to sin in this
direction.
</p><p>Special care should be exercised to avoid corrupt
servants and associates. Every servant not known to
be pure should be suspected until proof of innocence has
been established. They should be especially instructed
of the evil arising from manipulation of the genitals,
even in infants, as they may do immense harm through
simple ignorance.
</p><p>Timely Warning. &mdash; But in spite of chaste surroundings
and all other favorable circumstances, if the child is
left in ignorance of his danger, he may yet fall a victim
to the devices of servants or corrupt playmates, or may
himself make a fatal discovery. Hence arises the duty
of warning children of the evil before the habit has been
formed. This is a duty that parents seldom perform,
even when they are not unaware of the danger. They
in some way convince themselves that their children, at
least, are pure, even if others are corrupt. It is often
the most difficult thing in the world for parents to
comprehend the fact that <hi rend="italic">their</hi> children are not the best
children in the world, perfect paragons of purity and
innocence. There is an unaccountable and unreasonable
delicacy on the part of parents about speaking of sexual
subjects to their children. In consequence, their young,
inquisitive minds are left wholly in ignorance, unless,
perchance, they gain information from some vile source.
<pb n="299"/>
</p><p>Objections are raised against talking to children or
young persons about matters in any degree pertaining
to the sexual organs or functions. Some of the more
important of them are considered in the introduction to
this work, and we need not repeat here.
</p><p>Early Instruction. &mdash; The little one should be taught
from earliest infancy to abstain from handling the
genitals, being made to regard it as a very improper act.
When the child becomes old enough to understand and
reason, he may be further informed of the evil consequences;
then, as he advances in years, the functions of
the organs may be explained with sufficient fullness to
satisfy his natural craving for knowledge.
</p><p>If this course were pursued, how many might be
saved from ruin! It is, of course, necessary that the
parents shall themselves be acquainted with the true
functions of the organs before they attempt to teach any
one else, especially children. Many parents might receive
benefit from being obliged to "study up;" for it
is a lamentable fact, the ill effects of which are every
day seen, that a great many people have spent a very
large portion of their lives without ever ascertaining the
true function of the reproductive organs, though living
in matrimony for many years. Some of the consequences
of this ignorance have been portrayed in previous pages.
</p><p>"Oh! why did not some kind friend tell me of the
harm I was doing myself?" has been the exclamation
of many an unfortunate sufferer from this vice. A
warning voice should be raised to save those who are
ignorantly working their own destruction. Parents,
teachers, ministers, all who have access to the youth,
should sound the note of alarm in their ears, that if pos-<pb n="293"/>
sible they may be saved from the terrible thralldom
pictured by a writer in the following lines: &mdash;
</p><p>A Dark Picture. &mdash; "The waters have gone over me.
But out of the black depths, could I be heard, I would
cry to all those who have set a foot in the perilous flood.
Could the youth look into my desolation, and be made
to understand what a dreary thing it is when a man
shall feel himself going down a precipice with open eyes
and passive will &mdash; to see his destruction and have no
power to stop it, and yet to feel it all the way emanating
from himself; to perceive all goodness emptied out
of him, and yet not be able to forget a time when it was
otherwise; to bear about with him the spectacle of his
own self-ruin; could he feel the body of death out of
which I cry hourly with feebler and feebler outcry to be
delivered."


CURATIVE TREATMENT OF THE EFFECTS
OF SELF-ABUSE.

</p><p>When the habit and its effects are of very short
duration, a cure is very readily accomplished, especially in
the cases of children and females, as in them the evils
begun are not continued in the form of involuntary
pollutions. In cases of longer standing in males, the task
is more difficult, but still the prospect of recovery is
very favorable, provided the co-operation of the patient
can be secured; without this, little can be done. But
in these cases, the patient may as well be told at the
outset that the task of undoing the evil work of years of
sin is no easy matter. It can only be accomplished by
determined effort, by steady perseverance in right doing,
and in the application of necessary remedies. Those
<pb n="294"/>
who have long practiced the vice, or long suffered
severely from its effects, have received an injury which
will inevitably be life-long to a greater or less extent in
spite of all that can be done for them. Yet such need
not despair, for they may receive inestimable benefit by
the prevention of greater damage, which they are sure
to suffer if the disease is allowed to go unchecked.
</p><p>Cure of the Habit. &mdash; The preliminary step in treatment
is always to cure the vice itself if it still exists.
The methods adopted for this purpose must differ
according to the age of the individual patient.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">In children</hi>, especially those who have recently
acquired the habit, it can be broken up by admonishing
them of its sinfulness, and portraying in vivid colors its
terrible results, if the child is old enough to comprehend
such admonitions. In addition to faithful warnings, the
attention of the child should be fully occupied by work,
study, or pleasant recreation. He should not be left
alone at any time lest he yield to temptation. Work is
an excellent remedy; work that will really make him
very tired, so that when he goes to bed he will have no
disposition to defile himself. It is best to place such a
child under the care of a faithful person of older years,
whose special duty it shall be to Watch him night and
day until the habit is thoroughly overcome.
</p><p>In younger children, with whom moral considerations
will have no particular weight, other devices may be
used. Bandaging the parts has been practiced with
success. Tying the hands is also successful in some
cases; but this will not always succeed, for they will
often contrive to continue the habit in other ways, as
by working the limbs, or lying upon the abdomen.
<pb n="295"/>
Covering the organs with a cage has been practiced
with entire success. A remedy which is almost always
successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when
there is any degree of phimosis. The operation should
be performed by a surgeon without administering an
an&aelig;sthetic, as the brief pain attending the operation will
have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be
connected with the idea of punishment, as it may well
be in some cases. The soreness which continues for
several weeks interrupts the practice, and if it had not
previously become too firmly fixed, it may be forgotten
and not resumed. If any attempt is made to watch the
child, he should be so carefully surrounded by vigilance
that he cannot possibly transgress without detection.
If he is only partially watched, he soon learns to elude
observation, and thus the effect is only to make him
cunning in his vice.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">In adults</hi> or youth a different plan must be pursued.
In these cases, moral considerations, and the inevitable
consequences to health of body and mind, are the chief
influences by which a reform is to be effected, if at all.
These considerations may be urged with all possible
eloquence and earnestness, but should not be exaggerated.
The truth is terrible enough. If there are any
special influences which may be brought to bear upon a
particular individual, &mdash; and there always will be something
of this sort, owing to peculiarities of temperament
or circumstances, &mdash; these should be promptly employed,
and applied in such a manner as to secure for them their
full bearing.
</p><p>Through the courtesy of Dr. Archibald, Superintendent
of the Iowa Asylum for Feeble-Minded Children,
<pb n="296"/>
we have become acquainted with a method of treatment
of this disorder which is applicable in refractory cases,
and we have employed it with entire satisfaction. It
consists in the application of one or more silver sutures in
such a way as to prevent erection. The prepuce, or foreskin,
is drawn forward over the glans, and the needle to
which the wire is attached is passed through from one side
to the other. After drawing the wire through, the ends
are twisted together, and cut off close. It is now
impossible for an erection to occur, and the slight
irritation thus produced acts as a most powerful means of
overcoming the disposition to resort to the practice.
</p><p>In females, the author has found the application of
pure carbolic acid to the clitoris an excellent means of
allaying the abnormal excitement, and preventing the
recurrence of the practice in those whose will-power has
become so weakened that the patient is unable to exercise
entire self-control.
</p><p>The worse cases among young women are those in
which the disease has advanced so far that erotic
thoughts are attended by the same voluptuous sensations
which accompany the practice. The author has met many
cases of this sort in young women, who acknowledged
that the sexual orgasm was thus produced, often several
times daily. The application of carbolic acid in
the manner described is also useful in these cases in
allaying the abnormal excitement, which is a frequent
provocation of the practice of this form of mental masturbation.
</p><p>But after all, the most must be done by the individual
himself. All that others can do for him is to
surround him with favoring circumstances, and arouse
<pb n="297"/>
him to a proper sense of his real condition and danger.
If this can be thoroughly accomplished, there is much
reason to hope; but if the individual has become so lost
to all sense of purity, all aspirations toward purity, that
he cannot be made to feel the need of reformation, his
case is hopeless.
</p><p>How May a Person Help Himself? &mdash; The following
suggestions will be found useful in fighting the battle
with vice and habit: &mdash;
</p><p>1. Begin by a resolution to reform, strengthened by
the most solemn vows.
</p><p>2. Resolve to reform <hi rend="italic">now</hi>; not to-morrow or next
week, but this very minute. Thousands have sunk to
perdition while resolving to indulge "only this once."
</p><p>3. Begin the work of reform by purging the mind.
If a lewd thought enters the mind, dispel it at once.
Cultivate a loathing for concupiscence. Never harbor
such ideas for an instant; for they will surely lead to
the overt act. If, perchance, the physical sin should
not be committed, the thought itself is sin, and it leaves
a physical as well as a moral scar almost as deep and
hideous as that inflicted by the grosser crime.
</p><p>4. As a help to purity of mind, whenever impure
thoughts enter, immediately direct the mind upon the
purest object with which you are acquainted. Flee from
the special exciting cause, if there is one, and engage in
some active labor or other exercise that will divert the
mind into another channel.
</p><p>5. Avoid solitude; for then it is that temptation
comes, and you are most likely to fail. Avoid, equally,
all other causes which may lead to the act.
</p><p>6. Strictly comply with all the rules laid down for
<pb n="298"/>
the cultivation of chastity and the maintenance of continence.
</p><p>7. Above all, seek for grace and help from the
Source of all spiritual strength in every time of temptation,
relying upon the promise, "Seek, and ye shall
find."
</p><p>Hopeful Courage. &mdash; All individual who will earnestly
set himself about the work of purifying his mind and
redeeming his body, if he will conscientiously adopt, and
perseveringly apply, the remedies pointed out, <hi rend="italic">may be
sure of success</hi>. There can be no possible chance for
failure. Triumph is certain. Patience may be tried
and faith tested, but unwavering trust in God and
nature, and an executed determination to do all on his
part, will bring to every such one certain recovery.
There may be some scars left, a few traces of the injury
wrought; but the deliverance will be none the less
triumphant. Faith and perseverance will work wonders.
</p><p>General Regimen and Treatment. &mdash; After long
abuse of the sexual organs, and in many cases after a
short course of sin, the whole system becomes deteriorated;
digestion is impaired; the muscles are weakened;
the circulation is unbalanced; the nerves are irritable,
the brain &mdash; especially the back and lower portion of it &mdash;
is congested; the skin is torpid; the bowels are inactive
and the general health is deranged in almost every
particular. All these morbid conditions serve to keep
up the very difficulty which has produced and is
increasing them. Any curative effort, then, to be effective,
must be directed to these as well as to local conditions;
and it is pretty certainly established that local remedies
or applications alone will rarely accomplish any appreciable
good, at least of a permanent character.
<pb n="299"/>
</p><p>Mental and Moral Treatment. &mdash; The greatest impediment
to recovery is usually found in the mind of the
patient. His hopeless despair, melancholy, sullen apathy
in many cases, want of energy, and fickleness of mind
thwart all attempts that are made for him. In other
cases, the want of will-power, or neglect to exercise the
will in controlling the thoughts, completely counteracts
all that can be done for him. He must be made to
understand this well, and then all possible means must be
employed to attract his attention from himself, from
brooding over his ills. Occupy him, interest him, or
teach him to occupy and interest himself. The enthusiastic
study of some one of the natural sciences is a most
excellent auxiliary in effecting this.
</p><p>The thing of first importance is that the patient
should obtain command of his thoughts; by this means
he can do more for himself than all others can do for
him. "But I cannot control my thoughts," says the
patient. A young man said to me, "O doctor, you do n't
know how I feel. I despise myself; I hate myself; I
often feel inclined to kill myself. My mind is always
full of abominable images; my thoughts run away with
me, and I cannot help myself." The tears ran down
his face in streams as he told of his slavery. He
solemnly affirmed that he had never performed the act of
self-pollution but once in his life; and yet for years he
had been a constant sufferer from nocturnal emissions
until his manhood was nearly lost, evidently the result
of the mental Onanism which he had practiced without
imagining the possibility of harm.
</p><p>Control of the Thoughts. &mdash; But it is not true that
control of the thoughts is impossible. Thoughts are the
<pb n="300"/>
result of the action of the brain; and the action of the
brain may be controlled as well as the movements of a
voluntary muscle. It may be more difficult, especially
when the resolution is weakened, as it is by this vice;
but so long as there are left any remnants of will and
reason, control is possible. To strengthen the will must
be one of the objects of mental treatment, and exercise
is the method by which it may be accomplished. The
thing for a sufferer to say is not "I can't," but "I can
and I will control my thoughts." Suggestions which
will aid in accomplishing this have already been given
under the heading, "Cure of the Habit."
</p><p>We cannot forbear to add a word further respecting
the worth of religion in aiding these sufferers. If there
is any living creature who needs the help of true religion,
of faith in God, in Christ, and in the efficacy of
prayer, it is one of these. If there is any poor mortal
who cannot afford to be deprived of the aid of a sympathizing
Saviour, it is one who has enervated his will, degraded
his soul, and depraved his body by the vile habit
of self-abuse. A compassionate Redeemer will succor
even these defiled ones, if they truly "hunger and thirst"
after purity, and if they set about the work of reforming
themselves in good earnest, and with right motives.
</p><p>Exercise. &mdash; Physical exercise is a most powerful aid
to pure thoughts. When unchaste ideas intrude, engage
at once in something which will demand energetic muscular
exercise. Pursue the effort until fatigued, if necessary,
making all the while a powerful mental effort to
control the mind. Of course, evil thoughts will not be
expelled by thinking of them, but by displacing them by
pure thoughts. Exercise aids this greatly.
<pb n="301"/>
</p><p>Exercise is also essential to balance the circulation,
and thus relieve congestion of internal organs. Sedentary
persons especially need systematic exercise. No
single form of exercise is so excellent as walking. Four
or five miles a day are none too many to secure a proper
amount of muscular exercise. Gymnastics, the "health-lift," "Indian clubs," "dumb-bells," rowing, and other
forms of exercise are all good; but none of them should
be carried to excess. Ball-playing is likely to be made a
source of injury by exciting, in vigorous competition, too
violent and spasmodic action.
</p><p>Daily exercise should be taken to the extent of
fatigue. It is better that those who are still strong enough
should have some regular employment which will secure
exercise. Those who prefer may secure exercise and
recreation in the pursuit of some study that involves
necessary physical exertion; as botany, geology, or
entomology. The collection of natural-history specimens
is one of the most pleasant diversions, and may be made
very useful as well.
</p><p>Pleasant companionship is essential to the best progress
of these patients, especially in their walks, as much
more exercise may be taken without an unpleasant sense
of fatigue with a cheerful companion than when alone.
Solitude should be avoided at all times as much as
possible.
</p><p>Diet. &mdash; So much has already been said upon the relation
of diet to chastity and its influence upon the sexual
organs, that it is unnecessary to add many remarks here.
Nothing could be more untrue than the statement made
by some authors that the nature of the diet is of no
consequence.
<pb n="302"/>
</p><p>The science of physiology teaches that our very
thoughts are born of what we eat. A man that lives on
pork, fine-flour bread, rich pies and cakes, and
condiments, drinks tea and coffee, and uses tobacco, might as
well try to fly as to be chaste in thought. He will
accomplish wonders if he remains physically chaste;
but to be mentally virtuous would be impossible for him
without a miracle of grace.
</p><p>One whose thoughts have been so long trained in the
filthy ruts of vice that they run there automatically, and
naturally gravitate downward, &mdash; such an one must exercise
especial care to secure the most simple, pure, and
unstimulating diet.
</p><p>The following precautions are necessary to be
observed in relation to diet: &mdash;
</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Never overeat</hi>. If too much food is taken at one
meal, fast the next meal to give the system a chance to
recover itself, and to serve as a barrier against future
transgressions of the same kind. Gluttony is fatal to
chastity; and overeating will be certain to cause emissions,
with other evils, in one whose organs are weakened
by abuse.
</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Eat but twice a day</hi>, or, if supper is eaten, let it
be very light, and of the most simple food, as fruit, or
fruit and bread. Nothing should be eaten within four or
five hours of bed-time, and it is much better to eat
nothing after three o'clock. The ancients ate but two meals
a day; why should moderns eat three or four? If the
stomach contains undigested food, the sleep will be disturbed,
dreams will be more abundant, and emissions
will be frequent. A most imperative rule of life should
be, "Never go to bed with a loaded stomach." The vio-<pb n="303"/>
lation of this rule is the great cause of dreams and nightmares.
</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Discard all stimulating food</hi>. Under this head
must be included spices, pepper, ginger, mustard, cinnamon,
cloves, essences, all condiments, pickles, etc., together
with flesh food in any but moderate quantities.
It is hardly to be expected that all who have been
accustomed to use these articles all their lives, will discard them
wholly at once, nor, perhaps, that many will ever discard
them entirely; but it would be better for them to do so,
nevertheless.
</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Stimulating drinks</hi> should be abstained from with
still greater strictness. Wine, beer, tea, and coffee should
be taken under no circumstances. The influence of coffee
in stimulating the genital organs is notorious. Chocolate
should be discarded also. It is recommended by
some who suppose it to be harmless, being ignorant of
the fact that it contains a poison practically identical
with that of tea and coffee.
</p><p>Hot drinks of all kinds should be avoided.
</p><p>Tobacco, another stimulant, although not a drink,
should be totally abandoned at once.
</p><p>5. In place of such articles as have been condemned,
eat fruits, grains, milk, and vegetables. There is a rich
variety of these kinds of food, and they are wholesome
and unstimulating. Graham flour, oatmeal, and ripe
fruit are the indispensables of a dietary for those who
are suffering from sexual excesses.
</p><p>Further remarks upon diet, with a few useful recipes
for preparing healthful food, will be found in works de-<pb n="304"/>
voted to the subject of diet.[24] The patient must carefully
comply with all the rules of a healthy diet if he
would be sure of recovery.

</p><p>Sleeping. &mdash; It is from emissions which happen during
sleep that the great majority of sufferers complain;
hence there is no little importance attaching to this subject.
The following suggestions present in a very brief
manner some of the more practical ideas connected with
this part of the subject: &mdash;
</p><p>1. From seven to nine hours sleep are required by
all persons. The rule should be, Retire early, and sleep
until rested. Early rising is not beneficial unless it has
been preceded by abundant sleep.
</p><p>2. Arise immediately upon waking in the morning,
if it is after four o'clock. A second nap is generally
unrefreshing, and is dangerous, for emissions most frequently
occur at this time.
</p><p>3. If insufficient sleep is taken at night, sleep a few
minutes just before dinner. Half an hour's rest at this
time is remarkably refreshing; and even fifteen minutes
spent in sleep will be found very reviving. Do not sleep
after dinner, as a pollution will be very likely to occur,
and, as a rule, after-dinner naps are unrefreshing and
productive of indigestion.
</p><p>4. Never go to bed with the bowels loaded. The
bladder should be emptied just before retiring. It is
also a good plan to form the habit of rising once or
twice during the night to urinate.
</p><p>5. The position in sleeping is of some importance.
Sleeping upon the back or upon the abdomen favors the
occurrence of emissions; hence it is preferable to sleep
on the side. If supper has been taken, the right side is
<pb n="305"/>
preferable, as that position will favor the passage of food
from the stomach into the intestines in undergoing
digestion.
</p><p>Various devices are employed, sometimes with
advantage, to prevent the patient from turning upon his
back while asleep. The most simple is that recommended
by Acton, and consists in tying a knot in the
middle of a towel, and then fastening the towel about
the body in such a way that the knot will come upon
the small of the back. The unpleasant sensations
arising from pressure of the knot, if the sleeper turn upon
his back, will often serve as a complete preventive.
Others fasten a piece of wood upon the back for a similar
purpose. Still others practice tying one hand to the
bed-post. None of these remedies can be wholly
depended upon, but they may be tried in connection with
other means of treatment.
</p><p>6. Soft beds and pillows must be carefully avoided.
Feather-beds should not be employed when possible to
find a harder bed; the floor, with a single folded blanket
beneath the sleeper, would be preferable. Soft pillows
heat the head, as soft beds produce heat in other parts.
A hair mattress, or a bed of corn husks, oat straw, or
excelsior &mdash; covered with two or three blankets or a
quilted cotton mattress &mdash; makes a very healthy and
comfortable bed.
</p><p>7. Too many covers should be avoided with equal
care. The thinnest possible covering in summer, and
the lightest consistent with comfort in winter, should be
the rule. Sleeping too warm is a frequent exciting
cause of nocturnal losses.
</p><p>8. Thorough ventilation of the sleeping-room, both
<pb n="306"/>
while occupied and during the day-time, must not be
neglected. It should be located in a position to admit
the sunshine during the morning hours. It is a good plan
to keep in it a number of house plants, as they will help
to purify the air, besides adding to its cheerfulness.
</p><p>9. If wakeful at night, instead of lying in bed
trying to go to sleep, get up at once, open the bed,
air the sheets, remove the night-clothing, and walk
about the room for a few minutes, rubbing the body
briskly with the bare hand at the same time. A tepid
sponge bath, followed by a vigorous rubbing kept up
until really tired, will conduce to sleep in many cases.
Sometimes a change of bed, or pulling the bed to pieces
and arranging it again, is just the thing needed to bring
sleep.
</p><p>10. One of the most effectual panaceas for certain
varieties of sleeplessness is going to bed at peace with
all the world, and with a conscience void of offense
toward God as well as man.
</p><p>Dreams. &mdash; This is a subject of much interest to those
suffering from nocturnal pollutions, for these occurrences
are almost always connected with dreams of a lascivious
nature.
</p><p>In perfectly natural sleep, there are no dreams;
consciousness is entirely suspended. In the ordinary
stage of dreaming, there is a peculiar sort of consciousness,
many of the faculties of the mind being more or
less active, while the power of volition is wholly
dormant. Carpenter describes another stage of
consciousness between that of ordinary dreaming and
wakefulness, a condition "in which a dreamer has a
consciousness that he is dreaming, being aware of the
<pb n="307"/>
unreliability of the images which present themselves
before the mind. He may even make a voluntary and
successful effort to prolong them if agreeable, or to
dissipate them if unpleasing, thus evincing a certain
degree of that directing power, the entire want of which
is characteristic of the true state of dreams."
</p><p>Can Dreams be Controlled? &mdash; Facts prove that they
can be, and to a remarkable extent. Emissions most
frequently occur in the state described by Dr. Carpenter,
in which a certain amount of control by the will is
possible. This is the usual condition of the mind during
morning naps; and if a person resolutely determines to
combat unchaste thoughts whenever they come to him,
whether asleep or awake, he will find it possible to
control himself, not only during this semi-conscious
state, but even during more profound sleep.
</p><p>The following case related by an eminent London
surgeon,[25] illustrates what may be done by strong
resolution; the patient was an Italian gentleman of very
great respectability.


[25] Acton.

</p><p>"He had been inconvenienced five years before with
frequent emissions, which totally unnerved him. He
determined resolutely that the very instant the image of
a woman or any libidinous idea presented itself to his
imagination, <hi rend="italic">he would wake</hi>; and to insure his doing so,
dwelt in his thoughts on his resolution for a long time
before going to sleep. The remedy, applied by a vigorous
will, had the most happy results. The idea, the
remembrance of its being a <hi rend="italic">danger</hi>, and the determination
to wake, closely united the evening before, were never
dissociated, even in sleep, and he awoke in time; and
<pb n="308"/>
this reiterated precaution, repeated during some evenings,
absolutely cured the complaint."
</p><p>Several other cases of the same kind have been
recorded. Doubtless the plan would be found successful
in many cases when coupled with a proper regimen.
</p><p>A still greater control is exerted over the thoughts
during sleep by their character during hours of wakefulness.
By controlling the mind during entire consciousness,
it will also be controlled during unconsciousness
or semi-consciousness.
</p><p>Dr. Acton makes the following very appropriate
remarks upon this subject: &mdash;
</p><p>"Patients will tell you that they <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> control
their
dreams. This is not true. Those who have studied
the connection between thoughts during waking hours
and dreams during sleep, know that they are closely
connected. The <hi rend="italic">character</hi> is the same sleeping or waking.
It is not surprising that, if a man has allowed his
thoughts during the day to rest upon libidinous subjects,
he should find his mind at night full of lascivious dreams;
the one is a consequence of the other, and the nocturnal
pollution is a natural consequence, particularly when
diurnal indulgence has produced an irritability of the
generative organs. A will which in our waking hours
we have not exercised in repressing sexual desire, will
not, when we fall asleep, preserve us from carrying the
sleeping echo of our waking thought farther than we
dared to do in the day-time."
</p><p>Bathing. &mdash; A daily bath is indispensable to health
under all circumstances; for patients of this class, it is
especially necessary. A general bath should be taken every
morning immediately upon rising. General <hi rend="italic">cold bathing</hi> is
<pb n="309"/>
not good for any person, especially in the morning, though
some may tolerate it remarkably well, being of
exceptionally hardy constitutions; but the advice to try
"cold bathing," often given to sufferers from seminal
weakness, is very pernicious; for most of them have
been reduced so low in vitality by their disease that
they cannot endure such violent treatment.
</p><p>Cool bathing is, however, to be recommended. The
temperature of the water employed should be fifteen or
twenty degrees below that of the body. The administration
of water in the form of a hand or sponge bath in the
morning on arising is an excellent tonic. The saline
sponge bath, employing a tablespoonful of salt to the
quart of water, is somewhat more stimulating than the
ordinary water bath.
</p><p>Sun baths, electric baths, spray, plunge, and other
forms of bath are of greatest value to those suffering
from the effects of indiscretions. These are described,
with additional observations concerning the temperature
of baths, etc., in works devoted to this subject.
</p><p>Improvement of General Health. &mdash; Patients suffering
from emissions and other forms of seminal weakness
are almost always dyspeptic, and most of them present
other constitutional affections which require careful and
thorough treatment according to the particular indications
of the case. The wise physician will not neglect
these if he desires to cure his patient, and make his
recovery as complete as possible.
</p><p>Prostitution as a Remedy. &mdash; Said a leading physician
in New York to us, when interrogated as to his special
treatment of spermatorrh&oelig;a, "When a young man
comes to me suffering from nocturnal emissions, I give
<pb n="310"/>
him tonics and <hi rend="italic">send him to a woman</hi>." That this is not an
unusual method of treatment, even among regular physicians,
is a fact as true as it is deplorable. There are
hundreds of young men whose morals have been ruined
by such advice. Having been educated to virtuous habits,
at least so far as illicit intercourse is concerned, they
resist all temptations in this direction, even though their
inclinations are very strong; but when advised by a
physician to commit fornication as a remedial measure,
they yield their virtue, far too readily sometimes, and
begin a life of sin from which they might have been
prevented. There are good grounds for believing that
many young men purposely seek advice from physicians
who they know are in the habit of prescribing this
kind of a remedy.
</p><p>Few know how commonly this course is recommended,
and not by quacks, but by members of the regular
profession. A friend informed the writer that he
knew a case in which a country physician advised a
young man of continent habits to go to a neighboring
large city, and spend a year or so with prostitutes, which
advice he followed. Of his subsequent history we know
nothing; but it is very probable that, like most other
young men who adopt this remedy, he soon contracted
diseases which rendered his condition ten times worse
than at first, without at all improving his former state.
In pursuing this course, one form of emission is only
substituted for another, at the best; but more than this,
an involuntary result of disease is converted into a
voluntary sin of the blackest character, a crime in which
two participate, and which is not only an outrage upon
nature, but against morality as well.
<pb n="311"/>
</p><p>A final argument against this course is that it is not
a remedy, and does not effect a cure of the evil, as will
be shown by the following medical testimonies: &mdash;
</p><p>"The vexed question of connection is one which may
be decided out of hand. . . . <hi rend="italic">It has no power of curing bad
spermatorrh&oelig;a</hi>; it may cause a diminution in the number
of emissions, but this is only a delusion; the semen
is still thrown off; the frame still continues to be
exhausted; the genital organs and nervous system generally
are still harassed by the incessant tax; and the
patient is all the while laying the foundation of impotence."
</p><p>"In all solemn earnestness I protest against such
false treatment. It is better for a youth to live a continent
life." "There is a terrible significance in the wise
man's words, `None that go to her return again, neither
take they hold of the path of life.' "[27] This hazardous
and immoral mode of treatment is the result of the common
opinion that emissions are necessary and natural,
which we have previously shown to be false.


[26] Milton.
[27] Acton.

</p><p>Marriage. &mdash; Another class of practitioners, with more
apparent regard for morality, recommend matrimony as
a sure panacea for all the ills of which the sufferers
from self-abuse complain, with the possible exception of
actual impotence. Against this course, several objections
may be urged; we offer the following: &mdash;
</p><p>1. It is not a remedy, since, as in the case of illicit
intercourse, "legalized prostitution" is only a substitution
of one form of emission for another, the ill effects
of which do not differ appreciably.
</p><p>2. If it were a remedy, it would not be a justifiable
<pb n="312"/>
one, for its use would necessitate an abuse of the marriage
relation, as elsewhere shown.
</p><p>3. As another reason why the remedy would not be
a <hi rend="italic">proper</hi>, even if a <hi rend="italic">good</hi> one, it
may well be asked, What
right has a man to treat a wife as a vial of medicine?
Well does Mr. Acton inquire, "What has the young girl,
who is thus sacrificed to an egotistical calculation, done
that she should be condemned to the existence that
awaits her? Wh{o} has the right to regard her as
therapeutic agent, and to risk thus lightly her future
prospects, her repose, and the happiness of the remainder of
her life?"
</p><p>In cases in which seminal emissions occur frequently,
the most reliable writers upon this subject &mdash; Copland, Acton,
Milton, and others &mdash; advise, with reference to marriage,
"that the complaint should be removed before the
married life is commenced." Independent of the
considerations already presented, the individual affected
in this manner and contemplating marriage, should
carefully consider the possible and probable effects upon
offspring, the legitimate result of marriage; these have
been already described, and need not be recapitulated.
</p><p>Local Treatment. &mdash; While it is true that general
treatment alone is occasionally successful in curing the
diseases under consideration, and that local treatment
alone is very rarely efficient, it is also true that in many
cases skillful local treatment is required to supplement
the general remedies employed. While there has been
a tendency on the part of the profession generally to
depend wholly upon general treatment, on the part of a
less numerous body of specialists there has been an
opposite tendency, to depend wholly, or nearly so, upon
local measures. Both extremes are evidently wrong.
<pb n="313"/>
</p><p>The object of local treatment for the relief of emissions,
especially, is to remove the local cause of irritation,
which, as previously shown, is one of the most active
exciting causes of seminal losses. To effect this,
both internal and external applications are useful. We
will now consider some of these agents.
</p><p>The Warm Sitz Bath. &mdash; The warm sitz bath is one
of the most efficacious of all remedies. It should be
taken daily, and may sometimes be repeated, with benefit,
several times a day. Its effect is to relieve the local
congestion, and thus allay the irritability of the affected
parts. When but one bath is taken daily, it should be
just before retiring at night.
</p><p>In taking a sitz bath, a common wash-tub may be
employed. The temperature of the water should be
from 90&deg; to 95&deg;. A foot bath should be taken at the
same time, with the water a few degrees warmer. The
bath should last fifteen or twenty minutes. At the close
of it, water should be dashed quickly over the whole
body with the hand, after which the patient should rub
himself vigorously with a dry towel.
</p><p>The Ascending Douche. &mdash; This is also a very useful
means of allaying irritation, especially the reflex
excitability which is often present in the muscles in the
vicinity of the perineum and prostate gland and when there
is pain and fullness in these parts.
</p><p>Sponging of the perineum and adjacent parts may be
employed in place of the douche. The temperature of
the bath should be 110&deg; or 115&deg; when there is soreness
or irritability of the parts. In advanced cases of the
disease, in which internal emissions occur, and in cases
of impotence, cool water may be employed.
<pb n="314"/>
</p><p>The Abdominal Bandage. &mdash; This may be worn nights
to very great advantage by most patients. It not only
allays the irritability of the nerve centers which are
closely connected with the genital apparatus, but serves
to keep the bowels in a healthy condition. It should
not be applied so continuously as to produce a very profuse
eruption on the skin. If such a symptom should
appear, discontinue the bandage for a time. When
worn during the day-time, it should be changed once
in three or four hours. It is generally best to wear it
only nights.
</p><p>The Wet Compress. &mdash; This is an application to be
made to the lower part of the spine for the purpose of
allaying the excessive heat and irritation which often
exist there. It may also be worn nights, as it in some
degree prevents the danger arising from sleeping upon
the back.
</p><p>Hot and Cold Applications to the Spine. &mdash; These
are powerful remedies under appropriate conditions.
Hot applications relieve congestions of the genital
organs, and allay irritation. Cold applications are useful
when a condition of debility and relaxation is present.
Alternate applications of heat and cold are very valuable,
when skillfully applied, as a means of allaying reflex
excitability and promoting healthy action. These
applications are especially useful in cases in which there
is heat and pain in the lower portion of the back. Their
effects are greatly enhanced by administering a foot or
leg bath at the same time.
</p><p>Local Fomentations. &mdash; When great local irritation
exists, with considerable pain and spasmodic muscular
action, the application of hot fomentations to the peri-<pb n="315"/>
neum will be found the most effectual means of giving
relief. The hot douche and hot sitz bath are useful
under the same circumstances.
</p><p>In some cases, alternate hot and cold applications
are more effectual in allaying local irritation than hot
fomentations alone.
</p><p>Local Cold Bathing. &mdash; The genital organs should be
daily bathed in cold water just before retiring. Simply
dashing water upon the parts for two or three minutes
is insufficient; more prolonged bathing is necessary. A
short application of cold occasions a strong and sudden
reaction, which increases local congestion; hence the
bath should be continued until the sedative effect is fully
produced, which will require at least fifteen minutes.
The water must be cold; about 60&deg; is the best
temperature. Ice should be used to cool the water in
warm weather. It should be applied thoroughly, being
squeezed from a sponge upon the lower part of the
abdomen, and allowed to run down.
</p><p>The Enema. &mdash; The use of the enema is an important
means of aiding recovery; but it has been much abused,
and must be employed with caution. When the bowels
are very costive, relieve them before retiring by a copious
injection of tepid water. The "fountain" or "syphon"
syringe is the best instrument to employ.
</p><p>Useful as is the syringe when needed, nothing could
be much worse than becoming dependent upon it. The
bowels must be made to act for themselves without such
artificial assistance, by the use of proper food, especially
graham flour and oatmeal, and the avoidance of hot
drinks, milk, sugar, and other clogging and constipating
articles; by wearing the abdominal bandage, by thor-<pb n="316"/>
ough kneading and percussion of the abdomen several
times daily for five minutes at a time; by taking one or
two glasses of cold water half an hour before breakfast
every morning; and by plenty of muscular exercise
daily. The enema should be used occasionally, however,
rather than allow the bowels to continue costive, and to
avoid severe straining at stool.
</p><p>A small, cold enema taken just before retiring, and
retained, will often do much to allay local irritation.
</p><p>Electricity. &mdash; Probably no single agent will accomplish
more than this remedy when skillfully applied.
It needs to be carefully used, and cannot be trusted in
the hands of those not acquainted with the physical
properties of the remedy and scientific methods of applying it.
</p><p>Internal Applications. &mdash; Complete and rapid success
greatly depends upon skillful internal treatment, in a
large number of cases. We are aware that there is
considerable prejudice, in certain quarters, against internal
treatment; but having had the opportunity of observing
the effects of careful treatment applied in this way, and
having put to the test of practical experience this method,
we feel justified in recommending that which is approved
on both theoretical and practical grounds; for it is
rational to suppose that proper treatment, applied
directly to the seat of disease, must be at least equally
efficacious with methods less direct.
</p><p>As heretofore explained, in the more severe cases
the urethra is found in a very irritable condition. It is
hyper-sensitive, especially in that portion just in front
of the bladder, where the ejaculatory ducts open into it.
We have also seen how this condition is one of the chief
<pb n="317"/>
exciting causes of emissions. The remedies described
for allaying this irritation are all excellent and
indispensable; but there is another method of great value. This
consists in the passage of a suitable instrument, a sound
or bougie of proper size, two or three times a week.
By the aid of this means, the abnormal irritation will
often diminish with magical rapidity. The passage of
the instrument, of course, needs to be done with great
delicacy, so as to avoid increasing the irritation; hence
it should not be attempted by a novice. Lack of skill
in catheterism is doubtless the reason why some have
seemed to produce injury rather than benefit by this
method of treatment.
</p><p>Use of Electricity. &mdash; The use of electricity in
connection with that of the sound, adds greatly to its utility.
By means of the metallic instrument, also, electricity
may be applied directly to the point of greatest irritation;
and its soothing effect is sometimes really wonderful,
as the following case will show: &mdash;
</p><p>The patient, a man of unusual physical development,
was suffering from nocturnal emissions and diminished
sexual power, the result of early indiscretions and
marital excesses. One of his most unpleasant symptoms
was severe pain in the portion of the urethra near
the openings of the ejaculatory ducts. After he had
been suffering more than usual for a few days, we
applied the faradic electric current in the manner indicated
above, for about fifteen minutes. At the end of that
time the pain was entirely removed, though considerable
suffering had been caused by the passage of the instrument,
so sensitive was the congested membrane. The
pain did not return again for two or three weeks, though
<pb n="318"/>
treatment was necessarily suspended on account of
absence.
</p><p>In another case, that of a young man, a student, at
the beginning of treatment emissions occurred nightly, and
sometimes as many as four in a single night, according to
his statement, which we had no reason to doubt. Under
the influence of these local applications, combined
with other measures of treatment and a measurably
correct regimen, the number of emissions was in a few
weeks reduced to one in two or three weeks.
</p><p>Numerous other cases nearly as remarkable might
be detailed if it were necessary to do so. A very
slight increase of irritation sometimes occurs at first,
but this quickly subsides.
</p><p>The galvanic as well as the faradic current is to be
used under proper circumstances. The application of
electricity to the nerve centers by means of central
galvanization, and also general and local external
faradization, are necessary methods to be employed in
electrical treatment.
</p><p>Circumcision. &mdash; In cases of phimosis, in which irritation
is produced by retained secretions, division of the
prepuce, or circumcision, is the proper remedy. These
cases are not infrequent, but the exciting cause of much
of the difficulty is often overlooked. The same remedy
is often useful in cases of long prepuce.
</p><p>When the glans penis is unusually tender and sensitive,
this condition will generally be removed by the daily
washing with soap and water necessary for cleanliness.
If this does not suffice, or if there are slight excoriations
caused by acid secretions, apply, in addition, a weak
solution of tannin in glycerine once a day.
<pb n="319"/>
</p><p>Impotence. &mdash; Loss of sexual power arising from any
form of sexual excess, should be treated on the same
general plan laid down for the treatment of emissions
and other weaknesses. Heat to the spine, and short,
but frequent, local cold applications, are among the most
useful remedies; but probably electricity, discreetly
used, is by far the most valuable of all remedies. It
should be applied both internally and externally.
</p><p>The use of cantharides and other aphrodisiac
remedies to stimulate the sexual organs is a most pernicious
practice. The inevitable result is still greater weakness.
They should never be used. On the contrary, everything
of a stimulating character must be carefully
avoided, even in diet.
</p><p>Varicocele. &mdash; Patients suffering from this difficulty
should wear a proper suspensory bag, as the continued
pressure of the distended veins upon the testes, if
unsupported, will ultimately cause degenerative changes
and atrophy. In cases of varicocele in which the
disorder is attended by pain, or marked degeneration of
one or both testicles, or in which the disorder is an
evident aggravation of nocturnal losses, an operation is
usually required to effect a cure, though a proper
suspensory bandage will often afford relief, if constantly
worn. The operation for varicocele, when properly
performed, is free from danger, and is effective in affording
relief in this disorder. The author has found great
satisfaction in the employment of antiseptic ligation of
the veins, coupled in bad cases, by removal of the
redundant portion of scrotal tissue. This mode of operation
has always been attended by most excellent results.
</p><p>The wearing of a suspensory bag is also advisable
for those whose testicles are unusually pendulous.
<pb n="390"/>
</p><p>Treatment of the Disease in Women. &mdash; The treatment
of the results of self-abuse in woman is a very
much more complicated affair than it is in man, owing to
the greater variety of local disorders induced thereby.
The various forms of displacement require special methods
of treatment, many of which cannot be readily
undertaken at home. Many of the measures suggested for
the treatment of males are, however, entirely applicable
to this class of cases in women, and may be employed to
very great advantage and with most excellent results.
The sitz bath, hot sponging of the spine, hot and cold
applications to the spine, and the saline sponge bath are
all very useful measures.
</p><p>Most important of all, however, is the <hi rend="italic">vaginal douche</hi>.
This method of treatment consists in the injection into
the vagina by some form of syringe, particularly the
fountain or syphon syringe, of hot water. The temperature
should be 110&deg; or 120&deg;. In the employment of
vaginal injections, too small a quantity is usually made
use of. From three to five gallons should be used daily,
and as a rule, the temperature should be as hot as can
be borne without discomfort. We know of no single
method of treatment which is able to accomplish so much
in these cases as the hot vaginal douche. It should be
uniformly employed, and may be continued several
months with advantage. It should be used as long as
the leucorrh&oelig;al discharge is present, this being a
symptom of local congestion, and one which is more readily
relieved by this means than any other.
</p><p>The addition of a little alum or some other form of
astringent to the last portion of water employed, is in
many cases advantageous. Alum or tannin may be used
in proportion of one dram to the quart of water.
<pb n="321"/>
</p><p>In cases of sexual apathy, or loss of ability to engage
in the sexual act, the application of faradic electricity to
the vagina by means of a proper electrode is of very
great advantage. One electrode should be placed in the
vagina, while the other, connected with the sponge, is
passed over the lower portion of the spine, across the
the lower part of the abdomen, and along the inside of
the thighs.
</p><p>For directions for further treatment of these and
like derangements, the reader is referred to other works
by the author, in which the subject is fully treated.
</p><p>Drugs, Rings, etc. &mdash; If drugs, <hi rend="italic">per se</hi>, will cure invalids
of any class, they are certainly not satisfactory in this
class of patients. The whole materia medica affords no
root, herb, extract, or compound that alone will cure a
person suffering from emissions. Thousands of unfortunates
have been ruined by long-continued drugging. One
physician will purge and salivate the patient. Another
will dose him with phosphorus, quinine, or ergot.
Another feeds him with iron. Another plies him with
lupuline, camphor, and digitaline. Still another narcotizes
him with opium, belladonna, and chloral. Purgatives
and diuretics are given by another, and some will
be found ready to empty the whole pharmacopo&aelig;ia into
the poor sufferer's stomach if he can be made to open
his mouth wide enough.
</p><p>The way some of these unfortunate persons are
blistered, and burned, and cauterized, and tortured in sundry
other ways, is almost too horrible to think of; yet they
endure it, often willingly, thinking it but just punishment
for their sins, and perhaps hoping to expiate them by
this cruel penance. By these procedures, the emissions
<pb n="322"/>
are sometimes temporarily checked; but the patient is
not cured, nevertheless, and the malady soon returns.
</p><p>The employment of rings, pessaries, and numerous
other mechanical devices for preventing emissions, is
entirely futile. No dependence can be placed upon them.
Some of these contrivances are very ingenious, but they
are all worthless, and time and money spent upon them
are thrown away.
</p><p>Quacks. &mdash; The victims of self-abuse fall an easy prey
to the hordes of harpies, fiends in human shape, who are
ready at every turn to make capital out of their misfortunes.
From no class of persons do quacks and charlatans
derive so rich a harvest as from these erring ones.
It is not uncommon to find a man suffering from seminal
weakness who has paid to sundry parties hundreds of
dollars for "specifics" which they advertised as "sure
cures." We have seen and treated scores of these
patients, but never yet met a single case that had received
permanent benefit from patent medicines.
</p><p>The newspapers are full of the advertisements of
these heartless villains. They advertise under the guise
of "clergymen," charitable institutions, "cured invalids,"
and similar pretenses. Usually they offer for sale some
pill or mixture which will be a <hi rend="italic">sure cure</hi>, in proof of
which they cite the testimonials of numerous individuals
who never lived, or, at least, never saw either them or
their filthy compounds; or they promise to send free a
recipe which will be a certain cure. Here is a specimen
recipe which was sent by a "reverend" gentleman, who
claims to be a returned missionary from South America,
and who is so intent on doing good that he charges
nothing for his invaluable information: &mdash;
<pb n="323"/>
                  Extract of Corrossa apimis,
                    "    " Selarmo umbelifera,
                  Powdered Alkermes latifolia,
                  Extract of Carsadoc herbalis.

</p><p>This remarkable recipe is warranted to cure all the
evils arising from self-abuse without any attention to
diet or inconvenience of any kind, to prevent consumption
and insanity, and to cure venereal diseases. It is
also declared to be a perfectly "<hi rend="italic">safe</hi>" remedy for all
female difficulties, which means that it will aid nefarious
purposes.
</p><p>Along with the recipe comes the suggestion that the
druggist may not be able to furnish all the ingredients
in a perfectly pure state, and so, for the accommodation
of suffering humanity, this noble philanthropist has taken
infinite pains to secure them direct from South America,
and has put them up in neat little packages which he
will send, post-paid, for the trifle of $3.50, just one cent
<hi rend="italic">less</hi> than actual cost. Then he tells what purports to be
the history of his own nastiness, with a generous spicing
of pious cant, and closes with a benediction on all who
have fallen into the same slough, and especially those
who will send for his fabulous foreign weeds to help
them out.[28]


[28] Since the above was written, this notorious quack has died, worth
half a million dollars, gained by his deceitful practices, and the public
have learned that the name under which he advertized was a fictitious
one, and that he was neither a clergyman nor a missionary, as claimed.

</p><p>A young man sees the advertisement of a book which
will be sent free, postage paid, if he will only send his
address. The title of the book being of some such character
as "Manhood Regained" or "Nervous Debility,"
he imagines it may suit his case, and sends his name.
<pb n="324"/>
Return mail brings the book, which is a wretched jargon
of confusing terms and appalling descriptions of the effects
of self-abuse, with the most shameful exaggerations of
the significance of the most trivial symptoms. The
ignorant youth reads what he supposes to be a description
of his own case, and is frightened nearly to death. He
is most happily relieved, however, to find that the
generous publishers of the book have a remedy which is just
adapted to his case, but which is so precious that it
cannot be afforded at less than $50.00 for a sufficient
quantity to effect a cure. He willingly parts with his hard-earned dollars, and gets, in return, some filthy mixture
that did not cost a shilling.
</p><p>Another trap set is called an "Anatomical Museum."
The anatomical part of the exhibition consists chiefly of
models and figures calculated to excite the passions to
the highest pitch. At stated intervals the proprietor,
who is always a "doctor," and by preference a German,
delivers lectures on the effects of masturbation in which
he resorts to every device to excite the fears and exaggerate
the symptoms of his hearers, who are mostly
young men and boys. Thus he prepares his victim, and
when he once gets him within his clutches, he does not
let him go until he has robbed him of his last dollar.
</p><p>We might present almost any number of illustrations
of the ways in which these human sharks pursue their
villainy. If there were a dungeon deep, dark, and dismal
enough for the punishment of such rascals, we should
feel strongly inclined to petition to have them incarcerated
in it. They defy all laws, civil as well as moral,
and are cunning enough to keep outside of prison bars;
and thus they wax rich by robbery, and thrive by de-<pb n="325"/>
ceit. A terrible recompense awaits them at the final
settlement, though they escape so easily now.
</p><p>Closing Advice. &mdash; We cannot finish this chapter
without a few closing words of advice to those who are
suffering in any way from the results of sexual transgression.
We are especially anxious to call attention
to a few points of practical and vital interest to all who
are suffering in the manner indicated.
</p><p>1. Give the matter prompt attention. Do not delay
to adopt curative measures under the delusive idea that
the difficulty will disappear of itself. Thousands have
procrastinated in this way until their constitutions have
been so hopelessly undermined as to make treatment of
little value. The intrinsic tendency of this disease is to
continue to increase. It progresses only in one direction.
It never "gets well of itself," as some have
imagined that it may do. Something must be done to
effect a cure; and the longer treatment is delayed, the
more difficult the case will become.
</p><p>2. Begin the work of getting well with a fixed
determination to persevere, and never to give over the struggle
until success is attained, no matter how difficult may
be the obstacles to be surmounted. Such an effort will
rarely be unsuccessful. One of the greatest impediments
to recovery from diseases of this class is the vacillating
disposition of nearly all patients suffering from disorders
of this character. Make up your mind what course
of treatment to pursue, then adhere to it rigidly until it
has received a thorough trial. Do not despair if no very
marked results are seen in a week, a month, or even a
longer period. The best remedies are among those which
operate the most slowly.
<pb n="326"/>
</p><p>3. Avoid watching for symptoms. Ills are greatly
exaggerated by dwelling upon them. One can easily
imagine himself getting worse when he is really getting
better. Indeed, one can make himself sick by dwelling
upon insignificant symptoms. Fix upon a course to
pursue for recovery, firmly resolve to comply with every
requirement necessary to insure success, and then let
the mind be entirely at rest respecting the result.
</p><p>4. Never consult a quack. The newspapers abound
in lying advertisements of remedies for diseases of
this character. Do not waste time and money in
corresponding with the ignorant, unprincipled charlatans
who make such false pretensions. Do not consult traveling
doctors. Physicians of real merit have plenty of
business at home. They are not obliged to go abroad in
order to secure practice; persons who resort to this
course are, without exception, pretentious quacks. Consult
only some well-known and reliable physician in
whom you have confidence. If your physician treats
the matter lightly, and advises marriage as a means of
cure, you will not judge him harshly if you decide that
although he may be thoroughly competent to treat
other diseases, he is ignorant of the nature and proper
treatment of this. It is an unfortunate fact that there
are many physicians who are not thoroughly acquainted
with the nature of spermatorrh&oelig;a and the proper mode
of treating the disease; hence the importance of making
a judicious selection in choosing a medical adviser. It
is far better to consult your family physician than to
trust yourself in the hands of some one whom you do
not know, and especially one who makes great pretensions
to knowledge.
<pb n="327"/>
</p><p>5. Do not despair of ever recovering from the effects
of past transgression, and plunge into greater depths of
sin. Persevering, skillful treatment will cure almost
every case. Even the worst cases can be greatly benefited
if the earnest co-operation of the patient can be
secured. This is indispensable, and the patient should
be so instructed at the outset of a course of treatment.
</p><p>6. Every sufferer from sexual disease must make up
his mind to live, during the remainder of his life, as
closely in accordance with the laws of life and health as
circumstances under his control will allow him to do. One
who pursues this course, with a genuine regard for
principle and a love for right, may confidently expect to
receive the reward of obedience for his faithfulness.
We would recommend such to obtain and study the
best works upon hygiene, put in practice every new
truth as soon as learned, and become missionaries of the
saving truths of hygiene to others who are suffering from
the same cause as themselves, or who may be in danger
of falling into the same evil.</p>

A Chapter for Boys.</head>

<p>
BOYS, this chapter is for you. It is written and
printed expressly for you. The author does not
care very much if a single page is not read by
grown men, but is very solicitous that every boy
shall read each line thoughtfully and carefully, weighing
well the facts presented, and the words of warning offered.
You may find nothing to laugh at, nothing pleasing; but
you will find something to think about, something worth
pondering and remembering.
</p><p>Genuine Boys. &mdash; Real boys are scarce now-a-days.
In the days of Methuselah, male human beings were
still boys when nearly a century old; twenty-five years
ago, boys were still such until well out of their "teens,"
now, the interval between infancy and the age at which
the boy becomes a young man is so brief that boyhood
is almost a thing of the past. The happy period of
carefree, joyous innocence which formerly intervened
between childhood and early manhood is now almost
unobservable. Boys grow old too fast. They learn to
imitate the vices and the manners of their seniors before
they reach their teens, and are impatient to be counted
as men, no matter how great may be their deficiencies,
their unfitness for the important duties and responsibilities
of life. The consequence of this inordinate haste
and impatience to be old, is premature decay. Unfortu-
<pb n="329"/>
nately, the general tendency of the boys of the rising
generation is to copy the vices of their elders, rather than
the virtues of true manliness. A strong evidence of
this fact, if there were no other, is the unnaturally old-looking faces which so many of our boys present. At
the present time the average boy of twelve knows more
of vice and sin than the youth of twenty of the past
generation.
</p><p>Human Mushrooms. &mdash; It is not so much for these
human mushrooms, which may be not inaptly compared
to toadstools which grow up in a single night and almost
as speedily decay, that we write, but for the old-fashioned
boys, the few such there may be; those who have not
yet learned to love sin; those whose minds are still pure
and uncontaminated; those who are not ashamed to be
counted as boys, who are an ornament to boyhood, and
a delight to their parents. Those who have already
begun a course of vice and wickedness, we have little
hope of reforming; but we are anxious to offer a few
words of counsel and warning which may possibly help
to save as brands plucked from a blazing fire, those
whose moral sense is yet alive, who have quick and
tender consciences, who aspire to be truly noble and good.
We trust, however, that a few who may have already
entered upon a course of sin, will heed the warnings
given, and reform before they have been wholly ruined
by the terrible consequences of vice.
</p><p>"What are Boys for?" &mdash; This question was answered
with exact truthfulness by a little boy, who, when
contemptuously accosted by a man with the remark, "What
are you good for?" replied, "Men are made of such as
we." Boys are the beginnings of men. They sustain
<pb n="330"/>
the same relation to men that a small shrub does to a
full-grown tree. They are still more like the small
green apples which first appear when the blossoms drop
from the branches, compared with the ripe, luscious fruit
which in autumn bends the heavy-laden boughs almost
to breaking. Often, like the young apples, boys are
green; but this is only natural, and should be considered
no disgrace to them. If they grow up naturally,
they will ripen with age, like the fruit, developing at
each successive stage of life additional attractions and
estimable qualities.
</p><p>Boys the Hope of the World. &mdash; The worlds most
valuable property is its boys. A nation which has poor,
weakly, vicious boys, will have still weaker, more
vicious and untrustworthy men. A country with noble,
virtuous, vigorous boys, is equally sure of having noble,
pious, brave, and energetic men. Whatever debases,
contaminates, or in any way injures the boys of a country,
saps and undermines the very foundation of the
nation's strength and greatness. Save the boys from vice
and crime, give them good training, physically, mentally,
and morally, and the prosperity of the nation is assured.
</p><p>Man, the Masterpiece. &mdash; When a skillful artist perfects
a work of art, a painting, a drawing, a statue, or
some other work requiring great talent and exceeding
all his other efforts, it is called his masterpiece. So
man is the noblest work of God, the masterpiece of the
Almighty. Numerous anecdotes are told of the sagacity
of dogs, horses, elephants, and other animals, of their
intelligence as shown in their ingenious devices for
overcoming obstacles, avoiding difficulties, etc. Our
admiration and wonder are often excited by the scarcely less
<pb n="331"/>
than human wisdom shown by these lowly brothers of
the human race. We call them noble animals; but
they are only noble brutes, at best. Compared with
man, even in his most humble form, as seen in the wild
savage that hunts and devours his prey like a wild beast,
a lion or a tiger, they are immeasurably inferior. And
in his highest development, man-civilized, cultivated,
Christianized, learned, generous, pious-certainly stands
at the head of all created things.
</p><p>Boys, do you love what is noble, what is pure, what
is grand, what is good? You may each, if you will, be
come such yourselves. Let us consider for a moment &mdash;
</p><p>How a Noble Character is Formed. &mdash; Every human
being forms his own character. Various traits and
characteristics may be inherited from parents; but character
is built up by one's own efforts, and is good or bad
as we ourselves make it. As a modern philosopher has
said, "Our thoughts and our conduct are our own." A
noble character is formed by the development of good
qualities, and the suppression of bad ones. Real
improvement is from within outward, and comes from an
individual's own efforts. A boy can form a noble, elevated,
lovable character by cultivating good and pure thoughts,
which will certainly actuate to only good and pure
actions. By constant effort, evil tendencies, which have
been inherited, may be overcome; good traits may be
so developed as to overshadow the evil of an unfortunate
nature. Thus all may form noble characters, no
matter how adverse the circumstances under which they
live, or the natural disadvantages with which they have
to contend.
</p><p>How a Noble Character is Ruined. &mdash; A bad character
<pb n="332"/>
is formed by the development of bad traits or evil
propensities. In other words, sin is the cause of the
demoralization of character, the debasing of the mind,
the loss of nobility, of which we see so much around us
in the world. When one yields to temptations to wrong
doing, either such as come from one's own evil nature, or
from evil associates or surroundings, he makes a blemish
upon his character which years may not remove.
An ugly scar will ever remain to mar his character.
</p><p>Sin is the violation of some law. There are two
kinds of sin: that which is a transgression of the moral
law, and that which is a transgression of physical law.
In one sense, all sin is transgression of moral law; for it
is the moral duty of every one to obey every law which
relates to his well-being. Both classes of sin are
followed by penalties. If a person violates the laws of
health, he is just as certain to suffer as though he tells
a falsehood, steals, murders, or commits any other crime.
Perfect obedience to all of nature's laws, including, of
course, all moral laws, is necessary to perfect health and
perfect nobility of character. The nature of these laws
and the result of transgression will be understood after
we have taken a hasty glance at &mdash;
</p><p>A Wonderful Machine. &mdash; All the inventions and
devices ever constructed by the human hand or
conceived by the human mind, no matter how delicate, how
intricate and complicated, are simple, childish toys
compared with that most marvelously wrought mechanism,
the human body. Its parts are far more delicate, and
their mutual adjustments infinitely more accurate, than
are those of the most perfect chronometer ever made.
</p><p>In order to understand the structure of this wonder-<pb n="333"/>
ful machine, let us go back to the earliest period of its
existence. At this time, we find it to be but a mere
speck of matter, a single cell, a delicate little mass of
jelly-like protoplasm so small that a hundred or two
would not measure more than an inch if arranged in a
row. Under proper circumstances, this little cell grows,
expands, and finally subdivides into two, through the
operations of the protoplasm, or living matter, which
chiefly composes it. The same activity occasions
another subdivision, making four cells of the two. Still
another division produces eight cells.
</p><p>Thus the processes of growth and division continue
until the one original cell has developed into hundreds,
even thousands and millions, under the active working
of the protoplasm, which is the chief component of the
cells, and the potent agent in their activities. Development
and division still continue while a new process of
folding is set up, layers of cells being formed, groups and
subgroups being set off, which develop into special
systems and organs, until by and by the whole complex
organism which we call man is developed.
</p><p>What the Microscope Reveals. &mdash; To enable us to
comprehend more fully how "fearfully and wonderfully
made" is the "human form divine," let us examine
with minute care, by the aid of a powerful microscope,
one single part of the body, the blood. A prick of the
finger secures a tiny drop of red blood, which we place
upon a small slip of glass, and adjust under the
microscope. The magical instrument presents to view a scene
of such rare beauty as seldom meets the human eye.
The red blood has faded out to a faint amber color, and
the whole field is swarming with tiny creatures of the
<pb n="334"/>
most delicate and symmetrical structure, which float
about singly, or cling together in little groups. Here
and there may be seen some a little larger than the
others, though still so small that three thousand of them
arranged in a row would extend but one inch, curious
little round masses, so transparent as to be almost
invisible. They are not very numerous, but scattered
here and there about the field.
</p><p>Presently we perceive that some are changing their
form. A moment ago, the first one we inspected was
as round as a watch crystal; now it has become elliptical
in form. A few minutes later, we look again, and it has
stretched itself out into a long filament like an angle-worm. Presently it begins to draw itself up into a
round mass again; and in less time than is required to
describe the action, it has assumed its original shape,
but has changed its position. That is the way the
little creature moves about. It makes itself into the
shape of a worm, and crawls just as a worm does, by
making one end fast, and drawing the rest of the
body up.
</p><p>But what does it move about for? Why may it not
remain stationary? Shortly we shall see, if we watch
carefully. Even now the reason is evident. Reader,
just peep over our shoulder a moment. Put your eye
down to the eye-piece of our microscope. Do you see
the little fellow? Look sharp, and you will. A few
seconds ago it was round as a full moon. Now there
is a little pocket in one side. The pocket is growing
deeper and deeper. What is the object of such a curious
procedure? Let us put on another eye-piece.
Now we have magnified the object a million times. See
<pb n="335"/>
how much larger it looks. Now look at the pocket.
The mystery is solved. There is a little speck of food
which the little creature wishes to get, and so he has
made a pocket to put it in.
</p><p>The queerest part is yet to come, so we must watch
patiently a moment more. Now the mouth of the pocket
is closing up. Evidently, the little fellow is afraid he
may lose the precious morsel, and so he is going to shut
the pocket to prevent its escape. Now the opening is
closed, and before we are aware of it, the pocket has
itself disappeared, and there is the little particle inside.
</p><p>This seems a marvelous process, but it is a peculiar
way these little fellows have of taking their food. When
they wish to eat, they make a mouth or a stomach on
purpose for the occasion. If we wait a few moments,
we shall see that the little particle so curiously swallowed
has disappeared; it is now digested.
</p><p>Thus we see, by studying the habits of these wonderful
little creatures which live in the blood, that
although having no legs, wings, or other organs of
locomotion, they move from place to place at will; having
no hands, they feel; having no mouths, they eat;
though possessed of no stomach, they digest. They
are born, develop, grow old and infirm, and die, just as
larger creatures. Each has its own separate life, and its
special duties to perform, just as have horses, oxen, dogs,
and the human beings of whom they form a part.
</p><p>Thus we learn that the blood is a stream, coursing
through the various channels of the body, known as
arteries and veins, carrying in each drop millions of
creatures which live and grow in the limpid fluid like
the fishes in our rivers, or like the birds in the air.
<pb n="336"/>
These little creatures are known to science as blood
corpuscles. Every part of the body is likewise composed
of living creatures, which has each his special
work to do. Those of the same class, or which have
the same kind of labor to perform, are grouped together,
just as glass-blowers, printers, and other persons of the
same trade, are associated together in their work. All
these groups of living beings, working together, make up
that wonderful machine, the human body, the most
important parts of which we will now proceed to study.
</p><p>In order that an individual human being may live
and develop, it is necessary that he should eat, drink,
digest, and assimilate, and that he should be able to
move about, to perceive; that is, to hear, see, feel, smell,
taste, determine weight, and distinguish temperature, to
think, and to express ideas in language. In order to
keep his vital machinery in order, it is necessary that
the body should also be able to repair injuries which
may occur in consequence of wear or accident, and to
remove worn-out material which would otherwise obstruct
the working of the delicate machinery of which his body
is constructed. Each of these functions requires special
organs and apparatuses to carry on the work; and these
we will now briefly consider: &mdash;
</p><p>The Nutritive Apparatus. &mdash; This consists of organs
for the purpose of taking in food or nourishment, digesting
it, and distributing it throughout the body wherever
it is needed. These are chiefly the mouth and teeth for
receiving and chewing the food, the stomach and
intestines for digesting and absorbing it, and the heart and
blood-vessels for distributing it to the body.
</p><p>The Moving Apparatus. &mdash; For the purpose of pro-<pb n="337"/>
ducing motion, we have the muscles and the bones, by
which the food is received, masticated, and swallowed,
the blood circulated, the body moved about from place to
place, and speech, expression, respiration, and many
other important functions performed.
</p><p>The Thinking and Feeling Apparatus. &mdash; The brain
and nerves afford the means of thinking and feeling, also
giving rise to all the activities of the body by the
production of nerve force. To aid the brain and nerves, we
have special organs provided, termed the organs of special
sense; as the eye for sight, the ear for hearing, the
nose for the detection of odors, the tongue for tasting,
the skin and the mucous membrane for the sense of
touch.
</p><p>The Purifying Apparatus. &mdash; Waste matter accumulates
in the body so rapidly that it is necessary to have
abundant and efficient means to remove the same, and
prevent death by obstruction. This work is performed
by the lungs, liver, kidneys, skin, and mucous membrane.
</p><p>Each organ and tissue possesses the power to repair
itself. Animal heat, which is also necessary to life, is
not produced by any special set of organs, but results
incidentally from the various other processes named.
</p><p>The Reproductive Apparatus. &mdash; As there is a stomach
to digest, a brain to think, a pair of lungs to breathe,
etc., so there are special organs for reproducing the
species or producing new individuals. Unlike all the other
organs of the body, they are intended for use only after
full development of manhood has been attained; consequently,
they are only partially developed in childhood,
becoming perfected as the person becomes older, espe-<pb n="338"/>
cially after about the age of fourteen to eighteen, when
puberty occurs. The lungs, the stomach, the muscles,
and other organs must be used constantly from the earliest
period of infancy, and hence are developed sufficiently
for efficient use at birth. The fact that the sexual or
reproductive organs are only fully developed later on in
life, is sufficient evidence that they are intended for use
only when the body has become fully matured and well
developed.
</p><p>The Down-Hill Road. &mdash; In every large city, and in
small ones too, even in little villages, we can scarcely
step upon the street without being pained at meeting
little boys who have perhaps scarcely learned to speak
distinctly, but whose faces show very plainly that they
have already taken several steps down the steep hillside
of vice. All degrees of wickedness are pictured on
the faces of a large proportion of the boys we meet upon
the streets, loitering about the corners, loafing in hotels,
groceries, and about bar-room doors. Everywhere we
meet small faces upon which sin and vice are as clearly
written as though the words were actually spelled out.
Lying, swearing, smoking, petty stealing, and brazen
impudence are among the vices which contaminate
thousands and thousands of the boys who are by and by to
become the <hi rend="italic">men</hi> of this country, to constitute its
legislators, its educators, its supporters, and its protectors.
Is it possible that such boys can become good, useful,
noble, trustworthy men? If the seeds of noxious
weeds can be made to produce useful plants or beautiful
flowers, or if a barren, worthless shrub can be made
to bear luscious fruit, then may we expect to see
these vicious boys grow up into virtuous, useful men.
<pb n="339"/>
</p><p>But the vices mentioned are not the worst, whose
traces we see stamped upon the faces of hundreds of
boys, some of whom, too, would scorn to commit any
one of the sins named. There is another vice, still more
terrible, more blighting in its effects, a vice which
defiles, diseases, and destroys the body, enervates,
degrades, and finally dethrones the mind, debases and
ruins the soul. It is to this vice that we wish especially
to call attention. It is known as &mdash;
</p><p>Self-Abuse. &mdash; Secret vice, masturbation, and self-pollution are other names applied to the same awful sin
against nature and against God. We shall not explain
here the exact nature of the sin, as very few boys are
so ignorant or so innocent as to be unacquainted with it.
To this sin and its awful consequences we now wish to
call the attention of all who may read these lines.
</p><p>A Dreadful Sin. &mdash; The sin of self-pollution is one of
the vilest, the basest, and the most degrading that a
human being can commit. It is worse than beastly.
Those who commit it place themselves far below the
meanest brute that breathes. The most loathsome
reptile, rolling in the slush and slime of its stagnant
pool, would not bemean itself thus. It is true that
monkeys sometimes have the habit, but only when they
have been taught it by vile men or boys. A boy who
is thus guilty, ought to be ashamed to look into the eyes
of an honest dog. Such a boy naturally shuns the company
of those who are pure and innocent. He cannot
look with assurance into his mother's face. It is difficult
for any one to catch his eye, even for a few seconds.
He feels his guilt, and acts it out, thus making it known
to every one. Let such a boy think how he must appear
<pb n="340"/>
in the eyes of the Almighty. Let him only think of the
angels, pure, innocent, and holy, who are eye-witnesses
of his shameful practices. Is not the thought appalling?
Would he dare commit such a sin in the presence of his
father, his mother, or his sisters? How, then, will he
dare to defile himself in the presence of Him from whose
all-seeing eye nothing is hid?
</p><p>The Bible utters the most solemn warnings against
sexual sins. The inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah
were destroyed by fire and brimstone for such
transgressions. Onan was struck dead in the act of
committing a vileness of this sort. For similar vices the wicked
inhabitants of Palestine were destroyed, and their lands
given to the Hebrews. For a single violation of the
seventh commandment, one of the most notable Bible
characters, David, suffered to the day of his death.
Those who imagine that this sin is not a transgression of
the seventh commandment, may be assured that this
most heinous, revolting, and unnatural vice is in every
respect more pernicious, more debasing, and more immoral
than what is generally considered as violation of
the commandment which says, "Thou shalt not commit
adultery," and is a most flagrant violation of the same
same commandment.
</p><p>Those who imagine that they "have a right to do as
they please with themselves," so long as no one else is
immediately affected, must learn that we are not our
own masters; we belong to our Creator, and are
accountable to God, not only for the manner in which we
treat our fellow-men, but for how we treat ourselves, for
the manner in which we use the bodies which he has
given us. The man who commits suicide, who takes his
<pb n="341"/>
own life, is a murderer as much as he who kills a fellowman.
So, also, he who pollutes himself in the manner
we are considering, violates the seventh commandment,
although the crime is in both cases committed against
himself. Think of this, ye youth who defile yourselves
in secret, and seek to escape the punishment of sin. In
heaven a faithful record of your vile commandment-breaking is kept, and you must meet it by and by. You
are fixing your fate for eternity; and each daily act in
some degree determines what it shall be. Are you a
victim of this debasing vice? Stop, repent, reform,
before you are forever ruined, &mdash; a mental, moral, and
physical wreck.
</p><p>Self-Murderers. &mdash; Of all the vices to which human
beings are addicted, no other so rapidly undermines the
constitution and so certainly makes a complete wreck of
an individual as this, especially when the habit is begun
at an early age. It wastes the most precious part of the
blood, uses up the vital forces, and finally leaves the
poor victim a most utterly ruined and loathsone{sic} object.
If a boy should be deprived of both hands and feet, and
should lose his eyesight, he would still be infinitely
better off than the boy who for years gives himself up
to the gratification of lust in secret vice. For such a
boy to become a strong, vigorous man is just as impossible
as it would be to make a mammoth tree out of a
currant bush. Such a man will necessarily be short-lived. He will always suffer from the effects of his
folly, even though he shall marry. If he has children, &mdash;
he may become incapable, &mdash; they will be quite certain to
be puny, weak, scrofulous, consumptive, rickety, nervous,
depraved in body and mind, or otherwise deprived
<pb n="342"/>
of the happiness which grows out of the possession of
"a sound mind in a sound body."
</p><p>Let us notice a little more closely the terrible effects
resulting from this most unnatural and abominable vice.
</p><p>What Makes Boys Dwarfs? &mdash; How many times have
we seen boys who were born with good constitutions,
with force and stamina sufficient to develop them into
large, vigorous men, become puny dwarfs. At the time
when they ought to begin to grow and develop more
rapidly than ever before, their growth is checked, and
they cease to develop. They are, in fact, stunted,
dwarfed, like a plant which has a canker-worm eating
away at its roots. Indeed, there is a veritable canker-worm sapping their vitality, undermining their constitutions,
and destroying their prospects for time and for
eternity. Anxious friends may attribute the unhappy
change to overwork, overstudy, or some similar cause;
but from a somewhat extended observation, we are
thoroughly convinced that the very vice which we are
considering is the viper which blights the prospects and
poisons the existence of many of these promising boys.
</p><p>A boy who gives himself up to the practice of secret
vice at an early age, say as early as seven to ten years,
is certain to make himself a wreck. Instead of
having a healthy, vigorous body, with strong muscles
and a hardy constitution, he will be weak, scrawny,
sickly, always complaining, never well, and will never
know anything about that joyous exuberance of life and
animal spirits which the young antelope feels as he
bounds over the plain, or the vigorous young colt as it
frisks about its pasture and which every youth ought
to feel.
<pb n="343"/>
</p><p>Scrawny, Hollow-Eyed Boys. &mdash; Boys ought to be
fresh and vigorous as little lambs. They ought to be
plump, rosy, bright-eyed, and sprightly. A boy who is
pale, scrawny, hollow-eyed, dull, listless, has something
the matter with him. Self-abuse makes thousands of just
such boys every year; and it is just such boys that
make vicious, shiftless, haggard, unhappy men. This
horrible vice steals away the health and vitality which
are needed to develop body and mind; and the lad that
ought to make his mark in the world, that ought to
become a distinguished statesman, orator, clergyman,
physician, or author, becomes little more than a living
animal, a mere shadow of what he ought to have been
</p><p>Old Boys. &mdash; Often have we felt sad when we have
heard fond mothers speaking in glowing terms of the old
ways of their sons, and rather glorying that they looked
so much older than they were. In nine cases out of
ten, these old-looking boys owe their appearance to this
vile habit; for it is exceedingly common, and its dreadful
effects in shriveling and dwarfing and destroying the
human form are too plainly perceptible, when present,
to be mistaken. Oh, this dreadful curse! Why will so
many of our bright, innocent boys pollute themselves
with it?
</p><p>What Makes Idiots? &mdash; Reader, have you ever seen
an idiot? If you have, the hideous picture will never be
dissipated from your memory. The vacant stare, the
drooping, drooling mouth, the unsteady gait, the sensual
look, the emptiness of mind, &mdash; all these you well
remember. Did you ever stop to think how idiots are
made? It is by this very vice that the ranks of these
poor daft mortals are being recruited every day. Every
<pb n="344"/>
visitor to an insane asylum sees scores of them; ruined
in mind and body, only the semblance of a human being,
bereft of sense, lower than a beast in many respects, a
human being hopelessly lost to himself and to the
world, &mdash; oh, most terrible thought! &mdash; yet once pure,
intelligent, active, perhaps the hope of a fond mother, the
pride of a doting father, and possibly possessed of
natural ability to become greatly distinguished in some
of the many noble and useful walks of life; now sunk
below the brute through the degrading, destroying influence
of a lustful gratification.
</p><p>Boys, are you guilty of this terrible sin? have you
even once in this way yielded to the tempter's voice?
Stop, consider, think of the awful results, repent, confess
to God, reform. Another step in that direction, and
you may be lost, soul and body. You cannot dally
with the tempter. You must escape now or never.
Do n't delay.
</p><p>Young Dyspeptics. &mdash; If we leave out of the consideration
the effects of bad food and worse cookery, there
is in our estimation no other cause so active as this in
occasioning the early breaking down of the digestive organs
of our American boys. A boy ten or twelve years
of age ought to have a stomach capable of digesting
anything not absolutely indigestible; but there are to-day
thousands and thousands of boys of that age whose
stomachs are so impaired as to be incapable of digesting
any but the most simple food. The digestion being
ruined, decay of the teeth soon follows. Hardly one boy
in a dozen has perfectly sound teeth. With a bad stomach
and bad teeth, a foundation for disease is laid which
is sure to result in early decay of the whole body.
<pb n="345"/>
</p><p>A Cause of Consumption. &mdash; In this awful vice do we
find a cause, too, for the thousands of cases of consumption
in young men. At the very time when they ought
to be in their prime, they break down in health, and
become helpless invalids for life, or speedily sink into an
early grave.
</p><p>Upon their tombstones might justly be graven,
"Here lies a self-murderer." Providence is not to
blame; nor is climate, weather, overwork, overstudy,
or any other even seemingly plausible cause to be
blamed. Their own sins have sunk them in mental,
moral, and physical perdition. Such a victim literally
dies by his own hand, a veritable suicide. Appalling
thought! It is a grand thing to die for one's principles,
a martyr to right and truth. One may die blameless
who is the victim of some dire contagious malady
which he could not avoid; even the poor, downcast
misanthrope, whose hopes are blighted and whose sorrows
multiplied, may possibly be in some degree excused for
wishing to end his misery with his life; but the
wretched being who sheds his life-blood by the disgusting
maneuvers of self-pollution,-what can be said to
extenuate <hi rend="italic">his</hi> guilt? His is a double crime. He will
perish, overwhelmed with his own vileness. Let him
die, and return to the dust from which he sprang. Let
him pass from the memory of his fellow-men.
</p><p>The Race Ruined by Boys. &mdash; The human race is
growing weaker year by year. The boys of to-day
would be no match in physical strength for the hale,
sturdy youths of a century ago, their great-grandparents.
An immense amount of skillful training enables
now and then one to accomplish some wonderful feat of
<pb n="346"/>
walking, rowing, or swimming; but we hear very little
of remarkable feats of labor accomplished by our modern
boys. Even the country boys of to-day cannot
endure the hard work which their fathers did at the
same age; and we doubt not that this growing physical
weakness is one of the reasons why so large a share of
the boys whose fathers are farmers, and who have been
reared on farms, are unwilling to follow the occupation of
their fathers for a livelihood. They are too weakly to
do the work required by an agricultural life, even by the
aid of the numerous labor-saving inventions of the age.
</p><p>What is it that is undermining the health of the
race, and sapping the constitutions of our American
men? No doubt much may be attributed to the unnatural
refinements of civilization in several directions; but
there can be no doubt that vice is the most active cause
of all. Secret sin and its kindred vices ruin more
constitutions every year than hard work, severe study,
hunger, cold, privation, and disease combined.
</p><p>Boys, the destiny of the race is in your hands.
You can do more than all the doctors, all the scientists
and most eminent political men in the world, to secure
the prosperity and future greatness of the nation, by
taking care of yourselves, by being pure, noble, true to
yourselves and to the demands of high moral principle.
</p><p>Cases Illustrating the Effects of Self-Abuse. &mdash; The
land is full of poor human wrecks who have dashed in
pieces their hopes for this world, and too often for the
next also, against this hideous rock which lies hidden in
the pathway of every young man who starts out upon
life's stormy voyage. Gladly would we cover them
and all their dreadful deformities, with the mantle of
<pb n="347"/>
charity from the gaze of their fellow-beings; but
their number is so great that this could scarcely
be done, and the lesson to be learned from their
sad fate is such a grave one, and so needful for the
good of the generation of young men who are just
encountering the same dangers, that we cannot resist
the promptings of duty to present a few examples of the
effects of vice in men and boys that have fallen under
our own observation. We have seen hundreds of cases
of this sort; have treated many scores of persons for
the effects of the terrible crime which we are seeking to
sound a warning against, and the number of cases we
might describe would fill a volume; but we will select
only a very few.
</p><p>Two Young Wrecks. &mdash; Charles and Oscar B &mdash;  &mdash;
were the sons of a farmer in a Western State, aged
respectively ten and twelve years. They possessed well-formed heads, and once had beautiful faces, and were as
bright and sprightly as any little boys of their age to be
found anywhere. Their father was proud of them, and
their fond mother took great pleasure in building bright
hopes for her darling sons when they should attain
maturity, and become competent to fill useful and honorable
positions in the world. Living in a rapidly-growing Western community, they had every prospect
of growing up to honorable usefulness, a comfort to their
parents, a blessing to the world, and capable of enjoying
life in the highest degree.
</p><p>But suddenly certain manifestations appeared which
gave rise to grave apprehensions on the part of the
parents. It was observed that the elder of the little boys
no longer played about with that nimbleness which he
<pb n="348"/>
had formerly shown, but seemed slow and stiff in his
movements. Sometimes, indeed, he would stagger a
little when he walked. Soon, also, his speech became
affected in some degree; he mumbled his words, and
could not speak distinctly. In spite of all that could
be done, the disease continued, increasing slowly in all
its symptoms from week to week. Soon the hands,
also, became affected, so that the little boy could not
feed himself. The mind now began to fail. The bright
eyes became vacant and expressionless. Instead of the
merry light which used to shine in them, there was a
blank, idiotic stare.
</p><p>Imagine the grief and anguish of the poor mother!
No one but a mother who has been called to pass through
a similar trial could know how to sympathize with such
an one. Her darling son she saw daily becoming a prey
to a strange, incurable malady, with no power even to
stay the progress of the terrible disease.
</p><p>But there was still greater grief in store for her.
Within a year or two the younger son began to show
symptoms of the same character, and in spite of all that
was done, rapidly sank into the same helpless state as
his brother. As a last resort, the mother took her boys,
and came a long journey to place them under our
care. At that time they were both nearly helpless.
Neither could walk but a few steps. They reeled and
staggered about like drunken men, falling down upon
each other, and going through the most agonizing
contortions in their attempts to work their way from one
chair to another and thus about the room. Their heads
were no longer erect, but drooped like wilted flowers.
On their faces was a blank, imbecile expression, with
<pb n="349"/>
few traces of their former intelligence left. The mouth
was open, from the drooping of the lower jaw, and the
saliva constantly dribbled upon the clothing. Altogether,
the sight of them was a most appalling spectacle.
</p><p>We at once set to work to discover the cause of this
dreadful condition, believing that such an awful
punishment should certainly be the result of some gross
violation of nature's laws somewhere. The most careful
scrutiny of the history of the parents of the unfortunate
lads gave us no clue to anything of an hereditary
character, both parents having come of good families,
and having been always of sober, temperate habits.
The father had used neither liquor nor tobacco in any
form. The mother could give no light on the matter,
and we were obliged to rest for the time being upon the
conviction which fastened itself upon us that the cases
before us were most marked illustrations of the results
of self-abuse begun at a very early age. The mother
thought it impossible that our suspicions could be
correct, saying that she had watched her sons with jealous
care from earliest infancy, and had seen no indications of
any error of the sort. But we had not long to wait for
confirmation of our view of the case, as they were soon
caught in the act, to which it was found that they were
greatly addicted, and the mystery was wholly solved.
</p><p>Every possible remedy was used to check the terrible
disease which was preying upon the unfortunate boys,
but in vain. At times the symptoms would be somewhat
mitigated, and the most sanguine hopes of the fond,
watching mother would be excited, but in vain. The
improvement was always but temporary, and the poor
sufferers would speedily relapse into the same dreadful
<pb n="350"/>
condition again, and gradually grow worse. At last the
poor mother was obliged to give up all hope, in utter
despair watching the daily advances of the awful malady
which inch by inch destroyed the life, the humanity, the
very mind and soul of her once promising sons. Sadly
she took them back to her Western home, there to see
them suffer, perhaps for years before death should kindly
release them, &mdash; the terrible penalty of sin committed
almost before they had arrived at years of responsibility.
</p><p>How these mere infants learned the vice, we were
never able to determine. We have no doubt that
opportunities sufficient were presented them, as the parents
seemed to have very little appreciation of danger from
this source. Had greater vigilance been exercised, we
doubt not that the discovery of the vice at the beginning
would have resulted in the salvation of these two beautiful
boys, who were sacrificed upon the altar of concupiscence.
Two or three years after we first saw the cases,
we heard from them, and though still alive, their
condition was almost too horrible for description. Three
or four similar cases have come to our knowledge.
</p><p>Boys, are you guilty? Think of the fearful fate of
these boys, once as joyous and healthy as you. When
you are tempted to sin, think of the fearful picture of
the effects of sin which they present. Have you ever
once dared to commit this awful Sin? Stop, never dare
to do the thing again. Take a solemn vow before God
to be pure. Your fate may be as sad, your punishment
as terrible. No one can tell what the results may be.
Absolute purity is the only safe course.
</p><p>A Prodigal Youth. &mdash; A. M., son of a gentleman of
wealth in Ohio, early acquired the evil practice which
<pb n="351"/>
has ruined so many bright lads. He was naturally an
intelligent and prepossessing lad, and his father gave
him as good an education as he could be induced to
acquire, affording him most excellent opportunities for
study and improvement. But the vile habit which had
been acquired at an early age, speedily began its blighting
influence. It destroyed his taste for study and culture.
His mind dwelt upon low and vile subjects. He
grew restless of home restraint and surroundings, and
finally left the parental roof. Wandering from city to
city, he grew rapidly worse, sinking into deeper depths
of vice, until finally he became a base, besotted, wretched
creature. Broken down in health by his sins, he could
no longer enjoy even the most sensual pleasures; and
with no taste for or capability of appreciating anything
higher, he was most wretched indeed. The poor fellow
then fell into the hands of quacks. His kind father sent
him money in answer to his pitiful appeals for help, and
he went anxiously from one to another of the wretched
villains who promise relief to such sufferers, but only
rob them of their money, and leave them worse than
before.
</p><p>At last, in total despair of everything else, the poor
fellow came to us. He seemed quite broken-hearted
and penitent for his sins, and really appeared to want to
lead a better life if he could only be made well again.
We faithfully pointed out to him the dreadful wickedness
of his course, and the fact that a cure could only be
effected by the most implicit obedience to all of nature's
laws during his whole future life. Indeed, we were
obliged to inform him of the sad fact that he could never
be as well as before, that he must always suffer in con-<pb n="352"/>
sequence of his dreadful course of transgression. We
gave him a most earnest exhortation to begin the work
of reform where alone it could be effectual, by reforming
his heart; and the tears which coursed down his sin-scarred cheeks seemed to indicate true penitence and a
real desire to return to the paths of purity and peace.
</p><p>Earnestly we labored for this young man, for months
employing every means in our power to lift him from
the slough of sin and vice upon the solid pathway of
virtue and purity again. Gradually the hard lines on
his face seemed to lessen in intensity. The traces of
vice and crime seemed to be fading out by degrees. We
began to entertain hopes of his ultimate recovery. But
alas! in an evil moment, through the influence of bad
companions, he fell, and for some time we lost sight of
him. A long time afterward we caught a glimpse of
his bloated, sin-stained face, just as he was turning
aside to avoid recognition. Where this poor human
wreck is now leading his miserable existence we cannot
say, but have no doubt he is haunting the dens of iniquity
and sin in the cities, seeking to find a little momentary
pleasure in the gratification of his appetites and passions.
A hopeless wreck, with the lines of vice and crime
drawn all over his tell-tale countenance, he dares not go
home, for he fears to meet the reproachful glance of his
doting mother, and the scornful looks of his brothers
and sisters.
</p><p>We never saw a more thoroughly unhappy creature.
He is fully conscious of his condition. He sees himself
to be a wreck, in mind, in body, and knows that he is
doomed to suffer still more in consequence of his vices.
He has no hope for this world or the next. His mother
<pb n="353"/>
gave him earnest, pious instructions, which he has never
forgotten, though he has long tried to smother them.
He now looks forward with terror to the fate which he
well knows awaits all evil-doers, and shudders at the
thought, but seems powerless to enter the only avenue
which affords a chance of escape. He is so tormented
with the pains and diseased conditions which he has
brought upon himself by vice, that he often looks to
self-destruction as a grateful means of escape; but then
comes the awful foreboding of future punishment, and
his hand is stayed. Ashamed to meet his friends, afraid
to meet his Maker, he wanders about, an exile, an outcast,
a hopeless wreck.
</p><p>Young man, youth, have you taken the first step on
this evil road? If so, take warning by the fate of this
young man. At once "cease to do evil and learn to do
well," before, like him, you lose the power to do right,
before your will is paralyzed by sin so that when you
desire to do right, to reform, your will and power to
execute your good determinations fail to support your
effort.
</p><p>Barely Escaped. &mdash; L. R., of H &mdash;  &mdash; , a young man
about twenty-five years of age, presented himself for
treatment, a few years ago, for the consequences of self-abuse. Having been taught the habit by evil companions
when just merging into manhood, he had indulged his
passions without restraint for several years, not knowing
the evil consequences until he began to suffer the effects
of sin. Then, being warned by his own experience, and
by the fortunate thoughtfulness of an intelligent friend
who surmised his condition and told him faithfully of
the terrible results of the vile habit, he made a manly
<pb n="354"/>
effort to reform, and claimed to have wholly broken the
habit. To his great grief he found, however, that the
years in which he had devoted himself to sin had
wrought sad havoc in his system. In many ways his
health was greatly deranged, and his once powerful
constitution was broken down. The sexual organs
themselves were greatly diseased, so much so that a serious
and painful surgical operation was necessary. With
shame and mortification he looked upon his past life, and
saw what a hideous work of evil he had wrought. His
vileness stood out before him in a vivid light, and he
felt ashamed to meet the gaze of his fellows.
</p><p>After performing the necessary surgical operation
upon this poor unfortunate, we dealt faithfully with him,
pointing out to him the way by which he might with
proper effort in some degree redeem himself by a life-long struggle against every form of impurity. He felt,
and rightly, that the task was a most severe one. He
well knew that the stamp of sin was on his countenance
and in his mind. Thoughts long allowed to run upon
vile subjects, forming filthy pictures in the imagination,
are not easily brought back to the channel of purity and
virtue. The mind that has learned to love to riot in
impure dreams, does not readily acquire a love for the
opposite. But he determined to make a brave and
earnest effort, and we have every reason to believe that
he has, in a measure at least, succeeded. But, if so, he
has made a narrow escape. A few more years of sin,
and his rescue would have been impossible; both mind
and body would have been sunk so deep in the mire of
concupiscence that nothing but Almighty power could
have saved him from utter destruction.
<pb n="355"/>
</p><p>Thousands of boys and young men are to-day standing
on the slippery brink of that awful precipice from
which but very few are snatched away. Soon they will
plunge headlong over into the abyss of debasement and
corruption, from whence they will never escape. Oh
that we had the power to reach each one of these unfortunate
youths before it is too late, and to utter in their
ears such warnings, to portray before them such pictures
of the sure results of a course of sin, that they might be
turned back to the paths of chastity and virtue before
they have become such mental, moral, and physical
wrecks as we every day encounter in the walks of life.
But not one in a thousand can be reached when they
have gone so far in sin. When they have ventured
once, they can rarely be checked in their downward
course until great harm has been wrought which it will
require the work of years to undo. The young man we
have referred to made indeed a narrow escape, but no
one can safely run such a risk. Even he must suffer
all his life the consequences of a few years of sin.
</p><p>A Lost Soul. &mdash; M. M., of &mdash;  &mdash; , was the son of a
mechanic in humble circumstances. He was an only
child, and his parents spared no pains to do all in their
power to insure his becoming a good and useful man.
Good school advantages were given him, and at a proper
age he was put to learn a trade. He succeeded fairly,
and their hopes of his becoming all that they could
desire were great, when he suddenly began to manifest
peculiar symptoms. He had attended a religious revival,
and seemed much affected, professing religion and
becoming a member of the church. To the exercises of his
mind on the subject of religion his friends attributed his
<pb n="356"/>
peculiar actions, which soon became so strange as to
excite grave fears that his mind was seriously affected.
At times he was wild, showing such unmistakable
evidences of insanity that even his poor mother, who
was loth to believe the sad truth, was forced to admit
that he was deranged.
</p><p>After a few months a change came over him, which
encouraged his friends to think that he was recovering.
He became quiet and tractable, never manifesting the
furious symptoms before observed. But the deception
was only temporary; for it was soon evident that the
change was simply the result of the progress of the
disease, and denoted a failure of the mental powers and
the approach of imbecility. In this condition was the
young man when he came under our care. We felt
strongly impressed from our first examination of the
case that it was one of sexual abuse; but we were
assured by his friends in the most emphatic manner that
such was an impossibility. It was claimed that the
most scrupulous care had been bestowed upon him, and
that he had been so closely watched that it was impossible
that he should have been guilty of so gross a vice.
His friends were disposed to attribute his sad condition
to excessive exercise of mind upon religious subjects.
</p><p>Not satisfied with this view of the case, we set a close
watch upon him, and within a week his nurse reported
that he had detected him in the act of self-pollution,
when he confessed the truth, not being yet so utterly
devoid of sense as to have lost his appreciation of the
sinfulness of the act. When discovered, he exclaimed
"I know I have made myself a fool," which was the
exact truth.
<pb n="357"/>
</p><p>At this time the once bright and intelligent youth
had become so obtuse and stupid that he appeared
almost senseless. His face wore an idiotic expression,
and was rarely lighted up by a look of intelligence.
It was only by the greatest exertion that he could be
made to understand or to respond when spoken to. In
whatever position he was placed, whether lying, sitting,
or standing, no matter how constrained or painful, he
would remain for hours, staring vacantly, as fixed and
immovable as a statue. His countenance was blank and
expressionless, except at rare intervals. His lips were
always parted, and the saliva ran from the corners of his
mouth down upon his clothing. The calls of nature
were responded to involuntarily, constantly soiling his
clothing and bedding in a most disgusting manner, and
requiring the constant attention of a nurse to keep him
in anything like a wholesome condition.
</p><p>We did what we could to relieve this poor victim of
unhallowed lust, but soon became convinced that no
human arm could save from utter ruin this self-destroyed
soul. At our suggestion the young man was removed,
to be placed in an institution devoted to the care of
imbeciles and lunatics. The last we heard of the poor
fellow he was still sinking into lower depths of physical
and mental degradation, &mdash; a soul utterly lost and ruined.
How many thousands of young men who might have
been useful members of society, lawyers, clergymen,
statesmen, scientists, have thus sunk into the foul
depths of the quagmire of vice, to rise no more forever!
Oh, awful fate! The human eye never rests upon a
sadder sight than a ruined soul, a mind shattered and
debased by vice.
<pb n="358"/>
</p><p>The Results of One Transgression. &mdash; The following
case is a good illustration of the fact that a long course
of transgression is not necessary to occasion the most
serious results. A young man from an Eastern State,
who visited us for treatment, was suffering with the
usual consequences of self-abuse; but he asserted in the
most emphatic manner that he had never committed the
act of self-pollution but once in his life. He had, however,
after that one vile act, allowed his mind to run
upon vile thoughts, giving loose rein to his imagination,
and in consequence he found himself as bad off, suffering
with the very same disorders, as those who had practiced
the vice for some time.
</p><p>Not the slightest dallying with sin is safe. The
maintenance of perfect purity and chastity of body and
mind is the only right and safe course. By a few
months' treatment the young man recovered his health
in a great measure, and, marrying an estimable young
lady, settled down happily in life. Many tears of
remorse and repentance did he shed over that one sinful
act, and bitterly did he reproach the evil companion who
taught him to sin; but he was fortunate enough to
escape without suffering the worst effects of the sin, and
is now living a reformed and happy life.
</p><p>A Hospital Case. &mdash; One of the most wretched creatures
we ever saw among the many sufferers from sexual
excesses we have met, was a man about thirty years of
age whom we found in the large Charity Hospital on
Blackwell's Island, New York City. In consequence of
long indulgence in the soul-and-body-destroying habit,
he had brought upon himself, not only the most serious
and painful disease of the sexual organs themselves, but
<pb n="359"/>
disease of the bladder and other adjacent organs. He
was under severe and painful treatment for a long time
without benefit, and finally a surgical operation was
performed, but with the result of affording only partial
relief.
</p><p>An Old Offender. &mdash; Never were we more astonished
than at the depth of depravity revealed to us by the
confessions of a patient from a distant country who
upwards of sixty years of age, and was yet a victim of
the vile habit to which he had become addicted when a
youth. The stamp of vice was on his face, and was not
hidden by the lines made by advancing age. The sufferings
which this ancient sinner endured daily in consequence
of his long course of sin were sometimes fearful
to behold; and yet he continued the habit in spite of all
warnings, advice, and every influence which could be
brought to bear upon him. So long had he transgressed,
he had lost his sense of shame, and his appreciation of
the vileness of sin, and it was impossible to reform him
by any means which could be brought to bear upon him.
He left us still a sufferer, though somewhat relieved, and
we have every reason to believe, as vile a sinner as ever.
Undoubtedly, before this time his worthless life is ended,
and he has gone down into a sinner's grave, hoary with
vice, &mdash; a terrible end.
</p><p>The Sad End of a Young Victim. &mdash; C. L., a young
man residing in a large Southern city, was the youngest
son of parents who, though in moderate circumstances,
appreciated the value of education, and were anxious to
give their children every advantage possible for them to
receive. With this end in view, the young man was
sent to college, where he did well for a time, being
<pb n="360"/>
naturally studious and intelligent; but after a brief
period he began to drop behind his classes. He seemed
moody and obtuse. He could not complete his tasks,
even by the most severe application. It seemed impossible
for him to apply himself. The power of concentration
appeared to be lost. Soon he was seized with fits of
gloominess from which he did not seem to have power
to free himself. His strength began to fail to such a
degree that he could hardly drag himself to his meals,
and at last he was almost confined to his room. He
became greatly emaciated. The failure of his mental
powers seemed to keep pace with the wasting of his
body, so that it was soon evident that he must abandon
all hope of pursuing his studies, for some time at least.
</p><p>His case being brought to our notice, we gave him
every attention possible, and spared no effort to rescue
him from his condition. We readily perceived the cause
of his troubles, but for a long time he did not acknowledge
the truth. At last he confessed that he had
sinned for years in the manner suspected, and was
suffering the consequences. A knowledge of his guilt
weighed upon him, and haunted him day and night. He
promised to reform; but if he did, it was too late, for the
wasting disease which had fastened upon him continued.
At his mother's request he returned to his home, and a
few weeks later we received the awful intelligence that
he had ended his miserable life by blowing out his brains
with a pistol. Thus tragically ended the career of this
young man, who might, with the advantages afforded
him, have become a useful member of society. In total
despair for this life or the next, he rashly ended his
probation, and with his own hand finished the work of de-<pb n="361"/>
struction which he had himself begun. No words can
tell the grief of his stricken mother; but fortunately,
she was spared the knowledge of the whole truth else
would her sorrow have been too great to bear.
</p><p>From Bad to Worse. &mdash; C. E., a young man from the
West, was sent to us by his father with the request that
we would do what we could to save him. His father's
letter intimated that the son had been a source of grief
to him, but he hoped that he had repented of his prodigal
course, and was really determined to reform.
Though scarcely more than twenty years of age, the
young man's face wore an aspect of hardness, from
familiarity with vice, that we have rarely seen. He
was reduced to a mere skeleton by the vice which he
made no secret of, and was so weak that he could
scarcely walk a rod. It seemed as if every organ in his
body was diseased, and that he had so squandered his
vital resources that he had no power to rally from his
wretched condition, even should he carry out the
determination to reform which he announced. However, we
gave him the best counsel and advice within our power,
and placed him under treatment. After a few weeks it
was evident that nature was still willing to respond to
his endeavors to reform, by vigorous efforts to restore
him to a condition of comparative health. Thus he was
snatched, as it appeared, from the very jaws of death.
Under these circumstances it would seem that the most
hardened criminal would reform, at least for a season,
and lead a life of rectitude; but so utterly depraved
was this poor wretch that no sooner did he find that he
was not liable to die immediately than he at once began
again his career of sin. By long indulgence his moral
<pb n="362"/>
sense had become apparently obliterated. He seemed
to be utterly without the restraint imposed by
conscience. In less than a month he was detected in the
crime of theft, having stolen a watch from a fellow-patient. Upon his arrest, stimulated by the hope of in
some degree mitigating his punishment, he confessed to
having been carrying on a series of petty thieving for
weeks before he was finally detected, having scores of
stolen articles in possession. The last time we saw the
wretched fellow he was being led away in irons to
prison. We have since heard that he continues in his
downward career, having served out his time in prison,
and will undoubtedly end his life in a felon's cell, unless
he is shrewd enough to escape his just deserts. Having
lost all desire to do right, to be noble, pure, and good,
all efforts to reform and restore him to the path of
rectitude were fruitless. It was only the fear of impending
death that caused him to pause for a few days in his
criminal course.
</p><p>Young man, take warning by this sad case; enter
not the pathway of vice. A course of vice once entered
upon is not easily left. A youth who once gives himself
up to sin, rarely escapes from going headlong to destruction.
</p><p>An Indignant Father. &mdash; A case came to our knowledge
through a gentleman who brought his daughter to us
for treatment for the effects of self-abuse, of a father
who adopted a summary method of curing his son of the
evil practice. Having discovered that the lad was a
victim of the vile habit, and having done all in his
power by punishment, threats, and representations of its
terrible effects, but without inducing him to reform, the
<pb n="363"/>
father, in a fit of desperation, seized the sinful boy, and
with his own hand performed upon him the operation of
castration as he would have done upon a colt. The boy
recovered from the operation, and was of course effectually
cured of his vile habit. The remedy was efficient,
though not justifiable. Even a father has no right
thus to mutilate his own son, though we must confess
that the lad's chances for becoming a useful man are
fully as good as they would have been had he continued
his course of sin.
</p><p>Disgusted with Life. &mdash; T. A. was a young man of
promise, the son of ambitious parents, proud-spirited, and
without respect for religion. While still quite young,
he enlisted in the service of the Government, and
after a time rose to the position of an officer in the U. S.
army. Having in boyhood acquired the habit of self-abuse, he had stimulated his passions without restraint,
and was readily led still farther astray by the evil
companions by whom he was surrounded. He indulged
his passions in every way and on every occasion when
he found opportunity, and speedily began to feel the
effects of his vices. Before he was fully aware of his
condition, he found himself being literally devoured by
one of the vilest of all diseases.
</p><p>The malady made rapid advances, and speedily
reduced him to a condition of almost absolute helplessness.
He was obliged to obtain a furlough; but his
vital forces were so nearly exhausted that he did not
rally, even under skillful treatment; and when his
furlough expired, he was still in the same pitiable condition.
Getting it extended for a time, he by accident came
under our care, and by the aid of very thorough treat-<pb n="364"/>
ment he was in a measure improved, though the progress
of the disease was simply stayed. When apprised of his
real condition, he exhibited much agitation, walking
nervously about his room, and finally exclaimed that he
was utterly disgusted with life anyway, and after a few
weeks or months more of suffering he should blow his
brains out, and end his misery. He had no fears of
death, he said; and we presume that he could not
imagine it possible that there was any greater suffering
in store for him than he already endured.
</p><p>We pitied the poor fellow from the bottom of our
heart. He had natural qualities which ought to have
made him distinguished. He might have risen high in
the world of usefulness. Now he was compelled to
look back upon a short life of squandered opportunities,
a pathway stained with vice, memories of vile debaucheries
which had wasted his youth and broken his constitution.
Wretched was he, indeed. Notwithstanding
his vileness, he was not lost to shame; for his greatest
fear was that his friends might ascertain the real cause
of his sufferings, to conceal which he was obliged to
resort to all sorts of subterfuges. As soon as he was
able to travel, he left us, with little hope for this world
and none for the next; and we have heard nothing of
him since.
</p><p>Scores of similar cases we might recount in detail,
but we have not the space in this volume. These will
suffice to give the young reader an idea of the terrible
results of this awful vice which are suffered by its
victims. We have not dared to portray in these pages
one-half the misery and wretchedness which we have
seen as the results of self-abuse and the vices to which
<pb n="365"/>
it leads. The picture is too terrible for young eyes to
behold. We most sincerely hope that none of our readers
will ever have to suffer as we have seen boys and
young men do, languishing in misery as the result of
their own transgressions of the laws of chastity. We
will now devote the remaining pages of this chapter to
the consideration of some of the causes of the vice, the
avenues that lead to the awful sin which we are considering,
to the terrible consequences which attend it.
</p><p>Bad Company. &mdash; The influence of evil companionship
is one of the most powerful agents for evil against which
those who love purity, and are seeking to elevate and
benefit their fellow-men, have to contend. A bad boy
can do more harm in a community than can be counteracted
by all the clergymen, Sabbath-school teachers,
tract-distributers, and other Christian workers combined.
An evil boy is a pest compared with which the cholera,
small-pox, and even the plague, are nothing. The
damage which would be done by a terrific hurricane
sweeping with destructive force through a thickly settled
district is insignificant compared with the evil work
which may be accomplished by one vicious lad.
</p><p>No community is free from these vipers, these agents
of the arch-fiend. Every school, no matter how select
it may be, contains a greater or less number of these
young moral lepers. Often they pursue their work
unsuspected by the good and pure, who do not dream of
the vileness pent up in the young brains which have not
yet learned the multiplication table and scarcely learned
to read. We have known instances in which a boy
seven or eight years of age has implanted the venom of
vice in the hearts and minds of half a score of pure-<pb n="366"/>
minded lads within a few days of his first association
with them. This vice spreads like wild-fire. It is more
"catching" than the most contagious disease, and more
tenacious, when once implanted, than the leprosy.
</p><p>Boys are easily influenced either for right or wrong,
but especially for the wrong; hence it is the duty of
parents to select good companions for their children, and
it is the duty of children to avoid bad company as they
would avoid carrion or the most loathsome object. A
boy with a match box in a powder magazine would be
in no greater danger than in the company of most of the
lads who attend our public schools and play upon the
streets. It is astonishing how early children, especially
boys, will sometimes learn the hideous, shameless tricks
of vice which yearly lead thousands down to everlasting
death. Often, children begin their course of sin while
yet cradled in their mother's arms, thus early taught by
some vile nurse. Boys that fight and swear, that play
upon the streets and disobey their parents, may be
wisely shunned as unfit for associates. In many
instances, however, boys whose conduct is in other
respects wholly faultless, sometimes indulge in vice,
ignorant of its real nature and consequences.
</p><p>At the first intimation of evil on the part of a
companion, a boy who is yet pure should flee away as from
a deadly serpent or a voracious beast. Do not let the
desire to gratify a morbid curiosity deter you from fleeing
at once from the source of contamination. Under
such circumstances, do not hesitate a moment to escape
from danger. If an evil word is spoken, or an indecent
act of any sort indulged in by a companion, cut the
acquaintance of such a boy at once. Never allow yourself
<pb n="367"/>
to be alone with him for a moment. On no account be
induced to associate with him. He will as surely soil
and besmear with sin your moral garments as would
contact with the most filthy object imaginable your
outer garments.
</p><p>It were better for a boy never to see or associate
with a lad of his own age than to run any risk of being
corrupted before he is old enough to appreciate the terrible
enormity of sin, and the awful consequences of transgression.
It should be recollected, also, that not only young
boys, but vicious youths and young men are frequently
the instructors in vice. It is unsafe to trust any but
those who are known to be pure.
</p><p>Bad Language. &mdash; We have often been astonished at
the facility with which children acquire the language
of vice. Often we have been amazed to hear little
boys scarcely out of their cradles, lisping the most
horrible oaths and the vilest epithets. The streets and
alleys in our large cities, and in smaller ones also, in a
less degree, are nurseries of vice, in which are reared
the criminals that fill our jails, prisons, work-houses,
school-ships, and houses of correction. Many a lad
begins his criminal education by learning the language of
vice and sin. At first he simply imitates the evil
utterances of others; but soon he learns the full significance
of the obscene and filthy language which he hears
and repeats, and then he rapidly progresses in the
downward road.
</p><p>A boy that indulges in the use of foul language, will
not long be chaste in acts. It is a safe rule to be
followed by those who wish to grow up pure and unsullied
by sin, untainted by vice, that those who use bad lan-<pb n="368"/>
guage are persons to avoid, to keep away from. Even
those who are well fortified against vice, who have been
faithfully warned of its consequences and fully appreciate
its dangers, cannot be safely trusted to associate
with vile talkers. The use of bad language by old and
young is an evil which is of the very greatest, moment.
It is too often ignored; too little is said about it; far
too often it is regarded as of little consequence; and
persons who are really not bad at heart, thoughtlessly
encourage the evil by listening to and laughing at
obscene and ribald jokes, and impure language which
ought to make a virtuous man blush with shame to
hear.
</p><p>Boys, if you want to be pure, if you wish to be
loved by a pure mother, an innocent sister, and when
you are grown to manhood to be worthy of the confidence
of a pure, virtuous wife, keep your lips pure;
never let a vile word or an indecent allusion pass them.
Never, under any circumstances, give utterance to
language that you would blush to have your mother over-hear. If you find yourself in the company of persons
whose language will not bear this test, escape as soon
as possible, for you are in danger; your sense of what
is right and proper in speech is being vitiated; you are
being damaged in many ways.
</p><p>Bad Books. &mdash; A bad book is as bad as an evil
companion. In some respects it is even worse than a
living teacher of vice, since it may cling to an individual
at all times. It may follow him to the secrecy of his
bed-chamber, and there poison his mind with the venom
of evil. The influence of bad books in making bad boys
and men is little appreciated. Few are aware how much
<pb n="369"/>
evil seed in being sown among the young everywhere
through the medium of vile books. It is not only the
wretched volumes of obscenity, of which so many
thousands have been seized and destroyed by Mr. Comstock,
that are included under the head of bad books, and
which corrupt the morals of the young, and lead them
to enter the road to infamy; but the evil literature
which is sold in "dime and nickel novels," and which
constitutes the principal part of the contents of such
papers as the <hi rend="italic">Police Gazette</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Police News</hi>, and a
large proportion of the sensational story books which
flood the land, and too many of which find their way
into town and circulating libraries, and even Sunday-school libraries, which are rarely selected with the care
that should be exercised in the selection of reading
matter for the young.
</p><p>Bad books often find their way even where evil
companions would not intrude, and undoubtedly effect
a work of evil almost as great as is wrought by bad associations.
</p><p>Look out, boys, for the tempter in this guise. If a
companion offers you a book of a suspicious character,
take it home to your father, your mother, or some reliable
older friend, for examination. If it is handed you
with an air of secrecy, or if a promise to keep it hidden
from others is required, have nothing to do with it.
You might better place a coal of fire or a live viper in
your bosom, than to allow yourself to read such a book.
The thoughts that are implanted in the mind in youth
will stick there through life, in spite of all efforts to
dislodge them. Hundreds of men who have been thus
injured when young, but have by some providence es-<pb n="370"/>
caped a life of vice and shame, look back with most
intense regret to the early days of childhood, and
earnestly wish that the pictures then made in the mind
by bad books might be effaced. Evil impressions thus
formed, often torture the mind during a whole lifetime.
In the most inopportune moments they will intrude
themselves. When the individual desires to place his mind
undividedly upon sacred and elevated themes, even at
the most solemn moments of life, these lewd pictures
will sometimes intrude themselves in spite of his efforts
to avoid them. It is an awful thing to allow the mind
to be thus contaminated; and many a man would give
the world, if he possessed it, to be free from the horrible
incubus of a defiled imagination.
</p><p>Vile Pictures. &mdash; Obscene and lascivious pictures are
influences leading boys astray which are too important to
be unnoticed. Evil men, agents of the arch-fiend, have
adopted all sorts of devices for putting into the hands of
the boys and youth of the rising generation pictures
calculated to excite the passions, to lead to vice. Thousands
of these vile pictures are in circulation throughout the
country, in spite of the worthy efforts of such philanthropists
as Mr. Anthony Comstock and his co-laborers. In
almost every large school there are boys who have a
supply of these infamous designs, and act as agents in
scattering the evil contagion among all who come under
their influence.
</p><p>Under the guise of art, the genius of some of our
finest artists is turned to pandering to this base desire
for sensuous gratification. The pictures which hang in
many of our art galleries, that are visited by old and
young of both sexes, often number in the list views
<pb n="371"/>
which to those whose thoughts are not well trained to
rigid chastity can be only means of evil. A plea may
be made for these paintings in the name of art; but we
see no necessity for the development of art is this
particular direction, when nature presents so many and
such varied scenes of loveliness in landscapes, flowers,
beautiful birds, and graceful animals, to say nothing of
the human form protected by sufficient covering to
satisfy the demands of modesty.
</p><p>Many of the papers and magazines sold at our
newsstands, and eagerly sought after by young men and
boys, are better suited for the parlors of a house of ill-repute than for the eyes of pure-minded youth. A
news-dealer who will distribute such vile sheets, ought
to be dealt with as an educator in vice and crime, an
agent of evil, and a recruiting officer for hell and perdition.
</p><p>Evil Thoughts. &mdash; No one can succeed long in keeping
himself from vicious acts whose thoughts dwell upon
unchaste subjects. Only those who are pure in heart
will be pure and chaste in action. The mind must be
educated to love and dwell upon pure subjects in early
life, as by this means only can the foundation be laid
for that purity of character which alone will insure
purity of life. When the mind once becomes contaminated
with evil thoughts, it requires the work of years
of earnest effort to purge it from uncleanness. Vile
thoughts leave scars which even time will not always
efface. They soil and deprave the soul, as vile acts do
the body. God knows them, if no human being does;
and if harbored and cherished, they will tell against the
character in the day of Judgment as surely as will evil
words and deeds.
<pb n="372"/>
</p><p>Influence of Other Bad Habits. &mdash; Evil practices of
any sort which lower the moral tone of an individual,
which lessen his appreciation of and love for right and
purity and true nobility of soul, encourage the development
of vice. A boy who loves purity, who has a keen
sense of what is true and right, can never become a
vicious man. Profanity, falsehood, and deception of
every sort, have a tendency in the direction of vice.
</p><p>The use of highly seasoned food, of rich sauces,
spices and condiments, sweetmeats, and in fact all kinds
of stimulating foods, has an undoubted influence upon
the sexual nature of boys, stimulating those organs into
too early activity, and occasioning temptations to sin
which otherwise would not occur. The use of mustard,
pepper, pepper-sauce, spices, rich gravies, and all
similar kinds of food, should be carefully avoided by young
persons. They are not wholesome for either old or
young; but for the young they are absolutely dangerous.
</p><p>The use of beer, wine, hard cider, and tobacco, is
especially damaging to boys on this account. These
stimulants excite the passions, and produce a clamoring
for sensual gratification which few boys or young men
have the will-power or moral courage to resist. Tobacco
is an especially detrimental agent. The early age at
which boys now begin the use of tobacco may be one reason
why the practice of secret vice is becoming so terribly
common among boys and young men. We consider a
boy or young man who uses tobacco liable to the
commission of some vile act.
</p><p>The use of tea and coffee by boys is also a practice
which should be interdicted. All wise physicians for-<pb n="373"/>
bid the use of these narcotic drinks, together with that
of tobacco, and always with benefit to those who abstain.
In France, the government has made a law forbidding
the use of tobacco by students in the public schools.
In Germany, a still more stringent law has been made,
which forbids the use of tobacco by boys and young
men. These laws have been made on account of the
serious injury which was evidently resulting from the
use of the filthy weed to both the health and the morals
of the young men of those countries. There is certainly
an equal need for such a law in this country.
</p><p>Closing Advice to Boys and Young Men. &mdash; One
word more, and we must close this chapter, which we
hope has been read with care by those for whom it is
especially written. Let every boy who peruses these
pages, remember that the facts here stated are true.
Every word we have verified, and we have not written
one-half that might be said upon this subject. Let the
boy who is still pure, who has never defiled himself
with vice, firmly resolve that with the help of God he
will maintain a pure and virtuous character. It is much
easier to preserve purity than to get free from the taint
of sin after having been once defiled. Let the boy who
has already fallen into evil ways, who has been taught
the vile practice the consequences of which we have
endeavored to describe, and who is already in the downward
road, &mdash; let him resolve now to break the chain of
sin, to reform at once, and to renounce his evil practice
forever. The least hesitancy, the slightest dalliance
with the demon vice, and the poor victim will be lost{.}
Now, this moment, is the time to reform. Seek purity
of mind and heart. Banish evil thoughts and shun evil
<pb n="374"/>
companions; then with earnest prayer to God, wage a
determined battle for purity and chastity until the
victory is wholly won.
</p><p>One of the greatest safeguards for a boy is implicit
trust and confidence in his parents. Let him go to them
with all his queries, instead of to some older boyish
friend. If all boys would do this, an immense amount
of evil would be prevented. When tempted to sin,
boys, think first of the vileness and wickedness of the
act; think that God and pure angels behold every act,
and even know every thought. Nothing is hid from
their eyes. Think, then, of the awful results of this
terrible sin, and fly from temptation as from a burning
house. Send up a prayer to God to deliver you from
temptation, and you will not fall. Every battle manfully
and successfully fought, will add new strength to your
resolution and force to your character. Gaining such
victories from day to day, you will grow up to be a pure,
noble, useful man, the grandest work of God, and will
live a happy, virtuous life yourself, and add to the
happiness of those around you.</p>


</div1><div1 type="chapter" n="13" id="d21"><pb n="375"/>
<head>A Chapter for Young Men.</head>
<p>
AT about the age of fifteen years, the lad begins
to assume the characteristics of the young man.
The shoulders broaden, the voice deepens, a
rapid growth in hight and an increase in weight
occurs, and slight symptoms of a beard make their
appearance. The physiological changes which take place
in the body at this time are of serious import, and exert
a profound influence upon all parts of the body, The
sexual functions, which have heretofore been wholly
placid, provided the individual has been reared
normally, now become more active, as indicated by the
increased development of the organs. There is not,
necessarily, however, any functional activity or excitement
of the sexual system. If properly educated, and
surrounded by the proper influences, a boy of this age
will know nothing of the overwhelming excitements
of the sexual functions; and for some years longer,
these organs are by nature intended to remain passive,
no natural demand for their use occurring until
after the body has attained full maturity.
</p><p>Unfortunately, however, the natural order of things
is too frequently interfered with through the influence of
evil companions, and the majority of boys become more
or less contaminated morally long before this period.
Fortunate, indeed, is the boy who at the attainment

<pb n="376"/>
of puberty has acquired no form of sexual vice. The
nature of these vices, and the manner in which they
have been acquired, has been fully considered in another
chapter. The facts there stated, need not here be
recapitulated.
</p><p>It is important, however, to emphasize the fact that
at this period the natural development of the sexual
organs renders them peculiarly liable to excitement, and
hence those who have up to this time been so fortunate
as to escape the acquirement of any evil practice,
are now liable to make the fatal discovery, which
may be the means of effecting their physical and moral
ruin. Hence it is important for parents to set about
their boys at this time the most careful safeguards, to
warn them of the evils they are likely to encounter, and
by good council, to fortify them against the temptations
they are sure to meet. It is also important for
young men who are passing through this dangerous
epoch of life, to appreciate, as they are very apt not to
do, the dangers which threaten them, and the importance
of receiving and implicitly obeying the good council
of parents and wise friends, which their superior
experience is capable of giving them.
</p><p>Pure Manners. &mdash; One of the greatest safeguards
against the dangers surrounding this critical period, is that
sensitiveness to grossness and vulgarity which is the
result of the cultivation from earliest childhood of purity
of manners. A boy who has been accustomed to indulge
in vulgar, gross, obscene, or profane language,
is very likely to fall into evil practices; while a boy
who has always cultivated gentlemanly manners, purity
of speech, etc., will, on the other hand, be very unlikely
<pb n="377"/>
to yield to the temptations which are thrown about
him.
</p><p>Irreligion. &mdash; The lad who scoffs at religion, who presumes
to mock at piety, who has no interest in the Sabbath-school, and who attends church only when
compelled to do so, is in a fair way to become addicted to
all sorts of iniquities. Probably there is not one in a
hundred among boys of this class who does not become
addicted to some form of vice. Religion is the best of
all safeguards against these debasing vices, as well as
all other forms of sin, and no young man can afford to
begin his career in life without the aid to be afforded by
genuine religion; and of all helps which can be obtained,
religious influences, through the Sabbath-school, church,
etc., are the greatest.
</p><p>The growing disregard for religion among young men is
one of the most characteristic features of the time, and
this tendency accounts in part for the almost universal
prevalence of sexual vices among young men of the present
day.
</p><p>Wrong Ideas about Women. &mdash; From what the author
has learned through conversation with hundreds of young
men who have been under his professional care, he is
convinced that most of them entertain a very incorrect
idea respecting young women. While there are
undoubtedly many exceptions, it is certainly true that
among the better class of refined and cultivated ladies,
the sexual passions are comparatively dormant. The
young man who allows his sexual passions to predominate
his thoughts and to a large extent his conduct, is
wholly in error in thinking the average woman is a
creature after his own sort.
<pb n="378"/>
</p><p>The author has met several instances in which he
had every reason to believe that young women who had
been led from the path of virtue, had not been actuated
by the desire for sexual gratification, but were led astray
through a desire to please those who had won their
affections.
</p><p>There are, of course, plenty of young women whose
minds and manners have been corrupted by evil associations,
and this class are undoubtedly responsible for the
grossly incorrect estimate which most young men form
of the character of young women; and these young women
have undoubtedly led into vice many young men
who otherwise might have escaped. Certainly, young
men must not be charged with being the only emissaries
of vice. A good many cases have come to the
knowledge of the author in which "hired girls" of
"loose morals" have led into evil ways boys just
approaching manhood, who had previously been wholly
ignorant of vice.
</p><p>Sowing Wild Oats. &mdash; A vast deal of harm comes
through the opinion prevalent in the world that a young
man may "sow his wild oats" for a few months or a
few years without doing himself very much harm, and
without lessening his chances for success in life. The
fact that hundreds of young men do run wild for awhile,
going into all sorts of wickedness, frequenting the
saloon and gambling table, and the lowest haunts of vice,
and yet are received back into good society, if indeed
they are not all the while recognized as "real good
fellows," though unfortunately a little "fast," and placed
on equal footing with those who have never gone astray,
is no excuse for such a course. Indeed, there are
<pb n="379"/>
plenty of women who express a decided preference for
these fast young men, and consider a moderate degree
of wickedness as quite an accomplishment, rather than
a shame and a disgrace, as it should be to every intelligent
and pure-minded woman.
</p><p>The young man who imagines he can sow wild oats
even for a brief period without suffering serious injury,
will find himself greatly mistaken if he makes the
attempt. Let him consider before he begins this evil course,
that a single act of sin may cost him a life of wretchedness,
morally and physically. Every physician of
experience has seen plenty of cases in which the first
act of sexual indulgence was the means of the contraction
of some horrible disease which resulted in the total
blighting for life of all prospects for happiness.
</p><p>The mental, moral, and physical scars accompanying
a fast life, even though continued but a short time, are
often ineradicable, and are carried by the patient through
a life of bitter repentance.
</p><p>Another fact for the benefit of those who think
lightly on this subject: Steps taken in the direction of
a sensual life are not easily retraced. The libertine,
after he has once started in a career of vice, frequently
forgets his resolutions to reform after a brief period of
self-indulgence, and plunges deeper and deeper into vice,
until all desire for reformation has been dissipated, or
until the power to reform is at last totally paralyzed.
No truer words were ever uttered than those of the wise
man; "As for him that wanteth understanding, she
saith to him: stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten
in secret is pleasant. But he knoweth not that the
dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths
of hell."
<pb n="380"/>
</p><p>Getting Married. &mdash; The majority of young women
expect sooner or later to marry. Many are altogether
in too much of a hurry to consummate the most important
of all the acts of their lives, and rush into matrimony as
though it were a matter of the most trifling consequence.
Marriage is not regarded with that respect which the
sacredness of this Heaven-born institution properly
demands. The ease by which divorces can be obtained,
has undoubtedly contributed much to the hasty manner
in which this step is taken, and it is to be hoped that
some means may be devised by which this growing evil
may be checked.
</p><p>We do not propose to offer a long homily on the
subject of marriage, but have a few words of advice
which may possibly be of service.
</p><p>1. Be careful to prepare for marriage by making
yourself worthy of a good, pure woman. Cultivate
honesty, sincerity, and purity of thought and manners,
and a generous variety of those graces and qualities
which serve to make up a good and useful man.
</p><p>2. Do not allow yourself to be captivated by fine
clothes and a pretty face, or a piquant manner and an
artful smile. All these qualities are superficial, and not
correct guides to form an estimate of character. Seek
real moral worth, real solidity of character, genuineness,
sincerity, faithfulness, and simplicity. These are
qualities which will form a firm, substantial basis for genuine
affection.
</p><p>3. Avoid a young woman devoted to fashion; who
finds her chief enjoyment in balls, theaters, and fashionable
dissipation. Young women of this class are in a
state of ill health mentally and morally and usually phys-<pb n="381"/>
ically, and are utterly deficient in the qualities essential
to the making of a good wife.
</p><p>4. We may also suggest the importance of health,
of physical and mental adaptation, of proper relation as
regards age; but these are all points which will readily
occur to the mind of any young man possessed of a fair
share of good judgment and common sense, and need
not be dwelt upon here.
</p><p>The Young Husband. &mdash; After you have married a
lady, and pledged yourself in the most solemn manner
to love, cherish, and protect her, see to it that you do
not, within a few weeks, forget your marriage vow.
Too many young men take a wife as they would buy a
horse, or any other piece of property, and imagine that
as soon as the ceremony is over, the young woman
becomes their private property, and that they are at
liberty to do what they please. Every husband should
recollect that marriage gives him no proprietorship over
his wife. Marriage is simply a contract between two
individuals, who agree to work in harmony for each other's
mutual advancement and interest. Each one pledges
himself to protect the rights and regard the interests of
the other.
</p><p>Think of this, young man, and regulate your conduct
accordingly. First of all, make up your mind that
you will not make a beast of yourself. Too many
young men behave themselves in such a beastly manner
during the first week of their married life, that they
forfeit all right to the respect of their wives, and not
infrequently a young woman who, previous to marriage,
regarded her affianced as the embodiment of all
that is good and pure and noble, has her mental and
<pb n="389"/>
moral sensibilities so shocked by gross and brutal
behavior as soon as the marriage ceremony has placed
her in his power, that her love for him is totally
exhausted, and often so effectively that it can never be
resuscitated.
</p><p>Bear this fact in mind, young man. Curb your
passions. Control your propensities, and years hence you
will look back upon your conduct with a satisfaction
which will increase your self-respect, and as you reflect
upon the matter, the wealth of a Rothschild would not
purchase from you the satisfaction of thinking that you
acted the part of a man, rather than that of a beast.
</p><p>The brutal conduct of husbands, even on the first
night of marriage, not infrequently entails upon their
wives a lifetime of suffering. Such individuals are quite
unworthy the name of men. They are fit only to be
classed with the rakes who violate defenseless virgins,
and treat women as though they were made for no other
purpose than the gratification of the beastly propensities
of brutal men.
</p><p>If you have a good wife, cherish her, behave yourself
in such a way as to command her esteem and respect;
and you may be sure she will be true to you, and the
happiness she may bring to you will more than compensate
for the pains you can take to cultivate her love
and her respect. A great share of the infelicity of
married people grows out of the fact that as soon as the
honey-moon is past, and often immediately after the
ceremony is over, they cease to act like men and women,
and begin to conduct themselves like children. In
consequence, they soon lose their respect for one another,
and all sorts of disagreements and difficulties arise.
<pb n="383"/>
Always conduct yourself in such a way that you will be
sure not to lose the respect of your wife, and you will
thereby gain in self-respect, and will also have the
esteem and respect of your fellow-men.</p>

<head>A Short Chapter for Old Men.</head>
<p>
WHEN has a man reached that age at which he
may be said to be an old man? There is a
wonderful difference in individuals in respect
to the period at which symptoms of decline
make their appearance, much being due to previous habits
of life, as well as individual peculiarities and hereditary
predisposition. It may be said, however, that the
average man enters upon that portion of his life usually
denominated as old age, at about the age of fifty years.
At this period his physical powers begin to show evidence
of decline. His reserve fund of vitality, which
is considerably less than at an earlier age, may still be
sufficient to enable his system to perform all the functions
of life with regularity, but he is unable to endure
hardships as in previous years, and suffers sensibly whenever
any extreme demand is made upon his vitality.
</p><p>He is a wise man who at this period of life, while
his vital functions are still well performed, and the system
subject to no special disease or debility, recognizes the
fact that he is no longer young, and regulates himself
accordingly. Such a man will lay down as his rule
of life the greatest moderation in everything demanding
vital expenditure, and will resolutely set his face
against every form of unnecessary expenditure of vital

<pb n="385"/>
</p><p>A Dangerous Waste. &mdash; As has been pointed out
elsewhere in this work, the exercise of the sexual
function is accompanied by the most exhausting
expenditure of nervous and vital energy of which the body is
capable. Such expenditures are entirely unnecessary
to the health of the body, and hence it is evident that
at this period of life, when the vital forces should be in
every way economized, such indulgences should be discontinued.
</p><p>Physiology, on this account, prohibits the marriage
of old men with young women and old women with
young men. An old man who forms a union with a
young girl scarce out of her teens, or even younger, can
scarcely have any very elevated motive for his action,
and he certainly exposes himself to the greatest risk of
sudden death, while insuring his premature decay. A
king once characterized such a course as "the pleasantest
form of suicide." It is doubtless suicidal; but we
suspect there are some phases of such an unnatural
union which are not very enjoyable.
</p><p>One reason of the great danger of such marriages to
the old, is the exhaustive effects of the sexual act. As
previously noted, in some animals it causes immediate
death. Dr. Acton makes the following pertinent remarks: &mdash;
</p><p>"So serious, indeed, is the paroxysm of the nervous
system produced by the sexual spasm, that its immediate
effect is not always unattended with danger, and men
with weak hearts have died in the act. Every now and
then we learn that men are found dead on the night of
their wedding."
</p><p>"However exceptional these cases are, they are
<pb n="386"/>
warnings, and should serve to show that an act which
<hi rend="italic">may</hi> destroy the weak, should not be tampered with, even
by the strong."
</p><p>"There are old men who marry young wives, and
who pay the penalty by becoming martyrs to paralysis,
softening of the brain, and driveling idiocy."
</p><p>Dr. Gardner quotes the Abbe Maury as follows: "I
hold as certain that after fifty years of age a man of
sense ought to renounce the pleasures of love. Each
time that he allows himself this gratification is <hi rend="italic">a pellet of
earth thrown upon his coffin</hi>."
</p><p>Dr. Gardner further says: "Alliances of this sort
have taken place in every epoch of humanity, from the
time of the patriarchs to the present day, &mdash; alliances
repugnant to nature, between men bordering on decrepitude
and poor young girls, who are sacrificed by their
parents for position, or who sell themselves for gold.
There is in these monstrous alliances something which
we know not how to brand sufficiently energetically, in
considering the reciprocal relations of the pair thus
wrongfully united, and the lot of children which may
result from them. Let us admit, for an instant, that
the marriage has been concluded with the full consent of
the young girl, and that no external pressure has been
exerted upon her will, &mdash; as is generally the rule, &mdash; it will
none the less happen that reflection and experience will
tardily bring regrets, and the sharper, as the evil will be
without remedy; but if compulsion, or what is often the
same thing, <hi rend="italic">persuasion</hi>, had been employed to obtain the
consent which the law demands, the result would have
been more prompt and vehement. From this moment
the common life becomes odious to the unhappy victim,
<pb n="387"/>
and <hi rend="italic">culpable</hi> hopes will arise in her desolate heart, so
heavy is the chain she carries. In fact, the love of the
old man becomes ridiculous and horrid to her, and we
cannot sufficiently sympathize with the unfortunate person
whose duty [?] it is to submit to it. If we think of
it an instant, we shall perceive a repulsion such as is
only inspired by the idea of incest. . . . So what do we
oftenest observe? Either the woman violently breaks
the cursed bands, or she resigns herself to them, and
then seeks to fill up the void in her soul by adulterous
amours. Such is the somber perspective of the
sacrilegious unions which set at defiance the most
respectable instincts, the most noble desires, and the
most legitimate hopes. Such, too, are the terrible
chastisements reserved for the thoughtlessness or
foolish pride of these dissolute grey-beards, who
prodigalize the last breath of their life in search of depraved
voluptuousness."
</p><p>The parents, the perpetrators of such an outrage
against nature, are not the only sufferers. Look at the
children which they bring into the world! Let Dr.
Gardner speak again: &mdash;
</p><p>"Children, the issue of old men, are habitually
marked by a serious and sad air spread over their
countenances, which is manifestly very opposite to the
infantile expression which so delights one in the little
children of the same age engendered under other conditions.
As they grow up, their features take on more and
more the senile character, so much so that every one
remarks it, and the world regards it as a natural thing.
The old mothers pretend that it is an old head on young
shoulders. They predict an early death to these chil-<pb n="388"/>
dren, and the event frequently justifies the horoscope.
Our attention has for many years been fixed upon this
point, and we can affirm that the greater part of the
offspring of these connections are weak, torpid,
lymphatic, if not scrofulous, and do not promise a long
career."
</p><p>In old age the seminal fluid becomes greatly deteriorated.
Even at the best, its component elements could
only represent decrepitude and infirmity, degeneration
and senility. In view of such facts, says Dr. Acton, &mdash;
</p><p>"We are therefore forced to the conclusion that
the children of old men have an inferior chance of life;
and facts daily observed confirm our deductions. Look
but at the progeny of such marriages; what is its value?
As far as I have seen, it is the worst kind-spoilt childhood,
feeble and precocious youth, extravagant manhood,
early and premature death."
</p><p>Cicero on Old Age. &mdash; Cicero, in his essay on Old
Age, makes the following remarks, bearing directly on
this subject: &mdash;
</p><p>"Another charge against old age is that it deprives
us of sensual gratifications. Happy effect, indeed, to be
delivered from those snares which allure youth into
some of the worst vices! `Reason,' said Archytas, `is
the noblest gift which God or nature has bestowed on
man. Now nothing is so great an enemy to that divine
endowment as the pleasures of sense; for neither
temperance, nor any of the more exalted virtues, can find
place in that breast which is under the dominion of
voluptuous passions. Imagine yourself a man in the
actual enjoyment of the highest gratifications mere
animal nature is capable of receiving; there can be no
<pb n="389"/>
doubt that during his continuance in that state, it would
be utterly impossible for him to exert any one power of
his rational faculties.' The inference I draw from this
is, that if the principles of reason and virtue have not
proved sufficient to inspire us with proper contempt for
mere sensual pleasures, we have cause to feel grateful to
old age for at last weaning us from appetites it would
ill become us to gratify; for voluptuous passions are
bitter enemies to all the nobler faculties of the soul;
they hold no communion with the manly virtues, and
they cast a mist before the eye of reason. The little
relish which old age leaves for enjoyments merely
sensual, instead of being a disparagement to that period
of life, considerably enhances its value."
</p><p>Says Parise, a distinguished French physician, in his
work on old age: &mdash;
</p><p>"Love, at the decline of life, should take quite a
moral character, freed from all its animal propensities.
In the elderly man, it is paternal, conjugal, patriotic
attachment, which, without being so energetic as the love
experienced in youth, still warms old hearts and old
age; and, believe me, these have their sweet privileges,
as well as sometimes their bitter realities. These autumn
roses are not without perfume; perhaps less intoxicating
than that arising from first love, but presenting none of
its dangers.
</p><p>"Unfortunately, there are those who, either more
infatuated, more helplessly drifting on the tide of
passion, or more depraved, use all their endeavors to
realize desires which it is no longer possible to satisfy,
unless by a forced compliance of the organs. Not only
has the energy, the superfluous vitality of early days,
<pb n="390"/>
disappeared, but the organic power of reproduction is
nearly obliterated. Is all over then? <hi rend="italic">Credat Jud&aelig;us,
non ego</hi>. It is now that Venus Impudica lavishes on her
<hi rend="italic">used-up</hi> votaries her appetizing stimulants to vice and
debauchery. The imagination, polluted with impurities,
seeks pleasure which reason and good sense repudiate.
There are instances of debauched and shameless old age
which, deficient in vital resources, strives to supply their
place by fictitious excitement; a kind of brutish
lasciviousness, that is ever the more cruelly punished by
nature, from the fact that the immediately-ensuing
debility is in direct proportion to the forced stimulation
which has preceded it.
</p><p>"Reduced to the pleasures of recollection, at once
passionate and impotent, their sensuality may kill, but
cannot satiate. There are such old libertines who are
constantly seeking after the means of revivifying their
withered, used-up organism, as if that were possible
without imminent danger. The law of nature is without
appeal. To submit to it is the result of good, sound
judgment, and the reward is speedy. But submission is
no invariable rule, and persons of prudence and chastity
have but a faint conception of the devices to evade it, of
the folly, caprice, luxury, immodesty, the monstrous
lewdness and indescribable saturnalia of the senses
which are the result. The surgeon alone knows from
the confession of his patients, or surmises from his
experience, to what a depth corruption will descend,
and the evils which will follow, particularly in large
capitals. One of the most common means of excitement
employed by these senile Lovelaces is change, variety
in the persons they pursue. What is more fatal to the
<pb n="391"/>
<hi rend="italic">organism</hi>? Extreme youth is sacrificed to these shameless
old men. The full-blown charms of fine women no
longer suffice; they address themselves to mere children,
to the great scandal of our manners, and of all that these
victims of debauchery hold dear and sacred. Nevertheless,
let it be remarked, it is seldom, very seldom, that
punishment comes <hi rend="italic">pede claudo</hi>; old age, which disease
changes every day into decrepitude &mdash; often sudden death,
and death that lasts for years, a consequence of cruel
infirmities &mdash; proves the justice of nature."
</p><p>A distinguished physician speaks upon this same
subject as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"When a young man, without any redeeming qualities,
has run through a career of debauchery, when his
adult age is but a new lease of similar associations, the
necessity for additional excitement appears to goad him
on. Fictitious desires increase, until it is impossible to
say where shall be his acme of debauchery, or what
devices may be invented by those in his pay `to minister
to a mind diseased.' This is particularly the case when
such a pampered, ill-directed, unrestrained will is
accompanied by unlimited wealth. For such an one, youth,
innocence, and beauty soon cease to have attraction.
Well has it been said of him, that `the beast has
destroyed the man.' Variety may for a time satisfy or
stimulate his failing powers, but not for very long.
Local stimulants are tried, and, after a short repetition,
these also fail. As a last resource, unnatural excitement
is brought to bear, and now public decency is forgotten,
and we probably find that the first check to the lust of
the opulent satyr is his finding himself the hero of some
filthy police case, &mdash; then, maybe, a convict or a voluntary
exile.
<pb n="392"/>
</p><p>"As school-boys, we may have been accustomed to
laugh at the fables of the grotesque sylvan monsters of
antiquity, ignorant of what hideous truths of human
nature their half-animal forms were the symbols. Even
after sad experience has enlarged our knowledge of the
possibilities of vice, few of us, happily, have any idea of
how completely these bestial forms of ancient art represent
the condition of the satyrs who so notoriously affect
the seclusion and the shade of the parks and gardens in
modern cities. I question if a prison is the proper place
for such debased individuals. As far as I have noticed
their organization, I should say an uncontrolled giving
way to the sexual passion has used up a frame never
very strong. A constant drain on the nervous power
has produced an effect which renders its subject indifferent
to consequences, provided his all-absorbing pursuit,
namely, ministering to the excitement of his sexual
passion, can be indulged in. Doubtless, in many
instances, the brain has become affected, particularly when
there exists a strong hereditary tendency to disease.
This, together with deficiency of occupation, has caused
many of these victims to their own feelings to make the
pandering to their vile desires, and gratification of every
sensuality their imagination can devise, the chief
occupation of life. The medical man would hardly feel
justified in certifying their fitness for a lunatic asylum,
as in all other respects their conduct appears to be sane.
Observing, as these persons do, all the other usual
<hi rend="italic">convenances</hi> of society, there is yet a something about
them which marks them as thralls of a debasing pursuit.
It is an error, however, to suppose that they often suffer
from venereal disease. Your old <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;bauch&eacute;s</hi> know too
<pb n="393"/>
well the parties they have to deal with, and every
precaution is taken to avoid the consequences. They
are living and suffering specters whom, as some clever
writer has observed, `Death seems to forget to strike,
because he believes them already in the tomb.'
</p><p>"It may, perhaps, be thought singular in my
suggesting a moral based upon such vile practices as the
above, but allusion to them may not be without benefit
to those beginning life; and I would say, Let those
persons take warning who with an active imagination
once enter upon a career of vice, and dream that at a
certain spot they can arrest their progress. It is an old
tale, and often told, that, although the slope of criminality
be easy and gradual, it is still `le premier pas qui
coute;' and he who launches himself on such a course,
will acquire, as he goes velocity and force, <hi rend="italic">until at last
he cannot be stayed</hi>."
</p><p>From quite extensive observation, the author has no
doubt that a large number of the inconveniences of
advanced age, mental and physical, as well as numerous
local difficulties, including bladder disorders and
irritability of the prostate, etc., are frequently the result of
sexual excesses, not only during middle life, but continued
during advanced years. The following incident
speaks for itself: &mdash;
</p><p>A Case in Point. &mdash; Some time ago a man of some
prominence in the legal profession, sought an interview
with the author. An hour was fixed, and at the time
appointed he presented himself at the office, and after a
few preliminary remarks, made the following statement:
"I have been a man of great physical vigor, and for
many years have devoted myself with great earnestness
<pb n="394"/>
to my profession, and with most satisfactory results. I
have suffered very little from bodily infirmities of any
sort, until a few years back. Some four or five years
ago I began to experience discomfort in the region of
what I supposed to be the neck of the bladder, requiring
me to relieve the bladder very frequently, both during
the daytime and in the night. I sought relief by
various means, but unsuccessfully, and had come to
the belief that I was suffering with some serious disease
of the bladder or the prostate. Remedies addressed to
these organs did no good. I obtained a copy of one of
your works [an early edition of this work], and found
out the cause of my troubles. I am now between fifty
and sixty years of age. From mere force of habit,
I had continued indulging myself sexually as in early
life, never thinking of the possibility of harm, just as I
supposed most men did. While reading your work, I
became convinced that this was the cause of my suffering,
particularly as I at once recalled that my suffering
was greatly aggravated by indulgences of this sort, and
that when an absence from home for some time necessitated
abstinence, most of the symptoms disappeared.
I at once adopted the principle of total abstinence which
you recommend to men of my age, and with most
gratifying results. I had thought to employ your services
as a physician, but find myself entirely well, and
not in need of treatment."
</p><p>Other cases of the same sort might be recounted.
Undoubtedly there are thousands of elderly men suffering
in a similar way from the same cause.</p>

<head>A Chapter for Girls.</head>
<p>
WE have written this chapter especially for girls,
and we sincerely hope that many will read it
with an earnest desire to be benefited by so
doing. The subject of which we have to write
is a delicate one, and one which we regret exceedingly
needs to be written about. But our experience as a
physician has proven to us again and again that it is of
the utmost importance that something be said, that words
of warning should be addressed particularly to the girls
and maidens just merging into womanhood, on a subject
which vitally concerns not only their own future health
and happiness, but the prosperity and destiny of the race.
Probably no one can be better fitted to speak on this
subject than the physician. A physician who has given
careful attention to the health and the causes of ill-health
of ladies, and who has had opportunities for observing
the baneful influence exerted upon the bodies and minds
of girls and young women by the evil practices of which
it is our purpose here to treat, can better appreciate
than can others the magnitude of the evil, and is better
prepared to speak upon the subject understandingly and
authoritatively. Gladly would we shun the task which
has been pressed upon us, but which we have long
avoided, were it not for the sense of the urgent need of
its performance of which our professional experience has
<pb n="396"/>
thoroughly convinced us. We cannot keep our lips
closed when our eyes are witnesses to the fact that
thousands of the fairest and best of our girls and maidens are
being beguiled into everlasting ruin by a soul-destroying
vice which works unseen, and often so insidiously that
its results are unperceived until the work of ruin is complete.
</p><p>The nature of our subject necessitates that we should
speak plainly, though delicately, and we shall endeavor
to make our language comprehensible by any one old
enough to be benefited by the perusal of this chapter.
We desire that all who read these pages may receive
lasting benefit by so doing. The subject is one upon
which every girl ought to be informed, and to which she
should give serious attention, so as to become intelligent
concerning the evils and dangers to which girls
are exposed from this source.
</p><p>Girlhood. &mdash; Nothing is so suggestive of innocence and
purity as the simple beauty of girlhood when seen in its
natural freshness, though too seldom, now-a-days, is it
possible to find in our young girls the natural grace and
healthy beauty which were common among the little
maidens of a quarter of a century ago. The ruddy cheeks,
bright eyes, and red lips, which are indicative of a high
degree of healthy vigor, are not so often seen to-day as
formerly among the small girls in our public schools, and
passing to and fro upon the streets. The pale cheeks,
languid eyes, and almost colorless lips which we more
often see, indicate weakly constitutions and delicate
health, and prophesy a short and suffering life to many.
Various causes are at work to produce this unfortunate
decline; and while we hope that in the larger share of
<pb n="397"/>
cases, bad diet, improper clothing, confinement in poorly
ventilated rooms with too little exercise, and similar
causes, are the active agents, we are obliged to recognize
the fact that there is in far too many cases another
cause, the very mention of which makes us blush with
shame that its existence should be possible. But of
this we shall speak again presently.
</p><p>Real girls are like the opening buds of beautiful
flowers. The beauty and fragrance of the full-blossomed rose scarcely exceeds the delicate loveliness of
the swelling bud which shows between the sections of its
bursting calyx the crimson petals tightly folded beneath.
So the true girl possesses in her sphere as high a degree
of attractive beauty as she can hope to attain in after
years, though of a different character. But genuine
girls are scarce. Really natural little girls are
almost as scarce as real boys. Too many girls begin at a
very early age to attempt to imitate the pride and
vanity manifested by older girls and young ladies. It
is by many supposed that to be ladylike should be the
hight of the ambition of girls as soon as they are old
enough to be taught respecting propriety of behavior,
which is understood to mean that they must appear as
unnatural as possible in attempting to act like grown-up
ladies. Many mothers who wish their daughters to be
models of perfection, but whose ideas of perfect deportment
are exceedingly superficial in character, dress up
their little daughters in fine clothing, beautiful to look at,
but very far from what is required for health and comfort,
and then continually admonish the little ones that they
must keep very quiet and "act like little ladies." Such
a course is a most pernicious one. It fosters pride and
<pb n="398"/>
vanity, and inculcates an entirely wrong idea of what it
is to be ladylike, to be true to nature as a girl. Such
artificial training is damaging alike to mind and body;
and it induces a condition of mind and of the physical
system which is very conducive to the encouragement
of dangerous tendencies.
</p><p>How to Develop Beauty and Loveliness. &mdash; All little
girls want to be beautiful. Girls in general care much
more for their appearance than do boys. They have
finer tastes, and greater love for whatever is lovely and
beautiful. It is a natural desire, and should be encouraged.
A pure, innocent, beautiful little girl is the most
lovely of all God's creatures. All are not equally
beautiful, however, and cannot be; but all may be beautiful
to a degree that will render them attractive. Let all
little girls who want to be pretty, handsome, or good-looking, give attention, and we will tell them how.
Those who are homely should listen especially, for all
may become good-looking, though all cannot become
remarkably beautiful. First of all, it is necessary that
the girl who wishes to be handsome, to be admired,
should be good. She must learn to love what is right
and true. She must be pure in mind and act. She
must be simple in her manners, modest in her deportment,
and kind in her ways.
</p><p>Second in importance, though scarcely so, is the
necessity of health. No girl can long be beautiful without
health; and no girl who enjoys perfect health can be
really ugly in appearance. A healthy countenance is
always attractive. Disease wastes the rounded features,
bleaches out the roses from the cheeks and the vermillion
from the lips. It destroys the luster of the eye, and
<pb n="399"/>
the elasticity of the step. Health is essential to beauty.
In fact, if we consider goodness as a state of moral
health, then health is the one great requisite of beauty.
</p><p>Health is attained and preserved by the observance
of those natural laws which the Creator has appointed
for the government of our bodies. The structure of
these bodies we may do well to study for a few moments.
</p><p>The Human Form Divine. &mdash; Go with us to one of
the large cities, and we will show you one of the most
marvelous pieces of mechanism ever invented, a triumph
of ingenuity, skill, and patient, persevering labor for
many years. This wonderful device is a clock which
will run more than one hundred years. It is so
constructed that it indicates not only the time of day, the
day of the month and year, itself making all the necessary
changes for leap year, but shows the motions of the
earth around the sun, together with the movements and
positions of all the other planets, and many other
marvelous things. When it strikes at the end of each hour,
groups of figures go through a variety of curious
movements most closely resembling the appearance and
actions of human beings.
</p><p>The maker of this remarkable clock well deserves
the almost endless praise which he receives for his skill
and patience; for his work is certainly wonderful; but
the great clock, with its curious and complicated
mechanism, is a coarse and bungling affair when compared
with the human body. The clock doubtless contains
thousands of delicate wheels and springs, and is
constructed with all the skill imaginable; and yet the
structure of the human body is infinitely more delicate.
<pb n="400"/>
The clock has no intelligence, but a human being can
hear, see, feel, taste, touch, and think. The clock does
only what its maker designed to have it do, and can do
nothing else. The human machine is a living mechanism;
it can control its own movements, can do as it will,
within certain limits. What is very curious indeed, the
human machine has the power to mend itself, so that
when it needs repairs it is not necessary to send it to a
shop for the purpose, but all that is required is to give
nature an opportunity, and the system repairs itself.
</p><p>A Wonderful Process. &mdash; We have not space to
describe all the wonderful structures of this human
machine, but must notice particularly one of its most
curious features, a provision by which other human beings,
living machines like itself, are produced. All living
creatures possess this power. A single potato placed in the
ground becomes a dozen or more, by a process of
multiplying. A little seed planted in the earth grows up to
be a plant, produces flowers, and from the flowers come
other seeds, &mdash; not one, but often a great many, sometimes
hundreds from a single seed. Insects, fishes, birds, and
all other animals, thus multiply. So do human beings;
and in a similar manner. The organs by which this
most marvelous process is carried on in plants and
animals, including also human beings, are called sexual
organs. Flowers are the sexual organs of plants.
</p><p>Human Buds. &mdash; A curious animal which lives near
the sea-shore, in shallow water, attached to a rock like
a water plant, puts out little buds, which grow awhile
and then drop off, and after a time become large individuals
like the parent, each in turn producing buds like
the one from which it grew. Human beings are formed
<pb n="401"/>
by a similar process. Human buds are formed by an
organ for the purpose possessed only by the female sex,
and these, under proper circumstances, develop into
infant human beings. The process, though so simply
stated, is a marvelously complicated one, which cannot
be fully explained here; indeed, it is one of the
mysteries which it is beyond the power of human wisdom
fully to explain.
</p><p>The production of these human buds is one of the
most important and sacred duties of woman. It is
through this means that she becomes a mother, which
is one of the grandest and noblest functions of womanhood.
It is the motherly instinct that causes little girls
to show such a fondness for dolls, &mdash; a perfectly natural
feeling, which may be encouraged to a moderate degree
without injury.
</p><p>How Beauty is Marred. &mdash; As already remarked,
mental, moral, and physical health are the requisites
for true beauty, and to secure these, obedience to all
the laws of health is required. The most beautiful
face is soon marred when disease begins its ravages in
the body. The most beautiful character is as speedily
spoiled by the touch of moral disease, or sin. The face
is a mirror of the mind, the character; and a mind full
of evil, impure thoughts is certain to show itself in the
face in spite of the rosy cheeks and dimples, ruby lips
and bewitching smiles. The character is written on the
face as plainly as the face can be pictured by an artist
on canvass.
</p><p>To be more explicit, the girl who disregards the laws
of health, who eats bad food, eats at all hours or at
unseasonable hours, sits up late at night, attends fashiona-<pb n="402"/>
ble parties, and indulges in the usual means of dissipation
there afforded, dancing, wine, rich suppers, etc.,
who carefully follows the fashions in her dress, lacing
her waist to attain the fashionable degree of slenderness,
wearing thin, narrow-toed gaiters with French heels, and
insufficiently clothing the limbs in cold weather, and who
in like manner neglects to comply with the requirements
of health in other important particulars, may be certain
that sooner or later, certainly at no distant day, she will
become as unattractive and homely as she can wish not
to be. Girls and young ladies who eat largely of fat
meat, rich cakes and pies, confectionery, ice-cream,
and other dietetic abominations, cannot avoid becoming
sallow and hollow-eyed. The cheeks may be ever
so plump and rosy, they will certainly lose their freshness,
and become hollow and thin. Chalk and rouge will
not hide the defect; for everybody will discover the fraud,
and will of course know the reason why it is practiced.
</p><p>A Beauty-Destroying Vice. &mdash; But by far the worst
enemy of beauty and health of body, mind, and soul, we
have not yet mentioned. It is a sin concerning which
we would gladly keep silence; but we cannot see so
many of our most beautiful and promising girls and
young ladies annually being ruined, often for this world
and the next alike, without uttering the word of warning
needed.
</p><p>As before remarked, the function of maternity, which
is the object of the sexual system in woman, when
rightly exercised, is the most sacred and elevated office
which a woman can perform for the world. The woman
who is a true mother, has an opportunity of doing for
the race more than all other human agencies combined.
<pb n="403"/>
The mother's influence is the controlling influence in the
world. The mother molds the character of her children.
She can make of their plastic minds almost what she
will if she is herself prepared for the work. On the
other hand, misuse or abuse of the sexual organism is
visited in girls and women, as in boys and men, with the
most fearful penalties. Nothing will sooner deprive a
girl or young lady of the maidenly grace and freshness
with which nature blesses woman in her early years,
than secret vice.
</p><p>We have the greatest difficulty in making ourself
believe that it is possible for beings, designed by nature
to be pure and innocent, in all respects free from
impurity of any sort, to become so depraved by sin as to be
willing to devote themselves to so vile and filthy a
practice. Yet the frequency with which cases have
come under our observation, which clearly indicate the
alarming prevalence of the practice, even among girls
and young women who would naturally be least suspected,
compels us to recognize the fact. The testimony of
many eminent physicians whose opportunities for observation
have been very extensive, shows that the evil is
enormously greater than people generally are aware.
Instructors of the youth, of large experience, assert the
same. Nor is the evil greater in America than in some
other countries. One writer declares that the vice is
almost universal among the girls of Russia, which may
be due to the low condition in which the women of that
country are kept.
</p><p>Terrible Effects of Secret Vice. &mdash; The awful effects
of this sin against God and nature become speedily
visible in those who are guilty of it. The experienced
<pb n="404"/>
eye needs no confession on the part of the victim to
read the whole story of sinful indulgence and consequent
disease. The vice stamps its insignia upon the countenance;
it shows itself in the walk, in the changed disposition,
and the loss of healthy vigor. It is not only
impossible for a victim of this sinful practice to hide
from the all-seeing eye of God the vileness perpetrated
in secret, but it is also useless to attempt to hide from
human eyes the awful truth.
</p><p>Headache, side-ache, back-ache, pains in the chest,
and wandering pains in various parts of the body, &mdash;
these are but a few of the painful ailments from which
girls who are guilty of this sin suffer. Tenderness
of the spine, which causes great solicitude on the part
of parents and physicians, who fear that serious disease
is threatening the life of a loved daughter, not
infrequently originates in this way. Much of the hysteria
which renders wretched the lives of thousands of young
ladies and the fond friends who are obliged to care for
and attend them, arises from sexual transgression of the
kind of which we are speaking. The blanched cheeks,
hollow, expressionless eyes, and rough, pimply skins of
many school-girls, are due to this cause alone. We do
not mean by this to intimate that every girl who has
pimples upon her face is guilty of secret vice; but this
sin is undoubtedly a very frequent cause of the unpleasant
eruption which so often appears upon the foreheads
of both sexes. It would be very unjust, however, to
charge a person with the sin unless some further evidence
than that of an eruption on the face was afforded.
</p><p>The inability to study, to apply themselves in any
way except when stimulated by something of a very
<pb n="405"/>
exciting character, which many girls exhibit, is in a
large proportion of cases due to the practice of which we
are writing. Often enough the effects which are attributed
to overstudy, are properly due to this debasing
habit. We have little faith in the great outcry made in
certain quarters about the damaging effects of study
upon the health of young ladies. A far less worthy
cause is in many cases the true one, to which is attributable
the decline in health at a critical period when all
the vital forces of the system are necessarily called into
action to establish a new function.
</p><p>Hundreds of girls break down in health just as they
are entering womanhood. At from twelve to eighteen
years of age the change naturally occurs which transforms
the girl into a woman by the development of
functions previously latent. This critical period is one
through which every girl in health ought to pass with
scarcely any noticeable disturbance; and if, during the
previous years of life, the laws of health were observed,
there would seldom be any unusual degree of suffering
at this time. Those who have before this period been
addicted to the vile habit of which we are writing, will
almost invariably show at this time evidences of the
injury which has been wrought. The unnatural excitement
of the organs before the period of puberty, lays the
foundation for life-long disease. When that critical
epoch arrives, the organs are found in a state of congestion
often bordering on inflammation. The increased
congestion which naturally occurs at this time in many
cases, is sufficient to excite most serious disease.
</p><p>Here is the beginning of a great many of the special
diseases which are the bane and shame of the sex. Dis-<pb n="406"/>
placements of various sorts, congestions, neuralgia of the
ovaries, leucorrh&oelig;a, or whites, and a great variety of
kindred maladies, are almost certain to make their
appearance at this period or soon after in those who have
been guilty of self-abuse. If the evil influences already
at work are augmented by tight-lacing, improper dressing
of the extremities, hanging heavy skirts upon the hips,
and fashionable dissipation generally, the worst results
are sure to follow, and the individual is elected to be a
subject for the doctors during a good portion of her life.
</p><p>A talented writer some time since contributed to a
popular magazine an article entitled, "The Little Health
of Women," which contained many excellent hints
respecting the influences at work to undermine the
health and destroy the constitutions of American women;
but he did not even hint at this potent cause, which we
firmly believe is responsible for a far greater share
of the local disease and general poor health of girls,
young women, and married ladies, than has been generally
recognized. These are startling facts, but we are
prepared to substantiate them.
</p><p>Remote Effects. &mdash; Not all the effects of vice appear
in girlhood, nor even during early life. Frequently it
is not until the girl is grown up to be a wife and mother
that she begins to appreciate fully the harm that has
been wrought. At this time, when new demands are
made upon the sexual organism, when its proper duties
are to be performed, there is a sudden failure; new
weaknesses and diseases make their appearance, new
pains and sufferings are felt, which no woman who has not
in some way seriously transgressed the laws of health will
suffer. In not a few instances it is discovered that the
<pb n="407"/>
individual is wholly unfitted for the duties of maternity.
Often, indeed, maternity is impossible, the injury resulting
from the sins committed being so great as to render
the diseased organism incapable of the functions required.
</p><p>In the great majority of cases, these peculiar
difficulties, morbid conditions, and incapacities are
attributed to overwork, overstudy, "taking cold," "getting the
feet wet," or some other cause wholly inadequate to
account for the diseased conditions present, although in
many instances it may be true that some such unfortunate
circumstance may be the means of precipitating the
effects of previous sin upon organs already relaxed,
debilitated, and thus prepared readily to take on disease.
</p><p>Causes which Lead Girls Astray. &mdash; The predisposing
causes of sexual vice have already been dwelt upon
so fully in this volume that we shall devote little space
to the subject here. We may, however, mention a few
of the special causes which seem to be most active in
leading to the formation of evil habits among girls.
</p><p>Vicious Companions. &mdash; Girls are remarkably susceptible
to influence by those of their own age. A vicious
girl who makes herself agreeable to those with whom she
associates, can exert more influence over many of her
companions than can any number of older persons.
Even a mother rarely has the influence over her daughter
that is maintained by the girl whom she holds as
her bosom friend. The close friendships which are
formed between girls of the same age are often highly
detrimental in character. Each makes a confidant of
the other, and thus becomes estranged from the only
one competent to give counsel and advice, and the one
<pb n="408"/>
who of all others is worthy of a young girl's confidence,
 &mdash; her mother.
</p><p>From these unfortunate alliances often arise most
deplorable evils. Vicious companions not infrequently
sow the seeds of evil habits far and wide, contaminating
all who come within their influence.
</p><p>Whom to Avoid. &mdash; A girl will always do well to
avoid a companion who is vain, idle, silly, or frivolous.
Girls who have these evil characteristics, are very
likely to have others also which are worse. A girl who
is rude in her manners, careless in her habits, irreverent
and disobedient to parents and teachers, is always an
unsafe companion. No matter how pretty, witty,
stylish, or aristocratic she may be, she should be
shunned. Her influence will be withering, debasing,
wherever felt. A girl may be gay and thoughtless
without being vicious; but the chances are ten to one
that she will become sinful unless she changes her ways.
</p><p>Sentimental Books. &mdash; The majority of girls love to
read, but, unfortunately, the kind of literature of which
they are often fond is not of a character which will
elevate, refine, or in any way benefit them. Story-books, romances, love tales, and religious novels constitute
the chief part of the reading matter which American
young ladies greedily devour. We have known
young ladies still in their teens who had read whole
libraries of the most exciting novels.
</p><p>The taste for novel-reading is like that for liquor or
opium. It is never satiated. It grows with gratification.
A confirmed novel-reader is almost as difficult to
reform as a confirmed inebriate or opium-eater. The
influence upon the mind is most damaging and pernicious.
<pb n="409"/>
It not only destroys the love for solid, useful reading,
but excites the emotions, and in many cases keeps the
passions in a perfect fever of excitement. The confessions
of young women who were to all appearance
the most circumspect in every particular, and who no
one mistrusted could be capable of vile thoughts, have
convinced us that this evil is more prevalent than many,
even of those who are quite well informed, would
be willing to admit.
</p><p>By reading of this kind many are led to resort
to self-abuse for the gratification of passions which over-stimulation has made almost uncontrollable. Some have
thus been induced to sin who had never been injured by
other influences, but discovered the fatal secret
themselves. Mothers cannot be too careful of the character
of the books which their daughters read. Every book,
magazine, and paper should be carefully scrutinized,
unless its character is already well known, before it is
allowed to be read. In our opinion, some of the literature
which passes as standard, and is often found on
parlor center-tables and in family and school libraries,
such as Chaucer's poems and other writings of a kindred
character, is unfit for perusal by inexperienced and
unsophisticated young ladies. Some of this literature is
actually too vile for any one to read, and if written
today by any poet of note, would cause his works to be
committed to the stove and rag-bag in spite of his reputation.
</p><p>Various Causes. &mdash; Bad diet, the use of stimulating
and exciting articles of food, late suppers, confectionery,
and dainties, &mdash; all these have a very powerful influence
in the wrong direction, by exciting functions which
<pb n="410"/>
ought to be kept as nearly latent as possible. The
use of tea and coffee by young ladies cannot be too
strongly condemned. Improper dress, by causing local
congestion, often predisposes to secret vice by occasioning
local excitement. Probably a greater cause than
any of those last mentioned is too great familiarity with
the opposite sex. The silly letters which girls sometimes
receive from the boys and young men of their
acquaintance, and which they encourage by letters of a
similar character, must be condemned in the most thorough
manner. Upon receiving such a letter, a pure-minded girl will consider herself insulted. The childish
flirtations in which boys and girls sometimes indulge,
often lead to evils of a most revolting character.
</p><p>Modesty Woman's Safe-Guard. &mdash; True modesty and
maidenly reserve are the best guardians of virtue. The
girl who is truly modest, who encourages and allows no
improper advances, need have no fear of annoyance from
this source. She is equally safe from temptation to sin
which may come to her in secret, when no human eye
can behold. Maidenly modesty is one of the best qualities
which any young lady can possess. A young
woman who lacks modesty, who manifests boldness of
manner and carelessness in deportment, is not only liable
to have her virtue assailed by designing and unscrupulous
men, but is herself likely to fall before the temptation
to indulge in secret sin, which is certain to present
itself in some way sooner or later.
</p><p>This invaluable protection is speedily lost by the
girl who abandons herself to secret vice. The chances
are very great, also, that by degrees her respect and
love for virtue and chastity will diminish until she is
<pb n="411"/>
open to temptations to indulge in less secret sin; and
thus she travels down the road of vice until she finds
herself at last an inmate of a brothel or an outcast
wanderer, rejected by friends, and lost to virtue, purity, and
all that a true woman holds most dear.
</p><p>A Few Sad Cases. &mdash; Although we do not believe it
right to harrow the feelings of those who have sinned
and suffered with a rehearsal of sad cases when no good
can be accomplished by such accounts, we deem it but
just that those who are not yet entangled in the meshes
of vice should have an opportunity of knowing the actual
results of sin, and profiting by the sad experience of
others. It is for this purpose that we shall mention a
few cases which have come under our observation, taking
care to avoid mentioning any facts which might lead
to identification, as the facts we shall use were, many of
them, received in strict confidence from those who were
glad to unburden their hearts to some one, but had never
dared to do so, even to their friends.
</p><p>A Pitiful Case. &mdash; Several years ago we received a
letter from a young woman in a distant State in which
she described her case as that of an individual who had
early become addicted to secret vice, and had continued
the vile habit until that time, when she was about thirty-two years of age. In spite of the most solemn vows to
reform, she still continued the habit, and had become
reduced to such a miserable condition that she would
almost rather die than live. She sent with her letter
photographs representing herself at twenty and at that
time, so that we might see the contrast. It was indeed
appalling to see what changes sin had wrought. Her
face, once fair and comely, had become actually haggard
<pb n="412"/>
with vice. Purity, innocence, grace, and modesty were
no longer visible there. The hard lines of sin had
obliterated every trace of beauty, and produced a most
repulsive countenance. Though greatly depraved and
shattered by sin and consequent disease in body and
mind, she still had some desire to be cured, if possible,
and made a most pitiful appeal for help to escape
from her loathsome condition. We gave her the best
counsel we could under the circumstances, and did all in
our power to rescue her from her living death; but
whether in any degree successful we cannot tell, as we
have never heard from the poor creature since.
</p><p>We have often wished that we might but show
those two pictures to every girl who has been tempted
to sin in this way, to all who have ever yielded to this
awful vice. The terrible contrast would certainly
produce an impression which no words can do. We sent
them back to their wretched original, however, by her
request, and so cannot show the actual pictures; but
when any who read these lines are tempted thus to sin,
we beg of them to think of these two pictures, and by
forming a vivid image of them in the mind, drive away
the disposition to do wrong.
</p><p>A Mind Dethroned. &mdash; A young lady who had
received every advantage which could be given her by
indulgent parents, and who naturally possessed most
excellent talents, being a fine musician, and naturally so
bright and witty as to be the life of every company in
which she moved, suddenly began to show strange
symptoms of mental unsoundness. She would sometimes
be seized with fits of violence, during which
it was with great difficulty that she could be controlled.
<pb n="413"/>
Several times she threatened the lives of her nurses, and
even on one occasion attempted to execute her threat,
the person's life being saved by mere accident. Everything
was done for her that could be done, but the
mania increased to such a degree of violence that she
was sent to an asylum for the insane. Here she remained
for months before she became sufficiently tractable
to be taken to her home and cared for by friends.
Too close application to study was the cause at first
assigned for her mental disorder; but a careful investigation
of the case revealed the fact that the terrible sin
which has ruined the minds of so many promising young
men and brilliant young women, was the cause that led
to the sad result in this case also. The punishment of
sin, especially of sexual sins, is indeed terrible; but the
sin is a fearful one, and the penalty must be equal to
the enormity of the crime. Not all young women who
indulge thus will become insane, but any one who transgresses
in this way <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be thus punished. There is no
safety but in absolute purity.
</p><p>A Penitent Victim. &mdash; A young woman who had been
ill for years, and whose physicians had sought in vain
to cure her various ailments, until her parents almost
despaired of her ever being anything but a helpless invalid,
came to us for treatment, resolved upon making a last
effort for help. She had grown up in utter ignorance of
the laws of health, and of the results of the vice of which
we are writing; and having been early taught the sin, she
had indulged it for a number of years with the result of
producing a most terribly diseased condition of the
sexual organs, which had baffled the skill of all the
physicians who had attended her, none of whom had ever
<pb n="414"/>
been made acquainted with the true cause of the difficulties.
</p><p>When apprised of the real facts in the case, that she
alone was responsible for the sad condition into which
she had fallen, her eyes were opened to see the wickedness
and vileness of her course. She bitterly bemoaned
her past life, and heartily repented of her sins. Of the
sincerity of her repentance she gave evidence in the
earnest efforts which she put forth to help herself. She
spared no pains to do well all required on her part, and
was soon rewarded by feeling that her diseases were
being removed, and health was returning. Still she
was constantly reminded of her former sins. When the
will was off its guard, during sleep, the mind long
indulged in sin, would revert to the old channels, and riot
in vileness. Unchaste dreams often made her dread to
sleep, as she awoke from these unconscious lapses enervated,
weak, and prostrated as though she had actually
transgressed. But though often thus almost disheartened,
she continued the struggle, and was finally rewarded
by gaining a perfect victory over her mind, sleeping
as well as waking, and recovering her health sufficiently
to enable her to enjoy life, and make herself very
useful.
</p><p>Not a few similar cases have come under our observation;
and it seems to us that the pain, anguish, and
remorse suffered by these poor victims, ought to be a
warning to those who have never entered the sinful road.
What a terrible thing it is for a pure and lovely being,
designed by God to fulfill a high, holy, and sacred mission
in the world, to become a victim to such a filthy vice!
No girl of sense would in her right mind raise her hand
<pb n="415"/>
to dash in pieces a beautiful vase, to destroy a lovely
painting, or a beautiful piece of statuary. A girl who
would do such a thing would be considered insane, and
a fit subject for a mad-house. Yet is not the human
body, a girl's own beautiful, symmetrical form,
infinitely better, more valuable and more sacred, than any
object produced by human art? There can be but one
answer. How, then, is it possible for her thus to defile
and destroy herself? Is it not a fearful thing, a
terrible vice?
</p><p>A Ruined Girl. &mdash; One of the most remarkable cases
of disease resulting from self-abuse which ever came
under our observation was that of a young lady from a
distant Western State whose adopted parents, after
consulting many different physicians for a peculiar disease
of the breast, placed her under our care. We found her
a good-looking young woman about seventeen years of
age, rather pale, and considerably emaciated, very
nervous and hysterical, and suffering with severe pain in the
left breast, which was swollen to nearly double the
natural size, hot, tense, pulsating, and extremely tender
to the touch. Occasionally she would experience paroxysms
in which she apparently suffered extremely,
being sometimes semi-conscious, and scarcely breathing
for hours. We suspected the cause of these peculiar
manifestations at the outset, but every suggestion of the
possibility of the suspected cause was met with a stout
denial and a very deceptive pretense of innocent
ignorance on the subject. All treatment was unavailing
to check the disease. Though sometimes the symptoms
seemed to be controlled, a speedy relapse occurred, so
that no progress toward a cure was made. Finally, our
<pb n="416"/>
conviction that the first impression respecting the case
was correct became so strong that we hesitated no longer
to treat it as such. By most vigilant observation we
detected evidences of the soul-corrupting vice which we
considered unmistakable, and then the young woman who had
pretended such profound ignorance of the matter,
confessed to an extent of wickedness which was perfectly
appalling. Every paroxysm was traced to an unusual
excess of sinful indulgence. So hardened was she by
her evil practices that she seemed to feel no remorse,
and only promised to reform when threatened with
exposure to her parents unless she immediately ceased the
vile practice. In less than ten days the mysterious
symptoms which had puzzled many physicians, disappeared
altogether. The swollen, tender breast was no
larger than the other, and was so entirely restored that
she was able to strike it a full blow without pain.
</p><p>So great was the depravity of this girl, however,
that she had no notion of making a permanent reform.
She even boasted of her wickedness to a companion, and
announced her intention to continue the practice. We
sent her home, and apprised her parents of the full facts
in the case, for which we received their deepest gratitude,
though their hearts were nearly broken with grief at
the sad revelation made to them. Notwithstanding
their most earnest efforts in her behalf, the wretched
girl continued her downward career, and a year or two
after, we learned that she had sunk to the very lowest
depths of shame.
</p><p>Once this now wretched, disgraced creature was an
active, pure, innocent little girl. Her adopted father
lavished upon her numerous presents, and spent hun-<pb n="417"/>
dreds of dollars to obtain her recovery to health. Yet
through this awful vice she was ruined utterly, and
rendered so wholly perverse and bad that she had no desire
to be better, no disposition to reform. God only knows
what will be her sad end. May none who read these
lines ever follow in her footsteps.
</p><p>The Danger of Boarding-Schools. &mdash; Some years ago
a young lady came under our medical care who had suffered
for some time from a serious nervous difficulty
which had baffled the skill of all the physicians who had
had charge of her case, and which occasioned her a great
amount of suffering, making it necessary that she should
be confined to her bed most of the time, the disease
being aggravated by exercise, and the patient having
been much weakened by its long continuance.
</p><p>All the remedies usually successful in such cases
were employed with little or no effect, and we were feeling
somewhat perplexed concerning the case, when the
young lady sent for us one day, and as we entered she
burst into tears, and acknowledged that she had been
addicted to the habit of self-abuse, and that she was
still suffering from involuntary excitement during sleep.
Having been placed in a boarding-school when quite
young, she had there learned the vile habit, and had
practiced it without knowing anything of the ill effects
or really appreciating its sinfulness. When she learned,
some years after, that the habit was a most pernicious
vice, and of a character to bring destruction to both soul
and body in one addicted to it, she endeavored to free
herself from its shackles; but she found herself too
securely bound for escape. It seemed, indeed, an utter
impossibility. Her thoughts had long been allowed to
<pb n="418"/>
run in sentimental channels, and now they would do so
in spite of the most earnest efforts to the contrary,
during her waking hours; and in sleep while the will-power
was not active, the imagination would run riot uncontrolled,
leaving her, upon awaking, exhausted, enervated,
and almost desperate with chagrin. Knowing that
she was daily suffering for her transgressions, she was
filled with remorse and regret, and would have given all
to undo the past; but, alas! she could not, and could
only suffer with patience until relief could be secured.
Her love for sentimental literature occasioned another
battle for her to fight; for she could scarcely resist the
temptation daily offered her to while away some of the
weary hours with such stories of love and sentiment as
she had been accustomed to enjoy. But she fought the
battle earnestly, and finally succeeded in conquering the
evil tendencies of her mind both while awake and when
asleep; and from that time she began to make slow progress
toward recovery. The last we saw of her she was
doing well, and hoped in time to arrive at a very
comfortable state of health.
</p><p>A Desperate Case. &mdash; A little girl about ten years of
age was brought to us by her father who came with his
daughter to have her broken of the vile habit of self-abuse into which she had fallen, having been taught it
by a German servant girl. Having read an early copy
of this work, the father had speedily detected the habit,
and had adopted every measure that he could devise to
break his child of the destructive vice which she had
acquired, but in vain. After applying various other
measures without success, it finally became necessary to
resort to a surgical operation, by which it is hoped that
<pb n="419"/>
she was permanently cured, as we have heard nothing to
the contrary since, and as the remedy seemed to be
effectual. It was a severe remedy, and may seem a
harsh one, but every other means utterly failed, and the
father insisted upon the performance of the operation as
a trial. This little girl, naturally truthful and honest,
had, through the influence of this blighting vice, been
made crafty and deceptive. She would tell the most
astonishing falsehoods to free herself from the charge of
guilt, or to avoid punishment. Her father felt so deeply
upon the subject, and was so thoroughly awake to the
consequences of the sin, that he declared he would take
his daughter away into the wilderness, and leave her to
die, if need be, rather than allow her to grow up to
womanhood with this vile blight upon her, and run the
risk of her contaminating with the same vice his other,
younger children. He felt so deeply that the tears
coursed down his cheeks as he talked, and we were
most happy to be of service to him in aiding his daughter
to overcome the fascinating vice. She seemed willing
to try to help herself, but was unable to break the bonds
of sin without the extraordinary measures adopted.
</p><p>We might continue this rehearsal of cases to an
almost indefinite length, but we must soon bring this
chapter to a close. Those described are only a few
examples of the many we are constantly meeting. None
have been overdrawn; much has been omitted for the
sake of delicacy which the exposure of the whole truth
would have required us to present. We sincerely hope
that these examples may be a warning to those who
have never marred their purity of character by an
unchaste act. To those who may have already sinned
<pb n="490"/>
in this manner, let these words come with double force
and meaning. Do you value life, health, beauty, honor,
virtue, purity? Then for the sake of all these, abandon
the evil practice at once. Do not hesitate for a moment
to decide, and do not turn back after deciding to reform.
</p><p>A Last Word. &mdash; Girls, as one who has only your best
interests in view, and who would do you good, we beg
of you to give heed one moment to the important matter
which we have been presenting before you. It is of no
frivolous character. It is one of the most important
subjects to which your attention can be called. Only
those who are utterly ignorant of the dangers which
surround them in the world, or who are already hardened
in sin, will treat this matter lightly or scornfully.
If you are still pure, and possess a character unsoiled by
sin, thank God that you have been preserved until now,
and humbly petition him to enable you to remain as pure
and unsullied as you now are. Cultivate all the heavenly
graces. Make your mother your confidant in all
your perplexities and trials. Go to her for information
on all subjects upon which you find yourself ignorant.
Let no foreign influence beguile away your confidence
from her who is most worthy of your love and respect,
and who is best prepared to instruct you on all subjects,
no matter how delicate. Trust in God for help to resist
evil under every guise. Flee from temptation under
whatever form it may appear. Thus may you escape
the suffering, the sorrow, and the remorse which are
endured sooner or later by all who enter the road of sin, no
matter how short a time they may travel therein.
</p><p>To those who have already fallen, who have been led
astray either ignorantly or through weakness in yielding
<pb n="421"/>
to temptation, we will say, Turn from your evil way at
once. Misery, sorrow, anguish, and everlasting ruin
stare you in the face. Perdition is before you. You
need not think to escape the punishment that others
suffer, for there is no way of escape. The penalty
will surely come. Make haste to return to the paths of
purity before it is too late to mend the past. It may
take years of pure and upright living to repair the evil
already done; but do not hesitate to begin at once.
With the help of God, resolve to become pure again.
God can cleanse you from all unrighteousness. He can
enable you to chase from your mind and heart every
impure thought and unclean desire. Through his grace
you can successfully battle with temptation, and redeem
the black record of the past.</p>

<head>A FEW WORDS TO BOYS AND GIRLS.</head>


<p>We have a few words to say to boys and girls
together. You are to become the men and women of the
next generation, when your fathers and mothers have
retired from active life. Twenty years from to-day the
world will be just what the present boys and girls shall
make it. Boys who are chaste, honest, obedient, and
industrious, will become noble and useful men, husbands,
and fathers. Girls who are pure, innocent, and dutiful,
will become honored and lovely women, wives, and
mothers.
</p><p>Boys and girls are placed in families together, and
thus are evidently designed by nature to associate
together, to obtain their education and preparation for life
together. When secluded wholly from each other's
society, both suffer a loss. But while this is true, it is
also true that certain evils may and often do grow out
of the association of the two sexes of young people, so
serious in character that many wise and good men and
women have felt that the sexes should be reared and
educated apart as much as possible. These evils are the
result of too intimate and improper associations of boys
and girls. Associations of this sort must be most sedulously
avoided. Boys and girls who are in school
together must be extremely careful to avoid too close
associations. On all occasions a modest reserve should
be maintained in the deportment of the young of both
sexes toward each other. Too early intimacies often
lead to hasty marriages, before either party is prepared
to enter into the married state, and before the judgment
<pb n="423"/>
has been sufficiently developed to make either capable
of selecting a suitable partner for life. These facts are
usually learned when it is too late for the information to
be of any value.
</p><p>Parents and teachers are especially responsible for
guarding these early associations, and giving timely
warning when needed. The youth should always be
ready to take advice on this subject, for with their
inexperience, they cannot know their wants so well as do
their elders. Nothing is more disgusting to persons of
sound sense than youthful flirtations. Those misguided
persons who encourage these indiscretions in young people,
do an immense amount of injury to those whom they
ought to be prepared to benefit by wise counsel. We
have seen promising young people made wretched for
life through the influence of one of these mischief-makers, being most unhappily mated, and repenting too late
of a hasty marriage for which they were utterly unprepared.
</p><p>Young persons often labor under the erroneous
impression that in order to be agreeable they must talk
"small talk;" this literally means, "silly twaddle,"
which disgusts everybody, and yet which all seek to
imitate. Whenever the two sexes meet in society or
elsewhere, as at all other times, the conversation should
be turned upon subjects of real interest, which admit of
the exercise of sound sense and will be a means of
culture. Such associations do not result in injury to any
one, and may be the means of much profit; but nothing
is more execrable than the frivolous, silly, often
absolutely senseless observations which make up the great
bulk of the conversation of young people in fashionable
society.
<pb n="424"/>
</p><p>A most ready means of disclosing the superficial
character of the minds of a large share of the young
persons who move in fashionable circles is to introduce
some topic requiring depth of thought and sound judgment.
Such a subject will usually produce either an
instant lull in the conversation, or a display of ignorance
which cannot fail to reveal the shallowness of the speaker's
intellect. It is this superficial class of minds that
most easily fall victims to a sickly sentimentalism, which
readily leads to digressions from the pathway of rigid
virtue.
</p><p>A boy who has the elements of true manliness in
him, will carry a gentlemanly bearing wherever he goes.
In all his deportment, and especially in his conduct
toward the opposite sex, he will act the gentleman; and
the boy whose gentility is genuine will manifest the
same kind deference toward his mother and sisters as
toward other ladies and girls. So also the young lady
who is a lady at heart, will never allow herself to forget
the rules of propriety, whether she is in the company of
her father and brothers, or that of other gentlemen.
</p><p>All the rules of etiquette are worth little compared
with the one simple rule which is applicable to both
sexes and all ages, &mdash; "Have the heart right, and then
act natural." One so governed will not go very far
astray under any circumstances; but it is of the greatest
importance that the heart be right. To make it
such is, indeed, the great business of life.

</div1><div1 type="chapter" n="17" id="d25"><pb n="425"/>
<head>A Chapter for Young Women.</head>
<p>
THE young women of the present generation are to
be the mothers of the next, and it is of vital
importance for the generation to come that the
individuals composing it shall come into the world with
vigorous constitutions, free from the sad entailments of
hereditary disease, and prepared to grow up into vigorous,
noble, useful men and women. In order that this should
be the case, it is necessary that our young women should
become intelligent respecting those functions of the
body which are specially liable to become deranged, and
which are to be instrumental in bringing into life the
generation yet unborn.
</p><p>At the period of puberty, the girl passes, within a
few months, from girlhood to young womanhood. New
vital processes are set up within her body; new functions
are assumed. It is the duty of every mother to explain
to her daughter, in advance, the import of these new
processes, and to give her such information as will
enable her to so care for herself at this critical period as
to prevent the great amount of unnecessary suffering
which grows out of the neglect arising from ignorance
upon this subject. The failure of mothers to do their
duty in this respect, and more than this, the lamentable
ignorance of the mothers themselves, is one of the
considerations which have induced the author of this book

<pb n="426"/>
to prepare this special chapter in which to impart the
information so much needed, and to make such suggestions
as, if carefully followed, will save a vast amount of
suffering and wretched uselessness, or years of invalidism.
</p><p>Symptoms of Puberty. &mdash; As the period of puberty
approaches, the whole system seems to take on an
increased activity. The growth becomes more rapid;
the hips begin to broaden, the abdomen to enlarge; the
breasts increase in size; and by degrees the various
changes in the functions of the body, noted elsewhere as
occurring at puberty, make their appearance. The
nervous system is also more or less affected. Girls at
this age are apt to be somewhat irritable and nervous,
and in many cases the first symptoms of a sentimental
disposition make their appearance.
</p><p>Hygiene of Puberty. &mdash; Too early an appearance of
puberty should be looked upon as a misfortune, as it
predicts, in the great majority of cases, premature decay.
Hence, if indications of the approach of puberty appear
at too early an age, such measures should be adopted as
will have the effect to delay the approaching change.
The most important of these are abundant exercise in
the open air, and plenty of muscular work, though not of
an exhausting character, a simple diet of fruits, grains,
and milk, with abstinence from flesh food, and all
excesses which tend to exhaust the nervous system.
</p><p>In case the indications are that puberty is delayed
beyond the proper time for its appearance, special
attention should be given to the girls general health.
It is probable that there is some disturbance of nutrition
which prevents the appearance of the menstrual function
at the proper period. Whatever the cause is, it should
<pb n="427"/>
be carefully sought out and corrected. We have
frequently succeeded in bringing about the desired results
in these cases by a few weeks' treatment by electricity,
massage, and systematic exercise in a gymnasium, with
proper regulation of the diet. These means are almost
uniformly successful in these cases.
</p><p>A Critical Period. &mdash; As the first occurrence of menstruation
is a very critical period in the life of a female,
and as each recurrence of the function renders her
especially susceptible to morbid influences, and liable to
serious derangements, a few hints respecting the proper
care of an individual at these periods may be acceptable.
</p><p>Important Hints. &mdash; 1. Avoid taking cold. To do
this, it is necessary to avoid exposure; not that a
person must be constantly confined in a warm room, for
such a course would be the surest way in which to
increase the susceptibility to cold. Nothing will disturb
the menstrual process more quickly than a sudden chilling
of the body when in a state of perspiration, or after
confinement in a warm room, by exposure, without
sufficient protection, to cold air. A daily bath and daily
exercise in the open air are the best known means of
preventing colds.
</p><p>2. Intense mental excitement, as well as severe
physical labor, is to be sedulously avoided during this
period. At the time of its first occurrence, special care
should be observed in this direction. Intense study, a
fit of anger, sudden grief, or even great merriment, will
sometimes arrest the process prematurely. The feeling
of <hi rend="italic">malaise</hi> which usually accompanies the discharge, is by
nature intended as a warning that rest and quiet are
required; and the hint should be followed. Every
<pb n="428"/>
endeavor should be made to keep the individual comfortable,
calm, and cheerful. Feelings of apprehension
arising from a continual watching of symptoms, are very
depressing, and should be avoided by occupying the
mind in some agreeable manner not demanding severe
effort, either mental or physical.
</p><p>There is no doubt that many young women have
permanently injured their constitutions while at school
by excessive mental taxation during the catamenial
period, to which they were prompted by ambition to
excel, or were compelled by the "cramming" system too
generally pursued in our schools, and particularly in
young ladies' seminaries. It is not to be supposed,
however, that the moderate amount of sound study
required by a correct system of teaching would be injurious
to a healthy young woman at any time, and we
have no doubt that a very large share of the injury
which has been attributed to overstudy during the
catamenia has been induced by other causes, such as
improper dress, exposure to taking cold, keeping late
hours, and improper diet.
</p><p>If there is any class of persons deserving of pity, it
is that large class of girls and young women who are in
every large city employed as clerks, seamstresses, flower
makers, and in other taxing and confining occupations.
In order to keep their situations, they are required to
be on hand daily, being allowed no opportunity for rest
at the menstrual period. In many cases, too, they are
compelled to remain upon their feet all day behind a
counter, or at a work table, even at periods when a
recumbent position is actually demanded by nature.
There should be less delicacy in relation to this subject
<pb n="429"/>
on the part of young women, and more consideration on
the part of employers. Here is a field for philanthropic
effort which is well worthy the best efforts of
any person of influence who will engage in it.
</p><p>Custom of Indian Women. &mdash; The ease with which
Indian women perform the parturient act is proverbial.
They suffer scarcely at all from the pains of childbirth;
and without doubt one reason of this is the preservation
of their sexual health by rest during the menstrual
period. At those seasons they invariably absent
themselves from the lodge, and enjoy absolute rest. We
may readily suppose, from the nature of some of the
Mosaic laws, that a custom somewhat similar prevailed
among the ancient Hebrew women. If the hardy
women of the forest are benefited by rest, certainly our
more delicate civilized women may be thus benefited
All need a degree of rest; with some it should be absolute.
</p><p>Criminal Carelessness. &mdash; The reckless manner in
which some young women treat themselves at the menstrual
period, is quite appalling to one who is acquainted
with the painful and inveterate character of the evils
which arise from such abuse. It is no uncommon thing
for young ladies to attend balls, visit skating rinks;
and otherwise expose themselves to influences in
every way the best calculated to do them the most
harm at this particular period, observing not the slightest
precaution. Such recklessness is really criminal;
and the sad consequences of physical transgression are
sure to follow. A young lady who allows herself to get
wet or chilled, just prior to or during menstruation, runs
the risk of imposing upon herself life-long injury.
<pb n="430"/>
Mothers should look carefully after their daughters at
these periods, and impress upon them the importance of
special care.
</p><p>3. A third hint, which is applicable to both sexes
and at all times, is the necessity of attending promptly
to the demands of nature for the relief of bowels and
bladder. School-girls are often very negligent in this
respect; and we have seen the most distressing cases of
disease which were entirely attributable to this disregard
of the promptings of nature. Obstinate constipation
and chronic irritation of the bladder are common
effects. When constipation results, purgatives in the
shape of pills, salts, or "pleasant purgative pellets," are
resorted to with the certain effect of producing only
temporary relief, and permanent damage.
</p><p>To escape these evil consequences, (1.) Establish a
regular habit of relieving the bowels daily at a certain
hour; (2.) Discard laxative and cathartic drugs of every
kind; (3.) To aid in securing a regular movement of the
bowels, make a liberal use of oatmeal, wheat-meal,
fruit, and vegetables, avoiding fine-flour bread, sweet-meats, and condiments; (4.) Take daily exercise, as
much as possible short of fatigue; if necessarily
confined indoors, counteract the constipating influence of
sedentary habits by kneading and percussing the bowels
with the hands several minutes each day; (5.) Never
resist the calls of nature a single moment, if possible to avoid
it. In this case, as in numerous others, "delay is
dangerous." Ladies who desire a sweet breath &mdash; and what
lady does not? &mdash; should remember that retained feces is
one of the most frequent causes of foul breath. The
foul odors which ought to pass out through the bowels,
<pb n="431"/>
find their way into the blood, and escape at the lungs.
A medical man whose sense of smell is delicate, soon
learns to know a constipated person by his breath. As
one says, "What is more offensive than the breath of a
costive child?"
</p><p>A Doctor's Advice. &mdash; Boerhaave, a famous Dutch
physician, left to his heirs an elegantly bound volume
in which, he claimed, were written all the secrets of the
science of physic. After his death, the wonderful book
was opened, when it was found to contain only the
following sentence: &mdash;
</p><p>"Keep the head cool, the feet warm, and the bowels
open."
</p><p>An old Scotch physician once gave the following
advice to Sir Astley Cooper for the preservation of
health: &mdash;
</p><p>"Keep in the fear of the Lord, and your bowels
open."
</p><p>4. Perhaps nothing tends more directly to the
production of menstrual derangements, as well as uterine
diseases of every sort, than fashionable modes of dress.
We have not space here to give the subject the attention
it deserves; it will be found treated of in works
devoted to the subject of dress exclusively. Some of
the most glaring evils are, &mdash;
</p><p>(1.) Unequal distribution of clothing. The trunk,
especially the abdomen and pelvis, is covered with
numerous layers of clothing, an extra amount being caused by
the overlapping of the upper and lower garments. Very
frequently, the amount of clothing upon these, the most
vital parts, is excessive. At the same time, the limbs are
sometimes almost, in a state of nudity. A single cotton
<pb n="432"/>
garment, or at most one of thin flannel, is the only
protection to the limbs beneath the skirts, which often
serve no better purpose than to collect cold air and
retain it in contact with the limbs. A thin stocking is the
only protection for the ankles, and a thin shoe is the
only additional covering afforded the feet. Under such
circumstances, it is no wonder that a woman catches
cold if she only steps out-of-doors on a chilly or damp
day.
</p><p>(2.) Another glaring fault is in the manner of
suspending the skirts. Instead of being fastened to a waist,
or suspended so as to give them support from the shoulders,
they are hung upon the hips, being drawn tight at
the waist to secure support. By this means the organs
of the pelvis are pressed down out of place, the uterus
becomes congested, and painful menstrual derangements
ensue.
</p><p>(3.) Tight-lacing, or compressing the waist with a
corset, is a barbarous practice which produces the same
results as the one last mentioned. Reform in all
these particulars is an imperative necessity for every
woman who desires to secure or retain sexual health.
</p><p>It is of the greatest importance that careful attention
should be given to the proper establishment of the
menstrual function at the outset of a woman's life of
sexual activity. The first two years will be quite
likely to have a deciding influence respecting her health
during her whole future life. If a girl can get
through the first two years after puberty without
acquiring any serious uterine or ovarian disease, she will
stand a fair chance of enjoying a good degree of sexual
health during the balance of her life. The foundation
<pb n="433"/>
of a great share of the many thousands of cases of
uterine disease is laid during this period.
</p><p>At this early period the daughter is usually too young
to appreciate the importance of observing slight deviations
from the standard of health, even if she were sufficiently
informed to be able to recognize them; hence it
is a duty which no mother should neglect, to inquire
into the exact frequency of the periods, the amount and
character of the discharge, and other points necessary to
ascertain whether or not there is any deviation from the
natural condition of health. If there is pain, it is a
certain evidence of something seriously wrong. If there
is irregularity in any particular, it is a matter well
deserving serious attention.
</p><p>Other Perils. &mdash; After passing through the dangers
incident to the establishment of the menstrual function,
the young lady encounters dangers of a no less perilous
character. Having become a young lady, she must now,
according to the custom of the world, begin to enter
society. Here she meets all sorts of influences, some good
and some bad. At least, this is true of society in most
civilized communities. The young lady very soon discovers
that if she is to take equal rank with her associates,
she must adopt their manners and customs, to a
large extent at least.
</p><p>Unfortunately, the social customs in this country are
strangely prepared for a powerful tendency in the
direction of evil. These influences soon begin to tell
upon the character of a young woman who has not been
fortified against them with intelligent care and correct
early training, and even they are not always proof
against the contaminating influences with which they
<pb n="434"/>
come in contact. Often enough has the writer met
cases in which young girls of only fifteen or sixteen
years have been permitted to enter the exciting whirl-pool of social life, and imitating the example of their
elders, have accepted the attentions of young men of
whose history they knew nothing, and of whose characters
they were in no way competent to judge.
</p><p>Moon-light rides, long evening walks, associations at
parties, picnics, etc., give sly privileges, at first
apparently accidental, but gradually becoming more audacious,
until finally, within a few short weeks or months, the
cloak of modesty with which the young girl's maidenhood
had been protected, was torn in tatters, and she
lacks but little, if anything, of having taken all the
steps necessary to lead a woman outside the pale of
virgin purity. Thousands of girls, thus early thrown
into society, without experience in the world, with
immature minds, warm-hearted and unsuspecting, are
annually led down the road to ruin through the
opportunities afforded by our lax social manners. The
careful mother will restrain her daughters from exposure
to any of the temptations of fashionable society until
they have attained sufficient age and understanding, and
until their principles have become so thoroughly established
that they cannot be so easily led astray.
</p><p>"Fast Girls." &mdash; Some young women, like a certain
class of young men, imagine that there is something
particularly smart in being fast. A walk, a ride, or a
waltz with some fast young man, perhaps a notorious
rake, is an adventure which has a peculiar fascination.
They delight in those escapades and adventures which
startle old-fashioned people who still have some sense
<pb n="435"/>
of propriety. What is the consequence? These young
women soon find their moral sense so blunted, that
before they are aware of it they are led to the commission
of acts which, but a short time before, they would have
regarded with the greatest horror. In an unguarded
moment the fatal step is taken, and modesty, purity,
and honor, all that a woman holds most sacred, are
sacrificed, and they are rapidly swept away into the
maelstrom of vice.
</p><p>Improper Liberties. &mdash; The first step usually taken
by the young woman on the downward road, is the
allowance of little liberties on the part of young men.
They may be very slight at first, perhaps only a
significant pressure of the hand, or the arm placed about the
waist, or some similar impropriety. By degrees, slight
advances are made along the same line, until the grossest
breaches of immodesty are permitted. We are not
over-stating the matter when we say that we have met
many young women who have been led into wrong doing,
who have confessed that this was the beginning of
their downward course.
</p><p>Every young woman should resent the first appearance
of attentions of the sort referred to. There is no
other safe point at which the line may be drawn. Indeed,
we are of the opinion that the freedom with which
mothers allow strangers to handle their children, caressing
and fondling them, has a decided influence to break
down the barriers of modesty, and to pervert the
instincts so as to prepare them for the evils to which we
have called attention, in later years.
</p><p>Getting a Husband. &mdash; The women who are willing to
"live and die as old maids," are very rare exceptions
<pb n="436"/>
among the sex. The average woman looks upon the lot
of a spinster as the most wretched and undesirable
possible; and yet it is unquestionably true that the average
"old maid" is vastly happier in her lot, and more useful
to the world, than quite a large proportion of wives.
Certainly there is a vast deal of useful work which
can be better accomplished by those who can give
their undivided attention to the work in hand, than by
those whose minds and energies are necessarily devoted
to husband, children, and domestic cares. We doubt not
that the world would be vastly better off if there were
a much larger number of useful old maids, and a less
number of helpless, good-for-nothing, sickly wives.
Nevertheless, the average woman expects to marry sometime,
and it may be worth while to devote a little space
to the consideration of what sort of a man a husband
ought to be. In another chapter the characteristics of
persons of both sexes who ought not to marry at all
have been pointed out. A man possessing any of the
defects named, is not fit to be the husband of any woman
worthy of a good husband. To the suggestions elsewhere
made, we will add the following: &mdash;
</p><p>1. Be sure that the man whom you accept as a husband
is worth marrying. There are a great many
excellent men in the world, but probably by far the
great majority of husbands are not worth marrying.
Some years ago we were stopping for a few weeks at a
fashionable boarding-house in Boston. As we were
preparing to leave, the young woman in charge of the
dining-room, having learned of our connection with a
medical institution in the West, desired us to apply for
a position in it for her. As we had been greatly pleased
<pb n="437"/>
with her efficient management of the work she had in
charge, we were strongly inclined to endeavor to make
arrangements to employ her services, and offered her, by
way of encouragement, some remark to that effect, to
which she replied, "I suppose I ought to state to you
that I have an incumbrance."
</p><p>"What sort of an incumbrance?"
</p><p>"Why, do n't you understand? I have a husband."
</p><p>We found that she was indeed incumbered by a
good-for-nothing husband, which fact prevented our
engaging her services; and undoubtedly the same incumbrance
has been directly in the way of her getting on in
the world ever since.
</p><p>There are plenty of women in the world who are
capable of being of great service to society in various
callings, who are handicapped in the most effectual
manner by incumbrances of the same sort. If you have
an ambition to do anything in the world, or to be
anything more than a plodding character in the tide of
human life, see to it that the man whom you are to
marry is one who is competent to aid you in the attainment
of noble and useful things, instead of being an
"incumbrance" and a hinderance.
</p><p>2. Make yourself worthy of a good husband. Study
the arts of house-keeping and home-making. Give more
attention to the cultivation of estimable qualities of mind
and heart and character, to self-discipline and health-culture, than to external adornment of the person.
Form a high ideal of what a grand, noble, and lovable
woman ought to be, and endeavor to make yourself
such.
</p><p>3. Do not be in too great a hurry, and do not make
<pb n="438"/>
your favors too cheap. Maintain a maidenly reserve,
which is vastly more attractive to intelligent and sensible
men than the bold and flashy manners of many young
women of the present day, which say as distinctly as
words could speak, something like the following: &mdash;
</p><p>"I am in the matrimonial market. Won't you buy?
Speak quick! I am in a hurry to be sold as soon as
possible."
</p><p>Such vain creatures are usually "sold," to their
infinite mortification and chagrin. They think that by
their flashy manners and the great display of what is
vulgarly known as "cheek," they will be able to catch
a great prize in the shape of a wealthy or talented
husband; whereas, in the majority of cases, they are picked
up by some shallow-brained fop, who is skilled only in
the arts of deception, in which he has trained himself to
such perfection as to become an equal and suitable
match for one of those vain and flashy daughters of
fashion.
</p><p>Again we say, Do not be in a hurry. Wait and
work. Labor to make yourself purer and better, and
more thoroughly sincere and genuine in your purposes,
and you may be sure that in due time, and at the right
time, the one man who is capable of making you the
best possible husband will find you out. If you find
that you are overlooked, do not begin to bemoan your
lot, but be glad and thankful that you are not the wife
of an incumbrance, and be sure that in all probability, if
you were not single, you would be in that unhappy predicament.</p>

<head>Chapter for Wives and Mothers.</head>
<p>
YOU have found a husband, it is to be hoped, to
your mind, and suited to you, and now the question
is, What are you going to do with him or
for him? In the first place, make him a pleasant
cheerful, tidy home. Take good care of him. Particularly,
take good care of his stomach, by supplying
him with pure, wholesome food. If you can keep his
digestion good, you can rely upon his keeping his
temper, unless he is an extraordinarily ill-tempered man.
Be careful always to treat him well, and demand that
he should treat you well. Treat him respectfully, and
insist that he shall treat you respectfully in return.
Respect his rights of conscience, and require him to
respect yours as well. Humor him a little; especially if
you are in the right, and he in the wrong. You can
afford to be generous and liberal if you have the right
on your side, as you will certainly come out ahead in
the long run.
</p><p>Never allow your undoubted rights to be trampled
upon without protest. What are married women's
rights? we are asked. Some women imagine that when
married, all their rights become subject to their
husband's wishes. This is a mistake. Both human and
divine laws recognize the fact that a woman possesses
individual rights of which she cannot be deprived, even
<pb n="440"/>
by her husband. One of these is the right of conscience.
No Woman is ever called upon to sacrifice the
demands of conscience to the wishes of her husband.
</p><p>Another right which every wife possesses, is the
right to control her own person; that is, she is master
of her own body, and is under no physical or moral
obligation to submit to demands made upon her by her
husband unless her own instincts lead in the same
direction. Many other minor rights might be mentioned,
but these are the most important, and perhaps the only
ones concerning which any serious question is likely to
arise.
</p><p>The Young Mother. &mdash; One of the natural results of
marriage is motherhood. This function has, however,
in this perverted age, come to be looked upon as a
burden, and by some, almost as a disgrace. There
probably never was a time when paternity was avoided by
every conceivable device as at the present time. Some
of the numerous evils which grow out of the reluctance
on the part of women to fulfill the most important
function of womanhood, have been pointed out elsewhere
in this work, and need not be recapitulated here.
</p><p>Pregnancy. &mdash; The leading signs of pregnancy are as
follows: &mdash;
</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cessation of Menstruation</hi>. This is generally the
first evidence of conception, and is usually reckoned as
the beginning of the period of gestation, or pregnancy. It
sometimes happens, however, that menstruation continues
during the whole period of pregnancy.
</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Morning Sickness</hi> is a symptom which usually
appears early in the second month, sometimes, even in the
<pb n="441"/>
first week. The patient experiences nausea just after
rising in the morning, which is sometimes accompanied
by vomiting.
</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Change in the Breasts</hi>. By the middle or end of
the second month, the breasts begin to enlarge, becoming
firmer to the touch, and also somewhat sensitive.
The nipple becomes darker in color, and the ring around
it, technically termed the <hi rend="italic">areola</hi>, also acquires a deeper
hue, and extends its circle. Little tubercules make
their appearance upon the surface. At this period, dark
spots, closely resembling liver spots, make their
appearance upon the face and hands. These differ from
liver spots in that they usually disappear very speedily
after childbirth.
</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Increase in the size of the womb</hi>. By the end of
the second month, the womb acquires sufficient increase
in size to cause it to settle down into the pelvis, in
consequence of which the abdomen acquires an unnatural
flatness characteristic of this condition.
</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Beating of the f&oelig;tal heart</hi>. Between the third and
fourth months, the f&oelig;tus has attained sufficient growth
to enable the experienced observer to hear the beating
of the heart. This is the first sign of pregnancy.
The beating of the f&oelig;tal heart is to be distinguished
from that of the mother by its frequency, which is
usually about one hundred and thirty or one hundred
and fifty beats per minute.
</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">Quickening</hi>. This term is usually applied to the
first feeling of the movements of the child by the mother.
They may be felt any time by a quick tap on the abdomen.
</p><p>7. Continued enlargement of the f&oelig;tus takes place
from its rapid growth at this time.
<pb n="442"/>
</p><p>8. Near the termination of pregnancy, the uterus
becomes so greatly enlarged that severe pressure is
made upon the stomach: which occasions a <hi rend="italic">return of the
nausea and vomiting</hi>.
</p><p>9. <hi rend="italic">Leucorrh&oelig;a</hi>. During the last few weeks of
pregnancy, the congested state of the blood-vessels of
the vagina occasions a leucorrh&oelig;al discharge.
</p><p>10. <hi rend="italic">Settling of the womb</hi>. At the termination of the
pregnancy, just prior to childbirth, the womb again
settles down into the pelvis, causing a change in the
shape of the abdomen.
</p><p>The Curse Removed. &mdash; Most women look forward to
the period of childbirth with great apprehension and
anxiety, in consequence of the great suffering which
must be endured, and the no small peril to life and
health which are involved. Quite an extensive observation
has convinced us, however, that a large share of
the suffering and danger may be obviated by careful
preparation for the event. The following suggestions
are particularly important: &mdash;
</p><p>1. The diet should consist chiefly of fruits, grains,
and milk. The practice of drinking one or two glasses
of very warm water an hour before each meal, is an
excellent measure of preventing disease of the kidneys.
Tea and coffee should be discarded, as they cause a
decided increase of the tendency to morning sickness,
besides producing nervous irritability. Stimulants and
condiments of all sorts should be scrupulously avoided.
The avoidance of oatmeal and other grains which furnish
a large amount of bone-making material, is a doctrine
without scientific foundation, as we have elsewhere
shown at some length.
<pb n="443"/>
</p><p>2. An abundance of vigorous muscular exercise
should be taken daily. All the muscles of the body
should be exercised, particularly those of the abdomen.
By these means some of the most troublesome complications
of labor may be avoided, and the birth made easy.
Among the leading causes of painful childbirth, are
sedentary habits. The mother should take regular
exercise, even up to the last day. Walking is an excellent
form of exercise; and when this can be supplemented by
massage, and particularly by careful kneading of the
abdominal muscles, very great advantage may be gained.
</p><p>3. Tight-lacing, the suspending of heavy skirts from
the waist, and other errors in dress, are so patently evil
that we scarcely need take space to condemn them. Yet
some women will even insist on wearing corsets during
pregnancy, for the purpose of preserving their form.
This is so wicked and pernicious a practice that in our
opinion it ought to be prohibited by law.
</p><p>4. Baths of various sorts are of immense advantage
in securing easy childbirth. A general bath should be
taken at least twice a week. A warm vaginal injection
should be taken daily. The temperature of the water
should be 95&deg; to 100&deg;. A little fine castile soap should
be used to secure perfect cleanliness of the parts. By
this means the troublesome leucorrh&oelig;al discharge, and
the annoying itching which frequently attends it,
may usually be wholly controlled, if not entirely
prevented. A sitz bath taken during the early months
once or twice a week, and during the last two or three
months daily, or every other day, is very beneficial. The
temperature of the bath should be from 90&deg; to 94&deg;, and
should be continued twenty or thirty minutes. In
<pb n="444"/>
taking the bath, great care should be exercised not to
produce any shock to the patient by the sudden application
of either very hot or very cold water.
</p><p>A Hayti Mother. &mdash; The freedom from pain in childbirth
enjoyed by barbarous nations, is to the civilized
woman a matter of wonder and amazement. The same
immunity from suffering is enjoyed by negro women,
and by those of various other nations. A friend of the
writer, an old sea captain, recently related in substance
the following incident: &mdash;
</p><p>While living at Hayti a few years ago, as he was
driving one morning, he passed his washer-woman,
who with a huge basket of soiled clothes on her head,
was walking two or three miles into the country to a
little lake, which she used for a wash-tub in her laundry
operations. On returning in the evening over the same
route, he again passed the woman, returning with her
basket filled with spotless linen, carrying a new-born
babe in her arms. It was evident that she had not
allowed the small incident of a childbirth to interfere with
the regular business of the day.
</p><p>We would not attempt to maintain that all women
can bear children as easily as the Hayti washer-woman,
even if most careful attention is given to all the rules of
health. Among the most highly civilized nations,
especially the Caucasian race, the neglect of physical
culture has produced disproportionate development between
the head and other portions of the body, which is
unquestionably one cause of suffering at childbirth, and
cannot be wholly obviated by any attention to general
or special hygiene; but that the sufferings of childbirth
are greatly mitigated, and in many cases almost wholly
<pb n="445"/>
prevented, we are positively assured by experience with
scores of women who have faithfully carried out the
simple suggestions made in this and other works in
which we have presented this important subject.
</p><p>Ante-Natal Influences. &mdash; There can be no manner
of doubt that many circumstances which it is entirely
within the power of the parents to supply, exert a powerful
influence in molding both the mental and the physical
characteristics of offspring. By carefully availing
himself of the controlling power given him by a knowledge
of this fact, the stock-raiser is enabled to produce
almost any required quality in his young animals. Pigeon
fanciers show wonderful skill in thus producing most
curious modifications in birds. The laws of heredity and
development are carefully studied and applied in the
production of superior horses, cows, dogs, and pigeons; but
an application of the same principles to the improvement
of the human race is rarely thought of. Human beings
are generated in as hap-hazard and reckless a manner as
weeds are sown by the wind. No account is taken of
the possible influence which may be exerted upon the
future destiny of the new being by the physical or mental
condition of parents at the moment when the germ of
life is planted, or by the mental and physical conditions
and surroundings of the mother while the young life is
developing. Indeed, the assertion of a modern writer
that the poor of our great cities virtually "spawn"
children, with as little thought of influences and
consequences as the fish that sow their eggs broadcast upon
the waters, is not so great an exaggeration as it might
at first sight appear to be.
</p><p>Law Universal. &mdash; Men and women are constantly
<pb n="446"/>
prone to forget that the domain of law is universal.
Nothing comes by chance. The revolutions of the
planets, studied by the aid of the telescope; and the
gyrations of the atoms, seen only by the eye of science,
are alike examples of the controlling influence of
law. Notwithstanding this sad ignorance and the disregard
of this vitally important subject, the effects of law
are only too clearly manifested in the crowds of wretched
human beings with which the world is thronged. An
old writer sagely remarks, "It is the greatest part of
human felicity to be well born;" nevertheless, it is the sad
misfortune of by far the greater portion of humanity to
be deprived of this inestimable "felicity."
</p><p>A Source of Crime. &mdash; Who can tell how many of the
liars, thieves, drunkards, murderers, and prostitutes of
our day are less responsible for their crimes against
themselves, against society, and against Heaven, than
those who were instrumental in bringing them into the
world? Almost every village has its boy "who was
born drunk," a staggering, simpering, idiotic representative
of a drunken father, beastly intoxicated at the very
moment when he should have been most sober.
</p><p>An interesting study of this question has recently
been made by Mr. Dugdale, a member of the Prison
Association of the State of New York. When visiting the
various jails of the State, he found in one six persons
detained for crimes of various character, between all of
whom there was a family relation. Upon further
inquiry, he found that of the same family there were
twenty-nine relatives in the vicinity, seventeen of whom
were criminals. Still further investigation developed
the following facts:
<pb n="447"/>
</p><p>A Bad Family. &mdash; Within seventy-five years, a family
of 1200 persons have sprung from five sisters, several of
whom were illegitimate, and three of whom were known
to be unchaste, and who married men whose father was
an idle, thriftless hunter, a hard drinker, and licentious.
</p><p>Of this family, the history of about 709 was traced.
Of these, the facts set forth in the following incomplete
summary were found to be true: &mdash;
</p><p>Paupers,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 280
</p><p>Years of pauperism, . . . . . . . . . . . . 798
</p><p>Criminals,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 140
</p><p>Years of infamy,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 750
</p><p>Thieves,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .60
</p><p>Murderers,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7
</p><p>Prostitutes and adulteresses, . . . . . . . 165
</p><p>Illegitimate children,. . . . . . . . . . . .91
</p><p>No. of persons contaminated by syphilitic
disease, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 480
</p><p>Cost to the State in various ways,. .$1,308,000

</p><p>Without doubt, a complete summary would make this
showing still more appalling, since of the 709 whose
histories were traced, it was in many instances impossible
to determine whether the individuals were guilty
of crime or unchastity or not, even where there were
grounds for suspicion. Such cases were not included
in the summary.
</p><p>No amount of argument on this question could be
so conclusive as are these simple facts concerning
the "Juke" family. It is certainly high time that our
legislators began to awaken to this subject, and consider
whether it would be an unprofitable experiment to
make some attempt to prevent the multiplication of
criminals in this manner. We are not prepared to offer
<pb n="448"/>
a plan for securing an end; but it is very clearly
important that something should be done in this direction.
</p><p>A Physiological Fact. &mdash; It is an established physiological
fact that the character of offspring is influenced
by the mental as well as the physical conditions of the
parents at the moment of the performance of the generative
act. In view of this fact, how many parents can
regard the precocious, or even mature, manifestations of
sexual depravity in their children without painful
smitings of conscience at seeing the legitimate results of
their own sensuality? By debasing the reproductive
function to an act of selfish animal indulgence, they
imprinted upon their children an almost irresistible
tendency to vice. Viewing the matter from this standpoint,
what wonder that licentiousness is rife! that true
chastity is among the rarest of virtues!
</p><p>Prof. O. W. Holmes remarks on this subject:
"There are people who think that everything may be
done if the doctor, be he educator or physician, be only
called in season. No doubt; but <hi rend="italic">in season</hi> would often
be a hundred or two years before the child was born,
and people never send so early as that." "Each of us
is only the footing up of a double column of figures that
goes back to the first pair. Every unit tells, and some
of them are <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> and some <hi rend="italic">minus</hi>.
If the columns do n't
add up right, it is commonly because we can't make
out all of the figures."
</p><p>It cannot be doubted that the throngs of deaf, blind,
crippled, idiotic unfortunates who were "born so,"
together with a still larger class of dwarfed, diseased,
and constitutionally weak individuals, are the lamentable
<pb n="449"/>
results of the violation of some sexual law on the part
of their progenitors.
</p><p>Something for Parents to Consider. &mdash; If parents
would stop a moment to consider the momentous
responsibilities involved in the act of bringing into
existence a human being; if they would reflect that the
qualities imparted to the new being will affect its
character to all eternity; if they would recall the fact that
they are about to bring into existence a mirror in which
will be reflected their own characters divested of all the
flimsy fabrics which deceive their fellow-men, revealing
even the secret imaginings of their hearts, there would
surely be far less of sin, disease, and misery born into
the world than at the present day; but we dare not hope
for such a reform. To effect it would require such a
revolution in the customs of society, such a radical
reform in the habits and characters of individuals, as
could be done by nothing short of a temporal millennium.
</p><p>It is quite probable that some writers have greatly
exaggerated the possible results which may be attained
by proper attention to the laws under consideration.
All cannot be equally beautiful; every child cannot be
a genius; the influence of six thousand years of transgression
cannot be effaced in a single generation; but
persevering, conscientious efforts to comply with every
requirement of health, purity, morality, and the laws of
nature, will accomplish wonders in securing healthy
children with good dispositions, brilliant intellects, and
beautiful bodies.
</p><p>This is not the proper place to describe in detail a
plan to be pursued; but the few hints given, if rightly
<pb n="450"/>
appreciated, may enable those interested in the subject
to plan for themselves a proper course. In concluding
the subject, we may summarize its chief points as follows,
for the purpose of impressing them more fully upon
the mind: &mdash;
</p><p>The Origin of Evil. &mdash; 1. If a child is begotten in
lust, its lower passions will as certainly be abnormally
developed as peas will produce peas, or potatoes produce
potatoes. If the child does not become a rake or
a prostitute, it will be because of uncommonly fortunate
surroundings, or a miracle of divine grace. But
even then, what terrible struggles with sin and vice,
with foul thoughts and lewd imaginations, &mdash; the product
of a naturally abnormal mind, &mdash; must such an individual
suffer! If he is unsuccessful in the conflict, is he alone to
blame? Society, his fellow-men, will censure him alone;
but He who knoweth all the secrets of human life, will
pass a more lenient judgment on the erring one, and
mete out punishment where it most belongs.
</p><p>2. The same remarks apply with equal force to the
transmission of other qualities. If the interest of the
parents is only for self, with no thought for the well-being
of the one whose destiny is in their hands, they can expect
naught but a selfish character, a sordid, greedy
disposition, in the child.
</p><p>3. The influence of the father is, at the outset, as
great as that of the mother. The unhappy or immoral
thoughts of one alone at the critical moment when life is
imparted, may fix for eternity a foul blot upon the
character yet unformed.
</p><p>4. If during gestation the mother is fretful, complaining
and exacting; if she requires to be petted and
<pb n="451"/>
waited upon; if she gratifies every idle whim and
indulges every depraved desire and perverted appetite,
as thousands of mothers do, &mdash; the result will surely be a
peevish, fretful child, that will develop into a morose and
irritable man or woman, imperious, unthankful, disobedient,
willful, gluttonous, and vicious.
</p><p>How to Beget Sound Children. &mdash; If such undesirable
results would be avoided, the following suggestions
should be regarded: &mdash;
</p><p>1. For the beginning of a new life, select the most
favorable time, which will be when the bodily health is
at its hight; when the mind is free from care and anxiety;
when the heart is joyous, cheerful, and filled with
hope, love, high aspirations, pure and beautiful thoughts.
If, as one writer says, it is the duty of every human
pair engaging in the reproductive act, to bring into
existence the most perfect specimen of the race of which
they are capable, then it becomes a monstrous crime to
enter into relations which may produce a contrary
result. This may be a truth hard to accept, but who is
prepared to dispute it on logical or moral grounds?
</p><p>2. If a child has been properly conceived, the duty
then devolves upon the mother to secure its proper
development. Is beauty desired, let the mother be
surrounded with beautiful objects; and let her mind
dwell upon such objects. If an active mind and brilliant
intellect are required, the mother should devote
considerable time to study and mental labor of a pleasant
nature. The moral nature should be carefully cultivated,
to insure a lovely disposition. No angry words
or unhappy feelings should be tolerated. Purity of
heart and life should be maintained. The husband
<pb n="452"/>
should do his part by supplying favorable surroundings,
suggesting cheerful thoughts, and aiding mental culture.
</p><p>3. After birth, the mother still possesses a molding
influence upon the development of her child through
the lacteal secretion. Every mother knows how
speedily the child will suffer if nursed when she is
exhausted by physical labor or when suffering from
nervous excitement, as anger or grief. These facts
show the influence which the mental states of the
mother exert upon the child, even when the act of
nursing is the only physical bond between them.
</p><p>It would be a happy day for the race which should
witness the recognition of the fact that infants, even
human beings in embryo, possess rights which are as
sacred as those of adult human beings.
</p><p>This whole subject is more fully treated by the
author in special works, full information concerning
which can be obtained by those wishing to know more
on this subject, by addressing him personally.</p>

<head>Hygiene for Women in Advanced Life.</head>
<p>
CHANGE OF LIFE. &mdash; The two most important
periods in a woman's life are those which mark
the beginning and the end of the menstrual function.
The duration of sexual activity in women is
usually thirty-two years, extending from the average
age of thirteen to forty-five or forty-six. There is
great individual variation in this respect, however, the
termination of the menstrual function in some persons
occurring as early as the thirtieth year, while in others
it is delayed until the age of sixty or upwards. In a
case under the author's care a few years ago, the patient,
aged sixty, was still menstruating regularly. It is never
possible to predict with any degree of accuracy just at
what age the change of life, or menopause, will occur.
</p><p>The physical changes which occur at the change of
life, are the opposite to those which mark the period of
puberty. The ovaries, womb, and vagina undergo a
process of atrophy, or shrinkage, by which they become
reduced to a smaller size than before development occurred.
</p><p>The symptoms which mark the beginning of the
change of life are: irregularity of the menses, both as
to time and quantity; nervousness and general decline
of health, signified by loss of flesh, and various disturbances
in the stomach, bowels, bladder, and other organs;
<pb n="454"/>
Occasionally eruptions of the skin, particularly upon the
face; sometimes a slight growth of hair upon the upper
lip; suffering from neuralgia, nervousness, and sometimes
hysteria; complaint of sudden flushing of the face, or
"rush of blood to the head;" the hands, legs, and trunk
of the body may be affected, as well as the head and
face. These flushings are sudden, and usually last but
a few minutes, and are followed by profuse perspiration.
Sometimes a perspiration does not occur, a condition
known as "dry flushing," which is much more distressing
than the ordinary form, taking its place. Profuse
perspiration sometimes occurs during sleep, and is very
likely to follow excitement, either mental or nervous.
A great variety of other symptoms, involving nearly
every organ of the body, are present during this period.
</p><p>One of the dangers which should be especially
mentioned, is the liability of morbid growths to make their
appearance at this time. Various tumors of the womb,
as fibroids and cancers, select this as their favorite time
of attack. A cancer is not likely to occur, however,
unless the womb has some time been torn at childbirth, and
through neglect the laceration has not been repaired.
Growths of the urethra are not unlikely to occur at this
time.
</p><p>Hygiene of the Menopause. &mdash; Many of the ills to
which women are subject at this period, may be avoided
by proper preventive measures. Pre-existing disease
of the womb, which through neglect or improper treatment
has not been cured, lays the foundation for much
suffering at this time. It is indeed probable that previous
womb disease is the leading cause of suffering at this
period, as it is hardly supposable that in the normal state
<pb n="455"/>
such vital disturbances and great suffering as are
observed at this period would occur. This emphasizes the
importance of adopting such measures as will secure relief
from whatever local disorders may exist before this
period arrives, thus avoiding much of the inconvenience
and suffering of later years to which the individual will
otherwise be exposed. The following suggestions will
be found of especial service in preventing and mitigating
the sufferings attendant at this period: &mdash;
</p><p>1. Individuals passing through the change of life
should be relieved from all burdensome cares, and should
be kept free from all sources of worry and excitement.
Cheerfulness and harmony of spirits are particularly
important. If this cannot be obtained at home, arrangements
should be made for the patient to go to some
suitable place away from home for a few weeks or
months.
</p><p>2. Special attention should be given to diet, which
should be simple, wholesome, and nourishing, but free
from exciting stimulants of all sorts. Tea and coffee, as
well as all other narcotics and stimulants, should be
studiously avoided. The enforcement of this rule is
sometimes difficult, owing to the intense craving for
nerve stimulants which many women experience at this
period. Bitters and patent medicines of all sorts do a
great deal of mischief when employed as they are apt to
be. Their use is wholly without good results, and is
often productive of almost irreparable damage.
</p><p>3. The general health should be maintained by all
possible means. Outdoor exercises, carriage-riding when
the patient is unable to take a sufficient amount of
exercise by walking, are to be commended. Careful atten-<pb n="456"/>
tion should be given to the bowels, which may be emptied
regularly by the use of coarse grains, and an abundance
of fruit, etc.
</p><p>4. The flushings or profuse perspirations are best
relieved by hot saline sponge baths, hot and cold
applications to the spine, and the avoidance of all sources of
physical, mental, or nervous excitement.
</p><p>5. Most of the local symptoms which give annoyance
at this period may be relieved by the hot vaginal douche.
The distressing leucorrh&oelig;al discharge, accompanied by
violent itching, which often makes its appearance just
after the change of life, may usually be relieved by
appropriate treatment, though there is no one method
which will answer for all cases.</p>

<head>A Chapter for Married People.</head>
<p>
IT seems to be a generally prevalent opinion that the
marriage ceremony removes all restraint from the
exercise of the sexual functions. Few seem to even
suspect that the seventh commandment has any
bearing upon sexual conduct within the pale of matrimony.
Yet if we may believe the confessions and
statements of men and women, legalized prostitution is
a more common crime than illicit commerce of the sexes.
So common is the popular error upon this subject, and
so strongly fortified by prejudice, that it is absolutely
dangerous for a writer or speaker to express the
truth, if he knows it and has a disposition to do so. Any
attempt to call attention to true principles is mocked at,
decried, stigmatized, and, if possible, extinguished. The
author is vilified, and his work is denounced, and relegated
to the ragman. Extremist, fanatic, ascetic, are
the mildest terms employed concerning him, and he
escapes with rare good fortune if his chastity or virility
is not assailed.
</p><p>We are not going to run any such risks, and so shall
not attempt to enunciate or maintain any theory. We
shall content ourselves with plainly stating established
physiological facts by quotations from standard medical
authors, leaving each reader to draw conclusions and
construct a practical formula for himself.

<pb n="458"/>
</p><p>Object of the Reproductive Functions. &mdash; Man, in
whatever condition we find him, is more or less depraved.
This is true as well of the most cultivated and refined
ladies and gentlemen of the great centers of civilization,
as of the misshapen denizens of African jungles, or the
scarcely human natives of Australia and Terra del Fuego.
His appetites, his tastes, his habits, even his bodily
functions, are perverted. Of course, there are degrees
of depravity and varieties of perversion. In some
respects, savages approach more nearly to the natural
state than civilized man, and in other particulars, the
latter more nearly represents man's natural condition;
but in neither barbarism nor civilization do we find man
in his primitive state.
</p><p>In consequence of this universal departure from his
original normal condition, &mdash; the causes of which we need
not here trace, since they are immaterial in the
consideration of this question, &mdash; when we wish to ascertain
with certainty the functions of particular organs of the
human body, we are obliged to compare them with the
corresponding organs of lower animals, and study the
functions of the latter. It is by this method of investigation
that most of the important truths of physiology
have been developed; and the plan is universally
acknowledged to be a proper and logical one.
</p><p>The Sexual Function in Lower Animals. &mdash; Then if
we wish to ascertain, with certainty, the true function
of the reproductive organs in man, we must pursue the
course above indicated; in other words, study the
function of reproduction in lower animals. We say
<hi rend="italic">lower animals</hi>, because man is really an animal, a member
of the great animal kingdom, though not a beast, &mdash; at
<pb n="459"/>
least, he should not be a beast, though some animals in
human form approach very closely to the line that
separates humanity from brutes. We are brought, then,
for a solution of this problem, to a consideration of the
question, What is the object of the reproductive act in
those members of the animal kingdom just below man in
the scale of being? Let science tell us; for zoologists
have made a careful study of this subject for centuries.
</p><p>We quote the following paragraphs from one of the
most distinguished and reliable of modern physiologists,[29]
the facts which he states being confirmed by all other
physiologists: &mdash;


[29] Dalton.

</p><p>"Every living being has a definite term of life,
through which it passes by the operation of an invariable
law, and which, at some regularly appointed time, comes
to an end. . . . But while individual organisms are
thus constantly perishing and disappearing from the
stage, the particular kind, or species, remains in
existence. . . . This process, by which new organisms
make their appearance to take the place of those which
are destroyed, is known as the process of <hi rend="italic">reproduction</hi>, or
<hi rend="italic">generation</hi>.
</p><p>"The ovaries, as well as the eggs which they contain,
undergo, at particular seasons, a periodical development,
or increase in growth. . . . At the approach of the generative
season, in all the lower animals, a certain number
of the eggs, which were previously in an imperfect and
inactive condition, begin to increase in size, and become
somewhat altered in structure."
</p><p>"In most fish and reptiles, as well as in birds, this
regular process of maturation and discharge of eggs takes
<pb n="460"/>
place but once in a year. In different species of
quadrupeds, it may take place annually, semi-annually, bi-monthly, or even monthly; but in every instance, it
recurs at regular intervals, and exhibits accordingly, in a
marked degree, the periodic character which we have
seen to belong to most of the other vital phenomena."
</p><p>Periodical Reproduction. &mdash; "In most of the lower
orders of animals there is a periodical development of the
testicles in the male, corresponding in time with that of
the ovaries in the female. As the ovaries enlarge, and the
eggs ripen in the one sex, so in the other the testicles
increase in size, as the season of reproduction approaches,
and become turgid with spermatozoa. The accessory
organs of generation, at the same time, share the unusual
activity of the testicles, and become increased in vascularity,
and ready to perform their part in the reproductive
function."
</p><p>"Each of the two sexes is then at the same time
under the influence of a corresponding excitement. The
unusual development of the genital organs reacts upon the
entire system, and produces a state of peculiar activity
and excitability, known as the condition of `erethism.' "
</p><p>A Lesson from Instinct. &mdash; "It is a remarkable fact,
in this connection, that the female of these animals will
allow the approaches of the male only during and immediately
after the &oelig;stral period; that is, just when the egg
is recently discharged, and ready for impregnation. At
other times, when sexual intercourse would be necessarily
fruitless, the instinct of the animal leads her to avoid it;
and the concourse of the sexes is accordingly made to
correspond in time with the maturity of the egg and its
aptitude for fecundation."
<pb n="461"/>
</p><p>"The egg, immediately upon its discharge from the
ovary, is ready for impregnation. If sexual intercourse
happens to take place about that time, the egg and the
spermatic fluid meet in some part of the female generative
passages, and fecundation is accomplished. . . . If, on
the other hand, coitus does not take place, the egg passes
down to the uterus unimpregnated, loses its vitality
after a short time, and is finally carried away with the
uterine secretions."
</p><p>"It is easily understood, therefore, why sexual
intercourse should be more liable to be followed by pregnancy
when it occurs about the menstrual epoch than at other
times. . . . Before its discharge, the egg is immature,
and unprepared for impregnation; and after the menstrual
period has passed, it gradually loses its freshness and
vitality."
</p><p>The law of periodicity, as it affects the sexual
activity of males of the human species, is indicated in
the following remarks by the same author: &mdash;
</p><p>"The same correspondence between the periods of
sexual excitement in the male and female, is visible in
many of the animals [higher mammals], as well as in
fish and reptiles. This is the case in most species which
produce young but once a year, and at a fixed period,
as the deer and the wild hog. In other species, on the
contrary, such as the dog, the rabbit, the guinea-pig,
etc., where several broods of young are produced during
the year, or where, as in the human subject, the generative
epochs of the female recur at short intervals, so that
the particular period of impregnation is comparatively
indefinite, the generative apparatus of the male is almost
always in a state of full development, and is excited to
<pb n="462"/>
action at particular periods, apparently by some influence
derived from the condition of the female."
</p><p>Summary of Important Facts. &mdash; The facts presented
in the foregoing quotations from Dr. Dalton may be
summarized as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>1. The sexual function is for the purpose of producing
new individuals to take the place of those who die,
and thus preserve the species from becoming extinct.
</p><p>2. In the animal kingdom generally, the reproductive
function is <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> a periodical act, dependent upon
the development of the reproductive organs of both the
male and the female at stated periods.
</p><p>3. In those exceptional cases in which the organs of
the male are in a state of constant development, sexual
congress occurs, in lower animals, only at those times
when the periodical development occurs in the female.
</p><p>4. Fecundation of the female element can only take
place about the time of periodical development in the
female.
</p><p>5. The desire for sexual congress naturally exists
in the female only at or immediately after the time of
periodical development.
</p><p>6. The constant development of the sexual organs
in human males is a condition common to all animals in
which development occurs in the female at short intervals,
and is a provision of nature to secure a fruitful union
when the female is in readiness, but not an indication
for constant or frequent use.
</p><p>7. The time of sexual congress is always determined
by the condition and desires of the female.
</p><p>A Hint from Nature. &mdash; An additional fact, as stated
by physiologists, is that, under normal conditions, the
<pb n="463"/>
human female experiences sexual desire immediately
after menstruation more than at any other time. It has,
indeed, been claimed that at this period only does she
experience the true sexual instinct, unless it is abnormally
excited by disease or otherwise.
</p><p>From these facts the following conclusions must
evidently be drawn: &mdash;
</p><p>1. The fact that in all animals but the human
species the act can be performed only when reproduction
is possible, proves that in the animal kingdom in general
the sole object of the function is reproduction. Whether
man is an exception, must be determined from other
considerations.
</p><p>2. The fact that the males of other animals besides man,
in which the sexual organs are in a state of constant
development, do not exercise those organs except for the
purpose of reproduction, is proof of the position that the
constant development in man is not a warrant for their
constant use.
</p><p>3. The general law that the reproductive act is
performed only when desired by the female, is sufficient
ground for supposing that such should be the case with
the human species also.
</p><p>Some Valuable Opinions. &mdash; The opinions of several
writers of note are given in the following quotations: &mdash;
</p><p>"The approach of the sexes is, in its purest
condition, the result of a natural instinct, the end of which
is the reproduction of the species. Still, however, we
are far from saying that this ultimate result is, in any
proportion of cases, the actual thought in the minds of
the parties engaged."
</p><p>"The very lively solicitations which spring from the
<pb n="464"/>
genital sense, have no other end than to insure the
perpetuity of the race."[30]


[30] Dr. Gardner.

</p><p>"Observation fully confirms the views of inductive
philosophy; for it proves to us that coitus, exercised
otherwise than under the inspirations of honest instinct,
is a cause of disease in both sexes, and of danger to the
social order."[31]


[31] Mayer.

</p><p>"It is incredible that the act of bringing men into
life, that act of humanity, without contradiction of the
most importance, should be the one of which there
should have been the least supposed necessity for
regulation, or which has been regulated the least
beneficially."[32]


[32] Dunoyer.

</p><p>"But it may be said that the demands of nature are,
in the married state, not only legal, but should be
physically right. So they are, when our physical life
is right; but it must not be forgotten that few live in a
truly physical rectitude."[33]


[33] Gardner.

</p><p>"Among cattle, the sexes meet by common instinct
and common will; it is reserved for the human animal
to treat the female as a mere victim to his lust."[34]


[34] <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi>.

</p><p>"He is an ill husband that <hi rend="italic">uses his wife as a man
treats a harlot</hi>, having no other end but pleasure:
concerning which our best rule is, that although in this, as
in eating and drinking, there is an appetite to be satisfied,
which cannot be done without pleasing that desire;
yet, since that desire and satisfaction were intended by
nature for other ends, they should never be separated
from those ends."
</p><p>"It is a sad truth that many married persons, think-<pb n="465"/>
ing that the flood-gates of liberty are set wide open,
without measures or restraints (so they sail in the
channel), have felt the final rewards of intemperance
and lust by their unlawful using of lawful permissions.
Only let each of them be temperate, and both of them
modest."[35]


[35] Jeremy Taylor.

</p><p>Says another writer very emphatically, "It is a
common belief that a man and woman, because they are
legally united in marriage, are privileged to the unbridled
exercise of amativeness. This is wrong. Nature, in
the exercise of her laws, recognizes no human enactments,
and is as prompt to punish any infringement of
her laws in those who are legally married, as in those
out of the bonds. Excessive indulgence between the
married produces as great and lasting evil effects as in
the single man or woman, and is nothing more nor less
than legalized prostitution."
</p><p>Results of Excesses. &mdash; The sad results of excessive
indulgences are seen on every hand. Numerous ailments
attributed to overwork, constitutional disease, or
hereditary predisposition, know no other cause and need
no other explanation.
</p><p>Effects upon Husbands. &mdash; No doubt the principal
blame in this matter properly falls upon the husband;
but it cannot be said that he is the greatest sufferer;
however, his punishment is severe enough to clearly
indicate the enormity of the transgression, and to warn
him to a reformation of his habits. The following is a
quotation from an eminent medical authority: &mdash;
</p><p>"But any warning against sexual dangers would be
very incomplete if it did not extend to the excesses so
<pb n="466"/>
often committed by married persons in ignorance of their
ill effects. Too frequent emissions of the lifegiving fluid,
and too frequent excitement of the nervous system, are in
themselves most destructive. The result is the same
within the marriage bond as without it. The married
man who thinks that because he is a married man he
can commit no excess, however often the act of sexual
congress is repeated, will suffer as certainly and as
seriously as the unmarried debauchee who acts on the
same principle in his indulgences, &mdash; perhaps more
certainly, from his very ignorance, and from his not taking
those precautions and following those rules which a
career of vice is apt to teach the sensualist.
</p><p>"Many a man has, until his marriage, lived a most
continent life; so has his wife. As soon as they are
wedded, intercourse is indulged in night after night,
neither party having any idea that these repeated sexual
acts are excesses which the system of neither can
bear, and which, to the man at least, are absolute ruin.
The practice is continued till health is impaired,
sometimes permanently; and when a patient is at last obliged
to seek medical advice, he is thunderstruck at learning
that his sufferings arise from excesses unwittingly
committed. Married people often appear to think that
connection may be repeated as regularly and almost as often
as their meals. Till they are told of the danger, the
idea never enters their heads that they are guilty of
great and almost criminal excess; nor is this to be
wondered at, since the possibility of such a cause of disease
is seldom hinted at by the medical man they consult."
</p><p>"Some go so far as to believe that indulgence may
increase these powers, just as gymnastic exercises aug-<pb n="467"/>
ment the force of the muscles. This is a popular error,
and requires correction. Such patients should be told
that the shock on the system each time connection is
indulged in, is very powerful, and that the expenditure
of seminal fluid must be particularly injurious to organs
previously debilitated. It is by this and similar excesses
that premature old age and complaints of the generative
organs are brought on."
</p><p>"The length to which married people carry excesses
is perfectly astonishing."
</p><p>Consequences of Excess. &mdash; "Since my attention has
been particularly called to this class of ailments, I feel
confident that many of the forms of indigestion, general
ill health, hypochondriasis, etc., so often met with in
adults, depend upon sexual excesses. . . . That
this cause of illness is not more generally acknowledged
and acted on, arises from the natural delicacy which
medical men must feel in putting such questions to their
patients as are necessary to elicit the facts."
</p><p>"It is not the body alone which suffers from excesses
committed in married life. Experience every day
convinces me that much of the languor of mind, confusion
of ideas, and inability to control the thoughts, of which
some married men complain, arise from this cause."[36]


[36] Acton.

</p><p>The debilitating effects of excessive sexual indulgence
arise from two causes; viz., the loss of the seminal fluid,
and the nervous excitement. With reference to the
value of the spermatic fluid, Dr. Gardner remarks: &mdash;
</p><p>"The sperm is the purest extract of the blood. . . .
Nature, in creating it, has intended it not only to
communicate life, but also to nourish the individual life. In
<pb n="468"/>
fact, the re-absorption of the fecundating liquid impresses
upon the entire economy new energy, and a virility
which contributes to the prolongation of life."
</p><p>Another case came under our observation in which
the patient, a man, confessed to having indulged every
night for twenty years. We did not wonder that at
forty he was a complete physical wreck.
</p><p>Continence of Athletes. &mdash; "The moderns who are
training are well aware that sexual indulgence wholly
unfits them for great feats of strength, and the captain
of a boat strictly forbids his crew anything of the sort
just previous to a match. Some trainers have gone so
far as to assure me that they can discover by a man's
style of pulling whether he has committed such a breach
of discipline over night, and have not scrupled to attribute
the occasional loss of matches to this cause."[37]


[37] Acton.

</p><p>A Cause of Throat Disease. &mdash; The disease known as
<hi rend="italic">clergyman's sore throat</hi> is believed by many eminent
physicians to have its chief origin in excessive venery.
It is well known that sexual abuse is a very potent
cause of throat diseases. This view is supported by the
following from the pen of the learned Dr. X. Bourgeois: &mdash;
</p><p>"We ought not, then, to be surprised that the
physiological act, requiring so great an expenditure of
vitality, must be injurious in the highest degree, when
it is reiterated abusively. To engender is to give a
portion of one's life. Does not he who is prodigal of
himself, precipitate his own ruin? A peculiar character
of the diseases which have their origin in venereal
excesses and masturbation is chronicity."
</p><p>"Individual predispositions, acquired or hereditary,
<pb n="469"/>
engender for each a series of peculiar ills. In some, the
debility bears upon the pulmonary organs. Hence result
the dry cough, prolonged hoarseness, stitch in the
side, spitting of blood, and finally phthisis. How many
examples are there of young debauchees who have been
devoured by this cruel disease! . . . It is, of all
the grave maladies, the one which venereal abuses
provoke the most frequently. Portal, Bayle, Louis, say
this distinctly."
</p><p>The author has met a large number of cases which
fully verified the above statements. In fact, in quite a
large proportion of cases suffering from sexual excesses
which have come under his care, some form of throat
ailment has been present.
</p><p>A Cause of Consumption. &mdash; This fatal disease finds a
large share of its victims among those addicted to sexual
excesses, either of an illicit nature or within the marriage
pale; for the physical effects are essentially identical.
This cause is especially active and fatal with sedentary
persons, but is sufficiently powerful to undermine the
constitution under the most favorable circumstances, as
the following case illustrates: &mdash;
</p><p>The patient was a young man of twenty-two, large,
muscular, and well developed, having uncommonly broad
shoulders and a full chest. His occupation had been
healthful, that of a laborer. He had had cough for
several months, and was spitting blood. Examination of
the lungs showed that they were hopelessly diseased.
There was no trace of consumption in the family, and
the only cause to which the disease could be attributed
was excessive sexual indulgence, which he confessed to
having practiced for several years.
<pb n="470"/>
</p><p>Prostatic Troubles. &mdash; One of the most distressing
symptoms of advanced age is enlargement of the prostate.
Men who give themselves up to sexual excesses, find
themselves at middle age or even sooner, suffering with
these disorders, even in a very grave form. We have
met a number of instances in which a difficulty of this
kind existed, but disappeared very readily when the
patient corrected his habits by adopting a continent life.
</p><p>Effect on Wives. &mdash; If husbands are great sufferers, as
we have seen, wives suffer still more terribly, being of
feebler constitution, and hence less able to bear the
frequent shock which is suffered by the nervous system.
Dr. Gardner places this evil prominent among the causes
"the result of which we see deplored in the public press
of the day, which warns us that the American race is
fast dying out, and that its place is being filled by
emigrants of different lineage, religion, political ideas, and
education."
</p><p>The same author remarks further on the results of
this with other causes which largely grow out of it: &mdash;
</p><p>"It has been a matter of common observation that
the physical status of the women of Christendom has
been gradually deteriorating; that their mental energies
were uncertain and spasmodic; that they were prematurely
care-worn, wrinkled, and enervated; that they
became subject to a host of diseases scarcely ever know
to the professional men of past times, but now familiar
to, and the common talk of, the matrons, and often,
indeed, of the youngest females in the community."
</p><p>So prevalent are these maladies that Michelet says
with truth that the present is the "age of womb diseases."
<pb n="471"/>
</p><p>An Illustrative Case. &mdash; Every physician of observation
and experience has met many cases illustrative of the
serious effects of the evil named. Many years ago, when
the author was acting as assistant in a large dispensary in
an Eastern city, a young woman applied for examination
and treatment. She presented a great variety of nervous
symptoms, prominent among which were those of mild
hysteria and nervous exhaustion, together with impaired
digestion and violent palpitation of the heart. In our
inquiries respecting the cause of these difficulties, we
learned that she had been married about six months. A
little careful questioning elicited the fact that sexual
indulgence was invariably practiced every night, and often
two or three times, occasionally as many as four times a
night.
</p><p>We had the key to her troubles at once, and ordered
entire continence for a month. From her subsequent
reports I learned that her husband would not allow her
to comply with the request, but that indulgence was
much less frequent than before. The result was not all
that could be desired, but there was marked improvement.
If the husband had been willing to "do right,"
entire recovery would have taken place with rapidity.
</p><p>Thousands of unfortunate wives are constantly under
the doctor's care for the treatment of local ailments
which have their sole origin in sexual excesses for which
their husbands are responsible. It is not overstating
the matter when we say that we have met hundreds of
cases of this sort, and scores of times have we been
requested by suffering wives to appeal to their husbands
in their behalf.
</p><p>Something for Husbands to Consider. &mdash; We take
<pb n="472"/>
pleasure in quoting the following remarks from an address
of the eminent Prof. T. Parvin, M. D., of Jefferson
Medical College, Philadelphia: &mdash;
</p><p>"In woman, love throbs in every pulse, thrills in
every nerve and fiber of her being; her life is love. She
gives herself to the one she truly loves. If you find out
the history of poor seduced girls, those who, as is so
commonly said, loved not wisely but too well, you will find
that in almost all cases they yielded to the seducer in
no paroxysm of sensual passion, but because they loved
and trusted with their whole heart; they fell because
they sought not their own, but the gratification of
another. I do not believe one bride in a hundred, of
delicate, educated, sensitive women, accepts matrimony from
any desire of sexual gratification; when she thinks of
this at all, it is with shrinking, rather than with desire.
Happy that union in which the husband understands the
womanly nature.
</p><p>"On the other hand, how many women are made
wretched by the husband who thinks the highest end of
marriage is copulation, and that his wife ought to be
equally amorous with himself.
</p><p>"It is a mistake to suppose that the kindness, the
kiss, and the loving embrace of the wife are, in general,
the expression of sexual desire. The following was the
exclamation, to me, of a most refined and cultivated
lady, the mother of five children, and who dearly loved
her husband: `How often we wives would caress our
husbands if we did not know the inevitable consequences!'
I know that I am right as to the womanly
nature, and I know that if men generally thus believed,
there would be less licentiousness, purer and happier
<pb n="473"/>
wedded life, and healthier women; for how many women
are rendered miserable, both morally and physically, by
the sexual excesses and brutalities of husbands!
</p><p>In confirmation of these statements we quote the
following from an author whose name frequently appears
in this work, the eminent Dr. Acton: &mdash;
</p><p>"I have taken pains to obtain and compare abundant
evidence on this subject, and the result of my
inquiries I may briefly epitomize as follows: I should
say that the majority of women, happily for them, are
not very much troubled with sexual feeling of any kind.
What men are habitually, women are only exceptionally.
I admit, of course, the existence of sexual excitement,
terminating even in nymphomania, a form of insanity
that those accustomed to visit lunatic asylums must be
fully conversant with; but, with these sad exceptions,
there can be no doubt that sexual feeling in the female
is, in the majority of cases, in abeyance, and that it
requires positive and considerable excitement to be roused
at all; and even if roused, which in many instances it
never can be, is very moderate compared with that of
the male.
</p><p>"Many men, and particularly young men, form their
ideas of women's feelings from what they notice early
in life among loose, or at least low and vulgar women.
There is always a certain number of females who,
though not ostensibly prostitutes, make a kind of trade
of a pretty face. They are fond of admiration; they
like to attract the attention of those immediately around
them. Any susceptible boy is easily led to believe,
whether he is not altogether overcome by the siren
or not, that she, and hence all women, must have at least
<pb n="474"/>
as strong passions as himself. Such women, however,
give a very false idea of the condition of sexual feeling
in general. Association with the loose women of London
streets, in casinos and other immoral haunts, who, if
they have not sexual feeling, counterfeit it so well that
the novice does not suspect but that it is genuine, all
seem to corroborate such an impression.
</p><p>"Married men, medical men, or married women
themselves, would, if appealed to, tell a different tale,
and vindicate female nature from the vile aspersions cast
on it by the abandoned conduct and ungoverned lust of
a few of its worst examples. There are many females
who never feel any excitement whatever. Others,
again, immediately after each period, do become, to a
limited degree, capable of experiencing it; but this
capacity is only temporary, and will cease entirely until
the next menstrual period. The best mothers, wives,
and managers of households know little or nothing
of sexual indulgences. Love of home, of children,
of domestic duties, are the only passions they feel. As
a general rule, a modest woman seldom desires any
sexual gratification for herself. She submits to her
husband, but only to please him; and but for the desire
of maternity, would far rather be relieved from his
attention."
</p><p>The Greatest Cause of Uterine Disease. &mdash; Dr. J. R.
Black remarks as follows on this subject: &mdash;
</p><p>"Medical writers agree that one of the most
common causes of the many forms of derangement to which
woman is subject consists in excessive cohabitation.
The diseases known as menorrhagia, dysmenorrh&oelig;a,
leucorrh&oelig;a, amenorrh&oelig;a, abortions, prolapsus, chronic
<pb n="475"/>
inflammations and ulcerations of the womb, with a yet
greater variety of sympathetic nervous disorders, are
some of the distressing forms of these derangements.
The popular way of accounting for many of these ills is
that they come from colds or from straining lifts. But
if colds and great strain upon the parts in question
develop such diseases, why are they not seen among the
inferior animals? The climatic alternations they endure, the
severe labor some of them are obliged to perform, ought
to cause their ruin; or else, in popular phrase, `make
them catch their death o' cold.' "
</p><p>Legalized Murder. &mdash; A medical writer of considerable
ability presents the following picture, the counterpart of
which almost any one can recall as having occurred
within the circle of his acquaintance; perhaps numerous
cases will be recalled by one who has been especially
observing: &mdash;
</p><p>"A man of great vital force is united to a woman of
evenly-balanced organization. The husband, in the
exercise of what he is pleased to term his `marital rights,'
places his wife, in a short time, on the nervous,
delicate, sickly list. In the blindness and ignorance of
his animal nature, he requires prompt obedience to his
desires; and, ignorant of the law of right in this
direction, thinking that it is her duty to accede to his
wishes, though fulfilling them with a sore and troubled
heart, she allows him passively, never lovingly, to
exercise daily and weekly, month in and month out, the low
and beastly of his nature, and eventually, slowly but
surely, to kill her. And this man, who has as surely
committed murder as has the convicted assassin, lures
to his net and takes unto himself another wife, to repeat
<pb n="476"/>
the same program of legalized prostitution on his part,
and sickness and premature death on her part."
</p><p>Prof. Gerrish, in a little work from which we take
the liberty to quote, speaks as follows on this subject: &mdash;
</p><p>"One man, reckless of his duty to the community,
marries young, with means and prospects inadequate to
support the family which is so sure to come ere long.
His ostensible excuse is love; his real reason, the
gratification of his carnal instincts. Another man, in exactly
similar circumstances, but too conscientious to assume
responsibilities which he cannot carry, and in which
failure must compromise the comfort and tax the purses
of people from whom he has no right to extort luxuries,
forbears to marry; but, feeling the passions of his sex,
and being imbued with the prevalent errors on such
matters, resorts for relief to unlawful coition. At the
wedding of the former, pious friends assemble with their
presents and congratulations, and bid the legalized
prostitution God-speed. Love shields the crime, all the more
easily because so many of the rejoicing guests have
sinned in precisely the same way. The other man has
no festival gathering. . . . Society applauds the first and
frowns on the second; but, to my mind, the difference
between them is not markedly in favor of the former."
</p><p>"We hear a good deal said about certain crimes
against nature, such as pederasty and sodomy, and they
meet with the indignant condemnation of all right-minded persons. The statutes are especially severe on
offenders of this class, the penalty being imprisonment
between one and ten years, whereas fornication is
punished by imprisonment for not more than sixty days
and a fine of less than one hundred dollars. But the
<pb n="477"/>
query very pertinently arises just here as to whether
the use of the condom and defertilizing injections is not
equally a crime against nature, and quite as worthy of
our detestation and contempt. And, further, when we
consider the brute creation, and see that they, guided
by instinct, copulate only when the female is in proper
physiological condition and yields a willing consent, it
may be suggested that congress between men and
women may, in certain circumstances, be a crime against
nature, and one far worse in its results than any other.
Is it probable that a child born of a connection to which
the woman objects, will possess that felicitous organization
which every parent should earnestly desire and
endeavor to bestow on his offspring? Can the unwelcome
fruit of a rape be considered, what every child has a right
to be, a pledge of affection? Poor little Pip, in `Great
Expectations,' spoke as the representative of a numerous
class when he said, `I was always treated as if I had
insisted on being born, in opposition to the dictates of
reason, religion, and morality, and against the dissuading
arguments of my best friends.' We enjoin the young to
honor father and mother, never thinking how undeserving
of respect are those whose children suffer from inherited
ills, the result of the selfishness and carelessness of their
parents in begetting them.
</p><p>Accidental Pregnancies. &mdash; "These accidental pregnancies
are the great immediate cause of the enormously
common crime of abortion, concerning which the morals
of the people are amazingly blunted. The extent of the
practice may be roughly estimated by the number of
standing advertisements in the family newspapers, in
which feticide is warranted safe and secret. It is not
<pb n="478"/>
the poor only who take advantage of such nefarious
opportunities; but the rich shamelessly patronize these
professional and cowardly murderers of defenseless
infancy. Madame Restell, who died by her own hand in
New York, left a fortune of a million dollars, which she
had accumulated by producing abortions."
</p><p>A husband who has not sunk in his carnality too far
below the brute creation will certainly pause a moment,
in the face of such terrible facts, before he continues his
sensual, selfish, murderous course.
</p><p>Indulgence during Menstruation. &mdash; The following
remarks which our own professional experience has
several times confirmed, reveal a still more heinous violation
of nature's laws: &mdash;
</p><p>"To many it may seem that it is unnecessary to
caution against contracting relationships at the period of
the monthly flow, thinking that the instinctive laws of
cleanliness and delicacy were sufficient to refrain the
indulgence of the appetites; but they are little cognizant
of the true condition of things in this world. Often have
I had husbands inform me that they had not missed
having sexual relations with their wives once or more
times a day for several years; and scores of women with
delicate frames and broken-down health have revealed
to me similar facts, and I have been compelled to make
personal appeals to the husbands."[38]


[38] Gardner.

</p><p>The following is an important testimony by an
eminent physician[39] upon the same point: &mdash;


[39] Dr J. R. Black.

</p><p>"Females whose health is in a weak state . . . become
liable, in transgressing this law, to an infectious
disorder, which, it is commonly supposed, can only
<pb n="479"/>
originate or prevail among disreputable characters; but
Dr. Bumstead and a number of other eminent authorities
believe and teach that gonorrh&oelig;a may originate among
women entirely virtuous in the ordinary sense of the
term. That excessive venery is the chief cause that
originates this peculiar form of inflammation, has long
been the settled opinion of medical men."
</p><p>It seems scarcely possible that such enormity could
be committed by any human being, at least by civilized
men, and in the face of the injunctions of Moses to the
Jews, to say nothing of the evident indecency of the
act. The Jews still maintain their integrity to the
observance of this command of their ancient lawgiver.
</p><p>"Reason and experience both show that sexual
relations at the menstrual period are very dangerous to both
man and woman, and perhaps also for the offspring,
should there chance to be conception."[40]


[40] Mayer.

</p><p>The woman suffers from the congestion and nervous
excitement which occur at the most inopportune moment
possible. Man may suffer physical injury, though there
are no grounds for the assertion of Pliny that the
menstrual blood is so potent for evil that it will, by a mere
touch, rust iron, render a tree sterile, make dogs mad,
etc., or that of Paracelsus that "of it the devil makes
spiders, fleas, caterpillars, and all the other insects that
people the air."
</p><p>Indulgence during menstruation is liable to produce
violent hemorrhage, internal congestion, and even inflammation
in the woman, and in the man an inflammation
of the urethra, identical with gonorrh&oelig;a. One of the
most inveterate cases of catarrhal inflammation of the
<pb n="480"/>
urethra which we have ever met in the treatment of a
large number of cases of this sort, was occasioned in
this way.
</p><p>Effects upon Offspring. &mdash; That those guilty of the
transgression should suffer, seems only just; but that
an innocent being who had no part in the sin, no voice
in the time or manner of its advent into the world, &mdash;
that such an one should suffer equally, if not more
bitterly, with the transgressors themselves, seems anything
but just. But such is nature's inexorable law, that the
iniquities of the parents shall be visited upon the
children; and this fact should be a most powerful influence
to prevent parental transgression, especially in this
direction, in which the dire consequences fall so heavily
and so immediately upon an innocent being.
</p><p>Says Acton, "The ill effects of marital excesses are
not confined to offending parties. No doubt can exist
that many of the obscure cases of sickly children, born
of apparently healthy parents, arise from this cause;
and this is borne out by investigations among animals."
</p><p>Breeders of stock who wish to secure sound progeny,
will not allow the most robust stallion to associate with
mares as many times during the whole season as some
of these salacious human males perform a similar act
within a month. One reason why the offspring suffer is
that the seminal fluid deteriorates very rapidly by
repeated indulgence. The spermatozoa do not have time
to become mature, and progeny resulting from such
immature elements will possess the same deficiency; hence
the hosts of deformed, scrofulous, weazen, and idiotic
children which curse the race, and testify to the sensuality
of their progenitors. Another reason is the phys-<pb n="481"/>
ical and nervous exhaustion which the parents bring
upon themselves, and which totally unfits them to beget
sound, healthy offspring.
</p><p>The effects of this evil may often be traced in a large
family of children, nearly all of whom show traces of
the excesses of their parents. It commonly happens,
too, that such large families are on the hands of poor
men who cannot earn enough to give them sufficient food
and comfortable clothing, with nothing whatever to
provide for their education. The overburdened mother has
her strength totally exhausted by the excessive demands
upon her system incident to child-bearing, so that she is
unable to give her children that culture and training
which all children need. More than likely she feels
that they were forced upon her, and hence she cannot
have for them all that tender sympathy and affection a
mother should feel. The little ones grow up ignorant,
and often vicious; for the want of home care drives
them to the street. Thus does one evil create another.
</p><p>It is certainly a question which deserves some
attention, whether it is not a sin for parents to bring into the
world more children than they can properly care for. If
they can rear and educate three children properly, the
same work would be only half done for six; and there
are already in the world a sufficiency of half-raised
people. From this class of society the ranks of thieves,
drunkards, beggars, vagabonds, and prostitutes are
recruited. Why should it be considered an improper or
immoral thing to limit the number of children according
to the circumstances of the parents? Ought it not to be
considered a crime against childhood and against the
race to do otherwise? It is seriously maintained by a
<pb n="482"/>
number of distinguished persons that man "is in duty
bound to limit the number of his children as well as the
sheep on his farm, the number of each to be according
to the adequacy of his means for their support."
</p><p>Indulgence during Pregnancy. &mdash; Transgressions of
this sort are followed by the worst results of any form
of marital excess. The mother suffers doubly, because
laden with the burden of supporting two lives instead of
one. But the results upon the child are especially
disastrous. During the time when it is receiving its stock
of vitality, while its plastic form is being molded, and
its various organs acquiring that integrity of structure is
which makes up what is called constitutional vigor, &mdash;
during this most critical of all periods in the life of the
new being, its resources are exhausted and its structure
is depraved, and thus constitutional tendencies to disease
are produced, by the unnatural demands made upon
the mother.
</p><p>Effect upon the Character. &mdash; Still another terrible
consequence results from this practice so contrary
to nature. The delicate brain, which is being molded
with the other organs of the body, receives its cast
largely from those mental and nervous sensations and
actions of the mother which are the most intense. One
of the most certain effects of sexual indulgence at this
time is to develop abnormally the sexual instinct in the
child. Here is the key to the origin of much of the
sexual precocity and depravity which curse humanity.
Sensuality is born in the souls of a large share of the
rising generation. What wonder that prostitution
flourishes in spite of Christianity and civil law?
</p><p>It is scarcely necessary to say that all med-<pb n="483"/>
ical testimony concurs in forbidding indulgence during
gestation. The same reasons require its interdiction
during the nursing period. The fact that fecundation
would be impossible during pregnancy, and that during
this period the female, normally, has no sexual desire,
are other powerful arguments in favor of perfect
continence at this time.
</p><p>We quote the following from a work on health by
Dr. J. R. Black: &mdash;
</p><p>"Coition during pregnancy is one of the ways
in which the predisposition is laid for that terrible
disease in children, epilepsy. The natural excitement
of the nervous system in the mother by such a cause
cannot operate otherwise than by inflicting injury upon
the tender germ in the womb. This germ, it must be
remembered, derives every quality it possesses from
the parents, as well as every particle of matter of which
it is composed. The old notion of anything like
spontaneity in the development of the qualities of a new
being, is at variance with all the latest facts and
inductions concerning reproduction. And so is that of a
creative fiat. The smallest organic cell, as well as the
most complicated organism, in form and quality, is
wholly dependent upon the laws of derivation.
</p><p>"These laws are competent to explain, however
subtle the ultimate process may be, the great diversities
of human organization and character. Impressions from
without, the emotions, conduct, and play of the organic
processes within, are never alike from day to day, or from
hour to hour; and it is from the aggregate of these in
the parents, but especially of those in the mother
immediately before and after conception, that the quality of
<pb n="484"/>
the offspring is determined. Suppose, then, that there
is every now and then an unnatural, excited, and
exhausted state of the nervous system produced in the
mother by excessive cohabitation, is it any wonder that
the child's nervous system, which derives its qualities
from those of its parents, should take its peculiar stamp
from that of the parent in whom it lives, moves, and has
its being?
</p><p>"In the adult, epilepsy is frequently developed by
excessive venery; and the child born with such a
predisposition will be exceedingly liable to the disease
during its early years, when the nervous system is
notoriously prone to deranged action from very slight
disturbing causes.
</p><p>"The infringement of this law regulating intercourse
during pregnancy also reacts injuriously upon the
mental capacity of the child, tending to give it a stupid,
animalized look, and, there is also good reason to
believe, aids in developing the idiotic condition."
</p><p>Other Limitations. &mdash; Sexual indulgences ought not
to occur after abortion, miscarriage, or labor at full term.
Dr. Parvin reports the following case: &mdash;
</p><p>"A friend in the Philadelphia legal profession has
told me of his procuring a divorce within two years, for
a wife, on account of her husband's cruelty, and a part
of that cruelty was the driving of the nurse out of his
wife's room three days after her confinement, in order
that he might have intercourse with his wife."
</p><p>A Selfish Objection. &mdash; The married man will raise the
plea that indulgence is to him a necessity. He has only
to practice the principles laid down for the maintenance
of continence to entirely remove any such necessity,
<pb n="485"/>
should there be the slightest semblance of a real
demand. Again, what many mistake for an indication of
the necessity for indulgence, to relieve an accumulation
of semen, is in fact, to state the exact truth, but a call
of nature for a movement of the bowels. How this may
occur, has already been explained, as being due to the
pressure of the distended rectum upon the internal
organs of generation situated at the base of the bladder.
It is for this reason, chiefly, that a good share of sexual
excesses occur in the morning.
</p><p>But, aside from all other considerations, is it not the
most supreme selfishness for a man to consider only
himself in his sexual relations, making his wife wholly
subservient to his own desires? As a learned professor
remarks, in speaking of woman, "Who has a right to
regard her as a therapeutic agent?"
</p><p>Brutes and Savages more Considerate. &mdash; It is only
the civilized, Christianized (?) male human being who
complains of the restraint imposed upon him by the
laws of nature. The untutored barbarian, even some
of the lowest of those who wear the human form,
together with nearly all the various classes of lower
animals, abstain from sexual indulgence during
pregnancy. The natives of the Gold Coast and many other
African tribes regard it as a shameful offense to cohabit
during gestation. In the case of lower animals, even
when the male desires indulgence, the female resents
any attempt of the sort by the most vigorous resistance.
</p><p>Are not these wholesome lessons for that portion of
the human race which professes to represent the
accumulated wisdom, intelligence, and refinement of the
world? Those who need reproof on this point may re-<pb n="486"/>
flect that by a continuance of the evil practice they are
placing themselves on a plane even below the uncouth
negro who haunts the jungles of Southern Africa.
</p><p>We quote the following from the pen of a talented
professor in a well-known medical college: &mdash;
</p><p>"I believe we cannot too strenuously insist upon this
point, &mdash; that sexual intercourse should never be undertaken
with any other object than procreation, and never
then unless the conditions are favorable to the production
of a new being who will be likely to have cause to
thankfully bless his parents for the gift of life. If this
rule were generally observed, we should have no broken-nosed Tristram Shandys complaining of the carelessness
of their fathers in begetting them."[41]


[41] Dr. Gerrish.

</p><p>What may be Done? &mdash; But what is the practical
conclusion to be drawn from all the foregoing? What
<hi rend="italic">should</hi> people do? what <hi rend="italic">may</hi> they
do? Dr. Gardner
offers the following remarks, which partially answer the
questions: &mdash;
</p><p>"We have shown that we can `DO RIGHT' without
prejudice to health by the exercise of continence. Self-restraint, the ruling of the passions, is a virtue, and is
within the power of all well-regulated minds. Nor is
this necessarily perpetual or absolute. The passions
may be restrained within proper limitations. He who
indulges in lascivious thoughts may stimulate himself to
frenzy; but if his mind were under proper control, he
would find other employment for it, and his body,
obedient to its potent sway, would not become the master
of the man."
</p><p>What are the "proper limitations," every person
<pb n="487"/>
must decide for himself in view of the facts which have
been presented. If he find that the animal in his nature
is too strong to allow him to comply with what seems to
be the requirements of natural law, let him approximate
as nearly to the right as possible. "Let every man be
fully persuaded in his own mind," and act accordingly,
not forgetting that this is a matter with serious moral
bearings, and hence one in which conscience should be
on the alert. It is of no use to reject truth because it is
unpalatable. There can be nothing worse for a man
than to "know the truth and do it not."
</p><p>It is but fair to say that there is a wide diversity of
opinion among medical men on this subject. A very few
hold that the sexual act should never be indulged except
for the purpose of reproduction, and then only at periods
when reproduction will be possible. Others, while
equally opposed to the excesses, the effects of which
have been described, limit indulgence to the number of
months in the year.
</p><p>Read, reflect, weigh well the matter, then fix upon a
plan of action, and if it be in accordance with the dictates
of better judgment, do not swerve from it.
</p><p>If the suggestion made near the outset of these
remarks, in comparing the reproductive function in man
and animals, &mdash; that the seasons of sexual approach
should be governed by the inclination of the female, &mdash;
were conscientiously followed, it would undoubtedly do
away with at least three-fourths of the excesses which
have been under consideration. Before rejecting the
hint so plainly offered by nature, let every man consider
for a moment whether he has any other than purely
selfish arguments to produce against it.
<pb n="488"/>
</p><p>Early Moderation. &mdash; The time of all others when
moderation is most imperatively demanded, yet least
likely to be practiced, is at the beginning of matrimonial
life. Many a woman dates the beginning of a life of
suffering from the first night after marriage; and the
mental suffering from the disgusting and even horrible
recollections of that night, the events of which were
scarred upon her mind as well as upon her body, have
made her wretched both mentally and bodily.
</p><p>A learned French writer, in referring to this subject,
says, "The husband who begins with his wife by a rape,
is a lost man. He will never be loved."
</p><p>Cases have come under our care of young wives who
have required months of careful treatment to repair the
damage inflicted on their wedding night. A medical
writer has reported a case in which he was called upon
to testify in a suit for divorce, which is an illustration
of so gross a degree of sensuality that the perpetrator
certainly deserved most severe punishment. The victim,
a beautiful and accomplished young lady, to please her
parents, was married to a man much older than herself,
riches being the chief attraction. She at once began to
pine, and in a very few months was a complete wreck.
Emaciated, spiritless, haggard, she was scarcely a shadow
of her former self. The physician who was called in,
upon making a local examination, found those delicate
organs in a state of most terrible laceration and
inflammation. The bladder, rectum, and other adjacent organs,
were highly inflamed, and sensitive in the highest
degree. Upon inquiring respecting the cause, he found
that from the initial night she had been subjected to the
most excessive demands by her husband, "day and
<pb n="489"/>
night." The tortures she had undergone had been terrific;
and her mind trembled upon the verge of insanity.
She entered suit for divorce on the charge of cruelty,
but was defeated, the judge ruling that the law has no
jurisdiction in matters of that sort.
</p><p>In another somewhat similar case that came to our
knowledge, a young wife was delivered from the lecherous
assaults of her husband &mdash; for they were no better &mdash;
by the common sense of her neighbor friends, who gathered
in force, and insisted upon their discontinuance.
It is only now and then that cases of this sort come to
the surface. The majority of them are hidden deep
down in the heart of the poor, heart-broken wife, and too
often they are hidden along with the victim in an early
grave.
</p><p>Prevention of Conception. &mdash; The evil considered
in the preceding pages is by far the greatest cause of
those which will be dwelt upon here. Excesses are
habitually practiced through ignorance or carelessness
of their direct results; and then to prevent the legitimate
result of the reproductive act, innumerable devices
are employed to render it fruitless. To even mention
all of these would be too great a breach of propriety,
even in this plain-spoken work; but accurate description
is unnecessary, since those who need this warning are
perfectly familiar with all the foul accessories of evil
thus employed. We cannot do better than to quote
from the writings of several of the most eminent authors
upon this subject. The following paragraphs are from
the distinguished Mayer, who has been already frequently
quoted: &mdash;
</p><p>"The numerous stratagems invented by debauch to
<pb n="490"/>
annihilate the natural consequences of coition, have all
the same end in view."
</p><p>Conjugal Onanism. &mdash; "The soiling of the conjugal
bed by the shameful maneuvers to which we have made
allusion, is mentioned for the first time in Gen. 38:6,
and following verses: `And it came to pass, when he
[Onan] went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled
it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his
brother. And the thing which he did displeased the
Lord; wherefore he slew him.'
</p><p>"Hence the name, <hi rend="italic">congugal Onanism</hi>.
</p><p>"One cannot tell to what great extent this vice is
practiced, except by observing its consequences, even
among people who fear to commit the slightest sin, to
such a degree is the public conscience perverted upon
this point. Still, many husbands know that nature often
succeeds in rendering nugatory the most subtle calculations,
and reconquers the rights which they have striven
to frustrate. No matter; they persevere, none the less,
and by the force of habit they poison the most blissful
moments of life, with no surety of averting the result
that they fear. So, who knows if the infants, too often
feeble and weazen, are not the fruit of these in
themselves incomplete <hi rend="italic">procreations</hi>, and disturbed by
preoccupations foreign to the generic act? Is it not reasonable
to suppose that the creative power, not meeting in
its disturbed functions the conditions necessary for the
elaboration of a normal product, the conception might be
from its origin imperfect, and the being which proceeded
therefrom, one of those monsters which are described in
treatises on teratology?"
</p><p>"Let us see, now, what are the consequences to
those given to this practice of conjugal Onanism.
<pb n="491"/>
</p><p>"We have at our disposition numerous facts which
rigorously prove the disastrous influence of abnormal
coitus to the woman, but we think it useless to publish
them. All practitioners have more or less observed them,
and it will only be necessary for them to call upon
their memories to supply what our silence leaves
`However, it is not difficult to conceive,' says Dr.
Francis Devay, `the degree of perturbation that a like
practice should exert upon the genital system of woman
by provoking desires which are not gratified. A
profound stimulation is felt through the entire apparatus;
the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries enter into a
state of orgasm, a storm which is not appeased by the
natural crisis; a nervous superexcitation persists.
There occurs, then, what would take place if, presenting
food to a famished man, one should snatch it from his
mouth after having thus violently excited his appetite.
The sensibilities of the womb and the entire reproductive
system are teased for no purpose. It is to this
cause, too often repeated, that we should attribute the
multiple neuroses, those strange affections which
originate in the genital system of woman. Our conviction
respecting them is based upon a great number of
observations. Furthermore, the normal relations existing
between the married couple undergo unfortunate
changes; this affection, founded upon reciprocal esteem,
is little by little effaced by the repetition of an act
which pollutes the marriage bed; from thence proceed
certain hard feelings, certain deep impressions which,
gradually growing, eventuate in the scandalous ruptures
of which the community rarely know the real motive.'
</p><p>"If the good harmony of families and their reciprocal
<pb n="492"/>
relations are seriously menaced by the invasion of these
detestable practices, the health of women, as we have
already intimated, is fearfully injured. A great number
of neuralgias appear to us to have no other cause.
Many women that we have interrogated on this matter
have fortified this opinion. But that which to us has
passed to the condition of incontestable proof, is the
prevalence of uterine troubles, of enervation among the
married, hysterical symptoms which are met with in the
conjugal relation as often as among young virgins, arising
from the vicious habits of the husbands in their conjugal
intercourse. . . . Still more, there is a graver affection,
which is daily increasing, and which, if nothing arrests
its invasion, will soon have attained the proportions of a
scourge; we speak of the degeneration of the womb.
We do not hesitate to place in the foremost rank, among
the causes of this redoubtable disease, the refinements of
civilization, and especially the artifices introduced in our
day in the generic act. When there is no procreation,
although the procreative faculties are excited, we see
these pseudo-morphoses arise. Thus it is noticed that
polypi and schirrus [cancer] of the womb are common
among prostitutes."
</p><p>"We may, we trust, be pardoned for remarking upon
the artifices imagined to prevent fecundation, that there
is in them an immense danger, of incalculable limits.
We do not fear to be contradicted or taxed with
exaggeration in elevating them into the proportions of a true
calamity."
</p><p>The following is from an eminent physician[42] who for
many years devoted his whole attention to the diseases
<pb n="493"/>
of women, and lectured upon the subject in a prominent
medical college: &mdash;


[42] Dr. Gardner.

</p><p>"It is undeniable that all the methods employed to
prevent pregnancy are physically injurious. Some of
these have been characterized with sufficient explicitness,
and the injury resulting from incomplete coitus to both
parties has been made evident to all who are willing to
be convinced. It should require but a moment's consideration
to convince any one of the harmfulness of the
common use of cold ablutions and astringent infusions
and various medicated washes. Simple, and often
wonderfully salutary, as is cold water to a diseased limb
festering with inflammation, yet few are rash enough to
cover a gouty toe, rheumatic knee, or erysipelatous head
with cold water. . . . Yet, when in the general state
of nervous and physical excitement attendant upon
coitus, when the organs principally engaged in this act
are congested and turgid with blood, do you think you
can with impunity throw a flood of cold or even lukewarm
water far into the vitals in a continual stream?
Often, too, women add strong medicinal agents, intended
to destroy by dissolution the spermatic germs, ere they
have time to fulfill their natural destiny. These powerful
astringents suddenly corrugate, and close the glandular
structure of the parts, and this is followed, necessarily,
by a corresponding reaction, and the final result is
debility and exhaustion, signalized by leucorrh&oelig;a,
prolapsus, and other diseases.
</p><p>"Finally, of the use of intermediate tegumentary
coverings, made of thin rubber or gold-beater's skin, and
so often relied upon as absolute preventives, Madame de
Stael is reputed to have said, `They are cobwebs for
<pb n="494"/>
protection, and bulwarks against love.' Their employment
certainly must produce a feeling of shame and disgust
utterly destructive of the true delight of pure hearts
and refined sensibilities. They are suggestive of
licentiousness and the brothel, and their employment degrades
to bestiality the true feelings of manhood and the holy
state of matrimony. Neither do they give, except in a
very limited degree, the protection desired. Furthermore,
they produce (as alleged by the best modern
French writers, who are more familiar with the effect of
their use than we are in the United States) certain
physical lesions from their irritating presence as foreign
bodies, and also from the chemicals employed in their
fabrication, and other effects inseparable from their
employment, ofttimes of a really serious nature.
</p><p>"I will not further enlarge upon these instrumentalities.
Sufficient has been said to convince any one that
to trifle with the grand functions of our organism, to
attempt to deceive and thwart nature in her highly
ordained prerogatives, no matter how simple seem to be
the means employed, is to incur a heavy responsibility
and run a fearful risk. It matters little whether a
railroad train is thrown from the track by a frozen drop of
rain or a huge bowlder lying in the way; the result is
the same, the injuries as great. Moral degradation,
physical disability, premature exhaustion and decrepitude,
are the result of these physical frauds, and force
upon our conviction the adage, which the history of
every day confirms, that `honesty is the best policy.' "
</p><p>"Male Continence." &mdash; A peculiar method known as
"male continence" is practiced by the members of the
Oneida Community, which is thus described by Mr.
Noyes, the founder of the society &mdash;
<pb n="495"/>
</p><p>"The exact thing that our theory does propose, is to
take that same power of moral restraint which Paul,
Malthus, the Shakers, and all considerate men, use in
one way or another to limit propagation, and instead of
applying it, as they do, to the prevention of the intercourse
of the sexes, introduce it at another stage of the
proceedings; viz., after the sexes have come together in
social effusion, and before they have reached the propagative
crisis, thus allowing them all, and more than all,
the ordinary freedom of love (since the crisis always
interrupts the romance), and at the same time avoiding
undesired procreation and all the other evils incident to
male incontinence."
</p><p>This abominable practice can be considered as nothing
better than double masturbation. Its terrible results
do not differ much from those of solitary vice. The
following remarks will show what the effects of such a
practice are in the male; the effects upon the female are
precisely the same as those resulting from "conjugal
Onanism," which have been already described: &mdash;
</p><p>"The excited nervous system, if it does not receive
that shock which we have seen attends ejaculation, suffers
a longer and more severe strain, lasting often days
and nights, and one that is repeated over again. In
fact, the non-occurrence of emission after sexual excitement,
permits, for a time, the repetition of the excitement;
but ultimately a collapse takes place from which
it is very difficult to rally a patient. . . . These
practices, unnatural in the highest degree, cannot be
carried on with impunity. Nature is sure, sooner or
later, to inflict a severe retaliation.[43]


[43] Acton.

<pb n="496"/>
</p><p>Shaker Views. &mdash; The Shakers do not, as many suppose,
believe wholly in celibacy. They believe in marriage
and reproduction regulated by the natural law.
They, also, would limit population, but not by interfering
with nature; rather, by following nature's indications to
the very letter. They believe "that no animals should
use their reproductive powers and organs for any other
than the simple purpose of procreation." Recognizing
the fact that this is the law among lower animals, they
insist upon applying it to man. Thus they find no
necessity for the employment of those abominable
contrivances so common among those who disregard the
laws of nature. Who will not respect the purity which
must characterize sexual relations so governed?
</p><p>The Oneida Community. &mdash; Such a method for regulating
the number of offspring is in immense contrast
with that of the Oneida Community, which opens the
door for the unstinted gratification of lust, separates the
reproductive act entirely from its original purpose, and
makes it the means of mere selfish, sensual, beastly &mdash;
worse than brutish &mdash; gratification.
</p><p>Those who are acquainted with the history of the
founder of this community, are obliged to look upon him
as a scheming sensualist; who well knows the truth, but
deliberately chooses a course of evil, and beguiles into
his snares others as sensual as himself. The abominations
practiced among the members of the community
which he has founded, are represented by those who have
had an inside view of its workings as too foul to mention.
It seems almost wonderful that Providence does not lay
upon this gigantic brothel his hand of vengeance, as in
ancient times he did upon Sodom, which could hardly
<pb n="497"/>
have been more sunken in infamy than is this den
of licentiousness. It is, indeed, astonishing that it
should be tolerated in the midst of a country which
professes to regard virtue, and respect the marriage
institution.
</p><p>We are glad to note that popular opinion is calling
loudly for the eradication of this foul ulcer. Only a
short time ago a convention of more than fifty ministers
met at Syracuse, N. Y., for the express purpose of
considering ways and means for the removal of this blot
"by legal measures or otherwise." We sincerely wish
them success; and it appears to us that the people in
that vicinity would be justified should they rise <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>,
and purge their community of an evil so heinous, in case
no civil authority can be induced to do the work of
expurgation. Society must either cleanse herself of
these infections plague spots, or she will soon become
too rotten to hold together. We wait with much solicitude
to see which event will occur.
</p><p>Since the above was written, we have learned that
the popular feeling against the founder of this enormous
brothel rose so high that he was obliged to flee to Canada
to escape paying the just penalty for his sins.
</p><p>Moral Bearings of the Question. &mdash; Most of the
considerations presented thus far have been of a physical
character, though occasional references to the moral
aspect of the question have been made. In a certain
sense &mdash; and a true one &mdash; the question is wholly a moral
one; for what moral right have men or women to do
that which will injure the integrity of the physical
organism given them, and for which they are accountable to
their Creator? &mdash; Surely none; for the man who destroys
<pb n="498"/>
himself by degrees, is no less a murderer than he who
cuts his throat or puts a bullet through his brain. The
crime is the same, being the shortening of human life,
whether the injury is done to one's self or to another.
In this matter, there are at least three sufferers; the
husband, the wife, and the offspring, though in most
cases, doubtless, the husband is the one to whom the
sin almost exclusively belongs.
</p><p>Unconsidered Murders. &mdash; But there is a more startling
phase of this moral question. It is not impossible
to show that actual violence is done to a human life.
</p><p>It has been previously shown that in the two
elements, the ovum of the female and the spermatozoon of
the male, are all the elements, in rudimentary form,
which go to make up the "human form divine." Alone,
neither of these elements can become anything more than
it already is; but the instant they come in contact,
fecundation takes place, and the individual life begins.
From that moment until maturity is reached, years
subsequently, the whole process is only one of development.
Nothing absolutely new is added at any subsequent
moment. In view of these facts, it is evident that
at the very instant of conception the embryonic human
being possesses all the right to life it ever can possess.
It is just as much an individual, a distinct human being,
possessed of soul and body, as it ever is, though in a
very immature form. That conception may take place
during the reproductive act, cannot be denied. If, then,
means are employed with a view to prevent conception
immediately after the accomplishment of the act, or
at any subsequent time, if successful, it would be by
destroying the delicate product of the conception which
<pb n="499"/>
had already occurred, and which, as before observed, is
as truly a distinct individual as it can ever become, &mdash;
certainly as independent as at any time previous to birth.
</p><p>Is it immoral to take human life? Is it a sin to
kill a child? Is it a crime to strangle an infant at birth?
Is it a murderous act to destroy a half-formed human
being in its mother's womb? Who will dare to answer
no to one of these questions? Then who can refuse
assent to the plain truth that it is equally a murder to
deprive of life the most recent product of the generative
act?
</p><p>Who can number the myriads of murders that have
been perpetrated at this early period of existence?
Who can estimate the load of guilt that weighs upon
some human souls? Who knows how many brilliant
lights have been thus early extinguished? how many
promising human plantlets thus ruthlessly destroyed in
the very act of germinating? It is to be hoped that in
the final account the extenuating influence of ignorance
may weigh heavily in the scale of justice against the
damning testimony of these "unconsidered murders."
</p><p>The Charge Disputed. &mdash; It will be urged that these
early destructions are not murders. Murder is an awful
word. The act itself is a terrible crime. No wonder
that its personal application should be studiously avoided;
the human being who would not shrink from such a
charge would be unworthy of the name of human &mdash; a
very brute. Nevertheless, it is necessary to look the
plain facts squarely in the face, and shrink not from the
decision of an enlightened conscience. We quote the
following portions of an extract which we give in full
<pb n="500"/>
elsewhere; it is from the same distinguished authority[44]
so frequently quoted: &mdash;



[44] Gardner.

</p><p>"There is, in fact, no moment after conception when
it can be said that the child has not life, and the crime
of destroying human life is as heinous and as sure before
the period of `quickening' has been attained, as afterward.
But you still defend your horrible deed by saying:
`Well, if there be, as you say, this mere animal
life, equivalent at the most to simple vitality, there is
no mind, no soul, destroyed, and therefore there is no
crime committed.' Just so surely as one would destroy
and root out of existence all the fowls in the world
by destroying all the eggs in existence, so certain is it
that you do by your act destroy the animal man in the
egg, and the soul which animates it. . . . Murder is
always sinful, and murder is the willful destruction of a
human being at any period of its existence, from its
earliest germinal embryo to its final, simple, animal
existence in aged decrepitude and complete mental
imbecility."
</p><p>Difficulties. &mdash; Married people will exclaim, "What
shall we do?" Delicate mothers who have already more
children on their hands than they can care for, whose
health is insufficient to longer endure the pains and
burdens of pregnancy, but whose sensual husbands continue
to demand indulgence, will echo in despairing tones,
while acknowledging the truth, "What shall we do?"
We will answer the question for the latter first.
</p><p>Mr. Mill, the distinguished English logician, in his
work on "The Subjection of Woman," thus represents
the erroneous view which is popularly held of the sexual
<pb n="501"/>
relations of the wife to the husband: "The wife,
however brutal a tyrant she may be chained to, &mdash; though she
may know that he hates her, though it may be his daily
pleasure to torture her, and though she may feel it
impossible not to loathe him, &mdash; he can claim from her,
and enforce the lowest degradation of a human being,
that of being made the instrument of an animal function
contrary to her inclinations."
</p><p>Woman's Rights. &mdash; A woman does not, upon the
performance of the marriage ceremony, surrender all her
personal rights. The law recognizes this fact if her
husband beats her, or in any way injures her by physical
force, or even by neglect. Why may she not claim
protection from other maltreatment as well? or, at least,
why may she not refuse to lend herself to beastly lust?
She remains the proprietor of her own body, though
married; and who is so lost to all sense of justice, equity,
and even morality, as to claim that she is under any
moral obligation to allow her body to be abused?
</p><p>"But such a course would lead to separation and
divorce in numerous cases." Who will contend for the
maintenance of a relation which has no other bond than
lust, which views no other object than the gratification
of the animal passions? Were not such a bond better
broken than preserved? and were not such an object
better frustrated than attained? Judge candidly.
</p><p>We have carefully avoided any attempt to point out
the duty of a woman under the circumstances named.
That matter must be left for her to settle with her own
conscience after receiving due information. Some will
not hesitate to urge her to assert and maintain her rights
at all hazard. Should a woman feel in conscience bound
<pb n="502"/>
to do so, it would be the duty of every moral person to
support her; for she has an undoubted moral right,
whether she chooses to exercise it or not.
</p><p>What to Do. &mdash; Now to the question as asked by the
first parties, &mdash; married people who together seek for a
solution of the difficulties arising from an abandonment
of all protectives against fecundation. The true remedy,
and the natural one, is doubtless to be found in the
suggestion made under the heads of "Continence" and
"Marital Excesses." By a course of life in accordance
with the principles there indicated, all these evils and a
thousand more would be avoided. There would be less
sensual enjoyment, but more elevated joy. There would
be less animal love, but more spiritual communion; less
grossness, more purity; less development of the animal,
and a more fruitful soil for the culture of virtue, holiness,
and all the Christian graces.
</p><p>"But such a life would be impossible this side of
heaven." A few who claim to have tried the experiment,
think not. The Shakers claim to practice, as well as
teach, such principles; and with the potent aids to
continence previously specified, it might be found less
difficult in realization than in thought.
</p><p>A Compromise. &mdash; There will be many, the vast
majority, perhaps, who will not bring their minds to accept
the truth which nature seems to teach, which would
confine sexual acts to reproduction wholly. Others,
acknowledging the truth, declare "the spirit willing"
though "the flesh is weak." Such will inquire, "Is
there not some compromise by means of which we may
escape the greater evils of our present mode of life?"
Such may find in the following facts, suggestions for a
<pb n="502"/>
"better way," if not the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> way, though it cannot be
recommended as wholly free from dangers, and though
it cannot be said of it that it is not an <hi rend="italic">unnatural</hi> way: &mdash;
</p><p>"Menstruation in woman indicates an aptitude for
impregnation, and this condition remains for a period of
six or eight days after the entire completion of the flow.
During this time only can most women conceive. Allow
twelve days for the onset of the menses to pass by,
and the probabilities of impregnation are very slight.
This act of continence is healthful moral, and
irreproachable."[45]


[45] Gardner.

</p><p>It should be added to the above that the plan
suggested is not absolutely certain to secure immunity from
conception. The period of abstinence should certainly
extend from the beginning of menstruation to the
fourteenth day. To secure even reasonable safety, it is
necessary to practice further abstinence for three or four
days previous to the beginning of the flow.
</p><p>Many writers make another suggestion, which would
certainly be beneficial to individual health; viz., that
the husband and wife should habitually occupy separate
beds. Such a practice would undoubtedly serve to
keep the sexual instincts in abeyance. Separate apartments,
or at least the separation of the beds by a curtain,
are recommended by some estimable physicians,
who suggest that such a plan would enable both parties
to conduct their morning ablutions with proper thoroughness,
and without sacrificing that natural modesty
which operates so powerfully as a check upon the excessive
indulgence of the passions. Many will think the
suggestion a good one, and will make a practical appli-<pb n="504"/>
cation of it. Sleeping in single beds is reputed to be a
European custom of long standing among the higher
classes.
</p><p>This subject cannot be concluded better than by the
following quotations from an excellent and able work,
entitled, "The Ten Laws of Health"[46]: &mdash;


[46] Black.

</p><p>"The obvious design of the sexual desire is the
reproduction of the species. . . . The gratification of
this passion, or indeed of any other, beyond its legitimate
end, is an undoubted violation of natural law, as may be
determined by the light of nature, and by the resulting
moral and physical evils."
</p><p>"Those creatures not gifted with erring reason but
with unerring instinct, and that have not the liberty of
choice between good and evil, cohabit only at stated
periods, when pleasure and reproduction are alike possible.
It is so ordered among them that the means and
the end are never separated; and as it was the All-wise
Being who endowed them with this instinct, without the
responsibility resulting from the power to act otherwise,
it follows that it is HIS LAW, and must, therefore, be the
true copy for all beings to follow having the same functions
to perform, and for the same end. The mere fact
that men and women have the power and liberty of
conforming or not conforming to this copy, does not set
them free from obedience to a right course, nor from the
consequences of disobedience."
</p><p>"The end of sexual pleasure being to reproduce the
species, it follows, from the considerations just advanced,
that when the sexual function is diverted from its end
(reproduction), or if the means be used when the end is
impossible, harm or injury should ensue."
<pb n="505"/>
</p><p>"Perhaps the number is not small of those who
think there is nothing wrong in an unlimited indulgence
of the sexual propensity during married life. The
marriage vow seems to be taken as equivalent to the
freest license, about which there need be no restraint.
Yet, if there be any truth in the law in reference to the
enjoyment of the means only when the end is possible,
the necessity of the limitation of this indulgence during
married life is clearly as great as for that of any other
sensual pleasure.
</p><p>"A great majority of those constituting the most
highly civilized communities, act upon the belief that
anything not forbidden by sacred or civil law is neither
sinful nor wrong. They have not found cohabitation
during pregnancy forbidden; nor have they ever had
their attention drawn to the injury to health and organic
development which such a practice inflicts. Hence, an
habitual yielding to inclination in this matter has
determined their life-long behavior.
</p><p>"The infringement of this law in the married state
does not produce in the husband any very serious
disorder. Debility, aches, cramps, and a tendency to
epileptic seizures are sometimes seen as the effects of
great excess. An evil of no small account is the steady
growth of the sexual passion by habitual unrestraint. It
is in this way that what is known as libidinous blood is
nursed as well among those who are strictly virtuous,
in the ordinary meaning of the term, as among those
who are promiscuous in their intercourse.
</p><p>"The wife and the offspring are the chief sufferers
by the violation of this law among the married. Why
this is so, may in part be accounted for by the following
<pb n="506"/>
consideration: Among the animal kind it is the female
which decides when the approaches of the male are allowable.
When these are untimely, her instinctive prompting
leads her to resist and protect herself with ferocious
zeal. No one at all acquainted with the remarkable
wisdom nature invariably displays in all her operations,
will doubt that the prohibition of all sexual intercourse
among animals during the period of pregnancy must be
for a wise and good purpose. And if it serves a wise
and good purpose with them, why should an opposite
course not serve an unwise and bad purpose with us?
Our bodies are very much like theirs in structure and in
function; and in the mode and laws that govern reproduction
there is absolutely no difference. The mere
fact that we possess the power to act otherwise than
they do during that period, does not make it right.
</p><p>"Human beings having no instinctive prompting as
to what is right and what is wrong, cohabitation, like
many other points of the behavior, is left for reason or
the will to determine; or, rather, as things now are, to
unreason; for reason is neither consulted nor enlightened
as to what is proper and allowable in the matter.
Nature's rule, by instinct, makes it devolve upon the
female to determine when the approaches of the male
are allowable.
</p><p>"But some may say that she is helpless in the
matter. No one dare to approach her without consent
before marriage; and why should man not be educated
up to the point of doing the same after marriage?
She is neither his slave nor his property; nor does the
tie of marriage bind her to carry out any unnatural
requirement."</p>

<head>INFANTICIDE AND ABORTION.</head>

<p>Few but medical men are aware of the enormous
proportions which have been assumed by these terrible
crimes during the present century. That they are
increasing with fearful rapidity, and have really reached
such a magnitude as to seriously affect the growth of
civilized nations, and to threaten their very existence,
has become a patent fact to observing physicians. The
crime itself differs little in reality from that considered
under the heading, the "Prevention of Conception." It
is, in fact, the same crime postponed till a later period.
</p><p>We quote the following eloquent words on this
subject &mdash;
</p><p>"Of all the sins, physical and moral, against man
and God, I know of none so utterly to be condemned as
the very common one of the destruction of the child
while yet in the womb of the mother. So utterly
repugnant is it that I can scarcely express the loathing
with which I approach the subject! &mdash; murder in cold
blood, without cause, of an unknown child, one's nearest
relative; in fact, part of one's very being, actually
having, not only one's own blood in its being, but that
blood momentarily interchanging! Good God! Does
it seem possible that such depravity can exist in a
parent's breast &mdash; in a mother's heart?
</p><p>" 'Tis for no wrong that it has committed that its
sweet life is so cruelly taken away. Its coming is no
disgrace; its creation was not in sin, but &mdash; its mother
`do n't want to be bothered by any more brats; can
hardly take care of what she had got; is going to
Europe in the spring.'
<pb n="508"/>
</p><p>"We may forgive the poor deluded girl &mdash; seduced,
betrayed, abandoned &mdash; who in her wild frenzy, destroys
the mute evidence of her guilt. We have sympathy
and sorrow for her. But for the married shirk who
disregards her divinely-ordained duty, we have nothing
but contempt, even if she be the lordly woman of
fashion, clothed in purple and fine linen. If glittering
gems adorn her person, within there is foulness and
squalor."[47]


[47] Gardner.

</p><p>Not a Modern Crime. &mdash; Although this crime has
attained remarkable proportions in modern times, it is
not a new one by any means, as the following paragraph
will suffice to show: &mdash;
</p><p>"Infanticide and exposure were also the custom
among the Romans, Medes, Canaanites, Babylonians,
and other Eastern nations, with the exception of the
Israelites and Egyptians. The Scandinavians killed
their offspring from fantasy. The Norwegians, after
having carefully swaddled their children, put some food
into their mouths, placed them under the roots of trees
or under the rocks to preserve them from ferocious
beasts. Infanticide was also permitted among the
Chinese, and we saw, during the last century, vehicles
going round the streets of Pekin daily to collect the
bodies of the dead infants. To-day there exist foundling
hospitals to receive children abandoned by their
parents. The same custom is also observed in Japan,
in the isles of the Southern Ocean, at Otaheite, and
among several savage nations of North America. It is
related of the Jaggers of Guinea, that they devour their
own children."[48]


[48] Burdach.

<pb n="509"/>
</p><p>The Greeks practiced infanticide systematically, their
laws at one time requiring the destruction of crippled or
weakly children. Among all the various nations, the
general object of the crime seems to have been to avoid
the trouble of rearing children, or to avoid a surplus,
objects not far different from those had in view by
persons who practice the same crimes at the present time.
</p><p>The destruction of the child after the mother has
felt its movements, is termed infanticide; before that
time it is commonly known as abortion. It is a modern
notion that the child possesses no soul or individual life
until the period of quickening, &mdash; an error which we have
already sufficiently exposed. The ancients, with just
as much reason, contended that no distinct life was
present until after birth. Hence it was that they could
practice without scruple the crime of infanticide to
prevent too great increase of population. "Plato and
Aristotle were advocates of this practice, and these
Stoics justified this monstrous practice by alleging that
the child only acquired a soul at the moment when it
ceased to have uterine life and commenced to respire.
From hence it resulted that, the child not being
animated, its destruction was no murder."
</p><p>The prevalence of this crime will be indicated
by the following observations from the most reliable
sources: &mdash;
</p><p>"We know that in certain countries abortion is
practiced in a manner almost public, without speaking of
the East, where it has, so to speak, entered into the
manners of the country. We see it in America, in
a great city like New York, constituting a regular
business, and not prevented, where it has enriched more
than one midwife."
<pb n="510"/>
</p><p>"England does not yield to Germany or France in
the frequency of the crime of infanticide."[49]


[49] Jardien.

</p><p>"Any statistics attainable are very incomplete. False
certificates are daily given by attending physicians. Men,
if they are only rich enough, die of `congestion of the
brain,' not `delirium tremens;' and women, similarly
situated, do not die from the effects of abortion, but of
`inflammation of the bowels,' etc."
</p><p>"Infanticide, as it is generally considered (destroying
a child after quickening), is of very rare occurrence in
New York; whereas abortions (destroying the embryo
before quickening) are of daily habit in the families of
the best informed and most religious; among those
abounding in wealth, as well as among the poor and
needy."[50]


[50] Gardner.

</p><p>"Perhaps only medical men will credit the assertion
that the frequency of this form of destroying human life
exceeds all others by at least fifty per cent, and that
not more than one in a thousand of the guilty parties
receive any punishment by the hand of civil law. But
there is a surer mode of punishment for the guilty
mother in the self-executing laws of nature."[51]


[51] Black.

</p><p>"From a very large verbal and written correspondence
in this and other States, I am satisfied that
we have become <hi rend="italic">a nation of murderers</hi>."[52]


[52] Reamy.

</p><p>Said a distinguished clergyman of Brooklyn in a
sermon, "Why send missionaries to India when child-murder is here of daily, almost hourly, occurrence;
aye, when the hand that puts money into the contribution-box to-day, yesterday or a month ago did, or to-morrow will, murder her own unborn offspring?
<pb n="511"/>
</p><p>"The Hindoo mother, when she abandons her babe
upon the sacred Ganges, is, contrary to her heart,
obeying a supposed religious law, and you desire to
convert her to your own worship of the Moloch of
Fashion and Laziness and love of Greed. Out upon
such hypocrisy!"
</p><p>Writers tell us that it has even become the boast
of many women that they "know too much to have
babies."
</p><p>Says the learned Dr. Storer, "Will the time come,
think ye, when husbands can no longer, as they now
frequently do, commit the crime of rape upon their
unwilling wives, and pursuade them or compel them to
allow a still more dreadful violence to be wreaked upon
the children nestling within them, &mdash; children fully alive
from the very moment of conception, that have already
been fully detached from all organic connection with
their parent, and only re-attached to her for the purposes
of nutriment and growth, and to destroy whom `is a
crime of the same nature, both against our Maker and
society, as to destroy an infant, a child, or a man?' "[53]


[53] "Is it I?"

</p><p>Says another well-known author, "Ladies boast to
each other of the impunity with which they have
aborted, as they do of their expenditures, of their dress,
of their success in society. There is a fashion in this,
as in all other female customs, good and bad. The
wretch whose account with the Almighty is heaviest
with guilt, too often becomes a heroine."[54]


[54] "A Woman's Thoughts about Women."

</p><p>Causes of the Crime. &mdash; Many influences may combine
to cause the mother ruthlessly to destroy her helpless
child; as, to conceal the results of sin, to avoid the
<pb n="519"/>
burdens of maternity, to secure ease and freedom to
travel, etc., or even from a false idea that maternity is
vulgar; but it is true, beyond all question, that the
primary cause of the sin is far back of all these
influences. The most unstinted and scathing invectives are
used in characterizing the criminality of a mother who
takes the life of her unborn babe; but a word is seldom
said of the one who forced upon her the circumstances
which gave the unfortunate one existence. Though
doctors, ministers, and moralists have said much on this
subject, and written more, it is reasonable to suppose
that they will never accomplish much of anything in the
direction of reform until they recognize the part the
man acts in all these sad cases, and begin to demand
reform where it is most needed, and where its achievement
will effect the most good. As was observed in
the remarks upon the subject of "Prevention of Conception,"
this evil has its origin in "marital excesses," and
in a disregard of the natural law which makes the female
the sole proprietor of her own body, and gives to her
the right to refuse the approaches of the male when
unprepared to receive them without doing violence to the
laws of her being.
</p><p>The Nature of the Crime. &mdash; "The married and well-to-do, who by means of medicines and operations produce
abortions at early periods of pregnancy, have no
excuse except the pretense that they do not consider it
murder until the child quickens.
</p><p>"No, not murder, you say, for `there has not been
any life in the child.' Do not attempt to evade, even
to man, a crime which cannot be hidden from the
All-seeing. The poor mother has not herself felt the
<pb n="513"/>
life of the child perhaps, but that is a quibble only
of the laws of man, founded indeed upon the views
now universally recognized as incorrect, that the child's
life began when its movements were first strong enough
to be perceptible. There is, in fact, no moment after
conception when it can be said that the child has not
life, and the crime of destroying human life is as heinous
and as sure before the period of `quickening' has been
attained as afterward. But you still defend your horrible
deed by saying, `Well, if there be, as you say, this
mere animal life, equivalent at the most to simple vitality,
there is no mind, no soul destroyed, and therefore,
there is no crime committed.' Just so surely as one
would destroy and root out of existence all the fowls in
the world by destroying all the eggs in existence, so
certain it is that you do by your act destroy the animal
man in the egg, and the soul which animates it. When
is the period that intelligence comes to the infant? Are
its first feeble strugglings any evidence of its presence?
Has it any appreciable quantity at birth? Has it any
valuable, useful quantity even when a year old? When,
then, is it that destruction is harmless or comparatively
sinless? While awaiting your metaphysical answer, I will
tell you when it is sinful. Murder is always sinful, and
murder is the willful destruction of a human being at any
period of its existence, from its earliest germinal embryo
to its final, simple, animal existence in aged decrepitude
and complete mental imbecility."[55]


[55] Gardner.

</p><p>"There are those who would fain make light of this
crime by attempting to convince themselves and others
that a child, while in embryo, has only a sort of vegeta-<pb n="514"/>
tive life, not yet endowed with thought, and the ability
to maintain an independent existence. If such a
monstrous philosophy as this presents any justification
for such an act, then the killing of a newly born infant
or of an idiot may be likewise justified. The destruction
of the life of an unborn human being, for the reason
that it is small, feeble, and innocently helpless, rather
aggravates than palliates the crime. Every act of this
kind, with its justification, is obviously akin to that
savage philosophy which accounts it a matter of no
moment, or rather a duty, to destroy feeble infants,
or old, helpless fathers and mothers."[56]


[56] Black.

</p><p>Instruments of Crime. &mdash; "The means through which
abortions are effected are various. Sometimes it is
through potent drugs, extensively advertised in newspapers
claiming to be moral! &mdash; the advertisements so
adroitly worded as to convey under a caution the precise
information required of the liability of the drug to
produce miscarriages. Sometimes the information is
conveyed through secret circulars; but more commonly
the deed is consummated by professed abortionists, who
advertise themselves as such through innuendo, or
through gaining this kind of repute by the frequent
commission of the act. Not a few women, deterred by
lingering modesty or some sense of shame, attempt and
execute it upon themselves, and then volunteer to
instruct and encourage others to go and do likewise."[57]


[57] Black.

</p><p>Results of this Unnatural Crime. &mdash; It is the universal
testimony of physicians that the effects of abortion
are almost as deadly upon the mother as upon the child.
The amount of suffering is vastly greater; for that of
<pb n="515"/>
the child, if it suffer at all, is only momentary, in general,
while the mother is doomed to a life of suffering, of
misery, if she survives the shock of the terrible outrage
against her nature. It has been proved by statistics
that the danger of immediate death is <hi rend="italic">fifteen times as
great as in natural childbirth</hi>. A medical author of note
asserts that a woman suffers more injury from one abortion
than she would from twenty normal births. Says
an eminent physician on this point: &mdash;
</p><p>"We know that the popular idea is that women are
worn out by the toil and wear connected with the raising
of large families, and we can willingly concede something
to this statement; but it is certainly far more observable
that the efforts at the present day, made to avoid
propagation, are ten thousand-fold more disastrous to the
health and constitution, to say nothing of the demoralization
of mind and heart, which cannot be estimated by
red cheeks or physical vigor."
</p><p>But suppose the mother does not succeed in her
attempts against the life of her child, as she may not;
what fearful results may follow! Who can doubt that
the murderous intent of the mother will be stamped
indelibly upon the character of the unwelcome child, giving
it a natural propensity for the commission of murderous
deeds?
</p><p>Then again, &mdash; sickening thought, &mdash; suppose the
attempts to destroy the child are unsuccessful, resulting
only in horrid mutilation of its tender form; when such
a child is born, what terrible evidences may it bear in
its crippled and misshapen body of the cruel outrage
perpetrated upon it! That such cases do occur is certain
from the following narrative: &mdash;
<pb n="516"/>
</p><p>"A lady, determined not to have any more children,
went to a professed abortionist, and he attempted to
effect the desired end by violence. With a pointed
instrument the attempt was again and again made, but
without the looked-for result. So vigorously was the
effort made, that, astonished at no result's being obtained,
the individual stated that there must be some mistake,
that the lady could not be pregnant, and refused to
perform any further operations. Partially from doubt and
partially from fear, nothing further was attempted; and
in due process of time the woman was delivered of an
infant, shockingly mutilated, with one eye entirely put
out, and the brain so injured that this otherwise robust
child was entirely wanting in ordinary sense. This poor
mother, it would seem, needs no future punishment for
her sin. Ten years face to face with this poor idiot,
whose imbecility was her direct work &mdash; has it not punished
her sufficiently?"
</p><p>An Unwelcome Child. &mdash; A number of years ago, a
woman called on the writer, stating that she had become
pregnant much against her wishes, and earnestly desired
that an abortion should be produced. The following
conversation ensued: &mdash;
</p><p>"Why do you desire the destruction of your unborn
infant?"
</p><p>"Because I already have three children, which are
as many as I can properly care for; besides, my health
is poor, and I do not feel that I can do justice to what
children I now have."
</p><p>"Your chief reason, then, is that you do not wish
more children?"
</p><p>"Yes."
<pb n="517"/>
</p><p>"On this account you are willing to take the life of
this unborn babe?"
</p><p>"I must get rid of it."
</p><p>"I understand that you have already borne three
children, and that you do not think you are able to care
for more. Four children are, you think, one too many,
and so you are willing to destroy one. Why not destroy
one of those already born?"
</p><p>"Oh, that would be murder!"
</p><p>"It certainly would, but no more murder than it
would be to kill this unborn infant. Indeed, the little
one you are carrying in your womb, has greater claims
upon you than the little ones at home, by virtue of its
entire dependence and helplessness. It is just as much
your child as those whose faces are familiar to you, and
whom you love. Why should you be more willing to
take its life than that of one of your other children?
Indeed, there are several reasons why, if one must die
because there are too many, one of those already born
should be sacrificed instead of the one unborn. Your
other children you are acquainted with. Some of
them have serious faults. None of them have very
marked mental ability, or give very great promise of
becoming specially useful in the world. This one that
is unborn, may, for aught you know, be destined to a
career of wonderful usefulness. It may be a genius,
endowed with most remarkable gifts. It may be a
discoverer of some new truth or new principle, which will
be of great service to the world. It may be of all your
children the most talented and the most lovable, and in
every way the most desirable. Again, you cannot
destroy the life of this innocent child whom you have
<pb n="518"/>
never seen, without endangering your own life as well,
and certainly not without incurring the risk of life-long
suffering and disease. This could all be avoided by the
sacrifice of a child already born."
</p><p>"But that would be too horrible! To think of
taking one of my little boys and cutting his throat, or
throwing him into the river! I could not do such a
wicked thing."
</p><p>"The act would be in no sense more wicked than
what you have come here to request me to do for you.
Certainly, you do not think that I advise you to take
the life of one of your little children. I only wish to
present the matter to you in such a light that you will
see the enormity of the crime which in your heart you
have proposed to commit. My most earnest advice to
you is that you put such thoughts far from your mind, and
endeavor to make the best of your present circumstances.
Employ all such means as will build up your health, and
fortify yourself for the ordeal through which you must
pass, and which will conduce in every way to the
development of a vigorous and healthy child."
</p><p>The woman left our office defeated, but not wholly
restored to moral sanity. She continued to bemoan
her condition, and allowed her heart to be filled with
enmity against the innocent being that was in no way
responsible for her afflictions. So far as I know,
however, no active measures were taken to produce
abortion. The mother dragged out a miserable existence
for several months, and finally gave birth to a puny
infant, which barely survived the perils of parturition,
and came into the world the most wretched of all human
beings, "an unwelcome child." In a few weeks it
<pb n="519"/>
became emaciated to an extent almost beyond belief,
with not one particle of fatty tissue remaining to give to
its body the plumpness and roundness natural to this
period of life. The eyes were sunken back in their
sockets, the cheeks fallen in, the nose pinched, and the
whole countenance presented the appearance of infirm
old age, just upon the verge of the grave, from
consumption. The fingers resembled most those of a
skeleton. Horrible sores began to make their appearance,
first on the hands, then about the head and
eyes. The bones began to decay and drop out one by
one, and yet the poor little creature clung to life week
after week, becoming more wretched and miserable,
a constant moaning and crying day and night indicating
the intense suffering which it endured. Horrible
spasms now and then deprived it of the power to
breathe. Again and again the mother thought it was
dying, and even dead, but still it survived month after
month, lingering on literally a living, breathing putrefying
corpse. During all these days and weeks and
months of weary watching, day and night, what must
have been the mother's thoughts! What pangs of
bitter self-reproach, and what remorse of conscience must
have burned in her heart, as during the long night
watches she sat beside her dying babe, and listened to
its piteous moans!
</p><p>And still the wretched infant lingers on. Its little
flickering flame of life still faintly burns, and still the
mother tends it day and night, dressing its festering sores,
and soothing its feeble cry. Vain is her effort to undo
the wrong she has done her little one; but let us hope
that by genuine repentance and the many months of
<pb n="520"/>
faithful and patient watching, she has made a full atonement
for her sin.
</p><p>The Remedy. &mdash; Whether this gigantic evil can ever
be eradicated, is exceedingly doubtful. To effect its
cure would be to make refined Christians out of brutal
sensualists, to emancipate woman from the enticing,
alluring slavery of fashion, to uproot false ideas of life and
its duties, &mdash; in short to revolutionize society. The
crime is perpetrated in secret. Many times no one but
the criminal herself is cognizant of the evil deed. Only
occasionally do cases come near enough to the surface
to be dimly discernable; hence the evident inefficiency
of any civil legislation. But the evil is a desperate one,
and is increasing; shall no attempt be made to check the
tide of crime, and save the perpetrators from both physical
and spiritual perdition? An effort should be made,
at least. Let every Christian raise the note of warning.
From every Christian pulpit let the truth be spoken in
terms too plain for misapprehension. Let those who
are known to be guilty of this most revolting crime, be
looked upon as murderers, as they are; and let their real
moral status be distinctly shown.
</p><p>All these means will do something to effect a
reform; but the radical cure of the evil will only be
found in the principles suggested in the section devoted
to the consideration of "Marital Excesses." The
adoption of those principles and strict adherence to
them would effectually prevent the occurrence of circumstances
which are the occasion of abortions and infanticides.
</p><p>Murder by Proxy. &mdash; "There is, at the present time,
a kind of infanticide, which, although it is not so well
<pb n="521"/>
known, is even more dangerous, because done with
impunity. There are parents who recoil with horror at
the idea of destroying their offspring, although they
would greatly desire to be disembarrassed of them, who
yet place them without remorse with nurses who enjoy
the sinister reputation of never returning the children to
those who intrusted them to their care. These unfortunate
little beings are condemned to perish from inanition
and bad treatment.
</p><p>"The number of these innocent victims is greater
than would be imagined, and very certainly exceeds
that of the marked infanticides sent by the public prosecutor
to the court of the assizes."</p>

<head>Diseases Peculiar to Women.</head>
<p>
CAUSES OF DISEASE AMONG WOMEN. &mdash; The
great prevalence of diseases peculiar to the sex
among American women, is a matter of remark
by medical authors. The women of European
countries are far less subject to these maladies than are
American women, but yet they are more or less prevalent
among all civilized people. Among the principal
causes to which this state of things is attributable,
the following may be enumerated: &mdash;
</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Carelessness at Menstruation</hi>. &mdash; Neglect to care
properly for themselves at the menstrual period, either
through carelessness or ignorance of the consequences,
is probably one of the most common causes of uterine or
ovarian disorders. Neglects of this kind are most likely
to occur, and are most harmful, during the first two or
three years after the beginning of the menstrual period.
</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sexual sins</hi>, in the form of self-abuse in the
unmarried and excesses in the married, and prolonged
excitement from erotic thoughts in both classes, are
unmistakably a frequent cause of ovarian and uterine diseases.
</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Neglect of the Bowels</hi>. &mdash; Constipation is a prevalent
disorder among women. It is sometimes the result of
improper diet and sedentary habits, but is quite as
frequently the effect of neglecting to evacuate the bowels
at a regular hour each day, which is essential to proper

<pb n="523"/>
and regular action. Constipation gives rise to congestion
of the pelvic organs; and the violent efforts necessary
to expel the hardened contents of the bowels, force the
womb and ovaries out of position, straining the ligaments
and other structures by which they are held in position,
and causing intense congestion by the prolonged straining
efforts.
</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Excessive Use of Drugs</hi>. &mdash; This must also be
set down as a frequent cause of disease in women, though
not always of local disorders. After-dinner pills, liver
regulators, laxatives, etc., frequently operate in an
injurious manner upon the pelvic viscera.
</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Errors in Dress</hi>. &mdash; Tight-lacing, the wearing of
heavy skirts about the waist, neglect to properly clothe
the limbs, the wearing of high-heeled shoes, &mdash; these and
other errors in dress common among American women,
are responsible for a large share of the weak backs and
other evidences of local disease of which women complain.
</p><p>The importance of woman's dress has excited so
much interest of late that it might not be out of place to
give to its consideration at this point, a larger amount of
space than under ordinary circumstances would be
admissible. Not long since, a writer in the <hi rend="italic">North American
Review</hi> took up the cudgel in defense of what are considered
by the majority of intelligent physicians as the
most objectional features of fashionable dress. As the
profession and reputation of the writer referred to are
such that much harm may be done by the sophistical
arguments which he presents upon the subject, it may
be profitable to devote a little time to their consideration,
though their real weight is so slight that if they had
<pb n="524"/>
been produced by an obscure individual, they would
certainly not be worthy a moment's consideration. This
champion of fashion writes as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"Without going into the consideration of the dress
of women in various parts of the world, it will be sufficient
if I confine what I have to say on the subject to
their apparel as worn at the present day. But it is an
important fact that in the earlier periods of the history
of the human race, there were no essential points of
difference in the dress of the two sexes, except perhaps,
in the way of wearing the hair. Roman men and
women, for instance, wore pretty nearly the same kind
of external garments. A plate in Planch&eacute;'s `History
of Costume' represents a group of Anglo-Saxon men
and women of the tenth century, and it is difficult, if
not impossible, to tell which of the figures represent men
and which women. The traditional fig-leaf was the
same for both sexes, and from it were evolved skirts
that varied but little in shape and general appearance,
whether they concealed the nakedness of a man or that
of a woman. The differences that now exist have
mainly been caused by the revolt of man from the
inconvenience of long skirts, and the assumption by him
of a separate covering for each leg. What he has gained
in the facility with which he can run, leap, climb trees,
straddle a horse, row a boat, and do the many other
things that his occupations require of him, he has
certainly lost in grace and elegance. Trousers are of
oriental origin, and in the form of breeches were worn
by the ancient Gauls and Britons. They went out of
fashion, however, soon after the occupation by the
Romans, and the gown took their place, or rather re-acquired its place, for both sexes.
<pb n="525"/>
</p><p>"So far as I know, the wearing of trousers by
women is a mere matter of convenience and &aelig;sthetics
that they are perfectly competent to settle for
themselves, and that they certainly will decide without
interference from the other sex. It is not a question into
which sanitation enters. There are no statistics to
show that the partial exposure of the lower extremities
to the atmosphere, which more or less attends upon the
absence of trousers, leads to greater ill-health or mortality
than when they are more securely covered with
trousers. Rheumatism, sciatica, hip-joint disease, white-swelling, neuralgia, etc., are more common in men than
they are in women. It is true that women sometimes
wear drawers in winter, but they are in general a poor
protection in themselves compared with the close-fitting
woolen drawers of men, and the superimposed trousers
of even more compact material. As a matter of fact,
however, women endure cold weather as well as do men,
not because they are more warmly clad, but because,
owing to the flowing character of their garments, and the
fact that they are not in close contact with the lower
part of the body, a stratum of air exists between them
and the skin, and this, being a good non-conductor of
heat, prevents the rapid cooling of the surface that
would otherwise take place. It acts just as does the
two or three inches thickness of air when double windows
are put into a house."
</p><p>A Muddled Professor. &mdash; What a pity that the discovery
that loose skirts are warmer for the legs than
closely fitting garments, should have been made at so
late a day as this! What an amount of earnest talk has
been wasted! How the advocates of dress reform have
<pb n="526"/>
waxed warm in condemning the prevailing style in
women's dress, on the ground that the circulation is
disturbed by the exposure of the limbs to chilling by the
loose skirts, which Dr. Hammond has discovered are
much warmer than drawers or pantaloons! As most of
the agitators of the dress reform question have been
women, Dr. Hammond's discovery certainly suggests a
sad want of acumen on the part of the fair sex, that
they should have failed to make the discovery themselves,
though having had an opportunity for practical
experimentation which it is hardly supposable that Dr. H.
has had. It certainly requires the highest kind of
genius to be able to rise above the necessity for the
observation of facts to which vulgar minds are subjected,
and this remarkable discovery of the eminent Professor
affords another illustration of what may be accomplished
by a skillful use of the "scientific imagination." The
Professor's reasoning makes it very clear that poor
masculine humanity has been for some centuries back
abused in a gross and cruel manner, and that science
demands that the doctors should preach a crusade against
pantaloons, and insist that men shall meekly submit to a
reinstatement of the reign of the petticoat. Now that
we are fully awakened to the exposures and dangers
involved in the wearing of pantaloons, it is a matter of
amazement that the unhappy male biped who has been
subjected to such a barbarous costume, has not been
quite exterminated by this dreadful abuse of his nether
extremities .
</p><p>Personally, we have never had any experience in
petticoats; but when we have seen a woman battling
her way along the street against a December wind, with
<pb n="527"/>
her dress skirts whipping about like sails, and the frosty
air making small cyclones around her limbs protected
only by cotton stockings and thin drawers, our unscientific
imagination has somehow become impressed with
the idea that the biped in pantaloons on the other side
of the street has a great advantage in point of warmth
as well as convenience, notwithstanding the lack of
"&aelig;sthetic" qualities in his dress. It might appear to
some persons of meager intellectual endowments, and
not gifted with "scientific imaginations," that women
endure the cold season of the year as well as men, not
because their skirts afford them better protection, but
because they are less exposed to the inclemencies of the
season, their occupations being indoors.
</p><p>"But as the occupations of women are gradually
becoming identical with those of men, it appears to be
desirable, on the score of convenience, that they should
wear trousers, even at the sacrifice of warmth and
beauty. A woman commanding a steamboat would
certainly be more efficient in trousers than in long skirts.
A saleswoman in a shop would do her work with more
comfort to herself, and more to the satisfaction of her
employer, if she were disencumbered of the gown and
petticoats that prevent her from climbing step-ladders to
get down goods, or jumping over the counter, like her
male rival. Even as a physician, or as a nurse in a
hospital, she would more effectually perform her work
if she wore trousers, and thus had more freedom in the
motions of her lower limbs. A woman surgeon, for
instance, called upon to reduce a dislocation of the shoulder-joint, would find skirts very greatly incommodious when
she came to put her heel into the axilla of the patient
<pb n="528"/>
in order to obtain the necessary fixed point to counteract
the effects of her traction. Besides, the flowing drapery
worn by the woman physician and nurse is more apt to
absorb contagion than the closely fitting trousers of
man, and hence renders them carriers of disease from
house to house, or from person to person.
</p><p>"If I had the determination of the question, I should
prescribe trousers for all women that do manual labor,
except such as is of a purely ornamental character, &mdash;
embroidery, crocheting, etc., &mdash; and such as is strictly
confined to the use of the hands, without the legs' being
necessarily brought into use, &mdash; sewing, knitting, writing,
painting, etc. The sewing-machine should never be
worked by a woman in skirts. The gown and petticoats
I would reserve exclusively for women embraced in the
above-named exceptions, and for those whose office in
society is to be ornamental and useful in the various
social relations of life. Certainly a great deal of the
&aelig;sthetics of a drawing-room, a ball-room, or a dinner-table would be lost if the women who attend them wore
trousers instead of the silk, satin, and velvet gowns that
now add so much to their loveliness. I can quite conceive
that a man thoroughly imbued with the prejudices
received from a biased education, indisposed to accept
new ideas, and deeply endowed with a love for the
beautiful, might be reluctant to pay his addresses with a
view to matrimony to a woman wearing trousers. Still,
under the influence of familiarity with the idea of a
change in the nether garments of the sex, and especially
should they be generally adopted by pretty women, it
might reasonably be expected that a change of opinion
and emotion would ensue, and that perhaps in time he
<pb n="529"/>
might even be brought to regard trousers as filling more
completely his idea of the beautiful than do skirts at the
present day."
</p><p>Our author is afraid that the ball-room and the
dinner-table will lose some of their "&aelig;sthetics" if
women should put on trousers; but he at once admits
that the "&aelig;sthetics" of the dress question is wholly a
matter of habit, and may be completely reversed if sufficient
time is allowed.
</p><p>"There is another point that requires consideration,
and that is the practice of wearing the gown cut low in
the neck, so as to expose the breast, and without covering
for the arms. It is doubtful if this leads to any ill
consequences. It has been continued for many generations
without apparent injury. It might be supposed,
at first thought, that bronchitis, pleurisy, pneumonia, and
many kinds of rheumatism and neuralgia would be the
result of the custom; but such is really not the case, all
these affections being much more frequently met with
in men who cover the chest and arms with several
thicknesses of woolen material in addition to a shirt of
linen or cotton."
</p><p>Our learned author evidently delights in paradoxies.
He gravely says, "There is another point that requires
consideration," referring to the practice of exposing the
arms and chest, formerly more fashionable than at the
present time. One certainly would expect to hear at
least some word of condemnation of this fashion, the
unhealthfulness of which has been too frequently
demonstrated by those addicted to it, to require the dictum of
a learned doctor either for or against it. Indeed, the
Professor himself seems to recognize the apparent weak-<pb n="530"/>
ness of his defense of this most absurd of fashionable
follies, since he remarks, "It might be supposed at first
thought," etc., but gives no substantial reason why it
might not also be supposed at second thought, especially
since the same statistics which show man to be the
greatest sufferer from bronchitis, pneumonia, etc., as the
result of his greater exposure to the weather, show that
consumption, a disease which kills vastly more than all
the maladies named, finds by far the greatest percentage
of its victims among women. It is certainly a marvelous
exhibition of legerdemain in logic by which the
Professor at one moment advocates the wearing of skirts
and petticoats on the score of warmth for the limbs, and
the next insists that for the other extremity of the body,
which is certainly much more closely related to the
organs of greatest importance in the vital economy, no
clothing whatever is needed.
</p><p>"It has been strenuously urged by many so-called
sanitary reformers, that women should support their
skirts by straps passing over the shoulders, and some
few have been induced to adopt the method. It is to be
hoped that it will not spread. A woman's hips are
proportionally wider than those of a man, and there is no
better way of keeping up the many petticoats that it is
sometimes necessary to wear, than by fastening them
with strings or bands around the waist, over the corset.
Shoulder-straps hinder the movements of the chest, and
tend to make those who wear them round-shouldered.
Besides, they could not well be worn with a low-necked
dress. Even if trousers should come into general use
for women, it would be better that they should be kept
up by the support of the hips than by suspenders pass-<pb n="531"/>
ing over the shoulders. It is true that many men wear
suspenders, and this fact may perhaps lead to their
adoption by some women; but again no inconsiderable
number of the male sex support their trousers from the
hips. If comparatively narrow-hipped man can do this,
wide-hipped woman ought to be able to do it better."
</p><p>This paragraph certainly reads like the ingenious
advertisement of a fashionable <hi rend="italic">modiste</hi>, prepared after the
style of the latest pattern of quack medicine advertisements.
The Doctor speaks as one in authority when he
says, "There is no better way," etc. Did he ever try
the experiment? We know of some hundreds of intelligent
women who have tried the experiment of changing
the weight of the clothing from the waist to the shoulders,
and we do not know of a single instance in which
the experimenter has been willing to return to the old
style of dressing after shoulder straps had been adopted.
Suppose the Doctor should try the experiment himself
once. Let him supply himself with a fashionable corset,
now button his pantaloons tightly around his waist, and
fill his pockets with buck shot or twenty-dollar gold
pieces, and start off for a ten-mile tramp. If he do n't
complain of a dragging pain in the lower bowels and an
insupportable backache before he gets around home, it
will be because he hails the first cab, and takes the
journey on wheels.
</p><p>"Shoulder straps hinder the movements of the
chest, and tend to make the wearer round-shouldered."
Undoubtedly this is true if "many petticoats" are
suspended from them; but what intelligent woman who has
undertaken to reform her dress does not know that
"many petticoats" are <hi rend="italic">never</hi>, instead of "sometimes,
<pb n="532"/>
necessary." But here is the real argument: "Besides,
they could not well be worn with a low-necked dress."
Certainly not. A strip of red, white, or striped webbing
striking straight down across a broad, bare space of pink
and white immodesty, would destroy a "great deal of
&aelig;sthetics."
</p><p>But did it ever occur to our learned authority that
corsets may "hinder the movements of the chest, and
tend to make those who wear them" narrow-waisted?
It is true, women have wider hips than men, but this
anatomical peculiarity is given to women for quite
another purpose than to hang either trousers or petticoats
on. The Italian farmer works the cow as well as the ox
before the cart or plow. What would even Dr. Hammond
say if he should find one of these old-fashioned agriculturists
adjusting a yoke around the middle of his female
bovine, because her hips happened to be a little wider
than those of her broad-shouldered brother?
</p><p>"A good deal more might be said in regard to hats,
shoes, and stockings. But as I remarked in the beginning,
women will settle all the questions of dress for
themselves. There is no evidence to show that in this
respect men have ever interfered with them; and if
they should presume to make the attempt, it is not at
all likely that their advice would be heeded."
</p><p>We are able at last to find one sentiment with which
we can quite agree. Women are settling this question
of dress for themselves, and are perfectly competent to
do so, and it is certainly to be hoped that they will not
allow fashion-blinded men, even though they may be
backed by the prestige of a world-wide reputation in
some specialty, to interfere with their attempts to rescue
<pb n="533"/>
their sisters from the most thralling slavery of modern
times, &mdash; fashionable dress.
</p><p>Diseases of Women. &mdash; The disorders described in
this section are some of the most common to which
women are subject, and are all sufficiently serious to
demand special attention when recognized. We have not
space here to give accurate directions for the required
treatment, but think it proper to describe the several
maladies named, so as to render the reader intelligent
respecting their nature, and thus induce her to take
prompt steps to procure proper treatment when they are
recognized. In other works published by the author,
simple measures of treatment, such as can be used safely
and successfully at home, are carefully and fully described.
</p><p>General Suggestions. &mdash; We may add, however, the
following general suggestions respecting the treatment
of those disorders, which are applicable to nearly all
forms of diseases peculiar to women: &mdash;
</p><p>Nearly all forms of uterine disease are accompanied
by more or less congestion of the womb and ovaries.
There is pain in the region of the ovaries, across the
lower part of the bowels, in the back, or in other parts
adjacent to the sexual organs. Leucorrh&oelig;a is also
present in a great majority of cases. For the relief of
these various symptoms, there is no one measure so
generally applicable and capable of accomplishing so
much as the hot vaginal douche. This consists of the
injection of hot water into the vagina. The water should
be as hot as can be borne without discomfort, and should
be taken in considerable quantities. Not less than one
gallon, and generally two or three gallons, should be
<pb n="534"/>
employed at each application. The best means of
administering the douche is by a siphon syringe. The
treatment should be taken in a horizontal position.
</p><p>When the leucorrh&oelig;al discharge is very abundant,
and is not relieved by the persistent use of hot water,
alum or tannin may be added to the last portion of
water used, one or two drams to the quart.
</p><p>Women suffering from uterine diseases should usually
rest at the menstrual period. It is not always necessary
that the patient should remain in bed, though this is
sometimes required; but a large share of the ordinary
duties should be suspended for a day or two preceding
the period, until a day or two after. By this means the
aggravation of troubles which usually occur at each
menstrual period, may after a time be decreased, until
nature has time to restore the morbid conditions to
proper action.
</p><p>Leucorrh&oelig;a, or Whites. &mdash; This most common of all
maladies peculiar to the sex, is not always an independent
function, but sometimes a symptom of other disease. It
is always indicative of some disease, and should receive
prompt attention. A slight whitish discharge may take
place just before or just after the menstrual period,
which is entirely natural; but when it continues during
the interval between the periods, it is evidence of
disease, either of the vaginal mucous membrane or of the
womb, or both. Viscid mucous discharges are generally
from the womb. Curdy discharges are occasioned by
catarrh of the vagina. Offensive watery discharges
indicate tumors of the womb, which are sometimes
malignant. Bloody discharges are the result of tumors of
various kinds, and cancers and lacerations of the womb.
<pb n="535"/>
A very offensive discharge is usually indicative of
cancer.
</p><p>Vaginitis. &mdash; This is an inflammation of the vagina
which corresponds to gonorrh&oelig;a in the male. There is
much swelling, heat, and tenderness, and smarting or
burning sensation, accompanied by more or less discharge,
usually of a greenish character. The principal causes
are discharge from the womb, use of caustics, the wearing
of uterine supporters, self-abuse, and other sexual
excesses.
</p><p>Vaginismus. &mdash; This condition is one in which great
irritability exists about the mouth of the vagina, causing
violent contraction, accompanied by cutting pain. It is
often the cause of much suffering as well as inconvenience.
The principal causes are inflammation of the
vagina, rawness of the mucous membrane, vascular
growths of the urethra, fissure of the anus, hysteria,
itching of the genitals. This complaint often occasions
great distress, and is characterized by intense itching,
burning, or tingling of the external organs of generation.
The itching sometimes extends into the vagina to some
extent. The most common cause of the disease is an
ichorous discharge from the womb or the vagina, which
frequently occurs in old age. This disorder is sometimes
present in cases of diabetes. The effect is occasionally
wholly nervous in character.
</p><p>Uterine Catarrh. &mdash; This is a catarrhal inflammation
of the mucous membrane lining the uterus. The most
common causes are taking cold at the menstrual period,
and self-abuse or sexual excesses. Women who do not
nurse their children after childbirth, are very apt to
suffer with this disease. The general symptoms are a
<pb n="536"/>
watery discharge, often appearing in adhesive, stringy
masses; scanty, suppressed, painful, or profuse
menstruation; headache, particularly at the top of the head;
weakness in the back and across the lower part of the
bowels; slow digestion; inactive bowels; neurasthenia,
hysteria; general debility.
</p><p>Inflammation of the Womb. &mdash; The symptoms are
pain in the lower part of the back, and just above the
pubic bone, tenderness on pressure at the last-named
point, weight or dragging feeling in the bowels, desire
to relieve the bladder too frequently, leucorrh&oelig;a,
headache, general nervous debility. The most common
causes are sexual excesses, employment of means to
prevent conception, improper dress, abortions and
miscarriages, getting up too soon after confinement, injuries
in the neck of the womb, or perineum, occurring at
childbirth. To these must also be added the wearing of
uterine supporters, which frequently, by not fitting
properly, produce serious inflammation of the womb.
</p><p>Ulceration of the Womb. &mdash; The condition usually
known as ulceration of the womb, is not what is commonly
termed ulceration elsewhere, but would be more
properly termed abrasion, or erosion. The neck of the
womb, when seen through a speculum, is usually red,
enlarged, and raw. This condition generally exists in
connection with congestion or chronic inflammation of
the womb. One of its most frequent causes is laceration
of the neck of the womb at childbirth. These cases are
frequently treated for years without other than temporary
relief, through failure of the medical attendant to recognize
the fact that a tear has occurred. In these cases
the repair of the injury after proper preparatory treat-<pb n="537"/>
ment, effects a speedy and a permanent cure, as the
writer has witnessed in scores of cases.
</p><p>Amenorrh&oelig;a, or Suppressed Menstruation. &mdash; This
term is applied to a condition in which the menstrual
flow is absent. There are two varieties of the disease,
one in which the flow has never made its appearance,
though the proper time has arrived, and the other in
which the flow has been suppressed after having been
once established. There are numerous causes of this
disorder. It is usually the result of impaired nutrition.
Every case of amenorrh&oelig;a is not pathological, however.
Sometimes, as in fevers and other wasting diseases, the
function is suspended as a means of economizing the
vital forces of the body. In these cases, no attempt
should be made to restore the function by drugs or
other means. Great harm is often done by the use of
amenagogues. A temporary suppression of the menstrual
flow sometimes results from the disuse of flesh
food on the part of persons who have been accustomed
to using it freely; but we never have seen any harm
arise from the suppression of the menstrual flow in these
cases. Persons suffering with amenorrh&oelig;a sometimes
have a vicarious hemorrhage when the menstrual flow
first makes its reappearance. The hemorrhage may occur
from the nose, stomach, or bowels, and has often
been known to occur through the skin in the form of
bloody sweat.
</p><p>Scanty Menstruation. &mdash; The principal causes of
scanty or deficient menstruation are inflammation of the
ovaries; ovarian tumors, consumption, or other wasting
diseases; anteflexion of the womb; mental depression,
or general debility.
<pb n="538"/>
</p><p>Menorrhagia. &mdash; This condition is that in which there
is a too profuse discharge of blood. The system is
weakened by the loss, and so much so, in many cases,
that the individual does not recover her accustomed
strength before the occurrence of the next period, when
she becomes weakened still more. By a continuance of
this periodical loss, the person may be reduced to a state
of almost utter helplessness. A deathly pallor of the
countenance, extreme emaciation, loss of strength, and
general debility mark the effects of the constant drain
upon the system. Thousands of young women continue
to suffer in this way year after year, until their
constitutions are almost hopelessly wrecked, being deterred
by false notions of modesty or delicacy from consulting
a proper medical adviser and finding relief.
</p><p>The observance of a few simple precautions, and the
application of proper remedies, will very promptly check
the unnatural loss in most of these cases. In the first
place, absolute rest, chiefly in a supine position, must
be observed, not only during the menstrual period, but
for a few days previous to its commencement. If this
does not restrain the flow, cool and even cold compresses
may be applied to the lower part of the abdomen
and to the small of the back. In severe cases no harm
will come from the use of an ice-compress, made by
inclosing pounded ice between the folds of a towel. Great
care must be taken to make the hands, arms, feet, and
limbs thoroughly warm by the application of warm bottles
and woolen blankets. These measures will scarcely
fail to accomplish the desired end, if employed efficiently
and judiciously. It may be well to add, just here, that
the popular fear of using cold in such cases is ground-<pb n="539"/>
less. No harm can come so long as the extremities are
kept warm, and the circulation well balanced. However,
the patient must not be allowed to become chilly.
It is also of importance that the patient be kept
mentally quiet as well as physically so.
</p><p>Much good will result from these simple measures at
the time of the period; but a radical cure can only be
effected by removing the cause of the difficulty. The
patient's general health must be improved, and local
congestion must be removed. This will be accomplished
by attention to general hygiene, gentle exercise out-of-doors between the periods, abundance of good food,
tonic baths and other necessary treatment if there is
derangement of the digestive organs, and daily hip baths
with a local douche. The hip bath should be taken in
water of a temperature of 92&deg; at the beginning, after
five minutes lowering it five degrees. After five minutes
more, it may be lowered a few degrees more. By taking
a warm foot bath at 95&deg; or 100&deg; at the same time, quite
a cool bath may be endured without chilling. The bath
should be continued fifteen to thirty minutes, according
to the strength of the patient. A shorter bath than this
will do little good, as the sedative effect will not be obtained.
</p><p>The douche may be taken at the same time with the
bath, or before, as is most convenient. The fountain or
siphon syringe should be employed, and the water used
should range from 105&deg; to 120&deg;, as best suits the
sensations of the patient.
</p><p>By these simple remedies alone we have successfully
treated scores of cases of this sort. In some cases, other
remedies may be required, and in nearly all, accessory
<pb n="540"/>
remedies can be employed to advantage; but the measures
described are the main features of the most successful
mode of treatment.
</p><p>Hemorrhage from the Womb. &mdash; A profuse flow of
blood from the womb, occurring at any other time than
the menstrual period, is a hemorrhage, and not menstruation.
The flow of blood is sometimes so profuse as to
endanger life. It may usually be stopped by pressing
into the vagina a sponge or mass of cotton soaked in
vinegar. Meanwhile the patient should lie in bed with
the feet elevated.
</p><p>Dysmenorrh&oelig;a. &mdash; This condition is that in which
there is more or less pain and difficulty in connection
with the menstrual process. The causes are various, as
disease of the ovaries, congestion of the uterus,
malformation, and displacement or distortion of the organ.
Some of these conditions require the attention of a skilled
physician to remedy; but all may be palliated more or
less by simple measures of treatment which may be used
at home. A warm sitz or hip bath just at the beginning
of the period will often give almost magical relief. The
application of fomentations over the lower part of the
abdomen, and the corresponding portion of the spine, or
of hot bags, bottles, etc., in the same localities, is a
measure of great utility. The patient should be covered
warm in bed, should keep quiet, and great care should
be used to keep the extremities well warmed. The use
of electricity is a very valuable aid in numerous cases,
but this requires the services of a physician, who should
always be employed in severe cases when within reach.
</p><p>In many cases of this form of disease, the suffering
is so great that the constant dread of its periodical repe-<pb n="541"/>
tition becomes a source of great unhappiness, and casts
a gloom over the life of an individual who would otherwise
be happy.
</p><p>Ovarian Irritation. &mdash; The symptoms of this malady
are tenderness in the groin, pain in walking or standing,
and more or less continuous dull pain, which is greatly
aggravated at the menstrual period, the latter being
generally induced by a chill, which is quickly followed by a
fever, resembling that present in inflammation of the
ovaries. The most common causes of ovarian irritation
are self-abuse, sexual excesses, improper dress, taking
cold at the menstrual period, disappointment in love,
abortion, constipation of the bowels, inflammation and
displacement of the uterus, the opium habit, the use of
"preventives." Cases of this sort require skillful medical
care and management.
</p><p>Inflammation of the Ovaries. &mdash; The principal symptoms
are sudden pain in one or both groins, sometimes
extending down the legs, frequently pain in the breast
of the affected side, increase of pain during menstruation,
with tenderness on pressure, pain in moving the bowels,
general distress, nausea, more or less fever. The most
common causes are taking cold during menstruation,
mechanical injury, anteflexion, or gonorrh&oelig;a.
</p><p>Cellulitis. &mdash; This is an inflammation of the cellular
tissue about the womb. The symptoms are chills,
accompanied by fever and pain across the pelvis,
sometimes nausea and vomiting, tenderness on pressure
above the pubic bone, painful urination and defecation,
profuse menstruation. Abscesses sometimes form, which
may open externally, through the bowels, vagina, or
bladder. Contractions of the uterus about the womb,
<pb n="542"/>
causing displacement of the organ, are apt to follow this
inflammation. The most common causes are childbirth,
abortion, taking cold at the menstrual period, inflammation
of the uterus, the use of caustics upon the womb,
gonorrh&oelig;a, pessaries, and sexual excesses.
</p><p>Prolapsus, or Falling of the Womb. &mdash; Of all forms
of displacement of the womb, this is perhaps the most
common. A woman suffering from prolapsus, complains
of tenderness just above the pubes; irritation of the
bladder and rectum; sense of fullness in the vagina;
dragging pain in the back, extending around the body,
which, with the other symptoms, is aggravated by walking
or long standing upon the feet; profuse or painful
menstruation; leucorrh&oelig;a. Sometimes local symptoms
are entirely absent, all the unpleasant sensations being
experienced elsewhere. Patients complain of a dull
ache at the top of the head, nervousness and depression
of spirits, constipation of the bowels, general debility.
In very bad cases, the organ sometimes becomes so
prolapsed that it protrudes from the body, a condition
subjecting the patient to great suffering and inconvenience.
In these instances, however, the patient may be relieved
by a proper surgical operation, by means of which the
organ is supported in a natural position.
</p><p>In most of these cases, as well as in other forms of
displacement, the patient has usually worn pessaries of
some sort for years, with the effect of ultimately increasing
the gravity of the condition, and greatly adding to
the difficulty of effecting a cure. The most common
causes of falling of the womb are the wearing of heavy
skirts suspended from the waist, dancing, taking cold at
the menstrual period, self-abuse, lifting heavy weights,
<pb n="543"/>
improper management at childbirth, tear in the neck of
the womb or perineum, and in fact, local disease of any
sort. Prolapsus is almost always attended by enlargement
of the womb. Even the worst cases of this disease
are curable by proper management, though many women
suffering from this trouble endure the tortures of
irrational treatment at the hands of inexperienced and
incompetent physicians, from the effects of which they
may suffer for many years.
</p><p>Other Forms of Displacement. &mdash; Anteversion, anteflexion,
retroversion, retroflexion, and the various other
forms of displacement, are due to very much the same
causes as those which give rise to prolapsus, and the
symptoms are also very much the same. Backward
displacements give rise to greater and more constant
pain in the back; while forward displacements produce
greater pain in the lower part of the body in front,
disturbed action of the bladder, and hence too frequent and
painful urination, etc. Remarks made regarding the
treatment of prolapsus, apply with equal force to these
other forms of displacement.
</p><p>Prolapsus of the Ovaries. &mdash; The symptoms of this
unfortunate and very serious condition are pain of a
sickening character during movement of the bowels and
in walking, and after standing on the feet for some
time, starting in the groin and extending along the
front of the thigh on the affected side; painful connection.
On making an examination with the finger, the
ovary can usually be felt as a round swelling on one
side of the womb. Sometimes, in extreme cases, the
ovary may be found behind the womb. The most common
causes are chronic congestion of the womb, prolap-<pb n="544"/>
sus, retroversion or retroflexion, inflammation of the
ovaries, self-abuse and other sexual excesses, abortion,
and the employment of means to prevent conception.
This condition, though serious and often very persistent,
is curable by persevering and skillful treatment.
</p><p>Rectocele. &mdash; This is a condition in which the posterior
wall of the vagina is greatly relaxed and pulls forward,
dragging with it, also, the anterior portion of the rectal
wall. This forms a pouch in which the f&aelig;ces sometimes
accumulate, and into which they are pressed when
attempting to move the bowels, making it necessary to
press the parts back in order to secure a movement.
The most frequent cause is a tear of the perineum at
childbirth. Cases of this sort require a surgical operation.
We have found it necessary to perform this operation
in many cases, and have uniformly met with most
happy results.
</p><p>Cystocele, or Prolapsus of the Bladder. &mdash; This is a
condition somewhat similar to the preceding, only
involving the front wall of the vagina, the back wall being
dragged down to the vaginal wall, which forms a pouch
bulging out at the vaginal entrance. The patient
experiences difficulty in evacuating the bladder. In a case
recently under the care of the author, the amount of
prolapsus was so great that the urethra was doubled
upon itself, so that the bladder could not be evacuated
without pressing backward on the prolapsed portion with
the hand. In consequence of the retention of urine, the
bladder being seldom emptied, disease of the bladder is
likely to be set up, with its many attending inconveniences
and often great suffering.
</p><p>The most common cause of this condition is prolapsus
<pb n="545"/>
of the womb. It is frequently met with in its worst
form in elderly women who also suffer with rectocele.
In several cases which have come under the care of the
author, the patients have been quite advanced in life,
several years past the menopause, and the difficulty has
been due to a tear in the perineum, followed by great
relaxation of the vaginal walls. By means of a proper
surgical operation, the difficulty is wholly curable; but
little can be done for its relief by home treatment, aside
from the employment of hot vaginal douches and solutions
of tannin and other astringents, which, of course,
afford only temporary relief.
</p><p>Sterility. &mdash; In six cases out of seven in which married
people are unable to beget children, the fault is
with the wife. The most common causes in women are
contraction of the canal of the womb, displacements,
catarrh of the womb, leucorrh&oelig;a, and profuse menstruation.
Of the remote causes, sexual excesses, especially self-abuse, are the most potent. In occasional cases the
womb or ovaries may be absent. Sometimes both of
these organs are wanting. When this condition exists,
a wise and experienced physician should be consulted,
as in many cases the cause is of such a nature that it
can be removed by proper treatment.
</p><p>Nymphomania. &mdash; This is a mental and nervous affection
in which the patient is affected with uncontrollable
sexual desires, which frequently lead to the grossest
breaches of modesty. This humiliating disorder is
most frequently the result of self-abuse, and allowing
the mind to dwell without restriction upon lascivious
thoughts. It is sometimes the result of ovarian irritation,
and is occasionally observed in various diseases of
the brain.
<pb n="646"/>
</p><p>Hysterical Breast. &mdash; The breast is painful to the
touch, and sometimes much swollen. The most frequent
causes are disease of the womb and ovaries, self-abuse, and disorders of digestion. In one of the worst
cases we ever met, in which the breasts were exceedingly
sensitive and much swollen, the patient was
greatly addicted to masturbation. The difficulty
disappeared almost immediately when the habit was
discontinued.
</p><p>Painful Sitting. &mdash; The patient complains of pain
when sitting down or when rising from a sitting posture,
at the extreme lower end of the spine. The affection
is most frequently found in diseased conditions of
the ovaries, though it is sometimes the result of injuries
received in childhood, or a fall in which the force of the
blow was received upon the lower portion of the spine.
The affection is curable, though in some cases a surgical
operation is required.
</p><p>Dyspareunia, or Painful Connection. &mdash; This disorder
may arise from a great variety of causes. This is
undoubtedly more frequent than is known to physicians,
as women often suffer in this manner for years without
making it known even to their husbands. The suffering
may be the result of fissure of the vagina or rectum,
irritation of the bladder and urethra, vascular growths at
the mouth of the urethra, or sensitive points about the
mouth of the vagina. In some cases it seems to be a
purely nervous affection. Nearly all cases are curable
by the adoption of appropriate means.
</p><p>Urethral Tumors. &mdash; The symptoms are smarting,
burning, or cutting pain, during or after passing the
urine. Sometimes the pain is constant. It is generally
<pb n="547"/>
aggravated by sexual connection. It is often so extreme
as to render the patient's existence a burden, and to
induce great impairment of the general health, by the
constant strain upon the nervous system. Local examination
usually reveals a swollen condition of the glands
at the mouth of the urethra, which is red and often
preceded by a slight vascular growth looking some like a
minute raspberry, very small in size. The author has
met many cases of this sort, but has found the adoption
of proper measures of treatment effective. If a tumor
exists, it must be removed. The operation is not
painful.
</p><p>Bladder Disorders. &mdash; Various disorders of the bladder
are accompanied by frequent or painful passage of urine.
Retention of urine, and dull, aching pain after urination,
are among the most common discomforts to which women
are subject through local diseases. These are, in many
cases, not due to disease of the bladder itself, but to
some irritation of the womb or reflex irritation arising
from disease of the ovaries.
</p><p>Constipation. &mdash; Perhaps the majority of women are
more or less afflicted with constipation. This may be
due to sedentary habits, as well as to the use of concentrated
food and irregularity in attention to the calls of
nature. Most persons suffering in this way become
more or less habituated to the use of laxatives of various
sorts, the tendency of which is to aggravate the disorder,
if long continued.
</p><p>Constipation is one of the most prolific causes of
misplacements, and of congestions and inflammations of the
womb and ovaries, and frequently gives rise to very
serious local troubles. When present, this condition
<pb n="548"/>
is an adequate cause for anxiety, and should receive
prompt attention. By regularity of habits, proper
diet, and such other means as have been recommended
elsewhere in this work, the affection is wholly curable.
</p><p>Chlorosis, or Green Sickness. &mdash; The chief characteristics
of this disorder are the discoloration of the skin
and absence of the menses. The condition occurs most
frequently about the time of puberty, or just afterward.
It is not due, as many suppose, to the suppression of the
menses, but to a morbid condition of the system, which
is itself the cause of deficient activity of the sexual
organs. This disorder is not infrequently the result of
self-abuse. The cause must be sought for and removed.
When this is accomplished, nature will usually effect a
cure within a short time.
</p><p>Lacerations at Childbirth. &mdash; The most common of
all injuries received at childbirth are tears or lacerations
of the neck of the womb, or the perineum. Thousands
of women are suffering with the results of injuries of this
sort, without being aware of their condition. Tears of
the womb are often mistakenly treated as "ulcerations."
The only way in which a radical cure can be effected is
by a proper surgical operation, which in the hands of a
skillful surgeon is attended by little pain, and is radically
curative in its effects. In the treatment of some hundreds
of cases of this sort by operation, we have never
lost a patient, and the results have been in the highest
degree satisfactory. The author does not indorse the
views of some surgeons who hold that every laceration,
however slight, requires an operation; but believes where
a tear exists of sufficient extent to give rise to constant
irritation, the latter cannot be permanently removed by
<pb n="549"/>
other means than an operation. This remark applies to
injuries of the womb. In tears of the perineum, whether
an operation is required or not depends upon the condition
of the vagina and the parts. If greatly relaxed, so
that a rectocele exists, with prolapsus of the womb or
ovaries, or both, an operation is required.
</p><p>Vesico-and Recto-Vaginal Fistul&aelig;. &mdash; In cases of
difficult and prolonged childbirth, the septum between
the rectum and vagina is sometimes injured to such an
extent that a rupture occurs, and an opening is formed
between the bladder and the rectum into the canal.
This opening may be made to close up, in many instances,
by frequent and prolonged vaginal injections with hot
water; but this measure is generally insufficient, and a
permanent opening is formed, causing much inconvenience
and suffering, sometimes producing a most loathsome,
repulsive condition. The only cure for these cases
is through a surgical operation, which can be performed
without risk to life, and with little or no suffering on the
part of the patient, by a surgeon who is skilled and
experienced in this class of cases. There is no operation
a surgeon is called upon to perform in which the results
are more satisfactory than this. The gratitude of the
patient for being rescued from the wretched condition in
which she has been an object of mortification and disgust
to herself, and almost completely ostracized from society,
is unbounded.
</p><p>Tumors of the Womb. &mdash; The worst morbid growths
to which the womb is subjected are polypus and fibroid
tumors. Polypii seldom attain a large size. They are
usually attached to some portion of the canal of the
womb, sometimes by long, slender pedicles. In a case
<pb n="550"/>
recently operated upon by the author, the tumor itself
was not larger than a bean, but was attached by a pedicle
nearly six inches in length.
</p><p>The proper treatment of these growths is removal.
It is usually necessary to treat the point from which the
tumor is taken by means of the galvanic cautery, chromic
acid, or some other escharotic.
</p><p>Fibroid tumors frequently cause profuse hemorrhage
from the womb. The menses gradually grow more frequent
and profuse, until after a time the hemorrhage
becomes nearly continuous. This class of tumors can
usually be removed only by means of a surgical operation.
Occasionally, however, when they develop on the
inner surface of the womb, they are cast off by the efforts
of nature, strangulation and sloughing taking place. The
surgeon is sometimes able to remove fibroid tumors in
this situation by the aid of special instruments devised
for the purpose. Fibroids which occur before the change
of life, usually shrink away and disappear after the
period is passed. The proper management of these
cases consists in the adoption of such measures as
will prevent great loss of blood at the menstrual period,
and keep under control the inflammatory processes
which are likely to be set up.
</p><p>Cancer of the Womb. &mdash; This malady is in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred the result of a neglected tear of
the neck of the womb. It is important that this fact be
generally known, and it should impel persons suffering
with a tear of this sort received at childbirth, to apply
to a competent surgeon for the necessary operation.
Cancer is most successfully treated by prevention. It
is undoubtedly true, however, that in many cases the
<pb n="551"/>
disease in its early stages may be long postponed,
and sometimes entirely eradicated, by operation. The
presence of this disease is indicated by local pain, a
bloody and offensive discharge, great and rapid failure
of the general health, disturbances of the digestion, etc.
Death usually occurs within two years of its commencement.
Its progress may, however, be greatly delayed by
the use of appropriate medicines; hence patients suffering
in this way should not be abandoned, but should
receive the attention of a skilled surgeon.
</p><p>Deficient Development of the Womb and Ovaries.
 &mdash; This condition is indicated by the failure of the
menstrual period to make its appearance at the proper age,
sometimes a masculine appearance of the patient, and
frequently a slight growth of hair upon the upper lip.
Cases of this sort require very skillful management, and
should not be neglected. No good can be derived from
the use of medicines of any sort, but such methods of
treatment should be adopted as will improve the general
nutrition, upon which the disorder depends.
</p><p>Ovarian Tumor. &mdash; This condition, sometimes known
as ovarian dropsy, was formerly regarded as an utterly
hopeless malady; but it can be cured in a great majority
of cases by removal of the diseased ovary, with the
morbid growth which has developed. This operation,
known as <hi rend="italic">ovariotomy</hi>, is one of the greatest triumphs of
modern surgery. The cysts usually present in these
cases sometimes attain enormous size. In one case
operated upon by the author, the tumor weighed upwards
of fifty pounds, while the total weight of the person
after the operation was less than one hundred pounds.
When the morbid growth becomes as large as it was in
<pb n="552"/>
this case, the danger to life from the operation is greatly
increased, not only by the great size, but by the inflammation
excited by the enormous pressure to which the
surrounding tissues are subjected, causing adhesion to
the abdominal walls. It was formerly supposed that
operation in these cases should be deferred until the
tumor had acquired considerable size; but it is now
generally considered by the best practitioners that it
should be performed at as early a date as possible, and
patients managed in this way recover in a very large
proportion of cases. In the great Samaritan Hospital of
London, the eminent Spencer Wells has performed upwards
of one hundred and twenty such operations without
a single death.
</p><p>Stricture of the Neck of the Womb. &mdash; Constriction
of some portion of the neck of the womb is a not
infrequent condition. The constriction is usually located at
the inner end of the canal, though it may occur at any
point. The usual symptom is pain at the menstrual
period, and catarrh is sometimes present in the latter
condition, when produced by other causes. This malady
may be remedied by the proper surgical operation.
</p><p>Floating Tumor. &mdash; A movable tumor, usually a little
larger than the egg of a goose, sometimes exists in
women who have borne children in rapid succession,
especially women of small size who have borne very
large children. It is usually found upon the right side,
and by lying upon the back it may disappear, or be
pressed up under the ribs, but falls down again as soon
as the vertical position is assumed. The movable body
consists of a kidney which, with its attachments, has
become loosened from its usual position at the back of
<pb n="553"/>
the abdominal cavity. Owing to this fact, the tumor is
sometimes known as a floating kidney. A radical cure
cannot be effected, either by surgical means or medical
treatment, but great relief will be afforded the patient
by the wearing of a proper abdominal supporter.
</p><p>Relaxed Abdomen. &mdash; The relaxed condition of the
abdominal wall frequently present in women who have
borne a number of children, and in which the abdominal
walls have been greatly distended during pregnancy, is
often not only a source of great inconvenience, but a
cause of serious disease. The abdominal walls normally
support themselves in position; but when thus distended,
they allow the stomach and intestines to fall into the
lower portion of the abdominal cavity, thus bringing
pressure upon the pelvic organs, which in turn become
displaced, and otherwise diseased. Tight-lacing or the
wearing of heavy skirts suspended from the waist, and
the wearing of corsets, are very common predisposing
causes of this condition.
</p><p>Imperforate Hymen. &mdash; Through over-development,
the hymen is sometimes imperforate, thus retaining the
menstrual flow, and producing the appearance of delayed
menstruation, when the function is really properly
performed, the menstrual flow accumulating within the
cavity of the womb or vagina. These cases of course
require the services of a surgeon. A condition much
more frequent than the foregoing is one in which the
hymen, while not imperforate, is developed to such an
extent that the vaginal orifice is nearly closed, and the
membrane sufficiently firm and unyielding to present
an obstacle to coitus, requiring the services of a surgeon,
though occasioning no difficulty before marriage.

</p><p>Tumor of the Breast. &mdash; The most common tumors of
the breast are fibrous, encysted growths. These growths
are usually attended by more or less pain, but are not
dangerous to life, and rarely if ever develop into cancer.
Sometimes, however, they occasion so much distress that
a surgical operation is necessary. This should always
be performed when there is the slightest ground for
believing that it may be malignant in character. To Dr.
T. Thomas, of New York, is due the credit of devising a
method of operation by which these growths may be
removed without disfigurement, even the slightest scar
produced being completely hidden.
</p><p>Cancer of the Breast. &mdash; This formidable disease
seems to be rapidly increasing in frequency, notwithstanding
the great number of sure cures which have
been so largely advertised during the last century.
The symptoms of cancer of the breast are hard and painful
swelling in the breasts, causing, when somewhat
advanced, retraction of the nipple. These growths are
much more painful than those described under the head of
"Tumor of the Breast." The proper treatment consists
of thorough removal of the affected parts by operation.
This method is wholly superior to any of the forms of
plasters and caustics which are usually employed by the
so-called cancer doctors.
</p><p>The efficacy of the methods employed by cancer
doctors is greatly overestimated by the public, the
majority of the cases operated upon by them being growths
of a simple character, which never would have done any
harm if left alone, and would not have returned, whatever
method had been employed in their removal.
</p><p>Hysteria. &mdash; From the most remote ages of medical
<pb n="555"/>
history, this disease has been regarded as intimately
connected with morbid states of the female organs of
generation, especially the uterus. That it is not
exclusively produced by causes of this kind, is evidenced
by the fact that men also sometimes suffer from this
curious malady. The phases which it assumes are so
numerous that we shall not attempt an accurate description
of it; neither is this required, as there are few who
are not familiar with its peculiar manifestations. It
simulates almost every disease. Even consumption and
other formidable maladies have been so completely simulated
by this disorder as to deceive physicians of long
experience. We have met cases in which young ladies
were supposed to be in the last stages of pulmonary disease,
were apparently gasping almost their last breath,
panting, coughing, and experiencing the usual symptoms
which accompany tuberculous disease of the lungs, when
upon making a thorough physical examination of the
chest, we could find no evidence of pulmonary disease.
In one case we incurred the everlasting displeasure of a
young lady by disclosing the real state of affairs; but
we were repaid by seeing an immediate disappearance of
the symptoms, and complete recovery within six weeks,
although the young woman had been considered hopelessly
ill by her friends and physician for six months,
and was tenderly watched over, petted, and mourned by
friends as one who must soon fall a victim to fell
disease.
</p><p>The foundation of this disease is almost always laid
in some indiscretion by means of which disease of the
uterus is induced. Not infrequently it is the result of
self-abuse. The disease should not be regarded as a
<pb n="556"/>
trivial matter, which is wholly the result of a diseased
imagination, and requires only mental treatment, since
it is a real malady, dependent upon morbid states of the
system. It requires substantial and thorough treatment
as much as rheumatism, dyspepsia, or any other of the
numerous diseases to which humanity is subject. Persons
suffering in this way usually have low vitality, a
great loss of nerve tone, excessive irritability, and
deficient will-power. They should be taught that by the
exercise of sufficient will-power, the peculiar manifestations
of the disease may be controlled.</p>

<head>Diseases Peculiar to Men.</head>
<p>
OF that quite numerous class of maladies which are
peculiar to the male sex, by far the great majority
are the result of some form of transgression of
sexual law. The nature of these transgressions
has been fully discussed in previous portions of this
work, and what has already been said need not be
reiterated here. The object of this chapter is to describe
in greater detail than has been done in other portions of
the work, the nature and symptoms of the various diseases
of the male sexual organs.
</p><p>The intimate association of all the various important
functions of the body through the means of reflex nervous
activity, lays the foundation for that profound and
extensive influence upon the system at large which is
observed to result from nearly all forms of sexual
disease. It is, indeed, a common observation that local
disorders so slight in character as to produce little or no
inconvenience at the seat of disease, provoke, through
morbid reflex influence, derangements in other portions
of the body of the most serious and often most distressing
character. Thus we not infrequently find, as the result
of a slight irritability of the prostatic urethra, nervous
debility, dyspepsia, emaciation, and a great variety
of other marked and distressing symptoms. This fact
emphasizes the importance of giving to this class of dis-<pb n="558"/>
orders careful and thorough attention. Quite frequently
they are overlooked or neglected, even for years. Perhaps
the patient, through ignorance, imagines the symptoms
which he observes, to be of little consequence, and
thinks that they will pass away without special attention;
or it may be that he is deterred by shame or false
modesty from communicating the facts of his condition to
his medical adviser, and thus a disorder which at the
beginning might have been promptly corrected by the
employment of the simplest measures, or perhaps would
have required nothing more than a few words of good
advice, by long continuance acquires a chronic form, and
through the occurrence of tissue changes, becomes so
thoroughly fixed that the most skillful and persevering
treatment is necessary to effect its removal.
</p><p>The popular idea that time cures most diseases, is
erroneous. The fact is, time does not cure. Nature
cures, but time kills. Such acute maladies as active
congestion, fevers, inflammations, and the like, pass through
a regular cycle of changes, and by the unaided efforts of
nature, will usually end in recovery. Chronic maladies,
on the other hand, to which belong most sexual diseases,
are of a different character. Chronic disease tends
almost invariably to the production of changes in the
tissues which serve to propagate and intensify the disorder,
thus leading farther and farther away from the
standard of health.
</p><p>The difference between acute and chronic disorders
has been very aptly compared to that between a straight
line and a circle. One traveling a circle, sooner or later
arrives at the starting-point. This is the course of an
acute disease. One who travels in a straight line, is
<pb n="559"/>
continually increasing the distance between himself and
the starting-point. This is the course of a chronic
disease. We wish to protest against the popular fallacy
referred to, which leads hundreds to delay giving proper
attention to the morbid symptoms which they experience,
until so grave a condition is reached that recovery is
impossible.
</p><p>We do not wish to produce unnecessary alarm or
anxiety on the part of any, and would discourage in the
most emphatic manner that morbid seeking after symptoms,
dwelling upon and exaggerating every little deviation
from the natural condition of the body, which is
commonly met among those who are suffering with
maladies of the class considered in this chapter. In
consequence, thousands of those who are suffering with the
slightest ailments, imagine themselves to be much worse
than they are. Great harm is done by those who
unscrupulously take advantage of the ignorance and
inexperience of these sufferers, and thereby produce, not
only unnecessary alarm and distress, but an actual
aggravation of the slight disorders from which they are
suffering.
</p><p>We cannot, in this chapter, consider the entire category
of diseases to which men are peculiarly liable, but
shall confine our remarks to those maladies which are of
most common occurrence, and information concerning
which will be likely to be of the greatest value. As has
been previously stated, this work does not permit us to
enter into the details of medical treatment which, in
these disorders, may often be best left in the hands of a
competent physician; or when they may be chiefly
administered by the patient himself, should be directed by
<pb n="560"/>
one whose study and experience have fitted him to
modify and adapt to each individual case the general
principles of treatment which have been elsewhere laid
down.
</p><p>The principal object in presenting this chapter has
been to thoroughly acquaint the reader with the signs of
disease in the portions of the body considered, and the
consequences of neglecting to give timely and thorough
attention to these disorders before, by long continuance,
they become difficult of eradication, if not wholly incurable.
</p><p>Spermatorrh&oelig;a. &mdash; Used in its most general sense,
this term applies to all forms of disease of the sexual
organs accompanied by involuntary seminal losses. In
a more technical sense, it relates only to a condition in
which there is an unconscious escape of the seminal fluid
connected with the passage of urine or movement of the
bowels. It is in the latter sense that the term is here
used. This disease is not so frequent as has been
supposed by many; and on the other hand, it is not so
rare an affection as many medical writers have seemed
to think. There are those who claim to believe that
the disease occurs so infrequently that it is scarcely
worthy to be considered a distinct disorder. After
carefully investigating several hundred cases of diseases
peculiar to men, we have come to believe that it is by
no means so rare a disease as is generally supposed to
be the case, having determined the presence of spermatozoa
by microscopical examination in a large number of
cases in which a discharge occurred after urinating or
while straining at stool.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Symptoms</hi>. &mdash; The leading symptoms of true spermatorrh&oelig;a
<pb n="561"/>
are headache; dullness of intellect; loss of
power to concentrate the mind; defective memory;
occasionally, partial deafness; roaring in the ears;
giddiness; spots before the eyes; blurring of vision; short
breath; sensation of weight or stricture in the chest;
various forms of dyspepsia, such as sour stomach, or
heaviness at the stomach; sleepiness after meals;
constipation of the bowels; dry skin; abnormal sensitiveness
of the skin; crawling, tingling, and other peculiar
sensations of the arms or legs; twitching of the muscles;
pressure in the back of the head; weakness of the eyes;
general stiffness in the muscles, and lack of muscular
vigor; back-ache, especially in the lower portion of the
back, in the morning, or after muscular effort; great
depression of spirits; melancholy; sometimes a disposition
to commit suicide; insanity; unsteadiness of gait; severe
pains in various parts of the body; flushing of the face;
palpitation; loss of flesh; tenderness of the spine; pain
in one side; impotence; numbness, coldness, and other
abnormal sensations of the sexual organs, which are
likely to be in a relaxed and shrunken condition, and of
a bluish color; pain in the spermatic cord, and sometimes
in the groin, and also at times a dragging pain in the
testicles, which are sometimes tender; smarting or burning
sensations when passing urine or afterward; a
troublesome dribbling after relieving the bladder;
unnatural excitability of the parts; twitching of the
muscles at the fork of the thighs; frequent or involuntary
erections; epilepsy; paralysis; symptoms of consumption.
Lastly, as a symptom characteristic of this
disease, we should mention the escape of a whitish fluid
in greater or less quantities after passing urine or straining
at stool.
<pb n="562"/>
</p><p>In the majority of these cases there is to be found an
exceedingly irritable condition of the prostatic urethra,
and, indeed, not infrequently of the whole urethral canal.
This may be discovered by passing the finger into the
rectum, and pressing against the prostate gland and the
tissues just in front of it. In severe cases, a pressure
upon the perineum and the under surface of the penis,
close to the body, will show exquisite tenderness of
these parts. An intense burning or smarting on passing
urine is frequently present, indicating the same condition.
</p><p>It must not be supposed that all the above symptoms
are present in any one case; but a large majority will
be found in well-pronounced cases of this disorder.
Sometimes stricture may be present.
</p><p>Spermatorrh&oelig;a sometimes exists, not as a primary
disease, but as a symptom of some other disorder. It is
frequently present in extreme cases of nervous exhaustion,
in convalescence from fever, the debility arising
from pulmonary consumption, and in some cases of
hemorrhoids or other forms of rectal disease.
</p><p>It has been suggested that the tendency to this disease
may be inherited. It is unquestionably true that
some persons are much more liable to the disorder than
those who do not possess the peculiar predisposing
excitability which is so often present in this class of cases.
</p><p>False Spermatorrh&oelig;a. &mdash; It must not be supposed
that true spermatorrh&oelig;a exists in every case in which a
slight discharge is noticed when straining at stool or
after urinating. Probably the majority of cases in
which this symptom occurs, though requiring serious
attention, do not properly belong in this category. A
<pb n="563"/>
slight discharge of this kind is a very common result of
an incompletely cured gonorrh&oelig;a or gleet. Not infrequently,
when a discharge of this kind has existed previously,
and has been apparently cured, excessive sexual
indulgence, taking cold, a constipated condition of the
bowels, or a concentrated and irritating condition of the
urine, may cause it to reappear. The discharge usually
indicates a diseased condition of the urethra, any portion
of which may be affected, though the prostatic portion
is by far the most likely to be the part diseased. In
some cases, however, the difficulty is located in the vesicula
seminalis, the lining membrane of which, like other
portions of the urethral and genital passages, is subject
to catarrh as the result of cold, undue sexual excitement,
or continuous inflammation.
</p><p>Among the results of spermatorrh&oelig;a must be reckoned
the very worst of those physical and mental disasters
which have been enumerated in previous portions
of this work as resulting from self-abuse and other sexual
a excesses. A very common result, but one which has
been until quite recently overlooked, is stricture. This
severe and painful disorder most commonly occurs as the
result of the violent, acute inflammation of gonorrh&oelig;a,
especially when prolonged in the form of gleet. In cases
of spermatorrh&oelig;a, however, it appears to be the result
of long-continued congestion and irritation of the mucous
membrane of the urethral canal, resulting in changes in
the mucous membrane, which sooner or later produce
more or less narrowing of the parts, or stricture. The
amount of stricture produced in this way is not often so
great as to produce complete obstruction, and is quite
likely to be overlooked; but it may be quite sufficient
<pb n="564"/>
to occasion a vast deal of suffering, and set up morbid
processes in the bladder and other urinary passages, the
result of which may be the worst possible.
</p><p>The possibility of the existence of this condition
renders it important that every person suffering from
this disease should consult a thoroughly skilled and
competent physician, in order that the real state of his case
may be ascertained.
</p><p>The causes of stricture are such as have been already
enumerated in previous portions of this work. Self-abuse
and excessive venery are unquestionably its prime
causes; and when these exist, no measures of treatment
are effective, unless all the causes are removed. All
the hygienic measures which have been enumerated
elsewhere as essential to the successful treatment of the
results of self-abuse, must be brought to bear in these
cases. Whenever possible, the patient should place
himself under the care of a conscientious and skillful
physician. The weakened will-power and loss of moral
tone which usually exist in these cases, render the
services of a physician most important, as very few of
those suffering in this way have sufficient self-command
and decision of character to pursue, for any length of
time, the rigid and systematic efforts necessary for the
eradication of the effects of long-continued wrong doing.
</p><p>The opinion expressed by many physicians when
called upon by patients suffering in this way, that the
disease is one of little consequence, and probably does
not exist at all, often leads to great mischief; and
certainly, when such an opinion is given without a close
and critical investigation of the case, the patient may
well doubt the individual's competence to deal with dis-<pb n="565"/>
orders of this class. Those who have had much to do
with cases of this sort, have become thoroughly convinced,
not only of their great frequency, but of the fact that their
successful treatment requires the most painstaking
efforts, and the exercise of the highest skill, not only in
the selection and the application of remedial measures to
the diseased parts, but in the education and discipline of
the patient so as to secure his full co-operation in carrying
out those measures of treatment and regimen elsewhere
suggested, such as proper diet, exercise, abstinence,
etc., which are more important than any medicinal
remedies that can be employed.
</p><p>In the treatment of this disease, it should be
thoroughly understood that the danger to the system consists,
not in the loss of seminal fluid, though unquestionably
this is a serious drain upon the vital forces of
patients suffering in this way, but in the nervous
exhaustion arising from reflex nervous action, which
ultimately results in general debility and derangement of
the whole system. The irritable condition of the diseased
surfaces of those portions of the urethra usually
affected, occasions a morbid irritability of the nerve
centers of the lower portion of the spine, which have charge
of this part of the body, and from this the irritation is
propagated to other portions of the central nervous system.
It is by this means that the digestive organs,
lungs, heart, and in fact every portion of the body,
suffer, even in an extreme degree, as the result of this
disorder. Such methods of special treatment should be
employed as have been indicated in previous portions of
this work, in which the subject has been discussed as
fully as the character and scope of the volume will
permit.
<pb n="566"/>
</p><p>Seminal Weakness or Nocturnal Losses. &mdash; The
great prevalence of masturbation among boys and young
men, and marital excesses among married men, has rendered
the existence of genital weakness so common that
many physicians have come to believe that the occurrence
of seminal losses during sleep is a perfectly normal
condition, if not too frequently repeated. Extensive
observation, however, has convinced the writer that this
opinion is an error, and that in a man who is in perfect
health, physically, mentally, and morally, such a thing as
involuntary seminal losses will not occur, either sleeping
or waking.
</p><p>This diseased condition, for such we consider it to be
under all circumstances, is not solely the result of self-abuse, however, as it may arise from any form of sexual
abuse, as has been pointed out in previous portions of
this work. Unquestionably, the underlying cause of the
disease consists in a great number of circumstances
relating to diet, matters of regimen, social surroundings,
etc., pertaining to our modern civilization, which are
directly calculated to stimulate the sexual propensities to
abnormal activity.
</p><p>The occurrence of an emission during sleep, indicates
excessive irritability and want of nerve tone on the part
of the nerve centers controlling the sexual organs. In a
state of health, the influence of the brain or the nervous
system alone is not sufficient to produce seminal ejaculation,
the natural stimulus of coitus or the abnormal one
of masturbation being required to compel the receptacles
of this most precious of all vital fluids to yield up their
contents. When the controlling nerve centers have been
weakened by disease, however, and still further weakened
<pb n="567"/>
by the general lowering of nerve tone during sleep,
even the slight stimulus of a passing dream may be
sufficient to produce the involuntary actions by which the
emission is occasioned. In many cases in which the
disease has not reached this advanced stage, the emission
does not occur during sleep except when conditions
especially favoring it exist, such as the presence of
undigested food in the stomach, loaded bowels, a full bladder,
supine position, excessive heat from too much covering,
or some similar cause of abnormal sexual excitement.
After the disease has made further advancement,
however, causing all additional loss of tone on the part
of the sexual centers, the circumstances mentioned,
while still favoring the occurrence of the emissions, are
not essential to provoke it, as it will often occur with
most distressing frequency, even when all unfavorable
conditions are carefully avoided.
</p><p>After the malady has made still further progress,
the nerve centers become weakened to such a degree
that the same involuntary discharge may occur through
the excitement of impure thoughts, even while the
patient is wide-awake. Another step in advance, and
that most deplorable condition is reached in which
seminal losses occur without erotic thoughts, and even
without the slightest degree of sexual excitement of any
sort, a condition known as <hi rend="italic">spermatorrh&oelig;a</hi>, or spermatorrhagia,
which is considered under another head.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Symptoms</hi>. &mdash; The leading symptoms of this disorder
are pain in the lower portion of the back, various forms
of headache, debility, pressure at the back of the head,
fullness in the forehead with a general sense of oppression
in the head, confusion of thought, dullness of mind,
<pb n="568"/>
want of mental or physical energy, mental abstraction,
irritability of temper, nervousness, fickleness, morbid
fears, melancholy, roaring and various sounds in the
ears, specks before the eyes, tenderness of the eyeballs
and sensitiveness of the eyes to light, dark rings under
the eyes, muscular twitching, wandering pains in various
parts of the body, numbness and other peculiar sensations
in the arms and legs, symptoms of indigestion, constipation
of the bowels, sediment in the urine, irregularity of
the urinary excretion as to quantity, great sexual
excitability or sexual apathy, seminal losses occurring during
sleep either with or without dreams, smarting and burning
of the urethra during or after urinating, dribbling
after urination, sense of weight, pain, or uneasiness in
the testicles, tenderness or dull pains in the perineum or
fork of the thighs, and various other symptoms too
numerous to mention.
</p><p>It should be stated, however, in this connection, that
not infrequently the patient attributes to this disorder
many symptoms which are wholly foreign to it, and
which arise from other diseases that happen to be
present with it. The patient is pretty certain to make
close and frequent examinations of the sexual organs,
and to notice the slightest deviations from what he
considers to be the standard of health, as the result of
which he not infrequently becomes unnecessarily alarmed,
imagining that there is wasting of the parts, or other
abnormal conditions which do not really exist. This
tendency is greatly encouraged by the quackish advertisements
found in the newspapers and scattered about the
country in lying circulars, sent out by mercenary
charlatans, in which are to be found grossly exaggerated de-<pb n="569"/>
scriptions of the disease and its effects, which are well
calculated to excite in the highest degree, ignorant and
susceptible young men who may be suffering with any
of the symptoms of this disease.
</p><p>A question of importance must not be overlooked in
this connection: How frequently may emissions occur
without occasioning injury? As has been previously
said, an emission is an indication of an abnormal
condition. However, the abnormality does not amount to
what might properly be called a disease, when the
occurrence is only occasional, and is not followed by any
chronic general or local disturbance. When, however,
an emission occurs with only a few days interval, or
when the occasional occurrence is followed by general
discomfort and physical and mental depression or irritability.
or such local symptoms as smarting after urination,
dribbling after passing urine, etc., serious injury is
being done, and the individual should consider it necessary
to place himself under treatment. It may be said,
in general, that the occurrence of an emission more often
than once in three or four weeks is evidence that the
morbid condition present is sufficiently serious to require
medical attention. This statement will be met by the
claim that plenty of cases may be cited in which losses
have occurred with much greater frequency than this,
for long periods, without apparent injury; but sooner or
later other evidences of disease make their appearance.
In all these cases, injurious results make their appearance
sooner or later, if not in any other way, in the loss of
sexual vigor and the occurrence of prostatic and other
troubles which either do not occur at all in a healthy
person, or are postponed to a late period of advanced
life.
<pb n="570"/>
</p><p>In the treatment of many of these cases, we have
invariably noticed as one of the first symptoms of
improvement that though the seminal losses still continued
without great diminution in frequency, the patient no
longer suffered the great depression of mind and body
which had previously followed their occurrence. This is
a sign of improvement in general nerve tone, by means
of which the disorder will be ultimately controlled.
This change in the advance of the disease toward
health, is directly the reverse of that which occurs in
the march of the disorder in the opposite direction.
Patients may often imagine the emissions are doing no
harm, though occurring with great frequency, simply
because they do not feel any serious effects. But this is
only because the general vital tone is sufficiently great
to withstand for a time the exhausting drain upon the
system; but sooner or later, nervous bankruptcy will
supervene, and the patient will appreciate his true
condition.
</p><p>As regards the treatment of this disorder, it is not
necessary to repeat what has been said in previous portions
of this book, and we cannot attempt to treat the subject
in anything like a complete manner, not only because
our space is limited, but because such a treatise would
not be in conformity with the general character of this
work. The following, however, is what almost any
young man may do to aid himself in recovering from
this disease, in addition to such measures as may be
suggested by a competent physician who has been made
thoroughly cognizant of the peculiarities of the case: &mdash;
</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Diet</hi>. &mdash; Eat only plain and simple food. Avoid
all highly seasoned and stimulating articles of food, such
<pb n="571"/>
as sauces, pepper, pepper-sauce, mustard, and condiments
generally. Also avoid eating too fast, overeating,
and eating hearty and late suppers. Whole-grain
preparations, such as oatmeal, graham mush, cracked wheat,
graham bread, etc., should be freely used, together with
ripe fruit. Meat should be taken sparingly; and when
there is considerable local excitability and irritation, it
should be avoided altogether. All kinds of alcoholic
liquors, including wine, beer, and hard cider, must be
scrupulously avoided, also the use of tobacco in any
form. Strong tea and coffee are highly injurious. The
diet should be made abstemious. Better too little than
too much.
</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Exercise</hi>. &mdash; Plenty of exercise in the open air
should be taken daily. When the employment is
sedentary, dumb-bells, Indian clubs, and other forms of
gymnastics are of great value, and should be taken
regularly. The amount of exercise taken each day
should be equivalent to walking from six to fifteen
miles, according to the strength. Vigorous walking is
one of the best forms of exercise. It is not well, as a
rule, to take a great amount of exercise before breakfast.
Exercise may often be taken to advantage just before
retiring at night. It is useful at this time as a means
of securing a healthy fatigue, which will insure sound
and refreshing sleep.
</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Mental Conditions</hi>. &mdash; The mind should be controlled
with the utmost rigor. Impure thoughts should not be
harbored for a moment. The mind should not be occupied
in the evening with anything of an exciting nature.
</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Treatment</hi>. &mdash; Take a good, thorough sponge or full
bath, using soap, and rubbing vigorously with a coarse
<pb n="572"/>
towel, twice a week. Take a hip bath at 100&deg; three
times a week, just before retiring at night if convenient.
Continue the bath about fifteen minutes. Hot and
cold applications to the lower portion of the spine three
or four times a week, will also be found beneficial; and
when there is great local excitability or smarting after
urinating, hot applications may be made to the perineum
with advantage, using a sponge wet in hot water. When
the bowels are constipated, wear an abdominal bandage,
which should be applied by means of a towel wet in
cold water and wrung-out as dry as possible. Wind it
around the body, and cover with a flannel bandage long
enough to go two or three times around the body.
Change morning and night. After wearing one week,
intermit during the day time. Knead and purcuss the
bowels two or three times a day; and if very obstinate,
resort to the warm water enema, which can be most
conveniently taken by means of a fountain or siphon
syringe.
</p><p>Drink six or eight glasses of hot water in the course
of the day. One hour before a meal, or two or three
hours after, is the best time for taking the water. A
glass or two may be taken with advantage just before
retiring at night. If there is a tendency to atrophy or
shrinkage of the parts, alternate sponging in hot and
cold water daily for ten or fifteen minutes will be
found beneficial.
</p><p>Diurnal Losses. &mdash; Under the head of diurnal emissions
or losses are included every form of seminal discharge
occurring involuntarily during the waking hours. These
discharges are very diverse in character. They usually
occur just before or just after the passage of urine, or
<pb n="573"/>
when straining at stool. However, in the majority of
cases, they are not seminal in character, though there
may be an occasional loss of seminal fluid. This fact
may be ascertained by placing a small portion of the
discharge upon a slip of glass, and putting it in the
hands of a good microscopist for examination. We have
made many examinations of this kind, and while a trace
of seminal fluid has been frequently found, we have
been able to assure most of these patients that the
discharge which they supposed to be seminal in character,
and which had given rise to the gravest apprehensions,
was really wholly of a catarrhal nature, and only significant
as indicating a diseased condition of some portion
of the urinary or genital passages.
</p><p>These discharges should not be looked upon, however,
as insignificant, and not worthy of attention, as they are
always indicative of disease. The nature of the disease
presents as various forms as do the discharges
themselves. Several varieties are observed, which may be
enumerated as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>1. The most common of all discharges of this kind is
a clear, viscid secretion, much resembling the white of
an egg, which escapes from the orifice of the urethra
either before or after urination, or after an erection,
following some degree of sexual excitement. This discharge
is from the small glands located in the prostatic
urethra, and is a perfectly natural secretion. Too great
an amount, however, indicates abnormal irritability of the
membrane of the locality from which it comes, and hence
is deserving of attention.
</p><p>2. An opaque mucous secretion which is formed in the
seminal vesicles. This secretion may be either due to
<pb n="574"/>
catarrh of the parts named, or may be a natural secretion
squeezed out by the pressure of hardened feces in the
act of moving the bowels. A similar discharge, noticed
after urinating and after a movement of the bowels, may
be the result of a chronic irritation or inflammation of
some portion of the urethral canal, and in such a case
requires thorough and careful treatment.
</p><p>3. Lastly, we mention a milky looking fluid, in
quantity varying from one or two drops to half a
teaspoonful, escaping at the beginning or end of urination,
which is found to contain a greater or less quantity of
spermatozoa.
</p><p>All discharges from the urethra are liable to contain
spermatozoa in greater or less quantities, either as the
result of a relaxed condition of the openings of the
ejaculatory ducts, which allows the semen contained in the
seminal vesicles to escape, or often as the result of
constipation of the bowels, the seminal fluid being mechanically
forced out of the seminal vesicles by the pressure
of the hardened contents of the bowels. These
discharges may occur with very great frequency, or only
at long intervals. When of very infrequent occurrence,
their significance is not very great; but when, as is
sometimes the case, they occur daily, the condition
should receive prompt attention.
</p><p>Sometimes the discharge of seminal fluid is backward
into the bladder, and so mixed with the urine that attention
is not called to it, and the patient is wholly unaware
of the mysterious disease which is undermining his
health, and goes from one physician to another seeking
to find the real cause of his malady and the proper remedy,
but obtaining no relief. We have met a number of
<pb n="575"/>
cases of this sort, in some of which the amount of seminal
fluid lost in this way, and the constancy of the
symptom, quite exceeded any conception which we had
previously formed of cases of this sort. The only method
of detecting these cases is for the physician to adopt as
a routine practice the plan of making a careful microscopical
examination of the urine in every case.
</p><p>All urethral discharges, of whatever character, should
be subjected to careful microscopical scrutiny, as by this
means only, can their real character be determined. We
have frequently found seminal fluid present when it was
least suspected, and when the small quantity discharged
was supposed to be simply a little urethral mucus or
prostatic fluid. The significance of these discharges is
not in proportion to the quantity. Even the very slight
amount of discharge, if constantly present, is indicative
of a morbid condition, which may in time give rise to the
very worst results. When such a discharge accompanies
seminal losses, or any other form of sexual weakness, it
must certainly be removed before the accompanying
difficulty can be entirely relieved. The sediment which
appears in the urine, as a general thing, has nothing to
do with the discharges. These sediments usually consist
of phosphates or urates, though sometimes there is more
or less mucus present. When this is the case, whitish
threads will be observed to float upward from the mass
collected at the bottom of the vessel. When the deposit
consists of urates, the urine is clear when first passed,
the sediment only appearing after the urine has cooled.
Phosphates appear in the urine when first voided, often
giving to it a milky appearance, the cause of which is
likely to be attributed to the presence of a large quantity
<pb n="576"/>
of seminal fluid. It is exceedingly rare, however, that
spermatozoa are present in so great a quantity as to
give the urine this appearance.
</p><p>The ordinary results of these emissions, when long
continued, are the following: &mdash;
</p><p>1. The most constant of all the morbid conditions
resulting from this discharge is a weakened condition of
the organs affected. The functional activity of the sexual
organs is perhaps more easily disturbed than is
found to be the case with any other organ or system of
organs in the body. This is the wise provision of nature
for the protection of the rest of the body, which suffers
more profoundly from excessive exercise of the sexual
function than from any other form of abnormal functional
activity. Hence, when great excesses of this sort are
indulged in, nature kindly takes away the power for
indulgence, and thus prevents that utter destruction
of the body which results from the continued exhausting
drain to which the system might otherwise be
subjected. When diurnal emissions of any sort occur,
the sexual organs are also seriously diseased, and
morbid processes are at work which are very certian{sic} to result
ultimately in serious loss of sexual vigor. Cases in
which the discharge is distinctly of a seminal character,
were formerly considered to be practically hopeless; but
by proper management, and with the aid of improved
methods, these cases are known to be amenable to
treatment, and it is probable that nearly all cases, if not every
one, may be substantially cured by the adoption of the
proper measures.
</p><p>2. General nervous debility is another of the most
prominent results of these losses. This arises, not so
<pb n="577"/>
much from the drain upon the system of the frequent
discharge, but from the morbid reflex influence of the
local irritation, which gives rise to the discharge. The
patient is much given to melancholy, and sometimes
approaches almost to the border-line of insanity in
consequence of the mental distress arising from the
knowledge of his real condition, or from apprehension of a
condition more grave than that which really exists.
</p><p>3. Various diseases of the bladder and portions of
the urinary passages are often present in these cases, and
very frequent, difficult, or painful urination. Smarting
or burning at the beginning of the act of urination is a
very constant symptom, to which is usually added a
persistent and annoying dribbling of urine after evacuation
of the bladder. This is due to the relaxed and
weakened condition of the muscles of the urethra, and
their failure to contract promptly, so as to expel the last
portion of the urine. A similar condition of relaxation
affects the mouths of the ejaculatory ducts, which causes
them to remain open, allowing the escape of seminal
fluid.
</p><p>4. Dyspepsia in some one of its various forms is very
frequently an accompaniment of this disorder, and is a
direct cause of a great share of the debility and distress
arising from it, which are usually attributed to the
seminal losses, though not directly due to them.
</p><p>When a person discovers himself to be affected with
discharges of this sort, he should consider the matter one
deserving of immediate and careful attention until every
vestige of the disease is removed. The penalty of
neglecting to attend to the matter with promptness will
usually be, in the most favorable cases, early loss of
<pb n="578"/>
sexual vigor, and in the great majority of cases, some
worse form of sexual disease, and all the various
accompanying symptoms which have been pointed out. The
only methods of treatment which can be advantageously
employed by the patient himself are such as have been
already described as useful in other forms of sexual
disease.
</p><p>The question of marriage has been discussed elsewhere
in this work; but we cannot allow this opportunity
to pass without reiterating the warning that a person
suffering in this way should never think of marrying
until the local disease has been substantially cured, as
the deepest regret and intensification of suffering are
almost certain to result when a contrary course is taken.
</p><p>Diseased Prostate. &mdash; One of the most common
accompaniments of the disease previously described, is some
form of prostatic disorder. Perhaps the most common
of these is irritable prostate, a disease in which the
affected part is sensitive to pressure, as may be
discovered by introducing the finger into the rectum, and
pressing in the direction of the bladder. The irritability
is sometimes so great as to occasion pain or uneasiness
in sitting, there being constantly a dull, aching pain in
the perineum, or fork of the thighs. This condition may
be the result of chronic or acute inflammation, but most
often results from sexual excesses of some form. In
cases of nocturnal losses or spermatorrh&oelig;a, this condition
is a frequent cause of the continuance and aggravation of
the disorder, occasioning undue excitement of the parts,
and weakening of the nerve centers which have control
over these organs, lowering their tone, and thus engendering
the very conditions upon which this disorder
<pb n="579"/>
chiefly depends. Persons suffering in this way generally
complain of smarting during or after the evacuation of
the bladder.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Acute Inflammation of the Prostate</hi> is generally the
result of excessive sexual excitement, alcoholic indulgence,
extension of gonorrh&oelig;al inflammation, or severe
treatment of the urethra by means of irritating injections,
and the careless use of sounds. Exposure of the
parts to dampness and cold, as in sitting upon the
ground or a wet board, has occasioned the disease.
</p><p>The most common symptoms are a sensation of
weight and fullness about the rectum and perineum, and
an urgent desire to pass water, with uneasiness at the
neck of the bladder. When the urine is passed, more or
less pain is experienced at the close of the act. When
the inflammation attains a high degree of intensity, the
pain becomes throbbing and shooting in character.
There is a sensation of great fullness and tenderness in
the parts, also pain in the back when sitting. Great
pain is experienced in the movement of the bowels,
and in severe cases there may be obstruction of the
urinary passages. The patient may suffer from chilliness,
and generally has more or less fever. If the
finger is placed in the rectum, the prostate gland is
found to be more or less swollen and throbbing. If the
patient remains quiet in bed, the recovery is generally
quite speedy, though the gland is often left in an irritable
and enlarged condition, and is liable to the occurrence of
similar attacks, or the continuance of the inflammation
in a chronic form, in which the same symptoms are
experienced, though with a less degree of intensity.
There is also more or less discharge, cloudiness of urine,
<pb n="580"/>
and much difficulty and pain in passing the urine.
Excessive exercise and the use of irritating foods
aggravate the symptoms in the chronic as well as the acute
form of the disease.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Enlargement of the Prostate</hi> is usually the result of
acute or chronic inflammation, though it is not
infrequently found in elderly persons and those who have
been addicted to great excesses, without the occurrence
of the acute form of the disease. Enlargement of the
prostate is considered by some to be a necessary
accompaniment of old age; but this is certainly not the case,
though it is probable that fully one-third of all men who
have attained the age of fifty years have more or less
enlargement of the part.
</p><p>Many persons have a considerable degree of enlargement
of the prostate without being aware of the fact,
the increase in size being so gradual that it is not
observed until so great a degree of obstruction to the
passage of urine is produced as to require a considerable
degree of voluntary expulsive force. The size of the
stream is not usually lessened, but the force is greatly
diminished. The patient urinates with much greater
frequency than usual, and as the disease advances,
considerable irritability and discomfort in the rectum is
occasioned by the frequent and violent straining efforts
required to evacuate the bladder. After a time, the
obstruction becomes so great that the bladder cannot be
fully evacuated by any effort on the part of the patient.
When it becomes greatly distended, a small quantity of
urine may be forced out by violent efforts, and during
sleep a sort of overflow occurs, which may be the first
symptom to which the patient's attention is seriously
<pb n="581"/>
directed. The retained urine decomposes, becoming
alkaline, irritating the mucous membrane, and setting up
a catarrh or inflammation of the bladder and a great
variety of attendant disorders and inconveniences which,
if neglected, may lead to fatal results. We have
frequently met cases of this kind in which the bladder
contained almost incredible quantities of urine which had
probably been retained for weeks. In some cases,
possibly the bladder had not been fully emptied for
months.
</p><p>The very same measures which have elsewhere been
recommended for local congestion, particularly hot sitz
baths, hot fomentations to the lower portion of the spine
and the perineum, are among the most useful measures
in these cases. The same regimen as to diet should be
followed as has been indicated for other sexual
disorders, particularly the avoidance of all stimulating
foods, tobacco, alcoholics, tea, coffee, etc. It is
important, however, that the patient should avoid violent
exercise, and that total abstinence as regards sexual
indulgence should be observed until the disease is
thoroughly cured.
</p><p>Stricture. &mdash; A contraction, or stricture, of any portion
of the urethral canal is usually the result of the acute
inflammation of gonorrh&oelig;a, or the chronic irritation
and inflammation of gleet. All grades of stricture
exist in different cases, from a very slight narrowing of
the canal, to complete obstruction. The idea that a
stricture does no harm if it does not very materially
obstruct the passage of urine, is a popular error which
should be corrected. Any considerable degree of narrowing
of the canal, whether sufficient to present a
<pb n="582"/>
serious obstacle to the evacuation of the bladder or not,
is a serious matter, and requires the attention of a
competent surgeon. Such a contraction is usually
sufficient to maintain a gleety discharge, and a chronic
irritability which is likely to result in early loss of
sexual vigor, or some other form of sexual disorder.
</p><p>Stricture is not always the result of gonorrh&oelig;a
or acute inflammation of the urethra, but may, and
frequently does, result from the practice of self-abuse, or
may often be occasioned by a long continuance of nocturnal
emissions which may have been occasioned by
mental incontinence, even when masturbation has never
been practiced. The earliest symptoms of stricture are
pain and smarting at some point of the urethra during
or after the passage of urine, this part being usually the
seat of the stricture; a slight discharge; frequent
urination; the peculiar form of the stream of urine, which
may be twisted forked, divided, or squirting. Change
in the form of the stream should not, however, be looked
upon as a positive symptom of stricture, as it is not
infrequently occasioned by swelling of the lips of the
orifice of the urethra. Pain in the testicles and back,
and irritation and protrusion of the rectum are frequent
results of violent straining. Retention of the urine is
also a frequent symptom. Sometimes, in consequence
of retention of the urine, it becomes foul in the bladder,
producing irritation of the mucous membrane, and
subsequently catarrh of the bladder. In these cases, the
mucus appears in the urine as a whitish deposit, shreds
of which float through the urine. Blood is sometimes
passed, especially in cases in which the catheter is
frequently used. In advanced cases, the stricture becomes
<pb n="583"/>
so close that the urine can be passed only in drops; and
after a while, constant dripping occurs, due to overflowing
of the bladder, which the patient is unable to empty
by voluntary effort. The bladder becomes greatly
distended, and sometimes nearly paralyzed. Great injury
is occasionally done through rupture of the urethra, from
the violent straining efforts of the patient. There is
generally great impairment of the general health in
these cases. The patient complains of various disorders
of the digestive organs, great pain in the loins and back,
chilliness, followed by fever, especially after the use of
the catheter, which sometimes produces symptoms so
serious as to give rise to what is known as urethral fever.
</p><p>The treatment of stricture is a matter which belongs
exclusively to the skilled surgeon. The man who has
any suspicion whatever that he is suffering with even a
moderate degree of obstruction of the urethral canal,
should at once seek skillful surgical advice. Sometimes
the narrowing of the urethra may exist only at the
orifice, and yet serious results may follow if the matter is
neglected.
</p><p>Balanitis. &mdash; Persons who have a long and rather
tight foreskin, frequently suffer from inflammation of
the mucous membrane which covers the glans penis, or
foreskin. The symptoms are severe burning or itching
of the affected parts, frequently accompanied by violent
erections and great sexual excitement. The foreskin is
red and swollen, sometimes to a very great degree. A
yellowish or whitish discharge of a very disagreeable
odor is also present. The most common cause is neglect
to keep the parts thoroughly cleansed. The only
treatment required in the majority of cases is thorough
<pb n="584"/>
cleansing of the parts three or four times a day with
tepid water. If the disease persists, a slightly astringent
lotion may be applied, and if it is found impossible
to prevent the disease by daily cleansing, a portion of
the redundant prepuce should be removed by a surgeon.
</p><p>When cases of this sort are neglected, thickening
and narrowing of the foreskin is frequently the result,
and this is sometimes so great as to be an obstruction
to the passage of urine. We have met cases in which
the result was an adhesion of the foreskin to the glans
penis.
</p><p>Venereal Warts. &mdash; These morbid growths, which are
usually found upon the edge of the glans or some
portion of the foreskin, are not essentially different from
the warty growths which are to be found upon other
portions of the body. They may occur in chaste persons
as well as those who have been addicted to venereal
excesses, though the latter are much more liable to
suffer from this sometimes very obstinate disorder.
The disease is thought by some to be contagious, but it
is perhaps a question whether this point is fully
established. These warts may be successfully treated by
the employment of the same means as would be
employed in case of warts on any other part of the body.
</p><p>Phimosis. &mdash; This is a condition in which the foreskin
is so tight that it cannot readily be drawn back
over the glans penis. In some cases, the orifice is so
small that there is barely room for the passage of the
stream of urine in the evacuation of the bladder. A
person may be born with this condition, or it may be
the result of long-continued inflammation or irritation.
This matter is one which should receive attention, as the
<pb n="585"/>
irritation arising from phimosis may occasion various
sexual disorders, particularly nocturnal emissions, a
disease which is always aggravated by it, though originally
induced by other causes.
</p><p>As soon as discovered, this condition should be
removed by the proper operation. It is rarely necessary
to resort to the old method of circumcision, as the same
results may be obtained by a less formidable and painful
operation.
</p><p>Paraphimosis. &mdash; This condition is one rarely met with
except in cases of venereal disease, though some years
ago we encountered a very severe case in the person of
a little boy who was suffering from partial phimosis, and
having accidentally drawn the, prepuce over the glans,
was unable to return it. In a short time, so great swelling
occurred that sloughing of the parts was threatened,
when his father brought him to us for relief. Persons
suffering with paraphimosis should not incur the risk of
an accident of this sort. When paraphimosis exists, a
physician should be called, unless by careful manipulation
of the parts they can be readily restored to their
normal condition.
</p><p>Hydrocele. &mdash; This condition, sometimes incorrectly
called dropsy of the testicle, consists in an excessive
accumulation of natural secretion within one of the
coverings of the testicle. The enlargement is usually pear-shaped, with the large end downward, and differs from
hernia in its form, the tumor of hernia being larger at
the upper instead of the lower part. When allowed
to exist for years, hydrocele frequently causes a wasting
of the testicle, and hence should receive attention as soon
as it makes its appearance. It is not necessary to
<pb n="586"/>
describe the methods of treatment required for this
disorder, as a competent surgeon should be consulted.
</p><p>Varicocele. &mdash; This condition consists of a varicose
condition of the spermatic veins. It is a very frequent
malady, probably one-tenth of all males being affected
with it. In chronic cases, the disease is accompanied
by more or less inflammation of the walls of the veins,
causing thickening. The mass of veins sometimes attains
an enormous size. Aside from the enlargement, the
most common symptoms are pain in the testicle and
groin, and a constant dragging sensation, especially when
standing upon the feet, or engaged in active exercise.
In many cases these symptoms are not present to such
an extent as to occasion any inconvenience during the
cold months, but are very troublesome during the
warm season of the year. The disease may be occasioned
by the same causes which produce a varicose
condition of the lower extremities, such as long standing
upon the feet, or excessive walking. A very common
cause is straining at stool. The disease is probably most
frequent in those who have been addicted to self-abuse
and other sexual excesses, though it is by no means
confined to this class. Varicocele occurs most frequently
on the left side, which is probably due to the absence
of valves in the left spermatic vein.
</p><p>The palliative treatment of this disorder consists in
frequent bathing of the parts in cold water, and wearing
a proper suspensory bandage to support the scrotum and
its contents. The only radical method of cure consists
in ligation of the spermatic veins. The old method of
doing this operation was somewhat hazardous, and only
justifiable in severe cases; but the improved methods
<pb n="587"/>
now used are free from danger, and may be performed
without the aid of an an&aelig;sthetic, and without occasioning
any great degree of pain.
</p><p>Impotence. &mdash; Almost the sole cause of impotence is
sexual excess of some kind, and the disease is in a
great number of cases the result of self-abuse and
unnatural coitus. The first symptom of approaching impotence
is too early ejaculation, which is soon followed by loss
of sexual power. The primary cause of the disease is
exhaustion of the nerve centers which control the sexual
organs. In a great share of these cases, nocturnal losses,
or true spermatorrh&oelig;a, is present with all the accompanying
symptoms of this disorder, particularly an irritable
condition of the urethra. The majority of cases of
impotence which have not been seriously mistreated, may be
relieved, if they have not existed for too great a length
of time. In persons far advanced in years, who have
become impotent through the natural decline of the vital
powers, no measure of treatment can afford more than
temporary relief. In young men who are suffering with
complete or partial loss of sexual ability as the result of
excesses, the disease can usually be cured by the adoption
of proper methods in the hands of an experienced
physician. The patient may employ advantageously
the regimen and treatment suggested for seminal weakness,
which will be found of great service in conjunction
with any other measures of treatment that may be
instituted. We would warn persons suffering in this way
against the use of aphrodisiac remedies, or sexual stimulants,
as the ultimate results of such measures are the very
worst possible, and no cases are so hopeless as those
which have been mistreated in this way.
<pb n="588"/>
</p><p>Sterility. &mdash; Sterility is by most men supposed to be
a disease confined almost exclusively to the other sex;
but careful researches have shown that when married
couples are childless, the fault is with the husband in
not less than one case out of six. Want of procreative
power may be due to disease, or deficient development
of the testicles, or entire absence of the organs. It
may also arise from obstruction of some portion of the
seminal ducts, from disease of the seminal fluid, catarrhal
or bloody discharges from some portion of the urinary
passages, too frequent sexual indulgence, seminal losses,
catarrh of the prostate, absence of spermatozoa,
consumption, syphilis, nervous debility, and diseases of the
brain and kidneys. The management of diseases of this
kind requires the greatest skill on the part of the
physician, and cannot be left to the patient himself, and
hence few remarks concerning treatment are needed
here. Many cases are incurable from their very nature;
but cases in which the sterility is the result of abnormal
discharges, are cured by correcting the discharge.
</p><p>Gonorrh&oelig;a. &mdash; This disease, vulgarly known as clap,
was until recently considered a specific disorder, but is
now believed to be simply a catarrhal inflammation of
the urethral mucous membrane, which may be originated
by other causes than that of impure sexual connection.
Intemperance, excessive coitus, leucorrh&oelig;al discharge,
exposure of the perineum to cold, &mdash; all these
and possibly other causes may give rise to a genuine
gonorrh&oelig;al inflammation. The disease is usually
confined to the urethral canal, but may affect other portions
of the penis, as the head of the organ and the foreskin.
Its usual course is from the orifice of the urethra in-<pb n="589"/>
ward. It may be confined to the mucous membrane,
but usually involves the deeper structures. In severe
cases, the inflammation may reach into the surrounding
tissues so extensively as to cause distortion of the shape
of the organ by contraction and obstruction of the
urethral canal, or stricture and various other deformities
may be produced.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Symptoms</hi>. &mdash; The first symptoms of the disease are
usually noticed two or three days after exposure. The
first manifestations are itching, tingling, or simply slight
uneasiness about the meatus, or mouth of the urethra,
which on examination is found to be red and slightly
stuck together by a viscid, colorless secretion. The
discharge is at first very slight, but increases rapidly,
and soon becomes thick and yellowish. On passing
urine, a slight smarting sensation is felt. The disease
may remain at this stage any length of time, from half a
day to two or three days. Sooner or later, however,
the symptoms become much aggravated through extension
of the disease into the deeper portions of the
urethra, and the whole organ becomes swollen and
tender, the discharge thick and green, and the passage
of urine occasions a severe scalding sensation. Violent
erections are frequently experienced, as is also chordee, a
condition in which the organ is drawn into the shape
a bow during erections, a very painful and distressing
condition.
</p><p>In simple cases which pursue a natural course, the
inflammation subsides after one to six weeks; but in
many cases it will continue indefinitely, if not properly
treated, in the form of gleet, which sometimes lasts for
years. In this form of the disease, the discharge may
<pb n="590"/>
be so slight as to be readily overlooked, but may be
detected by pressing the urethra from behind forward. By
this means a few drops of milky discharge can be
squeezed out at the orifice of the urethra.
</p><p>One of the most serious and frequent results of this
disease is stricture, the extent of which may vary from
the very slightest degree of obstruction to complete
closure of the canal. The possible consequences of a
stricture are the very worst imaginable; and a person
who has acquired this unfortunate condition, is certain
to be subjected to many inconveniences, and may be
compelled to endure great suffering therefrom. A person
finding himself afflicted with this disorder, should
at once seek a skillful physician for advice, and should
give the matter serious attention until the disease is
wholly eradicated.
</p><p>Chancroid. &mdash; This disorder, sometimes termed simple
venereal ulcer, was until recently regarded as a form of
true syphilis. It is now known to be simply a local
disease. It is an infectious, eating ulcer, which progresses
rapidly when left to itself, and sometimes destroys a
very considerable portion of the part attacked. The
ulcer usually makes its appearance within one to two
hours after exposure. Buboes, or hard swellings in the
groin, often appear in connection with this disease.
Chancroid, sometimes termed soft chancre, is distinguished
from the ulcer which marks the beginning of
true syphilis by the fact that the tissues surrounding it
are soft, while in true chancre the sore has a hard or
indurated feeling. Another peculiarity of the soft
chancre is that if a portion of the discharge, which is very
copious, is introduced beneath the skin, or applied to a
<pb n="591"/>
raw surface in any way, a new sore is produced, whereas
the sore of true syphilis is not capable of being propagated
by inoculation in the same individual.
</p><p>This disorder requires vigorous and prompt attention;
and a person suffering with it should place himself
immediately under the care of a thoroughly competent
physician. One of the most essential features of the
treatment of this class of cases, is thorough cleanliness.
</p><p>Syphilis. &mdash; The symptoms of this disease are too
numerous for full consideration here, and we can only
notice some of the chief features of the disease. It has
three distinct stages. The first is a local manifestation,
known as <hi rend="italic">chancre</hi>. Two or three weeks, or longer, after
exposure, a small, hard, reddish pimple makes its appearance,
usually upon the genitals, although cases have
occurred in which the disease was contracted by kissing,
when the chancre was formed upon the lip. The pimple
increases in size for a few days, and finally ulcerates,
and discharges slightly. It does not usually give much
inconvenience, and is, in fact, not infrequently unnoticed.
In this respect, chancre differs very materially from
chancroid, &mdash; a very important distinction. After a few days
the glands of the groins become somewhat enlarged,
although not very painful. After one to three months
the secondary stage of the disease appears, as an eruption
of red spots, which are followed by pimples. After
a time, larger pimples or pustules make their appearance,
leaving behind them pock marks like those of small-pox.
Ulcers also appear in some cases. Stimultaneously{sic} with
the occurrence of the eruption, slightly raised spots of
a whitish color, known as <hi rend="italic">mucous patches</hi>, appear on the
mucous membrane of the lips and tongue and throat. A
<pb n="592"/>
slight discharge arises from these patches, which is of a
very contagious character. The patient also has sore
throat, and often sore eyes; and after the general health
has become considerably impaired, suffers greatly with
pain in the head, arms, legs, breast, and particularly
in the joints, though the pain is not confined to them as
in rheumatism. Small swellings, known as <hi rend="italic">nodes</hi>, which
are tender on pressure, appear on the, shins and other
parts.
</p><p>Most of the above symptoms usually disappear after
a few weeks, and the patient may seem to be well for
several months or years; but unless the disease has been
properly treated, it is all the time at work in the system,
and next makes its appearance in the deeper tissues,
particularly in the bones and cartilages of the nose and
skull. Not infrequently the nose is greatly disfigured,
or even wholly destroyed. The liver, lungs, kidneys,
heart, and other internal organs, are also likely lo be
affected. No other disease makes such fearful ravages
in the human constitution as this, or subjects its
victims to such horrible sufferings and disfigurements. It
is also one of the most certainly communicable by heredity,
of all diseases; and it is not possible for a physician
to say to a person suffering with this disease, at
any time, no matter how long treatment has been
received, that he is cured, and may safely marry. Let
every man whose blood is yet pure, consider soberly
whether he can afford to run the fearful risk of contamination
with such a malady.</p>

THE frequent allusion in the preceding chapters of
this work to the necessity for the care of the general
health, and the relation of the various disorders
mentioned to general bodily health, will naturally
have created in the mind of the interested reader a desire
for further information upon this important subject; and
there is no class of persons for whom information of this
character is more desirable, and of greater practical
value if accepted and carried out, than those who are
suffering the results of any of the forms of sexual
transgression which have been referred to in the preceding
chapters. One who finds himself early in life bankrupt
of vitality as the result of squandering his nerve force
and physical energies in the indulgence of vicious
propensities, certainly needs the help of all the aids to
recovery which can be afforded by a knowledge of the

them to a higher plane of existence, to a life of physical
rectitude which is the best foundation for a high grade
of mental and moral culture.
</p><p>It is hoped that in the following pages, which are
made up of somewhat miscellaneous observations upon
health topics, the reader will find much which will
interest him, and which may prove of real and lasting
benefit if adopted in his daily life.
</p><p>Hygiene of the Muscles. &mdash; The following remarks
on this subject are extracted from another work by the
author, "The Home Hand-Book of Domestic Hygiene
and Rational Medicine": &mdash;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">How to Take Exercise</hi>. &mdash; It is not sufficient to simply
take exercise indiscriminately, and without reference to
the object for which it is taken, the manner, time, etc.
It must be taken regularly, systematically, at proper
times, and in proper quantities. Perhaps we cannot do
better in treating this subject practically than to ask and
answer some of the most important questions relating to
this matter.
</p><p>1. When is the best time to exercise? There is a
popular theory extant that exercise taken early in the
morning has some specific virtue superior to that taken
at any other time. After careful observation on the
subject, we have become convinced that this popular
notion is a mistake when adopted as a rule for everybody.
For many busy professional men, especially lawyers,
editors, authors, clergymen, teachers, and others whose
vocations keep them mostly indoors, the morning may be
the only time when exercise can be taken conveniently;
and if not taken at this time it is likely to be neglected
altogether. Such persons, unless they are laboring
<pb n="595"/>
under some special derangement of the health, as
dyspepsia or some other constitutional malady, had
better by far take the morning walk or other form of
exercise than to take none at all. However, we are
pretty well convinced that for most persons the middle
of the forenoon is a much better time to take any kind
of active or vigorous exercise. In the morning, the
circulation is generally weakest, and the supply of nerve
force is the least abundant. In the forenoon, when the
breakfast has been eaten and digestion has become well
advanced, the system is at its maximum of vigor; hence,
if the individual is at liberty to choose his time for
exercise, this should be his choice.
</p><p>For poor sleepers, a half-hour's exercise taken in the
evening not long before retiring, will often act like a
soporific, and without any of the unpleasant after-effects
of drugs.
</p><p>Vigorous exercise should never be taken immediately,
nor within an hour, after a meal, and should not be taken
immediately before eating. Disregard for this rule is a
very common cause of dyspepsia.
</p><p>2. What kind of exercise shall be taken? The
answer to this question must, of course, vary with the
individual. Exercise must be modified to suit the
strength, the age, the sex, and even the tastes of the
individual. As a general rule, persons who take exercise
for health are apt to overdo the matter, the result of
which is damage rather than benefit. For most persons,
there is no more admirable and advantageous form of
exercise than walking; but many find walking simply
for exercise too tedious to persevere in it regularly.
Such will find advantage in walking in companies, pro-<pb n="596"/>
vided care is taken to avoid all such questionable
diversions as walking matches, or any kind of exercise in
which there will be a strife which will be likely to excite
to excess.
</p><p>Horseback-riding, for those who ride well and enjoy
this form of exercise, may be of great benefit. It is not
so well suited for ladies as for men, however, on account
of the awkward and unnatural manner in which custom
compels them to ride. It is impossible for a lady to
ride with the same degree of comfort, ease, and grace
that her male companion may, on account of the one-sided way in which she sits in the saddle. In many
countries, ladies ride in the same manner as men; with
them, of course, this objection does not hold.
</p><p>Horseback-riding is an excellent aid to digestion,
and often effectually relieves habitual constipation of the
bowels.
</p><p>Carriage riding is worth little as a form of exercise
except for very feeble invalids, for whom the gentle
swaying of the vehicle and the excitement of viewing
objects seldom seen may be sufficient and appropriate
exercise. Riding in a lumber wagon over a corduroy
road is about the only kind of carriage riding which is
worth speaking of as exercise for people in ordinary
health.
</p><p>Skating, rowing, racing, base-ball, foot-ball, dancing,
and most other exercises of the sort, are more often
harmful than otherwise, because carried to excess, and
associated with other evils of a pernicious character.
Performance upon the trapeze, boxing, and pugilistic
training, are open to the same objection. Calisthenics,
for school-children and young students, is a most admir-<pb n="597"/>
able form of exercise. It is also well adapted to invalids
who are unable to walk more than a short distance at a
time. In our opinion, every home ought to be fitted
out with all the conveniences for parlor gymnastics.
They afford not only healthful exercise, but a large
amount of excellent amusement for the little folks.
</p><p>For the majority of persons, no form of exercise is
more highly beneficial, healthwise, than some kind of
physical labor. For ladies, general housework is admirably
adapted to bring into play all the different muscles
of the body, while affording such a variety of different
exercises and such frequent change that no part need be
very greatly fatigued. There are thousands of young
ladies pining under the care of their family physician in
spite of all he can do by the most learned and complicated
prescriptions, for whom a change of air or a year's
residence in some foreign clime, or some similar expensive
project, is proposed, when all in the world that is needed
to make the delicate creatures well, is to require them
to change places with their mothers for a few weeks or
months. Let them cease thrumming the piano or guitar
for a time, and learn to cook, bake, wash, mend, scrub,
sweep, and perform the thousand and one little household
duties that have made their mothers and grandmothers
well and robust before them. We made such a prescription
once for a young lady who had been given up to
die of consumption by a gray-headed doctor, and whose
friends were sadly watching her decline, and in six
weeks the young miss was well, and has been so ever
since; but we entailed her everlasting dislike, and have
no doubt that any physician or other person who should
adopt the same course in similar cases will often be
similarly rewarded.
<pb n="598"/>
</p><p>For young men, there is no better or healthier
exercise than sawing and chopping wood, doing chores
about the house, working in the garden, caring for horses
or cows, clearing walks, bringing water, or even helping
their mothers in laundry work. Such exercise is light,
varied, oft changing, and answers all the requirements
for health most admirably. We can heartily recommend
it, and from personal experience, too. We advise all
young men, who can possibly get a chance, to adopt this
form of exercise as being the most certain of bringing
back the largest returns for a given expenditure of force
of any which can be suggested. There is no gymnasium
in the world which is better calculated to secure excellent
results from exercise than the kitchen, the wash-room, the workshop, the woodyard, the barn, and the
garden. These are nature's gymnasia. They require
no outlay for special appliances, and are always fitted
up for use.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Deficient Exercise of Students</hi>. &mdash; The common idea that
study and brain work are harmful, has chiefly grown
out of the fact that students usually confine themselves
too closely to their books, keep late hours, and take as
little as possible of active out-of-door exercise. There
is no doubt but that the majority of students could do
more work and better if they would devote at least two
hours of each day to purely physical exercise. In
ancient Greece, in the palmy days of that empire,
physical training was considered as much a part of the
necessary education of young men as their mental
culture. Every inducement was offered to them to
make themselves strong, vigorous, and athletic. Their
schools were called gymnasia, on account of the attention
given to gymnastics.
<pb n="599"/>
</p><p>The young women, too, were trained in physical
exercises as well as the young men. Small waists and
delicate forms, white, soft, helpless hands and tiny feet
were not prized among the pioneers of modern civilization.
The mothers of heroes and philosophers were not
pampered and petted and spoiled by indulgence. They
were inured to toil, to severe exercise. Their bodies
were developed so as to fit them for the duties of
maternity, and give them constitutions to bequeath to
their children which would insure hardihood, courage,
and stamina in the conflict with the world to obtain a
subsistence, and with human foemen in the rage of
battle. The women developed by this system of culture,
were immortalized in marble, and the beauty of their
forms has been the envy of the world from that day to
this; yet no one seems to think of attempting to gain
the same beauty in the same way. It might be done;
there is no reason why it cannot be; but the only way
is the one which the Grecian women adopted, &mdash; physical
culture.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Overtraining</hi>. &mdash; The careful observation of results in
large numbers of cases shows very clearly that there is
such a thing as overtraining, and that excessive development
of the muscular system is not only not advantageous,
but absolutely harmful. Trainers are not long-lived. Dr. Winship, who developed his muscles until
he was able to lift three thousand pounds, died when
he should have been in his prime. The result of
overtraining, or excessive development of the muscular
system, is the weakening of other vital parts of the
body. Symmetrical development is the best for health
and long life. This is what we plead for, not for
<pb n="600"/>
extremes in any direction. Let the nerves and the
muscles be developed together and equably, and we
shall have better results from both than would otherwise
be possible. <hi rend="italic">Mens sana in corpore sano</hi> was the motto of
the ancient Greeks; and the experience of every day
shows that the man with strong muscles and good
digestion, with fair intellectual abilities, is the one who wins
the goal to-day in the strife for wealth and fame and
all that men seek after. "A sound mind in a sound
body" is as necessary for assured success in life in the
nineteenth century as when the sentiment was first
inscribed upon the gates of the temples of ancient
Greece.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Necessity for Unrestrained Action</hi>. &mdash; A muscle tied up
is rendered as helpless as though it were paralyzed. It
will be observed that when a muscle acts, it does so by
swelling out in thickness, while contracting in length.
From this it will be evident that if a tight band is put
around a muscle in such a manner as to prevent its
expansion or increase in thickness, it cannot possibly act.
Hence, a fundamental requisite of healthful muscular
action is entire freedom from restraint. Unrestrained
action is indispensable to complete action and perfect
development. When a broken arm is done up in a splint
for a few weeks, upon removing the bandage it is usually
found that the arm has shrunken in size; the muscles
have wasted, partly in consequence of pressure, and
partly on account of the enforced inaction of the muscles.
The very same thing happens whenever pressure is
brought to bear upon the muscular tissues.
</p><p>Spring Biliousness. &mdash; Biliousness is not, as most
people suppose, a disease of the liver, but pertains
<pb n="601"/>
almost altogether to the stomach. It is chiefly the
result of overeating, eating too freely of sweets, pastry,
fats, and highly seasoned dishes. The cold, tonic air of
the winter months antidotes the bad influence of these
digressions in diet to some degree; but as the warm,
relaxing weather of spring comes on, the stomach begins
to fail more perceptibly in its efforts to accomplish the
unnecessary and injurious labor imposed upon it.
Indigestion is the result. By and by the poor stomach
gets so far behind in its work that it is altogether
overwhelmed and disabled, and the difficulty culminates in a
bilious attack, which is nothing more nor less than a
cessation of work on the part of the stomach. The over-worked organ needs rest. A bilious attack can always
be prevented by giving the stomach rest, by fasting a
meal or two before the final crash comes. No organ in
the body will endure more abuse and still patiently
continue its work than the stomach; but finally forbearance
ceases to be a virtue, and the faithful servant rebels
against abuse. Correct and properly regulate the diet,
and there will be no trouble with bilious attacks at any
season of the year.
</p><p>The Tobacco Bondage. &mdash; The following forcible article
on the subject of tobacco-using was contributed by
Hon. Neal Dow, in response to an invitation of the
author, to the columns of his journal, <hi rend="italic">Good Health</hi>, a few
years ago, but is so excellent as to be deserving of a
more permanent record than the columns of a monthly
journal. It is well worthy of thoughtful perusal: &mdash;
</p><p>"I do not think there is in the world a more absurd
custom than that of the tobacco habit. There are many
things about it worse than the absurd, but this particu-<pb n="602"/>
lar feature is in my mind now. The Chinese women
have crippled feet, which renders it almost impossible
for them to walk; it is not their fault, the deformity is
inflicted upon them in childhood. The natives of some
barbarous countries are tattooed the operation inflicting
upon them great and protracted pain. The natives of
some other countries have flattened heads, &mdash; a wrong
imposed upon them from their infancy. Some African
tribes knock out the two upper front teeth of every
male, and others have the front teeth filed like those of
a saw. There are many other deformities found among
savages, but none of them so absurd as the tobacco
habit.
</p><p>"Here is a minister, possibly a Doctor of Divinity,
smoking a cigar; there is a reason for it, there must be;
what is it? Ask him. He will say, `It's a great
pleasure.' Is that true? &mdash; No, it's false; it is not in any
proper sense a pleasure. Then why does he practice
that disgusting habit? &mdash; Because it is a necessity to him,
not because it's a pleasure. How a necessity? &mdash; Be
cause if he could not smoke, he would be in great torment.
</p><p>"The hard drinker does not take the alcohol
because he likes it, but for the same reason that the
tobacco slave takes that drug; viz, if he did not, he
would be in agony. The alcoholic slave has brought
himself by degrees into his wretched condition, precisely
in the same way that the tobacco slave has lost his
liberty, but with far more excuse, or rather with far less
liability to the contempt of men of independent minds
and independent ways of life and action. Why? &mdash; Because
all alcoholic drinks can be easily made extremely
<pb n="603"/>
pleasant to the taste of beginners in the downward road,
which is never the case with tobacco. This is so
loathsome and disgusting and repulsive to the system,
that in acquiring the tobacco habit, the novice is
desperately sick for days, sometimes for many weeks. There
is scarcely any other sickness so dreadful as that caused
by the tobacco to beginners. There is dreadful vomiting,
with splitting headache, livid lips, parched tongue,
and eyes like those of dead fish.
</p><p>"Then why do these poor fools persevere? &mdash; Because
they are such very poor fools as to believe it to be
manly to smoke or chew! Why? &mdash; Because others do
it. Men or boys, even of independent minds, judge for
themselves as to what is right and proper or otherwise,
and will not be led into any habit or way of life blindly,
simply because others do it.
</p><p>"But now the young man has `conquered his prejudices'
and has `learned to smoke.' What has he
acquired by it? &mdash; Nothing but the tobacco habit. Is
there no good in it whatever, no pleasure? &mdash; None; it is
simply the tobacco habit which has such a mastery over
its victim that he must yield to its demands under the
penalty of intolerable pain and suffering, pains so great
that it is very difficult for the strongest men to
endure them.
</p><p>"I called at a gentleman's office one day, and found
him smoking. I said to him: &mdash;
</p><p>" `What would you give if you had never learned to
smoke?' He paused a moment, and replied:
</p><p>" `Every dollar I have in the world.'
</p><p>" `Then why do you not abandon the habit?'
</p><p>" `I cannot now do that; I could not endure the
suffering it would cause me.'
<pb n="604"/>
</p><p>"Ask any man of forty years, and he will tell you
he is very sorry he learned to use tobacco, but cannot
now abandon the habit. A friend of mine was a
tobacco slave for many years, and had made frequent vain
attempts to emancipate himself. At last, he resolved
that come what might, he would be a wretched slave to
tobacco no longer. He told me afterward that the
struggle with the habit was more fearful than he could
describe, and added, that all the money in the Bank of
England would not tempt him to endure the like again.
</p><p>"Can a smoker be an honest and honorable man?
Can he? I do not answer, I ask the question. In the
street, on steamboats, in public places, in railway cars,
everywhere, in fact, except in smoking cars or in smoking
rooms, we have a right, all of us, to the free, fresh,
pure air. This is as much our right as the purse in our
pocket. No one has more right to take it from us than
he has to pick our pockets. Has he? I ask the question.
It's my view that he has not. Am I mistaken?
To pick a pocket is stealing, robbery; what is it to take
away the pure air from another, and to put stinking,
poisoned air in its place?
</p><p>"To sit beside another at the table, and sprinkle his
food with cayenne pepper or cover it with mustard, or
flavor it with asafetida, &mdash; what would such a procedure
be called? What word is there in our language by
which to characterize it? How would that differ from
infusing a disgusting stench into the air for others to
breathe? To flavor or poison another's food in that
way would be called an intolerable abomination, and the
doing of it would expose the party to a summary expulsion
from decent society. But the poisoning of the air
<pb n="605"/>
which others must breathe is so common a thing to do,
so many persons practice it who would not pick a pocket,
or poison other people's food, that most persons do not
look upon it in its true light.
</p><p>"I have often seen in the streets, ladies and others
walk very slowly or stop upon the sidewalk to allow the
smoke to pass on out of smelling distance. I have also
seen people cross the street to avoid the stench of
tobacco, which to many persons is intolerable. Have
these people an undoubted right to the free, fresh air as
they walk the streets? Then what term are we to apply
to the act of poisoning &mdash; for tobacco smoke is a poison &mdash;
the air for them to breathe? How may we justly stigmatize
those who do it?
</p><p>" `But people <hi rend="italic">can</hi> endure the tobacco smoke, they
can pass along the streets in spite of it. Then why
make a fuss about it?' Yes, so they <hi rend="italic">could</hi> pass the
sidewalks somehow, if piled up with boxes, bales, and
barrels, and intersected with ditches and holes; but for
all that, people have a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to unencumbered passage
ways. Am I wrong?"
</p><p>A Healthy Smell. &mdash; Some years ago we had occasion
to request a gentleman to give attention to the condition
of his back yard, which was in great need of the services
of a scavenger, containing in addition to a very foul
barn-yard and a much neglected privy, the carcasses of
two dead horses buried a little beneath the surface. We
expected that only a gentle hint would be necessary to
secure prompt attention to the matter, as the party was
almost a fanatic on the subject of diet. Imagine, then,
our surprise when this radical advocate of vegetarianism
and many other good reforms retorted, "Some people's
<pb n="606"/>
noses turn up at every little smell. Why! a barn-yard
smell is the healthiest kind of a smell, and I have
always been told it was good for consumption."
</p><p>There was a time when such notions seem to have
been generally prevalent. A few hundred years back,
the streets of London were in a worse condition than the
back yard referred to, &mdash; a cordial invitation for the
Great Plague, which came in due time. According to
an eminent European authority, personal cleanliness was
for a thousand years so universally disregarded "that
scarce a man, woman, or child throughout Europe made
a practice of daily ablution. During this carnival of
filth, again and again the Black Death ravaged European
countries. In the reign of Justinian, as Gibbon records,
a large proportion of the human race was swept away
by an epidemic which, with but slight intermissions,
raged for fifty years. In Constantinople, 1,000 grave-diggers, in constant employ, could not hide away fast
enough the victims of this dreadful disorder. We have
all been made acquainted, through the ghastly picture
drawn by Baccaccio, with the fearful plague that
desolated Florence in the fourteenth century, and by Defoe,
with the ravages of the Great Plague in London."
</p><p>When spring approaches, it is important to be on the
lookout for possible sources of air contamination when
the winter ice is melted, and the conditions favorable for
decomposition are developed. Let every nook and
corner of the house, the cellar, the back yard, and the
entire premises be thoroughly inspected so as to eradicate
every possible source for germs to germinate and multiply.
The germ question has come to be an intensely
practical one; and everybody ought to know enough
<pb n="607"/>
about it to be fully awake to the danger from this
source, and anxious to take every precaution to escape
injury themselves, and secure safety to others.
</p><p>Clothing of Children. &mdash; A point of primary importance
in regard to the clothing of children which mothers
should ever bear in mind, is the fact that frequent
changes are necessitated by the almost constant changes
of temperature in this climate. The weather of a
temperate climate is always subject to changes which will
be recognized, and should be as far as possible anticipated,
by the careful mother. Children possess very little
power to resist the influence of cold or heat. Their
vital functions, while very active, are more easily
disturbed than those of older people, hence they are more
susceptible to injury from change of weather than older
persons. Mothers should be constantly on the lookout
for changes which may involve the life of their little
ones. The fashion of putting on flannel under-garments
at the beginning of the cold season of the year, and
putting them off again at the beginning of spring, is a
pernicious one. There is no time of year when flannel
clothing is more imperiously required than in the cool,
damp days of spring and the occasional cool days in
summer. Clothing should be adjusted to the weather of
each day independently. In the winter time, an unusually
cold day demands an additional supply of clothing;
in summer time an unusually hot day may require an
opposite change of garments. In the spring and autumn,
particularly when the weather is very changeable, it
may be necessary to change the clothing two or three
times a day in order to meet the exigences of the
weather.
<pb n="608"/>
</p><p>Children should never be allowed to suffer for the
want of a change of this kind simply because the needed
garment has been soiled or must be saved for Sunday
wear, or for any other trivial reason. If a child cannot
be properly clothed, it should be sent to bed and kept
there until the proper garments can be provided for it.
The excuse which mothers often make for carelessness
in this particular, that "they have been too busy" to
make the necessary garments for the little one who has
outgrown its old clothing, is no justification for such
neglect; and it will generally be found that the required
time has been worse than wasted in the preparation of
unwholesome dishes which will have no other influence
than to deprave the taste and to undermine the
health of husband and children, or in the entertainment
of fashionable friends who are themselves squandering
valuable time which belongs properly to their
children, in the discussion of the latest fashions or the
most recent scandal suit.
</p><p>The clothing of the child at night is also a matter of
importance. As a rule, flannel night-gowns should be
worn, as by this means the little one avoids the chill
often given by coming in contact with cotton or linen
sheets, and is better protected from the chilly night air
if, as is often the case, it becomes uncovered in the night
by the displacement of the bed covers through its restlessness.
</p><p>Capnizomania. &mdash; An uncontrollable propensity to
steal is known as kleptomania. A similar propensity
for the use of liquor is termed dipsomania; so an
uncontrollable disposition to smoke the pipe may be termed
capnizomania. There are a few kleptomaniacs, a good
<pb n="609"/>
many dipsomaniacs, and a still larger number of
capnizomaniacs. It is not surprising that thousands of persons
who are addicted to self-indulgence as a matter of habit
should acquire a taste for liquor by the use at first of light
alcoholic drinks, such as wine or small beer or cider;
but it is a marvel that any human being should ever
become so perverted in his instincts as to acquire
a mania for such a sickening and nauseating drug
as tobacco. We have, however, met hundreds of persons
who were as completely enslaved by tobacco as ever
any human being was by the use of alcohol or opium.
Thousands of those who become addicted to the use of
this drug, never abandon it, even after they become
thoroughly convinced of its harmful character. Parents
will do well to see that their children do not contract
this dangerous form of insanity. We say dangerous
insanity; for we are thoroughly convinced that there is
no form of insanity from which the world is suffering so
much at the present day as the pipe-mania.
</p><p>Popular Medical Education. &mdash; For some years in
the past there has been much discussion among prominent
physicians respecting the propriety of encouraging
the education of the common people in medical
subjects. Among a certain class of the profession there
has been great opposition to the popularization of
medical subjects, it being claimed that more harm than
good would be done by so doing, since unqualified
persons would thereby be led to undertake the management
of cases which required the educated judgment and skill
which are possessed alone by the physician who has had
a long course of training in the schools and an extensive
experience at the bedside. We have long believed that
<pb n="610"/>
this objection was based on a partial or prejudiced view
of the subject, and that a consideration of its various
bearings from a more liberal standpoint would lead candid
thinkers to a different conclusion. It would not be
urged that because every one cannot become proficient
in all the abstractions of modern theology, the masses
should be kept in utter ignorance of religious theories,
notwithstanding the possibility that such knowledge
might be used in an unwise manner under some circumstances.
Every man who desires to do so has as good a
right to learn all he is capable of comprehending of the
science of medicine, as well as of the science of
mathematics, astronomy, law, or any other department of
human knowledge.
</p><p>We are glad to be able to quote the following very
sensible paragraphs on this subject from an address read
before the Michigan State Medical Society, by Thomas
N. Reynolds, M. D., of Detroit Mich., Professor of
Materia Medica and Therapeutics and of clinical Medicine
in Detroit Medical College, and visiting physician
to St. Mary's Hospital: &mdash;
</p><p>"In view of the fact that there is still in the world
the most extraordinary misconception with regard to the
true functions of medicine and medical men, it may not
seem wholly unfit that we should somewhat briefly
advert to it here.
</p><p>"As it existed among the people in earlier times, it
amuses us now perhaps more than it surprises us; and
when we recognize it still here and there among those
in lowly favored circumstances of life, it usually makes
little or no impression upon us; but when we so often
see it among the refined and cultured of our time, we
<pb n="611"/>
are sometimes led to inquire why it is. But this
misconception is not confined entirely to the laity or to
the crude charlatan, but more or less pervades the
educated and legitimate fraternity itself; and it is no
uncommon thing to see among the younger members of
our profession men confidently attributing to medicines
particular cures that they never produced. And even
the older practitioners, with quite an abiding faith,
sometimes prescribe remedies that serve little more
than to mutually satisfy the mind of the patient and the
doctor that the necessary and essential thing has been
done in the premises.
</p><p>"This undue credit to the effect of the drugs
prescribed, when it occurs among medical men, probably
arises mostly from the habit and routine of always
prescribing in certain approved manners in certain kinds
of cases; and when improvement takes place, forgetting
to allow sufficiently for the healing power of time and
nature herself.
</p><p>"As nothing but hard-earned experience and frequently
disappointed hopes in his scientific prescriptions,
will ever thoroughly convince the young practitioner of
their frequent inutility, so nothing but the proper kind
of education on these matters will ever convince the people
of their frequent too great confidence in the efficacy
of drugs alone.
</p><p>"To this end the study of anatomy, physiology,
hygiene, and particularly the laws of life, with the
influence thereon of habits, conditions, and surroundings,
should enter largely into, and be assiduously carried
all the way through, the education of the young, even if
it be to the exclusion of almost no matter what other
<pb n="612"/>
branch besides. And if the use of drugs be referred to
at all in their education, it should be with a special care
that they be taught the facts as they are, &mdash; that the
essential and useful drugs are really few and their
administration rarely necessary; that in the aggregate in the
world it is probable enough that more harm is being
yearly done by their indiscriminate and unskilled use
than there is good by their timely and judicious employment.
</p><p>"Physicians can do much more than is usually done
in this direction by their individual influence in
practice. Each physician should constantly endeavor to
establish in the minds of his patrons the fact that they
should seek intelligent opinions and skilled advice more
than prescriptions. And even at an occasional risk of
losing patronage, when medicine is not required at all,
he should dare to say so, and give the right advice
instead. Doctors should be educators more than physic-mongers. Whatever time the occasion demands should
be taken to fully explain the trouble for which persons
present themselves, and the best regulation of living to
be adopted under the circumstances; and for this opinion
and advice alone, when kindly given, they should,
and generally will, expect to pay.
</p><p>"If imposition and quackery are ever removed or
lessened at all, it will be in exact proportion to the
amount of correct information and thorough enlightenment
the people may obtain on this entire subject; for
it can never avail very much that a few educated and
honorable practitioners labor to bring the comparatively
few whom they reach, up to a reasonable and correct
estimation of the practice of medicine, while the masses

remain unable to discriminate between the imaginary
and what is real in it, or between the artful and
unscrupulous pretender and the genuine medical man. As
long as there is a general and popular demand for the
different forms of quackery, there will always be found
an ample supply; and legislation, though necessary and
good as far as it goes, can never entirely prevent it.
The early and continued education of each individual on
the subject is the only successful remedy."
</p><p>Depraved Appetites. &mdash; Most persons shudder and
their stomachs revolt at the mere mention of the horrible
<hi rend="italic">gnappee</hi> of the Hindoos, the bird's-nest puddings of
the Chinese, the horse steaks of the Parisians, and the
earth-worm soup of some continental gormands; but not
a few of the same individuals raise no objection when
invited to partake of a fashionable <hi rend="italic">pat&eacute; de foi&euml; gras</hi>, or
to indulge in a bit of roasted cheese which has an odor
decidedly ancient and suggestive of putrefaction. We
have met people whose tastes had become so utterly
perverted that they had acquired a decided fondness for
cheese alive with "skippers." Some years ago, while
stopping a few weeks in Wilmington, Del., completing
the manuscript for a book, we devoted an occasional
afternoon to the study of microscopic life by way of
recreation. One day we strolled down to the market-place in search of a specimen of cheese containing
"skippers," which we wished to make the subject of
study. We wandered about for some little time among
the different stalls without seeing what we thought to
be a promising cheese, but at last were attracted
by a strong odor of decay to a certain stand where
numerous specimens of cheese were displayed. We in-<pb n="614"/>
quired of the salesman if he could furnish us with a
piece of very old cheese, something strong and well filled
with "skippers." "Oh! yes;" he replied, "I have
just what you want; it is just the thing for toasting.
Some people like cheese containing `skippers;' better
for toasting than any other. It seems to be richer and
more highly flavored." We secured a segment of the
choice article which he cut from a mass far advanced in
decomposition, half covered with green and brown mold,
and odorous as a barn-yard, and hurried to our room to
study the lively fellows which we hoped to find sporting
about in the fragment of rotten milk which we carried
carefully wrapped in several folds of paper.
</p><p>Imagine our intense disappointment when after an
hour's anxious search by the aid of a good microscope,
we were unable to discover a single specimen. Evidently
the tiny creatures had become disgusted with
their habitat, and left for more savory quarters. We
laid the specimen aside for further study, and went out
on an errand. When we returned to a late dinner, we
noticed that our landlady had a merry twinkle in her
eye, but were quite unsuspicious of the cause until she
accused us of lunching in our room, &mdash; she knew we were
opposed to eating between meals, &mdash; and informed us she
had carried off on a chip the remainder of our meal, as it
gave rise to such an unsanitary smell in the house.
</p><p>We have had no further experience with old cheese;
but a rather funny story is told of Charles Lamb, the
great wit, which is too good to be lost, as an illustration
of the depraved condition of the civilized palate, even in
his day.
</p><p>One evening Mary Lamb took a sudden and violent
<pb n="615"/>
fancy to have some Stilton cheese for supper, an article
of which they had not a scrap in the house. It was
very wet, and getting rather late; but Charles, with that
self-denial which showed itself in a life-long devotion to
his sister, at once volunteered to try whether any could
be got. He sallied forth, and reached their cheese-monger just as the shutters were being put up. In
reply to his demand, he was assured that they had some
fine, ripe Stilton; and the shopkeeper proceeded to cut
off a slice. As it lay on the scales, Lamb's attention
was forcibly arrested by the lively gambols of a number
of little creatures which came to the surface of the "fine,
ripe Stilton." "Now, Mr. Lamb," said the cheese-monger,
"shall I have the pleasure of sending this home
for you?" "No, th-th-thank you," said Charles. "If
you will give me a bit of twine, I cou-cou-could, perhaps,
l-l-l-lead it home!"
</p><p>The Hygiene of Old Age. &mdash; At no period of life is a
careful observance of the laws of health of so imperious
importance as in advanced age. The vital machinery is
worn and weakened, the vitality at a low ebb, and it is
of paramount importance that all unnecessary hindrances
should be removed, that every removable obstacle to the
healthy performance of the bodily functions should be
taken out of the way. Thousands of lives are annually
sacrificed through the mistaken idea that hygienic rules
which are acknowledged to apply to young persons and
adults are not to be observed by those in advanced age.
For example, many popular writers maintain that while
the use of wine as a beverage by youth and adults
cannot be condemned too strongly, it is necessary for the
aged, as a means of stimulating the declining forces.
<pb n="616"/>
</p><p>Another writer condemns bathing by the aged,
because, it is claimed, it uses up the animal heat.
</p><p>The error of the first theory is apparent when the
fact is recalled that stimulation lessens, instead of
reinforcing, vital strength, thus weakening the hold on life
and shortening its duration. The fallacy of the second
theory is equally apparent when we take into consideration
the fact that in old age the wastes of the body are
greatly increased. The discharges from all the outlets
of the body are more heavily laden with organic
impurities than during youth and adult age. The breath
is laden with the poisonous products of disintegration,
and the perspiration with effete matter. It is for this
reason that a sudden obstruction of any of these outlets
is so speedily followed by fatal results. If frequent
bathing is neglected, the skin becomes obstructed, and
the kidneys are overworked. The urine becomes irritating
in character, and inflammation or congestion of the
bladder is likely to be the result. We have met scores
of cases of irritable bladder in elderly men which could
be traced, in a great part at least, to neglect of the
bath.
</p><p>Old persons should recollect, that the bath is
particularly necessary for them as a sanitary measure.
As the waste of the body preponderates over the repair,
the skin, if unwashed, soon becomes covered with a film
of the most intensely poisonous and readily decomposable
matter. A few days' accumulation is enough to produce
a condition not only in the highest degree detrimental to
the individual himself, but offensively injurious to all
persons of acute olfactory sensibilities who may be
closely associated with him.
<pb n="617"/>
</p><p>It is true that cold bathing may be, and generally is,
in a high degree injurious to aged persons; but bathing
in water at or near the temperature of the body cannot
be more productive of harm than putting on a clean suit
of clothes. Cleanliness is enforced by one of the first
laws in the "code of health," and is binding at all times
and at all ages. The greatest enemy of health is dirt;
and the worst of all kinds of dirt is that which arises
from the destructive processes at work in the body.
</p><p>Mouth-Breathing. &mdash; Few persons are aware that this
practice, so very common, is specially harmful, and many
will be surprised when we say that it is exceedingly
detrimental to health, even dangerously so. It is generally
due to obstructions in the nasal cavities, either through
thickening or swelling of the mucous membrane, or the
existence of polypi or other morbid growths. Sometimes
it is due to habit merely. A child catches cold. The
nasal passages become obstructed, necessitating mouth-breathing during sleep, when respiration is involuntary,
and hence less forcible than during the waking hours.
The cold is soon recovered from, but the habit has been
contracted, and is continued even to adult years, or during
an entire life-time.
</p><p>Enlargement of the tonsils is also a common cause of
mouth-breathing.
</p><p>Habitual mouth-breathing ultimately results in serious
disease of the throat and larynx. It is also the cause of
the peculiar malformation of the chest known as "pigeon's
breast."
</p><p>The remedy consists in the application of such measures
as will remove the obstructions, if present. Polypi
must be removed. Morbid growths must be removed or
<pb n="618"/>
destroyed. Catarrh, if present, must be cured. If
mouth-breathing is a habit merely, as is often the case,
especially with children, care should be taken to instruct
the child to breathe through the nose, and when it goes
to sleep the lips should be gently closed. By perseverance,
the habit may be cured.
</p><p>In many cases, mouth-breathing is due to obstruction
of the nostrils by morbid growths. These cases require
the attention of a physician who has made a special
study of this class of diseases.
</p><p>Coffee and Dyspepsia. &mdash; M. Laven, a French medical
authority, in a paper read before the Societe de Biologie,
and published in the <hi rend="italic">Rev. Med</hi>., states that "coffee,
instead of accelerating the digestive process of the stomach,
as is often supposed, rather tends to impede it. When
thirty grammes of coffee, diluted in one hundred and
fifty of water, are given to a dog, which is killed five
hours and a half afterward, the stomach is found pale,
its mucous surface being an&aelig;mic, and the vessels of its
external membrane contracted. The whole organ exhibits
a marked appearance of an&aelig;mia. Coffee thus determining
an&aelig;mia of the mucus membrane, preventing rather
than favoring vascular congestion, and opposing rather
than facilitating the secretion of gastric juice, how comes
it that the sense of comfort is procured for so many
who are accustomed to take coffee after a meal? A
repast, in fact, produces, in those whose digestion is torpid,
a heaviness of the intellectual faculties and embarrassment
of the power of thinking; and these effects, and
the disturbance of the head, are promptly dissipated by
the stimulant effect which the coffee produces on the
nervous centers, as shown by experiments with caffeine.
<pb n="619"/>
Coffee and tea, when taken in excess, are a frequent
cause of dyspepsia; from the an&aelig;mic condition of the
mucous membrane's being periodically renewed, a permanent
state of congestion is at last produced, which
constitutes dyspepsia. Coffee exerts both a local and a
general action, operating locally by means of its tannin,
by diminishing the caliber of the vessels, but acting on
the general economy by exciting the nervous centers
and the muscular system. It renders digestion slower,
and is only of good effect by relieving the feeling of
torpor after meals."
</p><p>The evidence against the use of tea and coffee is
accumulating so rapidly that there can no longer be any
doubt as to the propriety of using these articles as common
beverages. They must be put in the same category
with opium, alcohol, tobacco, and other harmful drugs.
</p><p>About Water Filters. &mdash; Some time ago a friend
wrote us asking the following questions respecting
water filters, the answers to which may be of practical
interest to many others: &mdash;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Questions</hi>. &mdash; 1. Is hard water rendered soft by filtration?
</p><p>2. How may a cheap and efficient filter be constructed?
</p><p>3. How should a filter be taken care of?
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Answers</hi>. &mdash; 1. The hardness of water is not removed by
filtration. If a charcoal filter is employed, some of the
mineral ingredients of the water will be retained in the
filter, but no very considerable proportion. The use of
hard water will very soon spoil the best filter made, by
the deposit of lime.
</p><p>2. A cheap filter can be made by the following
method: &mdash;
<pb n="620"/>
</p><p>Take a large flower pot or earthen vessel, make a
hole one-half inch in diameter in the bottom, and insert
in it a sponge. Place in the bottom of the vessel a
number of clean stones of sizes varying from that of an
egg to an apple. Place upon this a layer of much
smaller stones and coarse gravel. Then fill the jar
within two inches of the top, with equal parts of pulverized
charcoal and sharp sand, well mixed. Place loosely
over the top of the jar, a white flannel cloth, allowing
it to form a hollow in the middle, into which the
water can be poured. Secure the edges by tying a stout
cord around the outside of the jar. By keeping a suitable
vessel under the filter thus made, and supplying
rain-water when needed, very pure water can be obtained.
It can be kept in a cool place in the summer. It will
be necessary to renew it occasionally, by exchanging the
old sand and charcoal for fresh. The flannel and sponge
must be frequently cleansed.
</p><p>3. Such a filter, if allowed to become empty every
day, or every other day at least, ought to last several
years. Water which has a distinct odor should never
be passed through a filter. Filtration will not purify
such water.
</p><p>Barricading against Fresh Air. &mdash; In some parts of
the country, particularly in the New England States, the
houses of most of the wealthier classes are furnished
with double windows, and every other device for the
purpose of keeping out the cold air of winter. Apartments
are made as nearly air-tight as possible; and in
these close, unventilated rooms, hermetically sealed up,
thousands of persons annually spend several months of
the year, regardless of the fact that with the air which
<pb n="621"/>
they respire day and night, they are inhaling debility,
disease, and death. The life-giving oxygen, which a
beneficent Creator has supplied in lavish abundance
"without money and without price" to all, moans
anxiously around these sealed-up houses, seeking in vain for
even one small crevice through which to find entrance,
to carry life, energy, and purification to the suffocating;
inmates.
</p><p>Let a person from the pure, crisp, outer air, enter
one of these magnificent dens of disease. Beautiful
carpets cover the floors, fine works of art adorn the
walls, luxurious furniture abounds in every room, and
no luxury that wealth can buy is wanting; but oh!
what a smell! One is tempted to protect his olfactories
with a handkerchief, and beat a hasty retreat; but
courtesy demands that he should suffer martyrdom, and
so he sits down with as much complacency as possible,
but involuntarily turns wistfully toward the window now
and then, hoping to discover some little crack or crevice
through which one breath of pure, unpoisoned air may
enter. But in vain. In each breath his keen sense of
smell discovers ancient smells from the kitchen, odors of
decomposition from the cellar, moldy dust from the
carpet, and worst of all, the foul exhalations from half
a dozen human bodies, &mdash; lungs, skins, stomachs, decaying
teeth, etc. On the window-panes little streams of
organic filth are seen running down to form pools upon
the window-sills. On all the outer walls the same sort
of condensation of fetid matter is taking place, but is
rendered invisible by absorption by the porous paper
and plaster, where it undergoes putrefactive changes,
sending out foul and putrescent gases to add still further
<pb n="622"/>
to the contamination of the poison-laden atmosphere of
the close and musty rooms.
</p><p>Better by far, from a hygienic standpoint, was the
old-fashioned log house, with its huge fire-place and its
capacious throat, breathing up great volumes of air, and
here and there a chink between the logs, with loosely-fitting window-sash, and door jambs too large for the
doors, extending an invitation for God's pure, life-giving
oxygen to come in with its energizing, vitalizing, purifying,
beautifying, health-giving potencies. If every house
were provided with an efficient, automatic, ventilating
apparatus, double windows would offer no disadvantage to
health. But when windows are the chief means for the
admission of fresh air as well as of light, in the majority
of houses, they may well be looked upon as dangerous,
and deserving of the most vigorous condemnation.</p>

<head>ONE HUNDRED CHOICE HEALTH
THOUGHTS.</head>

<p>THE man who possesses good health is always rich.

</p><p>HEALTH is an energetic man's capital.

</p><p>ONE may purify the blood more in a single day by
breathing pure air, than by taking sarsaparilla or any
other blood-purifier for a year.

</p><p>"HEALTH is wealth" is a trite maxim, the truth of
which every one appreciates best after having suffered
from disease. Indeed, health is a most priceless treasure.
When deprived of it, we are willing to exchange
for it everything else we possess; yet when well, we
squander it ruthlessly, regardless of consequences.

</p><p>THE right to health stands second only to the right
to live.

</p><p>TEA and "temper" are so often found associated as
to afford good grounds for believing that they are closely
related.

</p><p>IT is not what one eats that nourishes him, but what
he digests.

</p><p>PLUCK is a wonderfully efficient agent in throwing off
disease.

</p><p>EXPOSING the body to the air and light, and briskly
rubbing the skin with the hand, is the best substitute for
a water bath, and is almost as efficient for cleansing the
skin.

<pb n="624"/>
</p><p>A COLD is much more easily avoided than cured.

</p><p>A MAN who has a perfectly healthy skin is almost
certain to be healthy in other respects. In no way can
the health of the skin be preserved but by frequent
bathing.

</p><p>SO-CALLED "softening of the brain" is often hardening
of the liver.

</p><p>"A MERRY heart maketh a glad countenance;" but a
sour stomach makes a wry face.

</p><p>CORRECT habits of eating and drinking are of the utmost
importance if we would keep the body in a state to
serve us well.

</p><p>NO person can impose upon his stomach with impunity;
sooner or later, punishment will follow as the
result of physical transgression.

</p><p>INTENSE mental activity, or severe physical exercise,
soon after eating, hinder the digestive process.

</p><p>NATURE makes no provision for digesting more than
her proper wants demand.

</p><p>IT is a mistaken idea that foods made rich with fats
are the most nourishing. Really "rich" foods are those
which contain a large proportion of the essential food
elements in a condition in which they may be easily
assimilated.

</p><p>LIQUID of any kind, taken at meals, in large quantities,
is prejudicial to digestion; because it delays the
action of the gastric juice, weakens its digestive qualities,
and overtaxes the absorbents.

<pb n="625"/>
</p><p>THE nourishing quality of any food depends upon its
digestibility as much as upon its nutritive elements.

</p><p>EATING between meals is a gross breach of the
requirements of good digestion. The habit many have
of eating fruit, confectionery, nuts, sweetmeats, etc.,
between meals, is a certain cause of dyspepsia.

</p><p>THE royal road to health leads not by the way of big
pills or little pills, purgatives or patent medicines, but
by the homely road of correct habits.

</p><p>THE best brain food is that which will make the best
blood, and thus most efficiently nourish the body in
general.

</p><p>WHEN a man has a bilious attack, and vomits bile, he
feels sure there is something the matter with his liver;
whereas, instead, he has bile enough and to spare, and
all he needs is good hygiene, a proper dietary, and
plenty of hot water inside and outside.

</p><p>EVERY individual should consider the hour for meals
a sacred one, not to be intruded upon under any ordinary
circumstances. The habit of regularity in eating ought
to be cultivated early in life.

</p><p>A PAIN in the back seldom indicates disease of the
kidneys, as most people suppose; and it may be controlled
by simple measures carefully and thoroughly applied.

</p><p>QUACKS thrive upon the ignorance and gullibility of
the people. The only remedy for quackery lies in the
education of the people in those medical facts and
theories, which will lead them to see that there is a
scientific foundation for rational medical practice

<pb n="626"/>
</p><p>ALL the medicines in creation are not worth a
farthing to a man who is constantly and habitually
violating the laws of his own nature.

</p><p>THE simplest food is, as a rule, the most healthful.

</p><p>IF we would keep the mind free and vigorous,
we must preserve a healthy state of digestion.

</p><p>A "BRASSY" taste in the mouth indicates a torpid
liver, and suggests a reform in diet.

</p><p>AN unstimulating, abstemious diet is the strongest of
all the allies of virtue.

</p><p>THE best of all condiments is hunger; and the most
efficient of all soporifics, labor.

</p><p>THE man who says, I can eat or drink anything,
nothing hurts me, is on the high road to physical
bankruptcy. By and by he will complain that everything
hurts him.

</p><p>DO not eat when tired. The idea that by the taking of
food the stomach or any other part of the system will be
strengthened, is a mistake.

</p><p>A TIRED stomach is a weak stomach. When the stomach
feels "faint and tired" at night, as many people
complain, what it wants is not food, but rest.

</p><p>A "GNAWING" hunger is not an indication of the
necessity for food, but of a diseased condition of the
stomach.

</p><p>COMMON sense teaches us that a feeble horse must be
lightly loaded; so a weak stomach, suffering with slow
digestion, must have as light and easy work as possible.

<pb n="626"/>
</p><p>AS a man eateth, so is he.

</p><p>THE free use of hot water is a very excellent means of
relieving various disturbances of digestion, particularly
those which arise from sluggishness of the stomach, such
as acidity, heart-burn, etc.

</p><p>HORSEBACK-RIDING is an excellent aid to digestion, and
often effectually relieves constipation of the bowels.

</p><p>AIR is food for the lungs as bread is food for the
stomach. More millions of people die from want of lung food
than from a deficiency of other aliment.

</p><p>GERMS differ in their relation to human life. Some
are innocent, some dangerous under certain conditions,
others dangerous under all circumstances.

</p><p>NOXIOUS gases and disease germs are usually associated
together, &mdash; a fortunate fact, as it enables us to
detect the dangerous character of an infected atmosphere
without the trouble of a chemical analysis. It is
possible for the air to be swarming with disease germs
without an offensive odor's being present; but the
reverse is seldom true, and it is perfectly safe to say
that a foul-smelling atmosphere is a dangerous one.

</p><p>NEVER use water which has a perceptible taste or
odor.

</p><p>NEVER employ water which is procured from a suspicious
source, as a well in a barn-yard or near a vault
or cess-pool, or from a cistern not recently cleansed.

</p><p>THE old supposition, that running water into which
impurities have been cast, purifies itself while running
twenty miles, is an error. Such water is never safe.

<pb n="628"/>
</p><p>TEST FOR IMPURE WATER. &mdash; Discard as dangerous,
water which will not stand the following test: &mdash;
</p><p>Dissolve in two tablespoonfuls of cistern water
which has been thoroughly boiled, unless distilled
water can be obtained, twelve grains of caustic potash
and four grains of permanganate of potash. Add two
drops of this solution to a teacupful of the water to be
tested. If the water is very impure, the pink color at
first produced will very quickly disappear. If the color
disappears within fifteen minutes, the water is too
impure for safe use.

</p><p>SLEEPING-ROOMS should be aired and sunned every
day.

</p><p>NEVER sleep in a room which has been for weeks
unused, unaired, unwarmed, and secluded from sunlight,
until the bedding has been thoroughly aired and dried,
and the air of the room thoroughly changed by ventilation.

</p><p>AVOID sleeping in damp beds and cold bedrooms. A
person had a great deal better sit up by the kitchen fire
and doze in his chair, than commit himself to the
horrible embrace of cold, clammy sheets, and run the
risk of sowing the seeds of an incurable illness.

</p><p>COMBUSTION is the best means of disposing of garbage,
and relieves the scavenger of an additional burden, and
the milkman of a temptation to economize.

</p><p>CELLARS should be kept clear of decaying vegetables,
wood, wet coal, and mold. The walls should be
frequently whitewashed, or washed with a strong solution
of copperas.

<pb n="629"/>
</p><p>THE best means to avoid the infection of a contagious
disease when unavoidably exposed, are the following:
Always have good ventilation in the room. Never
stand between the patient and the fire, but always
between him and a fresh-air inlet. Never while in the
room swallow any saliva; and after leaving, rinse out
the mouth, blow the nose, and wash the hands and face.
Keep up good general health by good food, exercise,
and temperance. In addition to these recommendations,
it is well to filter all the air you breathe while in the
sick-room by tying a handkerchief over the mouth and
nose.

</p><p>HALF the men and women who complain of sleeplessness,
have done nothing to entitle them to the use of
"Nature's sweet restorer."

</p><p>FOR poor sleepers, a half hour's exercise, taken a
short time before retiring will often act like a soporific.

</p><p>IF troubled with sleeplessness, eat an early and
light supper of easily digested food; or, better, eat no
supper at all. Do not engage in exciting conversation
or amusements during the evening. At an early hour,
prepare to retire determined to sleep. Just before
going to bed, soak the feet for ten minutes in a pail of
hot water, cooling it a little at the close.

</p><p>CLOTHE the body warmly and equably, giving special
attention to the extremities.

</p><p>CLOTHING should be adjusted to the weather of each
day independently. In the winter time, an unusually
cold day demands an additional supply of clothing; in
the summer time, an unusually hot day may require an
<pb n="630"/>
opposite change of garments. In the spring and autumn,
when the weather is very changeable, it may be necessary
to change the clothing two or three times during the
day in order to meet the exigences of the weather.

</p><p>THE whole body should be clad in soft flannel from
neck to wrists and ankles nearly the whole year round.

</p><p>LYING in the shade when perspiring, or sitting in a
draught in the same condition, is as likely to give a
person a cold in August, as getting the feet wet in
December or March.

</p><p>PHYSICAL culture is a sovereign remedy for most
human maladies. When the vital status is raised, the
morbid conditions engendered by neglect and ignorance
are left out, and the individual exists on a higher
physical plane.

</p><p>THE Hindoo devotee who, in blind zeal for his
religion, holds out his arm until the muscles shrink and
shrivel up, leaving the arm but a useless appendage of
the body, violates the law of nature which demands
exercise for health no more than does the student who
shuts himself up with his books until his limbs grow
lank and thin, and his fingers bony with physical
idle-ness; and the latter acts no more wisely in sacrificing
himself upon the shrine of learning than the other in
deforming himself to appease the wrath or win the favor of
Buddha.

</p><p>THE Autocrat of the Breakfast Table says each of us
is an omnibus, in which ride all our ancestors. The
man who carries in his "bus" a drunkard or a libertine,
is a proper subject for most profound sympathy.

<pb n="631"/>
</p><p>BATHS should usually be of a temperature which will
be the most agreeable to the person. Cold baths are
seldom required. Too much hot bathing is debilitating.

</p><p>THE most favorable time for a bath is between the
hours of ten and eleven in the forenoon.

</p><p>THE temperature of a room for taking a bath should
be at about 85&deg; or 90&deg; F.

</p><p>NEVER bathe when exhausted, or within three hours
after eating, unless the bath be confined to a very
small portion of the body.

</p><p>NEVER bathe when cooling off after profuse sweating,
as reaction will then often be deficient.

</p><p>ALWAYS wet the head before taking any form of bath,
to prevent determination of blood to the head.

</p><p>IF the bath be a warm one, always conclude it with
an application of water a few degrees cooler than the
body temperature.

</p><p>BE careful to thoroughly dry the skin after a bath,
rubbing vigorously, to prevent chilling.

</p><p>NEVER paper a wall over another paper.

</p><p>HARD-WOOD floors covered so far as necessary or
desirable, with loose rugs which can be daily removed
and shaken, are far more conducive to health than
carpets.

</p><p>NEVER clean the ears with a pick or with the twisted
end of a towel. The ear-wax dries up and falls out of
itself. Efforts to keep the ear free from wax increase
<pb n="632"/>
the difficulty by irritating the membrane, and causing it
to make more wax.

</p><p>NEVER allow cold water to enter the ears, and do not
let the cold wind blow in them. If they must be exposed
to cold air or water, protect them by a little wad
of cotton placed in the ear. Care should be taken to
remove the cotton as soon as it is no longer needed, as
much mischief sometimes results from leaving portions
of cotton or paper in the ear.

</p><p>IF a seed or other foreign substance has gotten into the
ear, do not try to remove it by introducing a knitting-needle or by any similar means. The only safe plan is
to syringe the ear with warm water, leaning the head to
one side so the object may drop out if loosened. If a
pea or a bean has been in the ear so long that it has
swelled, and hence cannot be dislodged by syringing, it
may be contracted by holding alcohol in the ear for a
short time. If an insect gets into the ear, pour in
a little oil, which will suffocate it, when it may be
removed by syringing.

</p><p>NEVER put chloroform or laudanum into the ear for
relief of tooth-ache.

</p><p>NEVER use the eyes when they are tired or painful,
nor with an insufficient or dazzling light{.} Lamps should
be shaded.

</p><p>ALWAYS let the light fall upon the object viewed, from
over the left shoulder, if possible; it should never come
from in front.

</p><p>NEVER read on the cars, when riding in a wagon or
street car, or when lying down.

<pb n="633"/>

</p><p>THOUSANDS of people are cured at mineral springs of

of its impurities. More water drinking at home and less

</p><p>WHEN the sun begins to circle low in the Southern

that dampness and malaria, and sultry days in mid-winter are vastly greater enemies to health than frost
and snow. The fear of cold is getting to be almost a
mania. Cold weather is a blessing. The winter toning
up is an advantage which no one can afford to miss
unless absolutely compelled to forego it.

</p><p>ONE of the most mischievous errors current in modern
times is the popular notion that a man may transgress
all the laws of health with impunity, and then
swallow a few drops of medicine, and antidote all the
results of his evil habits. Diseases are far less
frequently cured by remedies than most people, and indeed
many physicians, suppose. When a sick person gets
well, it is usually because he has reformed from his evil
ways, and nature has ceased to punish him for his physical
sins. Nature cures whenever there is a cure. It
has been suggested by a very wise physician that it
may be that remedies hinder as often as they aid in
recovery. And it may be that patients get well in spite
of the remedies which are applied outside and inside,
almost as often as by the aid {o}f them.

</p><p>WHEN we hear a man extolling this or that remedy
for disease, and claiming that he has been cured in some
magical way of a disorder generally conceded to be
incurable, let us remember that there is a very great difference
<pb n="636"/>
between <hi rend="italic">being</hi> well and <hi
rend="italic">feeling</hi> well. There is a
very large class of remedies the sole effect of which is
to make a sick man feel better, but which have no real
influence upon the progress of a disease, unless it be to
hasten it by using up the patient's vitality, and deluding
him into foolish expenditures of strength under the belief
that he is well, when he is really no better, but only
<hi rend="italic">feels</hi> better.

</p><p>THE man who has good health has golden wealth,
though his pocket-book is thin, and his bill of fare a

</p><p>A QUAINT old Dutch physician who flourished nearly
two centuries ago, had great faith in the mechanical cure
of disease. It was a favorite saying of his that more
patients would be cured by climbing a bitterwood tree,
than by drinking a disgusting decoction of its leaves.

</p><p>THERE is a most intimate relation between health and
morality. We have long held that a great share of the
crime among civilized people might be fairly charged to
bad physical conditions, which, by impairing the physical
health, lower the nerve tone, and then the moral
tone, so that there is not a proper appreciation of moral
principles and obligations. Is not this a means of
explaining those strange lapses from rectitude on the part
of men whose character has previously been for a lifetime
above reproach, which now and then so startle and
shock the moral sense of the community? A writer has
suggested that the unhappy condition of John Calvin's
stomach may have been the real cause of the burning of
Servetus; and there is probably no doubt that many a
poor fellow has swung from the gallows because the
judge had a fit of indigestion.
<pb n="637"/>
</p><p>Purifying the Blood. &mdash; It is a popular notion that
the blood can be purified by swallowing some bitter
stuff or nauseous medicine. Dr. Bacon, the modern
substitute for Shakespeare, announced a theory many
years ago, that everybody should be bled in the spring,
and treated with purgatives, because the blood became
so vile during the winter that it was necessary to purify
it by emptying the blood-vessels. This was undoubtedly
one way, and a robust person might suffer no real
harm from the treatment; but it would be very difficult
for a feeble person to overcome the debility, and furnish
a new supply of blood. The idea was good, but in such
a radical change the process of cure was so effective that
it many times killed the patient. "Cured to death,"
might truthfully be written on a great many tombstones.
The modern idea that the blood is to be purified by
antidotes, is wholly unphilosophical. It is absurd to think
that you are going to make the blood pure by putting
something impure into it. The blood may be purified,
but it must be by getting something out of it. The
best way is to set to work nature's five great purifiers;
the lungs, skin, liver, kidneys, and bowels, &mdash; the five
great excretory organs of the body. If a man's blood
is impure, it is because he has been taking something
impure into it, or because he has not been using the
excretory organs sufficiently to keep the impurities
worked out. The first step would be to stop putting
impurities into the blood, if that is what is the matter
People who live grossly, eating flesh meats, pastry, etc.,
and perhaps swallowing such things as tea and coffee,
wine and beer, and may be tobacco, are constantly over
taxing the excretory organs. Living a sedentary life is
<pb n="638"/>
another way to encourage the deposit of impurities in
the blood, there not being sufficient muscular exercise
in such cases to assist in throwing off the waste particles
of the body.
</p><p>To make the skin more active, take a hot bath once,
twice, or three times a week. If vigorous, one can
stand a Turkish or vapor bath every day for a while.
Do anything to get up a sweat; drink hot water, and
wrap up in warm blankets. A good vapor bath can be
taken in any ordinary bath-tub, by putting a slat bottom
in the tub, or a board with holes in it, so as to allow a
space at the bottom of the tub which will be free for a
running stream of hot water. Lie down on this slat
bottom, cover the tub with heavy blankets, and you
will have as good a vapor bath as need be given. A
Swedish shampoo, or a soap and water bath, or scouring
the skin off with a brisk "salt glow," &mdash; any or all of
these ways are good for getting up a healthy action of
the skin.
</p><p>Next endeavor to make the lungs work so vigorously
as to increase the supply of oxygen. A person walking
at the rate of three miles an hour, breathes three times
as much air as one who is sitting still; and one walking
at the rate of four miles an hour, breathes five times as
much as one sitting still. When sitting, one only
breathes about twenty cubic inches &mdash; about two-thirds
of a pint &mdash; at each inhalation, the furnace door of the
body being almost closed; but as just noted, even
moderate walking triples the capacity for taking in air.
With every breath, we throw off a certain amount of
impurities; at the four-miles-an-hour pace we may not
throw off five times as much waste matter as when sit-<pb n="639"/>
ting still, but we will approximate that amount, perhaps
about four times as much. Another advantage in deep
breathing is that the oxygen taken into the lungs goes
into every nook and cranny, and gets alongside every
nerve and fiber of the body, &mdash; everywhere this clogging
material is lodged, &mdash; and carries it out. It is a great
house cleaner; it sweeps down the cobwebs, and shakes
the curtains. That is why the skin looks clearer and
fresher. Let a person whose skin is dingy, dirty, and
sallow go out of doors and take regular and vigorous
exercise. The fresh supply of oxygen thus gained will
very soon tell upon the appearance of the skin.
</p><p>The liver may be set to work, and by the same
means the bowels and the kidneys can be made more
active, and that is by simply drinking large quantities
of hot water. The old German water-cure doctors found
this out almost a hundred years ago. Old Dr. Pressnitz,
of Graefenberg, used to recommend from twelve to twenty
glasses of water a day, to be taken in connection with
mountain climbing. There were beautiful springs along
the mountain side, and walking and climbing, his patients
would drink from six to twelve glasses before breakfast,
and the dose could be repeated two or three times in the
course of a day. Water is the best means of all for
cleansing the stomach, liver, and kidneys. Every part
of the body is permeated and cleansed. When we take
water into the stomach, it is absorbed, and by the
muscular action of the diaphragm this pure water is drawn
into the body, and carries impurities out.
</p><p>It is very interesting to notice how all these
remedies co-operate: warm baths to make the skin active;
exercise to make the lungs more active; and hot-water
<pb n="640"/>
drinking to increase the activity of the kidneys, bowels,
and liver. The warm baths take some of the fluids out
of the blood. Persons may lose even two pounds &mdash;
that means two pints of water &mdash; through the skin in a
hot bath. This excretion carries with it a large
quantity of impurities, and this makes a person thirsty, and
increases the amount of water-drinking, which supplies
the water taken from the blood, while the water-drinking
promotes the sweating, &mdash; action and reaction, you see,
constantly. By exercise the lungs are made to act more
vigorously. This increases the action of the diaphragm,
and that squeezes the liver and presses the old bile out
of it; and this, again, augments the water-drinking.
Again, exercise induces perspiration, and that in turn
also increases the water-drinking. Each means helps
the others all the time, and in this way the blood is
readily purified. But it cannot be done by a "tonic,"
or "blood-purifier." Every one of the nostrums advertised
under these various names, contains from six to
fifty per cent of bad whisky or alcohol, and yet the great
majority of people depend upon them as purifying agencies,
instead of upon the natural ones enumerated.
</p><p>Stomach "Goneness." &mdash; The faintness or empty
feeling of the stomach experienced by some in the evening
or during the night, is caused by the two walls of
the stomach coming in contact. When that organ is
empty, it collapses; but in a state of health we do not
feel this contact any more than we do the shutting of the
two eyelids together. But when the stomach is
diseased, we notice this contact just as we would contact
of the eyelids if they were inflamed. The mucous
membrane becomes congested and irritated, and causes
<pb n="641"/>
this "goneness." There are two remedies for this.
One is to eat something, and fill the stomach up with
some sort of bland substance, when the patient will feel
temporarily better. There are some people who always
eat something just before going to bed; they think it is
dangerous to have the stomach empty. A great deal of
harm is done in this way, yet some physicians recommend
eating, because it will give this temporary relief.
This eating for relief simply increases the cause of
irritation. The trouble is due to congestion of the
stomach, caused by over-work. The stomach is always
temporarily congested during the act of digestion, and
if it is kept constantly in use, the congestion will become
permanent. The second and best remedy for this
condition is rest, and the worst of all remedies is work.
Food put into the stomach increases the congestion,
because it makes the stomach work. You will notice
that this trouble occurs in the evening or in the night.
Persons make no such complaint in the morning. The
stomach has had a chance to rest, yet three hours after
breakfast, they may experience the same all-gone feeling.
The proper remedy is rest and careful attention
to the diet, that the cause may be relieved. For temporary
relief, nothing is so good as a drink of cold water,
and it will help to allay the congestion also.
</p><p>Nervous Dyspepsia. &mdash; It has often been remarked
that Americans are a nation of dyspeptics, and most
physicians will readily assent to the assertion that fully
half of the dyspeptics belong to the class commonly
known as nervous dyspeptics. A chronic nervous
dyspeptic is all but incurable, not because of tho intrinsic
obstinacy of his malady, but because the disease is
<pb n="642"/>
more than half in his mind. We do not mean by this
remark that he is an imaginary sufferer, but that the
disease affects his mind in such a manner that the
mental malady becomes the major part of the disease.
He thinks of his stomach before he eats, while he eats,
and after he eats. He will not let the poor organ
escape from his mental vision for an instant, if possible
to avoid it. He talks of his afflictions with every
sympathetic friend who will listen. He considers his
digestive machine the wickedest of stomachs, the very
incarnation of cruelty, and in view of his daily
martyrdom, wears a long face perpetually, and especially at
home, where he entertains his wife and children with
his groans and lamentations, and if possible makes nervous
dyspeptics of them, so that they can the better
appreciate his sufferings. If by any chance any of his
symptoms disappear, straightway he goes to work to
resurrect them, and he invariably succeeds. He would
not have one of those precious symptoms get away
for anything. He feels sure that no one appreciates
properly his agonies of mind and body, and it is
probable that his view of the matter is quite correct.
Fearing that his malady is not considered so grave a
matter as it should be, he sometimes exaggerates a little,
not with the slightest intention of telling a falsehood,
but simply to add picturesqueness to the monotonous
desert of his existence, to highten the interest of
his friends in his distressing case. Evidently the
philanthropic purpose of his mendacity renders it almost
excusable.
</p><p>Thus the nervous dyspeptic goes on from year to
year, until his disease veritably becomes grafted onto
<pb n="643"/>
his constitution as truly as a wild thorn may be grafted
upon a choice apple-tree. To take his malady away
from him is like tearing a limb from a tree. He would
feel quite lost without it. He would hardly recognize
himself, or know how to live without his hot-water
drenchings, his after-dinner pills or charcoal wafers, his
hot-water bags, his dietetic fussiness. His perpetual
introspectiveness keeps his stomach under constant and
the most minute observation. The poor organ is not
intended by nature to be paraded in public after such a
fashion, and is actually paralyzed by stage fright, as it
were. If by any chance such a patient is cured, he
quickly flounders back into his old morbid rut from
sheer force of habit, and summons back for the entertainment
of his depraved taste the ghostly hobgoblins
which some good genius had temporarily banished; and
so, to use a very ancient simile, he "returns like a dog
to his vomit."
</p><p>Those who look upon nervous dyspepsia as a trifling
malady are quite unacquainted with its horrible tenacity.
It clings to its victim like some huge monster of
the deep, a devil-fish or a sea-serpent, crushing him in
its toils, never quite extinguishing his last breath, but
always threatening to do so, thus keeping him upon the
ragged edge of despair, and at the same time holding
him by some mystic charm, some strange fascination, so
that he makes no effort to escape even when the toils
are so loosened that he might. The victims of the disease
require treatment of mind as well as body. They
afford a most admirable class of subjects for mind-cure
and faith-cure doctors. Indeed, this class of patients
furnishes them their most brilliant successes.
<pb n="644"/>
</p><p>But if faith alone will achieve so much, how much
more might faith and works accomplish, if they could
only be combined! This is the thing essential, in cases
of nervous dyspepsia. Works alone do little or nothing;
and if faith as well as works cannot be brought to bear
upon a given case, better far throw diet and physic to
the dogs, and turn the patient over to the professor of
metaphysics, with his mummeries and moonshine; for
at least half those suffering from this disease are more
benefited by mummeries than mush, and appreciate
more relief from liberal doses of moonshine than from
baths or peptones.
</p><p>Smoking a Cause of Consumption and Bright's
Disease. &mdash; A celebrated European specialist has recently
called attention to the fact that consumption is becoming
exceedingly prevalent among cigar-smokers. The reason
for this is evident. The fact that persons of feeble or
diseased constitution are frequently employed in the
manufacture of cigars, coupled with the enforced
confinement in a close and foul atmosphere, renders this
class of laborers especially liable to consumption. It is
not an uncommon thing to see two or three loud
consumptives in a single cigar-factory. Of course, the
mouth and lips are constantly soiled with the expectorated
matter; and when the cigar-maker puts on the
finishing touch to the cigar, by moistening it with his
lips, he infects it; and the man who smokes the cigar,
thereby becomes vaccinated with the disease. It might,
perhaps, not be a matter to be so greatly regretted, that
the race of cigar-smokers should be killed off, although
it must be admitted that, through ignorance, many
excellent men are addicted to the practice; but the non-<pb n="645"/>
users of cigars are interested in this matter almost as
much as those who smoke, for the reason that the person
suffering from consumption will be a source of infection
to others. We have, in more than one instance,
been able to trace consumption in a wife to the care of
a consumptive husband; and so the smoking husband
might easily infect an unoffending wife, from whom the
disease might in turn be communicated to innocent
children. Cigar-smoking must be regarded as one of the
most dangerous as well as one of the most loathsome
practices tolerated among civilized people.
</p><p>Dr. Auld, of Glasgow, also raises a warning voice
when he states an important fact which seems to have
been heretofore overlooked; viz., that tobacco may be
a cause of organic disease of the kidneys. As is well
known, the appearance of albumen in the urine is the
leading symptom of Bright's disease of the kidneys.
Dr. Auld finds that the use of tobacco is often accompanied
by this symptom, and lays it down as one of the
results of chronic nicotine poisoning.
</p><p>This eminent physician has done the world a valuable
service in calling attention to this important fact.
He also states that according to his observations,
tobacco is responsible for a very large number of
functional disorders not commonly attributed to it. He
finds that tobacco poisons both the nerve centers and
the nerve ends, causing muscular twitching and various
other nervous symptoms.
</p><p>Dr. Auld makes the important observation that
when these symptoms are found present, it is not necessary
merely to moderate the use of the drug, but it
must be wholly discarded; otherwise a cure cannot be
<pb n="646"/>
effected. This is contrary to the advice of most physicians,
who commonly prohibit only what they term
excess. We have for many years observed, however,
that half-way measures will not do in these cases.
Tobacco must be discarded wholly and forever.
</p><p>The amount of nerve energy and vital force that is
being squandered by the use of this drug is beyond
estimate. If the sum total of human life and strength
sacrificed to tobacco could be represented in figures, the
aggregate would be astounding. Tobacco is unquestionably
one of the worst of all the curses of civilization.
It certainly is equaled only by two vices &mdash; inebriety
and immorality. The mischief done by opium, cocaine,
and other vice-drugs is enormous, but incomparable
beside the far-reaching evils justly attributable to the
use of tobacco. Thousands of men are kept in a state
of chronic lethargy by its narcotic influence. Millions
of consciences are benumbed by its subtle spell. Countless
multitudes of children are born with weak nerves
and feeble constitutions, as the result of the chronic
nicotine poisoning of parents.
</p><p>The use of the vile drug by civilized man is one of
the enigmas of modern civilization. The old Greeks
and Romans, who shaped the foundations of our modern
civilization, used neither tobacco, tea, nor coffee, nor
strong liquor. If they had indulged in these stimulants
as do men and women of the present day, it is safe to
say that the human race would, by the present time,
have been deteriorated to the vanishing point, with the
possible exception of those savage tribes who may have
been preserved by their isolation from the influence of
these destructive agents. Unless a radical change for
<pb n="647"/>
the better can be effected within a few generations to
come, the condition of the then existing race at the present
rate of deterioration, is fearful to contemplate.
Extinction would come at last as a beneficent act of nature
who desires only the survival of the fittest.
</p><p>Coffee Poisoning. &mdash; A leading French journal calls
attention to twenty-three cases of chronic caffeism.
These were the leading symptoms noticed: Loss of
appetite, inability to sleep, trembling of the lips and
tongue, dyspepsia, neuralgia, pain in the stomach, giddiness,
convulsions, and obstinate constipation. The coffee
drunkard has thin features, drawn and wrinkled face,
and a grayish yellow complexion. His sleep is troubled
with anxious dreams. His pulse is weak, frequent, and
compressible. This same writer asserts that evil effects
upon the eyes and ears of people are more frequent from
coffee than from tobacco or alcohol. It does not absolutely
destroy vision or hearing, but it induces very
annoying functional troubles. That coffee is the efficient
agent, appears from the fact that, upon the entire
discontinuance of its use, the symptoms complained of
disappear.
</p><p>Diet for Diabetics. &mdash; All physicians of experience
are agreed that in the treatment of this disease, by far
the most important measure is the regulation of the diet.
Sugar, starch, and all foods containing them, should be,
as far as possible, excluded from the dietary. This
requires that the patient should abstain from the use of
sugar in any form, from bread, potatoes, peas, beans,
rice, oatmeal, corn-meal, and other grains, chestnuts,
and all other farinaceous articles of food. Sweet fruits
also must be avoided with equal care. The diet should
<pb n="648"/>
consist chiefly of meat of different kinds, including fowl.
Greens, green beans, lettuce, yellow beets, asparagus,
cucumbers, and radishes may also be eaten. Most acid
fruits may be taken in moderate quantities, such as
lemons, oranges, strawberries, peaches, and currants.
In many cases skim-milk, sour milk, or buttermilk may
be taken without increasing the proportion of sugar, and
hence without injury. Several eminent physicians claim
to have cured a number of cases of this disease by
means of an exclusive milk diet, the patient being
confined to this one article of food for several weeks. The
milk should be carefully skimmed. The quantity required
per day is from two to three quarts. By the
employment of a diet free from sugar or starch, sugar
may in many cases be made to disappear from the urine.
When this is the case, it may be looked upon as a very
favorable indication, and often so long as the patient
continues to abstain from those kinds of food which
occasion the production of sugar, the disease will be held
in check. Many so-called gluten flours and gluten
breads are manufactured and sold to persons suffering
from this disease, which are shown by chemical analysis
to contain no more gluten than the best whole-wheat
flour. It is, in fact, impossible to make a flour which
will contain much more than the ordinary percentage of
gluten obtained in whole-wheat flour, as it is impossible
to separate the starch and the gluten by any process of
milling. The Sanitarium Health Food Co., of Battle
Creek, Michigan, are the only manufacturers of pure
gluten with whom we are acquainted in this country.
The gluten manufactured by them has for many years
been largely used for diabetics, with excellent results.
<pb n="649"/>
</p><p>The Wilford Hall Secret. &mdash; For two or three years,
a man styling himself Dr. A. Wilford Hall, of New York
City, has been advertising and vending about the country
a pamphlet purporting to disclose a discovery made
by himself something more than forty years ago. The
so-called discovery which Dr. Hill claims to have made
is this: &mdash;
</p><p>Having had dyspepsia for a number of years, and
being greatly troubled with constipation, he resorted to
the enema as a means of emptying his bowels, and
discovered, as he claims, that it was possible to inject a
gallon of water into the colon by means of a bulb syringe.
He accordingly adopted this method of relieving his
bowels, and has habitually employed it, as he claims,
for more than forty years, during which time, he states,
his bowels have been relieved in no other way than by
the use of the syringe. He afterwards found that it
was possible to retain a small quantity of water &mdash; half a
pint or more &mdash; which, remaining in the bowels, was
absorbed the same as though taken through the mouth.
This is the whole of Dr. Hall's discovery. He recommends
the use of the enema as a substitute for nature's
method of relieving the bowels, to be employed by all
persons, whether sick or well, and claims that persons
who will adopt this method of relieving the bowels will
be proof against most of the diseases to which human
flesh is heir, mentioning particularly such disorders as
Bright's disease of the kidneys, small-pox, and other
grave and contagious maladies.
</p><p>This so-called discovery is embodied by Dr. Hall
in a cheaply printed pamphlet costing about two cents,
for which he charges the modest sum of $4.00. The
<pb n="650"/>
fraudulent business carried on by this man we have
fully exposed elsewhere,[58] and have shown that Dr.
Hall's so-called discovery is not a discovery at all, and
his so-called panacea is capable of doing much harm.
It is also clearly proven that Dr. Hall is not entitled to
any claim whatever as regards the priority of the use
of large quantities of water by enema. The reader is
referred to various hydropathic works published prior to
the date at which Dr. Hall claims to have made his
discovery, in which the use of water in this manner is
fully described.
</p><p>The absurdity of the claims made by Dr. Hall is so
manifest it seems almost an imposition upon the good
sense of our readers to seriously undertake to point it
out. For example, to reason that because washing the
dirt from one's face and hands is a perfectly harmless
and wholesome practice, flushing of the colon may
be practiced habitually without injury, is in the highest
degree absurd. Washing of the outside of the body is
a perfectly natural process. Nearly all animals are
accustomed to bathe the exterior of their bodies; but
nature has provided other means for cleansing the
interior of the body. The various digestive fluids, the
gastric juice, bile, etc., and even the intestinal mucus, are
antiseptics by which the contents of the intestines are
preserved from putrefaction; and in the lower bowel
the mucus, which is abundantly secreted by the glands
furnished for the purpose, forms a coating over the mass
of fecal matter, and thus protects the mucous membrane
<pb n="651"/>
against the absorption of poisonous substances. These
natural protective agents are entirely sufficient under
ordinary conditions of life. It is only when the bowels
become inactive, or when, through errors in diet, the
contents of the bowels become unnaturally poisonous, that
other means are necessary. Then the enema may be
properly used as a means of washing away offending
substances, and affording temporary relief; but the
proper remedy is to be found in correcting the causes of
an abnormal condition, by avoiding errors in diet or in
other habits of life.


[58] See GOOD HEALTH, a monthly magazine published by the Good
Health Publishing Co., Battle Creek, Mich., for July, August, and
September, 1890.

</p><p>The practice of habitually introducing so large a
quantity of water into the alimentary canal, has the
effect to destroy the normal sensibility of the bowels,
and to establish an abnormal condition, so that this large
amount of water becomes necessary as a stimulus to
provoke an evacuation of the intestines. It was long,
long ago discovered by physicians that the habitual use
of the enema as a means of stimulating the evacuation
of the bowels, is by no means free from evil consequences.
Chronic constipation cannot be cured by this method any
more than by the use of cathartics. It is only a mechanical
means of emptying the bowels, which is undoubtedly
preferable to the retention of fecal matter; hut at the
same time it is not a cure of the morbid condition, and
a person who habitually uses the enema, becomes as
much dependent upon it as is the habitual user of mineral
water or pills, upon these medicaments. For a
healthy person, then, to adopt the employment of this
so-called "secret," is to invite disease, and produce a
condition of chronic constipation and absolute dependence
upon some mechanical means of evacuation of the
<pb n="659"/>
bowels. One can scarcely believe that any well-informed
man would undertake to impose upon an intelligent public
so absurd a notion, and one is compelled to consider
the self-styled philanthropist who claims to have made
