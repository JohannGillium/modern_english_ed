FOREWARD 
</head> 
 
<p> 
This little treatise is part of a longer work which I began years ago 
without realising my limitations, and long since abandoned. Of the 
various fragments that might have been extracted from what I wrote, this 
is the most considerable, and, I think, the least unworthy of being 
offered to the public. The rest no longer exists.

<argument> 
 
<p> 
I MEAN to inquire if, in the civil order, there can be any sure and 
legitimate rule of administration, men being taken as they are and laws 
as they might be. In this inquiry I shall endeavour always to unite what 
right sanctions with what is prescribed by interest, in order that 
justice and utility may in no case be divided. 
</p><p> 
I enter upon my task without proving the importance of the subject. I 
shall be asked if I am a prince or a legislator, to write on politics. I 
answer that I am neither, and that is why I do so. If I were a prince or 
a legislator, I should not waste time in saying what wants doing; I 
should do it, or hold my peace. 
</p><p> 
As I was born a citizen of a free State, and a member of the Sovereign, 
I feel that, however feeble the influence my voice can have on public 
affairs, the right of voting on them makes it my duty to study them: and 
I am happy, when I reflect upon governments, to find my inquiries always 
furnish me with new reasons for loving that of my own country. 
</p></argument>

CHAPTER 1.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
SUBJECT OF THE FIRST BOOK 
</head> 
<p> 
MAN is born free; and everywhere he is in chains. One thinks himself the 
master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they. How did 
this change come about? I do not know. What can make it legitimate? That 
question I think I can answer. 
</p><p> 
If I took into account only force, and the effects derived from it, I 
should say: "As long as a people is compelled to obey, and obeys, it 
does well; as soon as it can shake off the yoke, and shakes it off, it 
does still better; for, regaining its liberty by the same right as took 
it away, either it is justified in resuming it, or there was no 
justification for those who took it away." But the social order is a 
sacred right which is the basis of all other rights. Nevertheless, this 
right does not come from nature, and must therefore be founded on 
conventions. Before coming to that, I have to prove what I have just 
asserted. 
</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="chapter" n="2" id="d8">

CHAPTER 2.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
THE FIRST SOCIETIES 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d9"> 
 
 
<p> 
THE most ancient of all societies, and the only one that is natural, is 
the family: and even so the children remain attached to the father only 
so long as they need him for their preservation. As soon as this need 
ceases, the natural bond is dissolved. The children, released from the 
obedience they owed to the father, and the father, released from the 
care he owed his children, return equally to independence. If they 
remain united, they continue so no longer naturally, but voluntarily; 
and the family itself is then maintained only by convention. 
</p><p> 
This common liberty results from the nature of man. His first law is to 
provide for his own preservation, his first cares are those which he 
owes to himself; and, as soon as he reaches years of discretion, he is 
the sole judge of the proper means of preserving himself, and 
consequently becomes his own master. 
</p><p> 
The family then may be called the first model of political societies: 
the ruler corresponds to the father, and the people to the children; and 
all, being born free and equal, alienate their liberty only for their 
own advantage. The whole difference is that, in the family, the love of 
the father for his children repays him for the care he takes of them, 
while, in the State, the pleasure of commanding takes the place of the 
love which the chief cannot have for the peoples under him. 
</p><p> 
Grotius denies that all human power is established in favour of the 
governed, and quotes slavery as an example. His usual method of 
reasoning is constantly to establish right by fact. 
<ref target="n1">[1]</ref> 
It would be possible to employ a more logical method, but none could be 
more favourable to tyrants. 
</p><p> 
It is then, according to Grotius, doubtful whether the human race 
belongs to a hundred men, or that hundred men to the human race: and, 
throughout his book, he seems to incline to the former alternative, 
which is also the view of Hobbes. On this showing, the human species is 
divided into so many herds of cattle, each with its ruler, who keeps 
guard over them for the purpose of devouring them. 
</p><p> 
As a shepherd is of a nature superior to that of his flock, the 
shepherds of men, i.e., their rulers, are of a nature superior to that 
of the peoples under them. Thus, Philo tells us, the Emperor Caligula 
reasoned, concluding equally well either that kings were gods, or that 
men were beasts. 
</p><p> 
The reasoning of Caligula agrees with that of Hobbes and Grotius. 
Aristotle, before any of them, had said that men are by no means equal 
naturally, but that some are born for slavery, and others for dominion. 
</p><p> 
Aristotle was right; but he took the effect for the cause. Nothing can 
be more certain than that every man born in slavery is born for slavery. 
Slaves lose everything in their chains, even the desire of escaping from 
them: they love their servitude, as the comrades of Ulysses loved their 
brutish condition. 
<ref target="n2">[2]</ref> 
If then there are slaves by nature, it is because there have been slaves 
against nature. Force made the first slaves, and their cowardice 
perpetuated the condition. 
</p><p> 
I have said nothing of King Adam, or Emperor Noah, father of the three 
great monarchs who shared out the universe, like the children of Saturn, 
whom some scholars have recognised in them. I trust to getting due 
thanks for my moderation; for, being a direct descendant of one of these 
princes, perhaps of the eldest branch, how do I know that a verification 
of titles might not leave me the legitimate king of the human race? In 
any case, there can be no doubt that Adam was sovereign of the world, as 
Robinson Crusoe was of his island, as long as he was its only 
inhabitant; and this empire had the advantage that the monarch, safe on 
his throne, had no rebellions, wars, or conspirators to fear.

CHAPTER 3.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
THE RIGHT OF THE STRONGEST 
</head> 
 
<p> 
THE strongest is never strong enough to be always the master, unless he 
transforms strength into right, and obedience into duty. Hence the right 
of the strongest, which, though to all seeming meant ironically, is 
really laid down as a fundamental principle. But are we never to have an 
explanation of this phrase? Force is a physical power, and I fail to see 
what moral effect it can have. To yield to force is an act of necessity, 
not of will -- at the most, an act of prudence. In what sense can it be a 
duty? 
</p><p> 
Suppose for a moment that this so-called "right" exists. I maintain that 
the sole result is a mass of inexplicable nonsense. For, if force 
creates right, the effect changes with the cause: every force that is 
greater than the first succeeds to its right. As soon as it is possible 
to disobey with impunity, disobedience is legitimate; and, the strongest 
being always in the right, the only thing that matters is to act so as 
to become the strongest. But what kind of right is that which perishes 
when force fails? If we must obey perforce, there is no need to obey 
because we ought; and if we are not forced to obey, we are under no 
obligation to do so. Clearly, the word "right" adds nothing to force: in 
this connection, it means absolutely nothing. 
</p><p> 
Obey the powers that be. If this means yield to force, it is a good 
precept, but superfluous: I can answer for its never being violated. All 
power comes from God, I admit; but so does all sickness: does that mean 
that we are forbidden to call in the doctor? A brigand surprises me at 
the edge of a wood: must I not merely surrender my purse on compulsion; 
but, even if I could withhold it, am I in conscience bound to give it 
up? For certainly the pistol he holds is also a power. 
</p><p> 
Let us then admit that force does not create right, and that we are 
obliged to obey only legitimate powers. In that case, my original 
question recurs. 
</p> 
</div2>

CHAPTER 4.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
SLAVERY 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d13"> 
 
 
<p> 
SINCE no man has a natural authority over his fellow, and force creates 
no right, we must conclude that conventions form the basis of all 
legitimate authority among men. 
</p><p> 
If an individual, says Grotius, can alienate his liberty and make 
himself the slave of a master, why could not a whole people do the same 
and make itself subject to a king? There are in this passage plenty of 
ambiguous words which would need explaining; but let us confine 
ourselves to the word <hi rend="italic">alienate.</hi> To alienate is to give or to sell. Now, 
a man who becomes the slave of another does not give himself; he sells 
himself, at the least for his subsistence: but for what does a people 
sell itself? A king is so far from furnishing his subjects with their 
subsistence that he gets his own only from them; and, according to 
Rabelais, kings do not live on nothing. Do subjects then give their 
persons on condition that the king takes their goods also? I fail to see 
what they have left to preserve. 
</p><p> 
It will be said that the despot assures his subjects civil tranquillity. 
Granted; but what do they gain, if the wars his ambition brings down 
upon them, his insatiable avidity, and the vexations conduct of his 
ministers press harder on them than their own dissensions would have 
done? What do they gain, if the very tranquillity they enjoy is one of 
their miseries? Tranquillity is found also in dungeons; but is that 
enough to make them desirable places to live in? The Greeks imprisoned 
in the cave of the Cyclops lived there very tranquilly, while they were 
awaiting their turn to be devoured. 
</p><p> 
To say that a man gives himself gratuitously, is to say what is absurd 
and inconceivable; such an act is null and illegitimate, from the mere 
fact that he who does it is out of his mind. To say the same of a whole 
people is to suppose a people of madmen; and madness creates no right. 
</p><p> 
Even if each man could alienate himself, he could not alienate his 
children: they are born men and free; their liberty belongs to them, and 
no one but they has the right to dispose of it. Before they come to 
years of discretion, the father can, in their name, lay down conditions 
for their preservation and well-being, but he cannot give them 
irrevocably and without conditions: such a gift is contrary to the ends 
of nature, and exceeds the rights of paternity. It would therefore be 
necessary, in order to legitimise an arbitrary government, that in every 
generation the people should be in a position to accept or reject it; 
but, were this so, the government would be no longer arbitrary. 
</p><p> 
To renounce liberty is to renounce being a man, to surrender the rights 
of humanity and even its duties. For him who renounces everything no 
indemnity is possible. Such a renunciation is incompatible with man's 
nature; to remove all liberty from his will is to remove all morality 
from his acts. Finally, it is an empty and contradictory convention that 
sets up, on the one side, absolute authority, and, on the other, 
unlimited obedience. Is it not clear that we can be under no obligation 
to a person from whom we have the right to exact everything? Does not 
this condition alone, in the absence of equivalence or exchange, in 
itself involve the nullity of the act? For what right can my slave have 
against me, when all that he has belongs to me, and, his right being 
mine, this right of mine against myself is a phrase devoid of meaning? 
</p><p> 
Grotius and the rest find in war another origin for the so-called right 
of slavery. The victor having, as they hold, the right of killing the 
vanquished, the latter can buy back his life at the price of his 
liberty; and this convention is the more legitimate because it is to the 
advantage of both parties. 
</p><p> 
But it is clear that this supposed right to kill the conquered is by no 
means deducible from the state of war. Men, from the mere fact that, 
while they are living in their primitive independence, they have no 
mutual relations stable enough to constitute either the state of peace 
or the state of war, cannot be naturally enemies. War is constituted by 
a relation between things, and not between persons; and, as the state of 
war cannot arise out of simple personal relations, but only out of real 
relations, private war, or war of man with man, can exist neither in the 
state of nature, where there is no constant property, nor in the social 
state, where everything is under the authority of the laws. 
</p><p> 
Individual combats, duels and encounters, are acts which cannot 
constitute a state; while the private wars, authorised by the 
Establishments of Louis IX, King of France, and suspended by the Peace 
of God, are abuses of feudalism, in itself an absurd system if ever 
there was one, and contrary to the principles of natural right and to 
all good polity. 
</p><p> 
War then is a relation, not between man and man, but between State and 
State, and individuals are enemies only accidentally, not as men, nor 
even as citizens, 
<ref target="n3">[3]</ref> 
but as soldiers; not as members of their country, but as its defenders. 
Finally, each State can have for enemies only other States, and not men; 
for between things disparate in nature there can be no real relation. 
</p><p> 
Furthermore, this principle is in conformity with the established rules 
of all times and the constant practice of all civilised peoples. 
Declarations of war are intimations less to powers than to their 
subjects. The foreigner, whether king, individual, or people, who robs, 
kills or detains the subjects, without declaring war on the prince, is 
not an enemy, but a brigand. Even in real war, a just prince, while 
laying hands, in the enemy's country, on all that belongs to the public, 
respects the lives and goods of individuals: he respects rights on which 
his own are founded. The object of the war being the destruction of the 
hostile State, the other side has a right to kill its defenders, while 
they are bearing arms; but as soon as they lay them down and surrender, 
they cease to be enemies or instruments of the enemy, and become once 
more merely men, whose life no one has any right to take. Sometimes it 
is possible to kill the State without killing a single one of its 
members; and war gives no right which is not necessary to the gaining of 
its object. These principles are not those of Grotius: they are not 
based on the authority of poets, but derived from the nature of reality 
and based on reason. 
</p><p> 
The right of conquest has no foundation other than the right of the 
strongest. If war does not give the conqueror the right to massacre the 
conquered peoples, the right to enslave them cannot be based upon a 
right which does not exist. No one has a right to kill an enemy except 
when he cannot make him a slave, and the right to enslave him cannot 
therefore be derived from the right to kill him. It is accordingly an 
unfair exchange to make him buy at the price of his liberty his life, 
over which the victor holds no right. Is it not clear that there is a 
vicious circle in founding the right of life and death on the right of 
slavery, and the right of slavery on the right of life and death? 
</p><p> 
Even if we assume this terrible right to kill everybody, I maintain that 
a slave made in war, or a conquered people, is under no obligation to a 
master, except to obey him as far as he is compelled to do so. By taking 
an equivalent for his life, the victor has not done him a favour; 
instead of killing him without profit, he has killed him usefully. So 
far then is he from acquiring over him any authority in addition to that 
of force, that the state of war continues to subsist between them: their 
mutual relation is the effect of it, and the usage of the right of war 
does not imply a treaty of peace. A convention has indeed been made; but 
this convention, so far from destroying the state of war, presupposes 
its continuance. 
</p><p> 
So, from whatever aspect we regard the question, the right of slavery is 
null and void, not only as being illegitimate, but also because it is 
absurd and meaningless. The words <hi rend="italic">slave</hi> and <hi rend="italic">right</hi> contradict each other, 
and are mutually exclusive. It will always be equally foolish for a man 
to say to a man or to a people: "I make with you a convention wholly at 
your expense and wholly to my advantage; I shall keep it as long as I 
like, and you will keep it as long as I like."

	<p>The Romans, who understood and respected the right of war more than 
any other nation on earth, carried their scruples on this head so far 
that a citizen was not allowed to serve as a volunteer without engaging 
himself expressly against the enemy, and against such and such an enemy 
by name. A legion in which the younger Cato was seeing his first service 
under Popilius having been reconstructed, the elder Cato wrote to 
Popilius that, if he wished his son to continue serving under him, he 
must administer to him a new military oath, because, the first having 
been annulled, he was no longer able to bear arms against the enemy. The 
same Cato wrote to his son telling him to take great care not to go into 
battle before taking this new oath. I know that the siege of Clusium and 
other isolated events can be quoted against me; but I am citing laws and 
customs. The Romans are the people that least often transgressed its 
laws; and no other people has had such good ones.

THAT WE MUST ALWAYS GO BACK TO A FIRST CONVENTION 
</head> 
<p> 
EVEN if I granted all that I have been refuting, the friends of 
despotism would be no better off. There will always be a great 
difference between subduing a multitude and ruling a society. Even if 
scattered individuals were successively enslaved by one man, however 
numerous they might be, I still see no more than a master and his 
slaves, and certainly not a people and its ruler; I see what may be 
termed an aggregation, but not an association; there is as yet neither 
public good nor body politic. The man in question, even if he has 
enslaved half the world, is still only an individual; his interest, 
apart from that of others, is still a purely private interest. If this 
same man comes to die, his empire, after him, remains scattered and 
without unity, as an oak falls and dissolves into a heap of ashes when 
the fire has consumed it. 
</p><p> 
A people, says Grotius, can give itself to a king. Then, according to 
Grotius, a people is a people before it gives itself. The gift is itself 
a civil act, and implies public deliberation. It would be better, before 
examining the act by which a people gives itself to a king, to examine 
that by which it has become a people; for this act, being necessarily 
prior to the other, is the true foundation of society. 
</p><p> 
Indeed, if there were no prior convention, where, unless the election 
were unanimous, would be the obligation on the minority to submit to the 
choice of the majority? How have a hundred men who wish for a master the 
right to vote on behalf of ten who do not? The law of majority voting is 
itself something established by convention, and presupposes unanimity, 
on one occasion at least.

I SUPPOSE men to have reached the point at which the obstacles in the 
way of their preservation in the state of nature show their power of 
resistance to be greater than the resources at the disposal of each 
individual for his maintenance in that state. That primitive condition 
can then subsist no longer; and the human race would perish unless it 
changed its manner of existence.

But, as men cannot engender new forces, but only unite and direct 
existing ones, they have no other means of preserving themselves than 
the formation, by aggregation, of a sum of forces great enough to 
overcome the resistance. These they have to bring into play by means of 
a single motive power, and cause to act in concert. 
</p><p> 
This sum of forces can arise only where several persons come together: 
but, as the force and liberty of each man are the chief instruments of 
his self-preservation, how can he pledge them without harming his own 
interests, and neglecting the care he owes to himself? This difficulty, 
in its bearing on my present subject, may be stated in the following 
terms: 
</p><p> 
"The problem is to find a form of association which will defend and 
protect with the whole common force the person and goods of each 
associate, and in which each, while uniting himself with all, may still 
obey himself alone, and remain as free as before." This is the 
fundamental problem of which the <hi rend="italic">Social Contract</hi> provides the solution. 
</p><p> 
The clauses of this contract are so determined by the nature of the act 
that the slightest modification would make them vain and ineffective; so 
that, although they have perhaps never been formally set forth, they are 
everywhere the same and everywhere tacitly admitted and recognised, 
until, on the violation of the social compact, each regains his original 
rights and resumes his natural liberty, while losing the conventional 
liberty in favour of which he renounced it. 
</p><p> 
These clauses, properly understood, may be reduced to one -- the total 
alienation of each associate, together with all his rights, to the whole 
community; for, in the first place, as each gives himself absolutely, 
the conditions are the same for all; and, this being so, no one has any 
interest in making them burdensome to others. 
</p><p> 
Moreover, the alienation being without reserve, the union is as perfect 
as it can be, and no associate has anything more to demand: for, if the 
individuals retained certain rights, as there would be no common 
superior to decide between them and the public, each, being on one point 
his own judge, would ask to be so on all; the state of nature would thus 
continue, and the association would necessarily become inoperative or 
tyrannical. 
</p><p> 
Finally, each man, in giving himself to all, gives himself to nobody; 
and as there is no associate over whom he does not acquire the same 
right as he yields others over himself, he gains an equivalent for 
everything he loses, and an increase of force for the preservation of 
what he has. 
</p><p> 
If then we discard from the social compact what is not of its essence, 
we shall find that it reduces itself to the following terms: 
</p><p> 
<hi rend="italic">"Each of us puts his person and all his power in common under the 
supreme direction of the general will, and, in our corporate capacity, 
we receive each member as an indivisible part of the whole."</hi> 
</p><p> 
At once, in place of the individual personality of each contracting 
party, this act of association creates a moral and collective body, 
composed of as many members as the assembly contains votes, and 
receiving from this act its unity, its common identity, its life and its 
will. This public person, so formed by the union of all other persons 
formerly took the name of <hi rend="italic">city,</hi> 
<ref target="n4">[4]</ref> 
and now takes that of <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">body politic;</hi> it is called by its 
members <hi rend="italic">State</hi> when passive. <hi rend="italic">Sovereign</hi> when active, and 
<hi rend="italic">Power</hi> when compared with others like itself. Those who are associated in it take 
collectively the name of <hi rend="italic">people,</hi> and severally are called 
<hi rend="italic">citizens,</hi> as sharing in the sovereign power, and 
<hi rend="italic">subjects,</hi> as being under the laws of the State. But these terms are often confused and taken one for another: 
it is enough to know how to distinguish them when they are being used 
with precision.

 The real meaning of this word has been almost wholly lost in modern 
times; most people mistake a town for a city, and a townsman for a 
citizen. They do not know that houses make a town, but citizens a city. 
The same mistake long ago cost the Carthaginians dear. I have never 
read of the title of citizens being given to the subjects of any 
prince, not even the ancient Macedonians or the English of to-day, 
though they are nearer liberty than any one else. The French alone 
everywhere familiarly adopt the name of citizens, because, as can be 
seen from their dictionaries, they have no idea of its meaning; 
otherwise they would be guilty in usurping it, of the crime of <foreign 
lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">lese-majeste</hi></foreign>: among them, the name 
expresses a virtue and not a right. When Bodin spoke of our citizens and 
townsmen, he fell into a bad blunder in taking the one class for the 
other. M. d'Alembert has avoided the error, and, in his article on 
Geneva, has clearly distinguished the four orders of men (or even five, 
counting mere foreigners) who dwell in our town, of which two only 
compose the Republic. No other French writer, to my knowledge, has 
understood the real meaning of the word citizen.</p></note>

CHAPTER 7.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
THE SOVEREIGN 
</head> 
 
<p> 
THIS formula shows us that the act of association comprises a mutual 
undertaking between the public and the individuals, and that each 
individual, in making a contract, as we may say, with himself, is bound 
in a double capacity; as a member of the Sovereign he is bound to the 
individuals, and as a member of the State to the Sovereign. But the 
maxim of civil right, that no one is bound by undertakings made to 
himself, does not apply in this case; for there is a great difference 
between incurring an obligation to yourself and incurring one to a whole 
of which you form a part. 
</p><p> 
Attention must further be called to the fact that public deliberation, 
while competent to bind all the subjects to the Sovereign, because of 
the two different capacities in which each of them may be regarded, 
cannot, for the opposite reason, bind the Sovereign to itself; and that 
it is consequently against the nature of the body politic for the 
Sovereign to impose on itself a law which it cannot infringe. Being able 
to regard itself in only one capacity, it is in the position of an 
individual who makes a contract with himself; and this makes it clear 
that there neither is nor can be any kind of fundamental law binding on 
the body of the people -- not even the social contract itself. This does 
not mean that the body politic cannot enter into undertakings with 
others, provided the contract is not infringed by them; for in relation 
to what is external to it, it becomes a simple being, an individual. 
</p><p> 
But the body politic or the Sovereign, drawing its being wholly from the 
sanctity of the contract, can never bind itself, even to an outsider, to 
do anything derogatory to the original act, for instance, to alienate 
any part of itself, or to submit to another Sovereign. Violation of the 
act by which it exists would be self-annihilation; and that which is 
itself nothing can create nothing. 
</p><p> 
As soon as this multitude is so united in one body, it is impossible to 
offend against one of the members without attacking the body, and still 
more to offend against the body without the members resenting it. Duty 
and interest therefore equally oblige the two contracting parties to 
give each other help; and the same men should seek to combine, in their 
double capacity, all the advantages dependent upon that capacity. 
</p><p> 
Again, the Sovereign, being formed wholly of the individuals who compose 
it, neither has nor can have any interest contrary to theirs; and 
consequently the sovereign power need give no guarantee to its subjects, 
because it is impossible for the body to wish to hurt all its members. 
We shall also see later on that it cannot hurt any in particular. The 
Sovereign, merely by virtue of what it is, is always what it should be. 
</p><p> 
This, however, is not the case with the relation of the subjects to the 
Sovereign, which, despite the common interest, would have no security 
that they would fulfil their undertakings, unless it found means to 
assure itself of their fidelity. 
</p><p> 
In fact, each individual, as a man, may have a particular will contrary 
or dissimilar to the general will which he has as a citizen. His 
particular interest may speak to him quite differently from the common 
interest: his absolute and naturally independent existence may make him 
look upon what he owes to the common cause as a gratuitous contribution, 
the loss of which will do less harm to others than the payment of it is 
burdensome to himself; and, regarding the moral person which constitutes 
the State as a <foreign lang="lat">persona ficta</foreign>, because not 
a man, he may wish to enjoy the rights of citizenship without being 
ready to fulfil the duties of a subject. The continuance of such an 
injustice could not but prove the undoing of the body politic. 
</p><p> 
In order then that the social compact may not be an empty formula, it 
tacitly includes the undertaking, which alone can give force to the 
rest, that whoever refuses to obey the general will shall be compelled 
to do so by the whole body. This means nothing less than that he will be 
forced to be free; for this is the condition which, by giving each 
citizen to his country, secures him against all personal dependence. In 
this lies the key to the working of the political machine; this alone 
legitimises civil undertakings, which, without it, would be absurd, 
tyrannical, and liable to the most frightful abuses.

<lb/> 
THE CIVIL STATE 
</head> 
 
<p> 
THE passage from the state of nature to the civil state produces a very 
remarkable change in man, by substituting justice for instinct in his 
conduct, and giving his actions the morality they had formerly lacked. 
Then only, when the voice of duty takes the place of physical impulses 
and right of appetite, does man, who so far had considered only himself, 
find that he is forced to act on different principles, and to consult 
his reason before listening to his inclinations. Although, in this 
state, he deprives himself of some advantages which he got from nature, 
he gains in return others so great, his faculties are so stimulated and 
developed, his ideas so extended, his feelings so ennobled, and his 
whole soul so uplifted, that, did not the abuses of this new condition 
often degrade him below that which he left, he would be bound to bless 
continually the happy moment which took him from it for ever, and, 
instead of a stupid and unimaginative animal, made him an intelligent 
being and a man. 
</p><p> 
Let us draw up the whole account in terms easily commensurable. What man 
loses by the social contract is his natural liberty and an unlimited 
right to everything he tries to get and succeeds in getting; what he 
gains is civil liberty and the proprietorship of all he possesses. If we 
are to avoid mistake in weighing one against the other, we must clearly 
distinguish natural liberty, which is bounded only by the strength of 
the individual, from civil liberty, which is limited by the general 
will; and possession, which is merely the effect of force or the right 
of the first occupier, from property, which can be founded only on a 
positive title. 
</p><p> 
We might, over and above all this, add, to what man acquires in the 
civil state, moral liberty, which alone makes him truly master of 
himself; for the mere impulse of appetite is slavery, while obedience to 
a law which we prescribe to ourselves is liberty. But I have already 
said too much on this head, and the philosophical meaning of the word 
liberty does not now concern us.

CHAPTER 9.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
REAL PROPERTY 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d22"> 
 
 
<p> 
EACH member of the community gives himself to it, at the moment of its 
foundation, just as he is, with all the resources at his command, 
including the goods he possesses. This act does not make possession, in 
changing hands, change its nature, and become property in the hands of 
the Sovereign; but, as the forces of the city are incomparably greater 
than those of an individual, public possession is also, in fact, 
stronger and more irrevocable, without being any more legitimate, at any 
rate from the point of view of foreigners. For the State, in relation to 
its members, is master of all their goods by the social contract, which, 
within the State, is the basis of all rights; but, in relation to other 
powers, it is so only by the right of the first occupier, which it holds 
from its members. 
</p><p> 
The right of the first occupier, though more real than the right of the 
strongest, becomes a real right only when the right of property has 
already been established. Every man has naturally a right to everything 
he needs; but the positive act which makes him proprietor of one thing 
excludes him from everything else. Having his share, he ought to keep to 
it, and can have no further right against the community. This is why the 
right of the first occupier, which in the state of nature is so weak, 
claims the respect of every man in civil society. In this right we are 
respecting not so much what belongs to another as what does not belong 
to ourselves. 
</p><p> 
In general, to establish the right of the first occupier over a plot of 
ground, the following conditions are necessary: first, the land must not 
yet be inhabited; secondly, a man must occupy only the amount he needs 
for his subsistence; and, in the third place, possession must be taken, 
not by an empty ceremony, but by labour and cultivation, the only sign 
of proprietorship that should be respected by others, in default of a 
legal title. 
</p><p> 
In granting the right of first occupancy to necessity and labour, are we 
not really stretching it as far as it can go? Is it possible to leave 
such a right unlimited? Is it to be enough to set foot on a plot of 
common ground, in order to be able to call yourself at once the master 
of it? Is it to be enough that a man has the strength to expel others 
for a moment, in order to establish his right to prevent them from ever 
returning? How can a man or a people seize an immense territory and keep 
it from the rest of the world except by a punishable usurpation, since 
all others are being robbed, by such an act, of the place of habitation 
and the means of subsistence which nature gave them in common? When 
Nunez Balboa, standing on the sea-shore, took possession of the South 
Seas and the whole of South America in the name of the crown of Castile, 
was that enough to dispossess all their actual inhabitants, and to shut 
out from them all the princes of the world? On such a showing, these 
ceremonies are idly multiplied, and the Catholic King need only take 
possession all at once, from his apartment, of the whole universe, 
merely making a subsequent reservation about what was already in the 
possession of other princes. 
</p><p> 
We can imagine how the lands of individuals, where they were contiguous 
and came to be united, became the public territory, and how the right of 
Sovereignty, extending from the subjects over the lands they held, 
became at once real and personal. The possessors were thus made more 
dependent, and the forces at their command used to guarantee their 
fidelity. The advantage of this does not seem to have been felt by 
ancient monarchs, who called themselves Kings of the Persians, 
Scythians, or Macedonians, and seemed to regard themselves more as 
rulers of men than as masters of a country. Those of the present day 
more cleverly call themselves Kings of France, Spain, England, etc.: 
thus holding the land, they are quite confident of holding the 
inhabitants. 
</p><p> 
The peculiar fact about this alienation is that, in taking over the 
goods of individuals, the community, so far from despoiling them, only 
assures them legitimate possession, and changes usurpation into a true 
right and enjoyment into proprietorship. Thus the possessors, being 
regarded as depositaries of the public good, and having their rights 
respected by all the members of the State and maintained against foreign 
aggression by all its forces, have, by a cession which benefits both the 
public and still more themselves, acquired, so to speak, all that they 
gave up. This paradox may easily be explained by the distinction between 
the rights which the Sovereign and the proprietor have over the same 
estate, as we shall see later on. 
</p><p> 
It may also happen that men begin to unite one with another before they 
possess anything, and that, subsequently occupying a tract of country 
which is enough for all, they enjoy it in common, or share it out among 
themselves, either equally or according to a scale fixed by the 
Sovereign. However the acquisition be made, the right which each 
individual has to his own estate is always subordinate to the right 
which the community has over all: without this, there would be neither 
stability in the social tie, nor real force in the exercise of 
Sovereignty. 
</p><p> 
I shall end this chapter and this book by remarking on a fact on which 
the whole social system should rest: i.e., that, instead of destroying 
natural inequality, the fundamental compact substitutes, for such 
physical inequality as nature may have set up between men, an equality 
that is moral and legitimate, and that men, who may be unequal in 
strength or intelligence, become every one equal by convention and legal 
right.<ref target="n5">[5]</ref>

</div3> 
 
<div3 type="notes" id="d23">

<note id="n5"><seg type="note-symbol">[5]</seg> <p>
 Under bad governments, this equality is only apparent and illusory: 
it serves only to-keep the pauper in his poverty and the rich man in the 
position he has usurped. In fact, laws are always of use to those who 
possess and harmful to those who have nothing: from which it follows 
that the social state is advantageous to men only when all have 
something and none too much.

<lb/> 
THAT SOVEREIGNTY IS INALIENABLE 
</head> 
<p> 
THE first and most important deduction from the principles we have so 
far laid down is that the general will alone can direct the State 
according to the object for which it was instituted, i.e., the common 
good: for if the clashing of particular interests made the establishment 
of societies necessary, the agreement of these very interests made it 
possible. The common element in these different interests is what forms 
the social tie; and, were there no point of agreement between them all, 
no society could exist. It is solely on the basis of this common 
interest that every society should be governed. 
</p><p> 
I hold then that Sovereignty, being nothing less than the exercise of 
the general will, can never be alienated, and that the Sovereign, who is 
no less than a collective being, cannot be represented except by 
himself: the power indeed may be transmitted, but not the will. 
</p><p> 
In reality, if it is not impossible for a particular will to agree on 
some point with the general will, it is at least impossible for the 
agreement to be lasting and constant; for the particular will tends, by 
its very nature, to partiality, while the general will tends to 
equality. It is even more impossible to have any guarantee of this 
agreement; for even if it should always exist, it would be the effect 
not of art, but of chance. The Sovereign may indeed say: "I now will 
actually what this man wills, or at least what he says he wills"; but it 
cannot say: "What he wills tomorrow, I too shall will" because it is 
absurd for the will to bind itself for the future, nor is it incumbent 
on any will to consent to anything that is not for the good of the being 
who wills. If then the people promises simply to obey, by that very act 
it dissolves itself and loses what makes it a people; the moment a 
master exists, there is no longer a Sovereign, and from that moment the 
body politic has ceased to exist. 
</p><p> 
This does not mean that the commands of the rulers cannot pass for 
general wills, so long as the Sovereign, being free to oppose them, 
offers no opposition. In such a case, universal silence is taken to 
imply the consent of the people. This will be explained later on.

CHAPTER 2.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
THAT SOVEREIGNTY IS INDIVISIBLE 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d27"> 
 
 
<p> 
SOVEREIGNTY, for the same reason as makes it inalienable, is 
indivisible; for will either is, or is not, general; 
<ref target="n6">[6]</ref> 
it is the will either of the body of the people, or only of a part of 
it. In the first case, the will, when declared, is an act of Sovereignty 
and constitutes law: in the second, it is merely a particular will, or 
act of magistracy -- at the most a decree. 
</p><p> 
But our political theorists, unable to divide Sovereignty in principle, 
divide it according to its object: into force and will; into legislative 
power and executive power; into rights of taxation, justice and war; 
into internal administration and power of foreign treaty. Sometimes they 
confuse all these sections, and sometimes they distinguish them; they 
turn the Sovereign into a fantastic being composed of several connected 
pieces: it is as if they were making man of several bodies, one with 
eyes, one with arms, another with feet, and each with nothing besides. 
We are told that the jugglers of Japan dismember a child before the eyes 
of the spectators; then they throw all the members into the air one 
after another, and the child falls down alive and whole. The conjuring 
tricks of our political theorists are very like that; they first 
dismember the Body politic by an illusion worthy of a fair, and then 
join it together again we know not how. 
</p><p> 
This error is due to a lack of exact notions concerning the Sovereign 
authority, and to taking for parts of it what are only emanations from 
it. Thus, for example, the acts of declaring war and making peace have 
been regarded as acts of Sovereignty; but this is not the case, as these 
acts do not constitute law, but merely the application of a law, a 
particular act which decides how the law applies, as we shall see 
clearly when the idea attached to the word law has been defined. 
</p><p> 
If we examined the other divisions in the same manner, we should find 
that, whenever Sovereignty seems to be divided, there is an illusion: 
the rights which are taken as being part of Sovereignty are really all 
subordinate, and always imply supreme wills of which they only sanction 
the execution. 
</p><p> 
It would be impossible to estimate the obscurity this lack of exactness 
has thrown over the decisions of writers who have dealt with political 
right, when they have used the principles laid down by them to pass 
judgment on the respective rights of kings and peoples. Every one can 
see, in Chapters III and IV of the First Book of Grotius, how the 
learned man and his translator, Barbeyrac, entangle and tie themselves 
up in their own sophistries, for fear of saying too little or too much 
of what they think, and so offending the interests they have to 
conciliate. Grotius, a refugee in France, ill-content with his own 
country, and desirous of paying his court to Louis XIII, to whom his 
book is dedicated, spares no pains to rob the peoples of all their 
rights and invest kings with them by every conceivable artifice. This 
would also have been much to the taste of Barbeyrac, who dedicated his 
translation to George I of England. But unfortunately the expulsion of 
James II, which he called his "abdication," compelled him to use all 
reserve, to shuffle and to tergiversate, in order to avoid making 
William out a usurper. If these two writers had adopted the true 
principles, all difficulties would have been removed, and they would 
have been always consistent; but it would have been a sad truth for them 
to tell, and would have paid court for them to no one save the people. 
Moreover, truth is no road to fortune, and the people dispenses neither 
ambassadorships, nor professorships, nor pensions.

WHETHER THE GENERAL WILL IS FALLIBLE 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d30"> 
 
 
<p> 
IT follows from what has gone before that the general will is always 
right and tends to the public advantage; but it does not follow that the 
deliberations of the people are always equally correct. Our will is 
always for our own good, but we do not always see what that is; the 
people is never corrupted, but it is often deceived, and on such 
occasions only does it seem to will what is bad. 
</p><p> 
There is often a great deal of difference between the will of all and 
the general will; the latter considers only the common interest, while 
the former takes private interest into account, and is no more than a 
sum of particular wills: but take away from these same wills the pluses 
and minuses that cancel one another, 
<ref target="n7">[7]</ref> 
and the general will remains as the sum of the differences. 
</p><p> 
If, when the people, being furnished with adequate information, held its 
deliberations, the citizens had no communication one with another, the 
grand total of the small differences would always give the general will, 
and the decision would always be good. But when factions arise, and 
partial associations are formed at the expense of the great association, 
the will of each of these associations becomes general in relation to 
its members, while it remains particular in relation to the State: it 
may then be said that there are no longer as many votes as there are 
men, but only as many as there are associations. The differences become 
less numerous and give a less general result. Lastly, when one of these 
associations is so great as to prevail over all the rest, the result is 
no longer a sum of small differences, but a single difference; in this 
case there is no longer a general will, and the opinion which prevails 
is purely particular. 
</p><p> 
It is therefore essential, if the general will is to be able to express 
itself, that there should be no partial society within the State, and 
that each citizen should think only his own thoughts: 
<ref target="n8">[8]</ref> 
which was indeed the sublime and unique system established by the great 
Lycurgus.  But if there are partial societies, it is best to have as 
many as possible and to prevent them from being unequal, as was done by 
vSolon, Numa and Servius. These precautions are the only ones that can 
guarantee that the general will shall be always enlightened, and that 
the people shall in no way deceive itself.

 "Every interest," says the Marquis d'Argenson, "has different 
principles. The agreement of two particular interests is formed by 
opposition to a third." He might have added that the agreement of all 
interests is formed by opposition to that of each. If there were no 
different interests, the common interest would be barely felt, as it 
would encounter no obstacle; all would go on of its own accord, and 
politics would cease to be an art.

THE LIMITS OF THE SOVEREIGN POWER 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d33"> 
 
 
<p> 
IF the State is a moral person whose life is in the union of its 
members, and if the most important of its cares is the care for its own 
preservation, it must have a universal and compelling force, in order to 
move and dispose each part as may be most advantageous to the whole. As 
nature gives each man absolute power over all his members, the social 
compact gives the body politic absolute power over all its members also; 
and it is this power which, under the direction of the general will, 
bears, as I have said, the name of Sovereignty. 
</p><p> 
But, besides the public person, we have to consider the private persons 
composing it, whose life and liberty are naturally independent of it. We 
are bound then to distinguish clearly between the respective rights of 
the citizens and the Sovereign, 
<ref target="n9">[9]</ref> 
and between the duties the former have to fulfil as subjects, and the 
natural rights they should enjoy as men. 
</p><p> 
Each man alienates, I admit, by the social compact, only such part of 
his powers, goods and liberty as it is important for the community to 
control; but it must also be granted that the Sovereign is sole judge of 
what is important. 
</p><p> 
Every service a citizen can render the State he ought to render as soon 
as the Sovereign demands it; but the Sovereign, for its part, cannot 
impose upon its subjects any fetters that are useless to the community, 
nor can it even wish to do so; for no more by the law of reason than by 
the law of nature can anything occur without a cause. 
</p><p> 
The undertakings which bind us to the social body are obligatory only 
because they are mutual; and their nature is such that in fulfilling 
them we cannot work for others without working for ourselves. Why is it 
that the general will is always in the right, and that all continually 
will the happiness of each one, unless it is because there is not a man 
who does not think of "each" as meaning him, and consider himself in 
voting for all? This proves that equality of rights and the idea of 
justice which such equality creates originate in the preference each man 
gives to himself, and accordingly in the very nature of man. It proves 
that the general will, to be really such, must be general in its object 
as well as its essence; that it must both come from all and apply to 
all; and that it loses its natural rectitude when it is directed to some 
particular and determinate object, because in such a case we are judging 
of something foreign to us, and have no true principle of equity to 
guide us. 
</p><p> 
Indeed, as soon as a question of particular fact or right arises on a 
point not previously regulated by a general convention, the matter 
becomes contentious. It is a case in which the individuals concerned are 
one party, and the public the other, but in which I can see neither the 
law that ought to be followed nor the judge who ought to give the 
decision. In such a case, it would be absurd to propose to refer the 
question to an express decision of the general will, which can be only 
the conclusion reached by one of the parties and in consequence will be, 
for the other party, merely an external and particular will, inclined on 
this occasion to injustice and subject to error. Thus, just as a 
particular will cannot stand for the general will, the general will, in 
turn, changes its nature, when its object is particular, and, as 
general, cannot pronounce on a man or a fact. When, for instance, the 
people of Athens nominated or displaced its rulers, decreed honours to 
one, and imposed penalties on another, and, by a multitude of particular 
decrees, exercised all the functions of government indiscriminately, it 
had in such cases no longer a general will in the strict sense; it was 
acting no longer as Sovereign, but as magistrate. This will seem 
contrary to current views; but I must be given time to expound my own. 
</p><p> 
It should be seen from the foregoing that what makes the will general is 
less the number of voters than the common interest uniting them; for, 
under this system, each necessarily submits to the conditions he imposes 
on others: and this admirable agreement between interest and justice 
gives to the common deliberations an equitable character which at once 
vanishes when any particular question is discussed, in the absence of a 
common interest to unite and identify the ruling of the judge with that 
of the party. 
</p><p> 
From whatever side we approach our principle, we reach the same 
conclusion, that the social compact sets up among the citizens an 
equality of such a kind, that they all bind themselves to observe the 
same conditions and should therefore all enjoy the same rights. Thus, 
from the very nature of the compact, every act of Sovereignty, i.e., 
every authentic act of the general will, binds or favours all the 
citizens equally; so that the Sovereign recognises only the body of the 
nation, and draws no distinctions between those of whom it is made up. 
What, then, strictly speaking, is an act of Sovereignty? It is not a 
convention between a superior and an inferior, but a convention between 
the body and each of its members. It is legitimate, because based on the 
social contract, and equitable, because common to all; useful, because 
it can have no other object than the general good, and stable, because 
guaranteed by the public force and the supreme power. So long as the 
subjects have to submit only to conventions of this sort, they obey 
no-one but their own will; and to ask how far the respective rights of 
the Sovereign and the citizens extend, is to ask up to what point the 
latter can enter into undertakings with themselves, each with all, and 
all with each. 
</p><p> 
We can see from this that the sovereign power, absolute, sacred and 
inviolable as it is, does not and cannot exceed the limits of general 
conventions, and that every man may dispose at will of such goods and 
liberty as these conventions leave him; so that the Sovereign never has 
a right to lay more charges on one subject than on another, because, in 
that case, the question becomes particular, and ceases to be within its 
competency. 
</p><p> 
When these distinctions have once been admitted, it is seen to be so 
untrue that there is, in the social contract, any real renunciation on 
the part of the individuals, that the position in which they find 
themselves as a result of the contract is really preferable to that in 
which they were before. Instead of a renunciation, they have made an 
advantageous exchange: instead of an uncertain and precarious way of 
living they have got one that is better and more secure; instead of 
natural independence they have got liberty, instead of the power to harm 
others security for themselves, and instead of their strength, which 
others might overcome, a right which social union makes invincible. 
Their very life, which they have devoted to the State, is by it 
constantly protected; and when they risk it in the State's defence, what 
more are they doing than giving back what they have received from it? 
What are they doing that they would not do more often and with greater 
danger in the state of nature, in which they would inevitably have to 
fight battles at the peril of their lives in defence of that which is 
the means of their preservation? All have indeed to fight when their 
country needs them; but then no one has ever to fight for himself. Do we 
not gain something by running, on behalf of what gives us our security, 
only some of the risks we should have to run for ourselves, as soon as 
we lost it?

CHAPTER 5.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
THE RIGHT OF LIFE AND DEATH 
</head> 
 
<p> 
THE question is often asked how individuals, having no right to dispose 
of their own lives, can transfer to the Sovereign a right which they do 
not possess. The difficulty of answering this question seems to me to 
lie in its being wrongly stated. Every man has a right to risk his own 
life in order to preserve it. Has it ever been said that a man who 
throws himself out of the window to escape from a fire is guilty of 
suicide? Has such a crime ever been laid to the charge of him who 
perishes in a storm because, when he went on board, he knew of the 
danger? 
</p><p> 
The social treaty has for its end the preservation of the contracting 
parties. He who wills the end wills the means also, and the means must 
involve some risks, and even some losses. He who wishes to preserve his 
life at others' expense should also, when it is necessary, be ready to 
give it up for their sake. Furthermore, the citizen is no longer the 
judge of the dangers to which the law-desires him to expose himself; and 
when the prince says to him: "It is expedient for the State that you 
should die," he ought to die, because it is only on that condition that 
he has been living in security up to the present, and because his life 
is no longer a mere bounty of nature, but a gift made conditionally by 
the State. 
</p><p> 
The death-penalty inflicted upon criminals may be looked on in much the 
same light: it is in order that we may not fall victims to an assassin 
that we consent to die if we ourselves turn assassins. In this treaty, 
so far from disposing of our own lives, we think only of securing them, 
and it is not to be assumed that any of the parties then expects to get 
hanged. 
</p><p> 
Again, every malefactor, by attacking social rights, becomes on forfeit 
a rebel and a traitor to his country; by violating its laws be ceases to 
be a member of it; he even makes war upon it. In such a case the 
preservation of the State is inconsistent with his own, and one or the 
other must perish; in putting the guilty to death, we slay not so much 
the citizen as an enemy. The trial and the judgment are the proofs that 
he has broken the social treaty, and is in consequence no longer a 
member of the State. Since, then, he has recognised himself to be such 
by living there, he must be removed by exile as a violator of the 
compact, or by death as a public enemy; for such an enemy is not a moral 
person, but merely a man; and in such a case the right of war is to kill 
the vanquished. 
</p><p> 
But, it will be said, the condemnation of a criminal is a particular 
act. I admit it: but such condemnation is not a function of the 
Sovereign; it is a right the Sovereign can confer without being able 
itself to exert it. All my ideas are consistent, but I cannot expound 
them all at once. 
</p><p> 
We may add that frequent punishments are always a sign of weakness or 
remissness on the part of the government. There is not a single ill-doer 
who could not be turned to some good. The State has no right to put to 
death, even for the sake of making an example, any one whom it can leave 
alive without danger. 
</p><p> 
The right of pardoning or exempting the guilty from a penalty imposed by 
the law and pronounced by the judge belongs only to the authority which 
is superior to both judge and law, i.e., the Sovereign; each its right 
in this matter is far from clear, and the cases for exercising it are 
extremely rare. In a well-governed State, there are few punishments, not 
because there are many pardons, but because criminals are rare; it is 
when a State is in decay that the multitude of crimes is a guarantee of 
impunity. Under the Roman Republic, neither the Senate nor the Consuls 
ever attempted to pardon; even the people never did so, though it 
sometimes revoked its own decision. Frequent pardons mean that crime 
will soon need them no longer, and no one can help seeing whither that 
leads. But I feel my heart protesting and restraining my pen; let us 
leave these questions to the just man who has never offended, and would 
himself stand in no need of pardon.

LAW 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d37"> 
 
 
<p> 
BY the social compact we have given the body politic existence and life; 
we have now by legislation to give it movement and will. For the 
original act by which the body is formed and united still in no respect 
determines what it ought to do for its preservation. 
</p><p> 
What is well and in conformity with order is so by the nature of things 
and independently of human conventions. All justice comes from God, who 
is its sole source; but if we knew how to receive so high an 
inspiration, we should need neither government nor laws. Doubtless, 
there is a universal justice emanating from reason alone; but this 
justice, to be admitted among us, must be mutual. Humanly speaking, in 
default of natural sanctions, the laws of justice are ineffective among 
men: they merely make for the good of the wicked and the undoing of the 
just, when the just man observes them towards everybody and nobody 
observes them towards him. Conventions and laws are therefore needed to 
join rights to duties and refer justice to its object. In the state of 
nature, where everything is common, I owe nothing to him whom I have 
promised nothing; I recognise as belonging to others only what is of no 
use to me. In the state of society all rights are fixed by law, and the 
case becomes different. 
</p><p> 
But what, after all, is a law? As long as we remain satisfied with 
attaching purely metaphysical ideas to the word, we shall go on arguing 
without arriving at an understanding; and when we have defined a law of 
nature, we shall be no nearer the definition of a law of the State. 
</p><p> 
I have already said that there can be no general will directed to a 
particular object. Such an object must be either within or outside the 
State. If outside, a will which is alien to it cannot be, in relation to 
it, general; if within, it is part of the State, and in that case there 
arises a relation between whole and part which makes them two separate 
beings, of which the part is one, and the whole minus the part the 
other. But the whole minus a part cannot be the whole; and while this 
relation persists, there can be no whole, but only two unequal parts; 
and it follows that the will of one is no longer in any respect general 
in relation to the other. 
</p><p> 
But when the whole people decrees for the whole people, it is 
considering only itself; and if a relation is then formed, it is between 
two aspects of the entire object, without there being any division of 
the whole. In that case the matter about which the decree is made is, 
like the decreeing will, general. This act is what I call a law. 
</p><p> 
When I say that the object of laws is always general, I mean that law 
considers subjects <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italic">en masse</hi></foreign> and actions in the abstract, and never a 
particular person or action. Thus the law may indeed decree that there 
shall be privileges, but cannot confer them on anybody by name. It may 
set up several classes of citizens, and even lay down the qualifications 
for membership of these classes, but it cannot nominate such and such 
persons as belonging to them; it may establish a monarchical government 
and hereditary succession, but it cannot choose a king, or nominate a 
royal family. In a word, no function which has a particular object 
belongs to the legislative power. 
</p><p> 
On this view, we at once see that it can no longer be asked whose 
business it is to make laws, since they are acts of the general will; 
nor whether the prince is above the law, since he is a member of the 
State; nor whether the law can be unjust, since no one is unjust to 
himself; nor how we can be both free and subject to the laws, since they 
are but registers of our wills. 
</p><p> 
We see further that, as the law unites universality of will with 
universality of object, what a man, whoever he be, commands of his own 
motion cannot be a law; and even what the Sovereign commands with regard 
to a particular matter is no nearer being a law, but is a decree, an 
act, not of sovereignty, but of magistracy. 
</p><p> 
I therefore give the name "Republic" to every State that is governed by 
laws, no matter what the form of its administration may be: for only in 
such a case does the public interest govern, and the <foreign 
lang="lat">res publica</foreign> rank as a <hi rend="italic">reality.</hi> Every legitimate 
government is republican; 
<ref target="n10">[10]</ref> 
what government is I will explain later on. 
</p><p> 
Laws are, properly speaking, only the conditions of civil association. 
The people, being subject to the laws, ought to be their author: the 
conditions of the society ought to be regulated solely by those who come 
together to form it. But how are they to regulate them? Is it to be by 
common agreement, by a sudden inspiration? Has the body politic an organ 
to declare its will? Who can give it the foresight to formulate and 
announce its acts in advance? Or how is it to announce them in the hour 
of need? How can a blind multitude, which often does not know what it 
wills, because it rarely knows what is good for it, carry out for itself 
so great and difficult an enterprise as a system of legislation? Of 
itself the people wills always the good, but of itself it by no means 
always sees it. The general will is always in the right, but the 
judgment which guides it is not always enlightened. It must be got to 
see objects as they are, and sometimes as they ought to appear to it; it 
must be shown the good road it is in search of, secured from the 
seductive influences of individual wills, taught to see times and spaces 
as a series, and made to weigh the attractions of present and sensible 
advantages against the danger of distant and hidden evils. The 
individuals see the good they reject; the public wills the good it does 
not see. All stand equally in need of guidance. The former must be 
compelled to bring their wills into conformity with their reason; the 
latter must be taught to know what it wills. If that is done, public 
enlightenment leads to the union of understanding and will in the social 
body: the parts are made to work exactly together, and the whole is 
raised to its highest power. This makes a legislator necessary.

 I understand by this word, not merely an aristocracy or a democracy, 
but generally any government directed by the general will, which is the 
law. To be legitimate, the government must be, not one with the 
Sovereign, but its minister. In such a case even a monarchy is a 
Republic. This will be made clearer in the following book.

THE LEGISLATOR 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d40"> 
 
 
<p> 
IN order to discover the rules of society best suited to nations, a 
superior intelligence beholding all the passions of men without 
experiencing any of them would be needed. This intelligence would have 
to be wholly unrelated to our nature, while knowing it through and 
through; its happiness would have to be independent of us, and yet ready 
to occupy itself with ours; and lastly, it would have, in the march of 
time, to look forward to a distant glory, and, working in one century, 
to be able to enjoy in the next. 
<ref target="n11">[11]</ref> 
It would take gods to give men laws. 
</p><p> 
What Caligula argued from the facts, Plato, in the dialogue called the 
<hi rend="italic">Politicus,</hi> argued in defining the civil or kingly man, on the basis of 
right. But if great princes are rare, how much more so are great 
legislators? The former have only to follow the pattern which the latter 
have to lay down. The legislator is the engineer who invents the 
machine, the prince merely the mechanic who sets it up and makes it go. 
"At the birth of societies," says Montesquieu, "the rulers of Republics 
establish institutions, and afterwards the institutions mould the 
rulers." 
<ref target="n12">[12]</ref> 
</p><p> 
He who dares to undertake the making of a people's institutions ought to 
feel himself capable, so to speak, of changing human nature, of 
transforming each individual, who is by himself a complete and solitary 
whole, into part of a greater whole from which he in a manner receives 
his life and being; of altering man's constitution for the purpose of 
strengthening it; and of substituting a partial and moral existence for 
the physical and independent existence nature has conferred on us all. 
He must, in a word, take away from man his own resources and give him 
instead new ones alien to him, and incapable of being made use of 
without the help of other men. The more completely these natural 
resources are annihilated, the greater and the more lasting are those 
which he acquires, and the more stable and perfect the new institutions; 
so that if each citizen is nothing and can do nothing without the rest, 
and the resources acquired by the whole are equal or superior to the 
aggregate of the resources of all the individuals, it may be said that 
legislation is at the highest possible point of perfection. 
</p><p> 
The legislator occupies in every respect an extraordinary position in 
the State. If he should do so by reason of his genius, he does so no 
less by reason of his office, which is neither magistracy, nor 
Sovereignty. This office, which sets up the Republic, nowhere enters 
into its constitution; it is an individual and superior function, which 
has nothing in common with human empire; for if he who holds command 
over men ought not to have command over the laws, he who has command 
over the laws ought not any more to have it over men; or else his laws 
would be the ministers of his passions and would often merely serve to 
perpetuate his injustices: his private aims would inevitably mar the 
sanctity of his work. 
</p><p> 
When Lycurgus gave laws to his country, he began by resigning the 
throne. It was the custom of most Greek towns to entrust the 
establishment of their laws to foreigners. The Republics of modern Italy 
in many cases followed this example; Geneva did the same and profited by 
it. 
<ref target="n13">[13]</ref> 
Rome, when it was most prosperous, suffered a revival of all the crimes 
of tyranny, and was brought to the verge of destruction, because it put 
the legislative authority and the sovereign power into the same hands. 
</p><p> 
Nevertheless, the <foreign lang="lat">decemvirs</foreign> themselves 
never claimed the right to pass any law merely on their own authority. 
"Nothing we propose to you," they said to the people, "can pass into law 
without your consent. Romans, be yourselves the authors of the laws 
which are to make you happy." 
</p><p> 
He, therefore, who draws up the laws has, or should have, no right of 
legislation, and the people cannot, even if it wishes, deprive itself of 
this incommunicable right, because, according to the fundamental 
compact, only the general will can bind the individuals, and there can 
be no assurance that a particular will is in conformity with the general 
will, until it has been put to the free vote of the people. This I have 
said already; but it is worth while to repeat it. 
</p><p> 
Thus in the task of legislation we find together two things which appear 
to be incompatible: an enterprise too difficult for human powers, and, 
for its execution, an authority that is no authority. 
</p><p> 
There is a further difficulty that deserves attention. Wise men, if they 
try to speak their language to the common herd instead of its own, 
cannot possibly make themselves understood. There are a thousand kinds 
of ideas which it is impossible to translate into popular language. 
Conceptions that are too general and objects that are too remote are 
equally out of its range: each individual, having no taste for any other 
plan of government than that which suits his particular interest, finds 
it difficult to realise the advantages he might hope to draw from the 
continual privations good laws impose. For a young people to be able to 
relish sound principles of political theory and follow the fundamental 
rules of statecraft, the effect would have to become the cause; the 
social spirit, which should be created by these institutions, would have 
to preside over their very foundation; and men would have to be before 
law what they should become by means of law. The legislator therefore, 
being unable to appeal to either force or reason, must have recourse to 
an authority of a different order, capable of constraining without 
violence and persuading without convincing. 
</p><p> 
This is what has, in all ages, compelled the fathers of nations to have 
recourse to divine intervention and credit the gods with their own 
wisdom, in order that the peoples, submitting to the laws of the State 
as to those of nature, and recognising the same power in the formation 
of the city as in that of man, might obey freely, and bear with docility 
the yoke of the public happiness. 
</p><p> 
This sublime reason, far above the range of the common herd, is that 
whose decisions the legislator puts into the mouth of the immortals, in 
order to constrain by divine authority those whom human prudence could 
not move. 
<ref target="n14">[14]</ref> 
But it is not anybody who can make the gods speak, or get himself 
believed when he proclaims himself their interpreter. The great soul of 
the legislator is the only miracle that can prove his mission.  Any man 
may grave tablets of stone, or buy an oracle, or feign secret 
intercourse with some divinity, or train a bird to whisper in his ear, 
or find other vulgar ways of imposing on the people. He whose knowledge 
goes no further may perhaps gather round him a band of fools; but he 
will never found an empire, and his extravagances will quickly perish 
with him. Idle tricks form a passing tie; only wisdom can make it 
lasting. The Judaic law, which still subsists, and that of the child of 
Ishmael, which, for ten centuries, has ruled half the world, still 
proclaim the great men who laid them down; and, while the pride of 
philosophy or the blind spirit of faction sees in them no more than 
lucky impostures, the true political theorist admires, in the 
institutions they set up, the great and powerful genius which presides 
over things made to endure. 
</p><p> 
We should not, with Warburton, conclude from this that politics and 
religion have among us a common object, but that, in the first periods 
of nations, the one is used as an instrument for the other.

THE PEOPLE 
</head> 
 
<p> 
AS, before putting up a large building, the architect surveys and sounds 
the site to see if it will bear the weight, the wise legislator does not 
begin by laying down laws good in themselves, but by investigating the 
fitness of the people, for which they are destined, to receive them. 
Plato refused to legislate for the Arcadians and the Cyren&aelig;ans, because 
he knew that both peoples were rich and could not put up with equality; 
and good laws and bad men were found together in Crete, because Minos 
had inflicted discipline on a people already burdened with vice. 
</p><p> 
A thousand nations have achieved earthly greatness, that could never 
have endured good laws; even such as could have endured them could have 
done so only for a very brief period of their long history. Most 
peoples, like most men, are docile only in youth; as they grow old they 
become incorrigible. When once customs have become established and 
prejudices inveterate, it is dangerous and useless to attempt their 
reformation; the people, like the foolish and cowardly patients who rave 
at sight of the doctor, can no longer bear that any one should lay hands 
on its faults to remedy them. 
</p><p> 
There are indeed times in the history of States when, just as some kinds 
of illness turn men's heads and make them forget the past, periods of 
violence and revolutions do to peoples what these crises do to 
individuals: horror of the past takes the place of forgetfulness, and 
the State, set on fire by civil wars, is born again, so to speak, from 
its ashes, and takes on anew, fresh from the jaws of death, the vigour 
of youth. Such were Sparta at the time of Lycurgus, Rome after the 
Tarquins, and, in modern times, Holland and Switzerland after the 
expulsion of the tyrants. 
</p><p> 
But such events are rare; they are exceptions, the cause of which is 
always to be found in the particular constitution of the State 
concerned. They cannot even happen twice to the same people, for it can 
make itself free as long as it remains barbarous, but not when the civic 
impulse has lost its vigour. Then disturbances may destroy it, but 
revolutions cannot mend it: it needs a master, and not a liberator. Free 
peoples, be mindful of this maxim: "Liberty may be gained, but can never 
be recovered." 
</p><p> 
Youth is not infancy. There is for nations, as for men, a period of 
youth, or, shall we say, maturity, before which they should not be made 
subject to laws; but the maturity of a people is not always easily 
recognisable, and, if it is anticipated, the work is spoilt. One people 
is amenable to discipline from the beginning; another, not after ten 
centuries. Russia will never be really civilised, because it was 
civilised too soon. Peter had a genius for imitation; but he lacked true 
genius, which is creative and makes all from nothing. He did some good 
things, but most of what he did was out of place. He saw that his people 
was barbarous, but did not see that it was not ripe for civilisation: he 
wanted to civilise it when it needed only hardening. His first wish was 
to make Germans or Englishmen, when he ought to have been making 
Russians; and he prevented his subjects from ever becoming what they 
might have been by persuading them that they were what they are not. In 
this fashion too a French teacher turns out his pupil to be an infant 
prodigy, and for the rest of his life to be nothing whatsoever. The 
empire of Russia will aspire to conquer Europe, and will itself be 
conquered. The Tartars, its subjects or neighbours, will become its 
masters and ours, by a revolution which I regard as inevitable. Indeed, 
all the kings of Europe are working in concert to hasten its coming.

THE PEOPLE (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>) 
</head> 
 
<p> 
As nature has set bounds to the stature of a well-made man, and, outside 
those limits, makes nothing but giants or dwarfs, similarly, for the 
constitution of a State to be at its best, it is possible to fix limits 
that will make it neither too large for good government, nor too small 
for self-maintenance. In every body politic there is a maximum strength 
which it cannot exceed and which it only loses by increasing in size. 
Every extension of the social tie means its relaxation; and, generally 
speaking, a small State is stronger in proportion than a great one. 
</p><p> 
A thousand arguments could be advanced in favour of this principle. 
First, long distances make administration more difficult, just as a 
weight becomes heavier at the end of a longer lever. Administration 
therefore becomes more and more burdensome as the distance grows 
greater; for, in the first place, each city has its own, which is paid 
for by the people: each district its own, still paid for by the people: 
then comes each province, and then the great governments, satrapies, and 
vice-royalties, always costing more the higher you go, and always at the 
expense of the unfortunate people. Last of all comes the supreme 
administration, which eclipses all the rest. All these over charges are 
a continual drain upon the subjects; so far from being better governed 
by all these different orders, they are worse governed than if there 
were only a single authority over them. In the meantime, there scarce 
remain resources enough to meet emergencies; and, when recourse must be 
had to these, the State is always on the eve of destruction. 
</p><p> 
This is not all; not only has the government less vigour and promptitude 
for securing the observance of the laws, preventing nuisances, 
correcting abuses, and guarding against seditious undertakings begun in 
distant places; the people has less affection for its rulers, whom it 
never sees, for its country, which, to its eyes, seems like the world, 
and for its fellow-citizens, most of whom are unknown to it. The same 
laws cannot suit so many diverse provinces with different customs, 
situated in the most various climates, and incapable of enduring a 
uniform government. Different laws lead only to trouble and confusion 
among peoples which, living under the same rulers and in constant 
communication one with another, intermingle and intermarry, and, coming 
under the sway of new customs, never know if they can call their very 
patrimony their own. Talent is buried, virtue unknown and vice 
unpunished, among such a multitude of men who do not know one another, 
gathered together in one place at the seat of the central 
administration. The leaders, overwhelmed with business, see nothing for 
themselves; the State is governed by clerks. Finally, the measures which 
have to be taken to maintain the general authority, which all these 
distant officials wish to escape or to impose upon, absorb all the 
energy of the public, so that there is none left for the happiness of 
the people. There is hardly enough to defend it when need arises, and 
thus a body which is too big for its constitution gives way and falls 
crushed under its own weight. 
</p><p> 
Again, the State must assure itself a safe foundation, if it is to have 
stability, and to be able to resist the shocks it cannot help 
experiencing, as well as the efforts it will be forced to make for its 
maintenance; for all peoples have a kind of centrifugal force that makes 
them continually act one against another, and tend to aggrandise 
themselves at their neighbours' expense, like the vortices of Descartes. 
Thus the weak run the risk of being soon swallowed up; and it is almost 
impossible for any one to preserve itself except by putting itself in a 
state of equilibrium with all, so that the pressure is on all sides 
practically equal. 
</p><p> 
It may therefore be seen that there are reasons for expansion and 
reasons for contraction; and it is no small part of the statesman's 
skill to hit between them the mean that is most favourable to the 
preservation of the State. It may be said that the reason for expansion, 
being merely external and relative, ought to be subordinate to the 
reasons for contraction, which are internal and absolute. A strong and 
healthy constitution is the first thing to look for; and it is better to 
count on the vigour which comes of good government than on the resources 
a great territory furnishes. 
</p><p> 
It may be added that there have been known States so constituted that 
the necessity of making conquests entered into their very constitution, 
and that, in order to maintain themselves, they were forced to expand 
ceaselessly. It may be that they congratulated themselves greatly on 
this fortunate necessity, which none the less indicated to them, along 
with the limits of their greatness, the inevitable moment of their fall.

THE PEOPLE (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>) 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d45"> 
 
 
<p> 
A BODY politic may be measured in two ways -- either by the extent of 
its territory, or by the number of its people; and there is, between 
these two measurements, a right relation which makes the State really 
great. The men make the State, and the territory sustains the men; the 
right relation therefore is that the land should suffice for the 
maintenance of the inhabitants, and that there should be as many 
inhabitants as the land can maintain. In this proportion lies the 
maximum strength of a given number of people; for, if there is too much 
land, it is troublesome to guard and inadequately cultivated, produces 
more than is needed, and soon gives rise to wars of defence; if there is 
not enough, the State depends on its neighbours for what it needs over 
and above, and this soon gives rise to wars of offence. Every people, to 
which its situation gives no choice save that between commerce and war, 
is weak in itself: it depends on its neighbours, and on circumstances; 
its existence can never be more than short and uncertain. It either 
conquers others, and changes its situation, or it is conquered and 
becomes nothing. Only insignificance or greatness can keep it free. 
</p><p> 
No fixed relation can be stated between the extent of territory and the 
population that are adequate one to the other, both because of the 
differences in the quality of land, in its fertility, in the nature of 
its products, and in the influence of climate, and because of the 
different tempers of those who inhabit it; for some in a fertile country 
consume little, and others on an ungrateful soil much. The greater or 
less fecundity of women, the conditions that are more or less favourable 
in each country to the growth of population, and the influence the 
legislator can hope to exercise by his institutions, must also be taken 
into account. The legislator therefore should not go by what he sees, 
but by what he foresees; he should stop not so much at the state in 
which he actually finds the population, as at that to which it ought 
naturally to attain. Lastly, there are countless cases in which the 
particular local circumstances demand or allow the acquisition of a 
greater territory than seems necessary. Thus, expansion will be great in 
a mountainous country, where the natural products, i.e., woods and 
pastures, need less labour, where we know from experience that women are 
more fertile than in the plains, and where a great expanse of slope 
affords only a small level tract that can be counted on for vegetation. 
On the other hand, contraction is possible on the coast, even in lands 
of rocks and nearly barren sands, because there fishing makes up to a 
great extent for the lack of land-produce, because the inhabitants have 
to congregate together more in order to repel pirates, and further 
because it is easier to unburden the country of its superfluous 
inhabitants by means of colonies. 
</p><p> 
To these conditions of law-giving must be added one other which, though 
it cannot take the place of the rest, renders them all useless when it 
is absent. This is the enjoyment of peace and plenty; for the moment at 
which a State sets its house in order is, like the moment when a 
battalion is forming up, that when its body is least capable of offering 
resistance and easiest to destroy. A better resistance could be made at 
a time of absolute disorganisation than at a moment of fermentation, 
when each is occupied with his own position and not with the danger. If 
war, famine, or sedition arises at this time of crisis, the State will 
inevitably be overthrown. 
</p><p> 
Not that many governments have not been set up during such storms; but 
in such cases these governments are themselves the State's destroyers. 
Usurpers always bring about or select troublous times to get passed, 
under cover of the public terror, destructive laws, which the people 
would never adopt in cold blood. The moment chosen is one of the surest 
means of distinguishing the work of the legislator from that of the 
tyrant. 
</p><p> 
What people, then, is a fit subject for legislation? One which, already 
bound by some unity of origin, interest, or convention, has never yet 
felt the real yoke of law; one that has neither customs nor 
superstitions deeply ingrained, one which stands in no fear of being 
overwhelmed by sudden invasion; one which, without entering into its 
neighbours' quarrels, can resist each of them single-handed, or get the 
help of one to repel another; one in which every member may be known by 
every other, and there is no need to lay on any man burdens too heavy 
for a man to bear; one which can do without other peoples, and without 
which all others can do; 
<ref target="n15">[15]</ref> 
one which is neither rich nor poor, but self-sufficient; and, lastly, 
one which unites the consistency of an ancient people with the docility 
of a new one. Legislation is made difficult less by what it is necessary 
to build up than by what has to be destroyed; and what makes success so 
rare is the impossibility of finding natural simplicity together with 
social requirements. All these conditions are indeed rarely found 
united, and therefore few States have good constitutions. 
</p><p> 
There is still in Europe one country capable of being given laws -- 
Corsica. The valour and persistency with which that brave people has 
regained and defended its liberty well deserves that some wise man 
should teach it how to preserve what it has won. I have a feeling that 
some day that little island will astonish Europe.

 If there were two neighbouring peoples, one of which could not do 
without the other, it would be very hard on the former, and very 
dangerous for the latter. Every wise nation, in such a case, would make 
haste to free the other from dependence. The Republic of Thiascala, 
enclosed by the Mexican Empire, preferred doing without salt to buying 
from the Mexicans, or even getting it from them as a gift. The 
Thiascalans were wise enough to see the snare hidden under such 
liberality. They kept their freedom, and that little State, shut up in 
that great Empire, was finally the instrument of its ruin.

<lb/> 
THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS OF LEGISLATION 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d48"> 
 
 
<p> 
IF we ask in what precisely consists the greatest good of all, which 
should be the end of every system of legislation, we shall find it 
reduce itself to two main objects, liberty and equality -- liberty, 
because all particular dependence means so much force taken from the 
body of the State and equality, because liberty cannot exist without it. 
</p><p> 
I have already defined civil liberty; by equality, we should understand, 
not that the degrees of power and riches are to be absolutely identical 
for everybody; but that power shall never be great enough for violence, 
and shall always be exercised by virtue of rank and law; and that, in 
respect of riches, no citizen shall ever be wealthy enough to buy 
another, and none poor enough to be forced to sell himself: 
<ref target="n16">[16]</ref> 
which implies, on the part of the great, moderation in goods and 
position, and, on the side of the common sort, moderation in avarice and 
covetousness. 
</p><p> 
Such equality, we are told, is an unpractical ideal that cannot actually 
exist. But if its abuse is inevitable, does it follow that we should not 
at least make regulations concerning it? It is precisely because the 
force of circumstances tends continually to destroy equality that the 
force of legislation should always tend to its maintenance. 
</p><p> 
But these general objects of every good legislative system need 
modifying in every country in accordance with the local situation and 
the temper of the inhabitants; and these circumstances should determine, 
in each case, the particular system of institutions which is best, not 
perhaps in itself, but for the State for which it is destined. If, for 
instance, the soil is barren and unproductive, or the land too crowded 
for its inhabitants, the people should turn to industry and the crafts, 
and exchange what they produce for the commodities they lack. If, on the 
other hand, a people dwells in rich plains and fertile slopes, or, in a 
good land, lacks inhabitants, it should give all its attention to 
agriculture, which causes men to multiply, and should drive out the 
crafts, which would only result in depopulation, by grouping in a few 
localities the few inhabitants there are. 
<ref target="n17">[17]</ref> 
If a nation dwells on an extensive and convenient coast-line, let it 
cover the sea with ships and foster commerce and navigation. It will 
have a life that will be short and glorious. If, on its coasts, the sea 
washes nothing but almost inaccessible rocks, let it remain barbarous 
and ichthyophagous: it will have a quieter, perhaps a better, and 
certainly a happier life. In a word, besides the principles that are 
common to all, every nation has in itself something that gives them a 
particular application, and makes its legislation peculiarly its own. 
Thus, among the Jews long ago and more recently among the Arabs, the 
chief object was religion, among the Athenians letters, at Carthage and 
Tyre commerce, at Rhodes shipping, at Sparta war, at Rome virtue. The 
author of <hi rend="italic">The Spirit of the Laws</hi> has shown with many examples by what 
art the legislator directs the constitution towards each of these 
objects. What makes the constitution of a State really solid and lasting 
is the due observance of what is proper, so that the natural relations 
are always in agreement with the laws on every point, and law only 
serves, so to speak, to assure, accompany and rectify them. But if the 
legislator mistakes his object and adopts a principle other than 
circumstances naturally direct; if his principle makes for servitude 
while they make for liberty, or if it makes for riches, while they make 
for populousness, or if it makes for peace, while they make for conquest 
-- the laws will insensibly lose their influence, the constitution will 
alter, and the State will have no rest from trouble till it is either 
destroyed or changed, and nature has resumed her invincible sway.

</div3> 
 
<div3 type="notes" id="d49">

<note id="n16"><seg type="note-symbol">[16]</seg> <p>
 If the object is to give the State consistency, bring the two 
extremes as near to each other as possible; allow neither rich men nor 
beggars. These two estates, which are naturally inseparable, are equally 
fatal to the common good; from the one come the friends of tyranny, and 
from the other tyrants. It is always between them that public liberty is 
put up to auction; the one buys, and the other sells.

 "Any branch of foreign commerce," says M. d'Argenson, "creates on 
the whole only apparent advantage for the kingdom in general; it may

gains nothing by it, and the people is no better off."

THE DIVISION OF THE LAWS 
</head> 
 
<p> 
IF the whole is to be set in order, and the commonwealth put into the 
best possible shape, there are various relations to be considered. 
First, there is the action of the complete body upon itself, the 
relation of the whole to the whole, of the Sovereign to the State; and 
this relation, as we shall see, is made up of the relations of the 
intermediate terms. 
</p><p> 
The laws which regulate this relation bear the name of political laws, 
and are also called fundamental laws, not without reason if they are 
wise. For, if there is, in each State, only one good system, the people 
that is in possession of it should hold fast to this; but if the 
established order is bad, why should laws that prevent men from being 
good be regarded as fundamental? Besides, in any case, a people is 
always in a position to change its laws, however good; for, if it choose 
to do itself harm, who can have a right to stop it? 
</p><p> 
The second relation is that of the members one to another, or to the 
body as a whole; and this relation should be in the first respect as 
unimportant, and in the second as important, as possible. Each citizen 
would then be perfectly independent of all the rest, and at the same 
time very dependent on the city; which is brought about always by the 
same means, as the strength of the State can alone secure the liberty of 
its members. From this second relation arise civil laws. 
</p><p> 
We may consider also a third kind of relation between the individual and 
the law, a relation of disobedience to its penalty. This gives rise to 
the setting up of criminal laws, which, at bottom, are less a particular 
class of law than the sanction behind all the rest. 
</p><p> 
Along with these three kinds of law goes a fourth, most important of 
all, which is not graven on tablets of marble or brass, but on the 
hearts of the citizens. This forms the real constitution of the State, 
takes on every day new powers, when other laws decay or die out, 
restores them or takes their place, keeps a people in the ways in which 
it was meant to go, and insensibly replaces authority by the force of 
habit. I am speaking of morality, of custom, above all of public 
opinion; a power unknown to political thinkers, on which none the less 
success in everything else depends. With this the great legislator 
concerns himself in secret, though he seems to confine himself to 
particular regulations; for these are only the arc of the arch, while 
manners and morals, slower to arise, form in the end its immovable 
keystone. 
</p><p> 
Among the different classes of laws, the political, which determine the 
forms of the government, are alone relevant to my subject.

CHAPTER 1.<lb/>

 GOVERNMENT IN GENERAL 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d53"> 
 
 
<p> 
I WARN the reader that this chapter requires careful reading, and that I 
am unable to make myself clear to those who refuse to be attentive. 
Every free action is produced by the concurrence of two causes; one 
moral, i.e., the will which determines the act; the other physical, 
i.e., the power which executes it. When I walk towards an object, it is 
necessary first that I should will to go there, and, in the second 
place, that my feet should carry me. If a paralytic wills to run and an 
active man wills not to, they will both stay where they are. The body 
politic has the same motive powers; here too force and will are 
distinguished, will under the name of legislative power and force under 
that of executive power. Without their concurrence, nothing is, or 
should be, done. 
</p><p> 
We have seen that the legislative power belongs to the people, and can 
belong to it alone. It may, on the other hand, readily be seen, from the 
principles laid down above, that the executive power cannot belong to 
the generality as legislature or Sovereign, because it consists wholly 
of particular acts which fall outside the competency of the law, and 
consequently of the Sovereign, whose acts must always be laws. 
</p><p> 
The public force therefore needs an agent of its own to bind it together 
and set it to work under the direction of the general will, to serve as 
a means of communication between the State and the Sovereign, and to do 
for the collective person more or less what the union of soul and body 
does for man. Here we have what is, in the State, the basis of 
government, often wrongly confused with the Sovereign, whose minister it 
is. 
</p><p> 
What then is government? An intermediate body set up between the 
subjects and the Sovereign, to secure their mutual correspondence, 
charged with the execution of the laws and the maintenance of liberty, 
both civil and political. 
</p><p> 
The members of this body are called magistrates or <hi rend="italic">kings,</hi> that is to say 
<hi rend="italic">governors,</hi> and the whole body bears the name <hi rend="italic">prince.</hi> 
<ref target="n18">[18]</ref> 
Thus those who hold that the act, by which a people puts itself under a 
prince, is not a contract, are certainly right. It is simply and solely 
a commission, an employment, in which the rulers, mere officials of the 
Sovereign, exercise in their own name the power of which it makes them 
depositaries. This power it can limit, modify or recover at pleasure; 
for the alienation of such a right is incompatible with the nature of 
the social body, and contrary to the end of association. 
</p><p> 
I call then <hi rend="italic">government,</hi> or supreme administration, the legitimate 
exercise of the executive power, and prince or magistrate the man or the 
body entrusted with that administration. 
</p><p> 
In government reside the intermediate forces whose relations make up 
that of the whole to the whole, or of the Sovereign to the State. This 
last relation may be represented as that between the extreme terms of a 
continuous proportion, which has government as its mean proportional. 
The government gets from the Sovereign the orders it gives the people, 
and, for the State to be properly balanced, there must, when everything 
is reckoned in, be equality between the product or power of the 
government taken in itself, and the product or power of the citizens, 
who are on the one hand sovereign and on the other subject. 
</p><p> 
Furthermore, none of these three terms can be altered without the 
equality being instantly destroyed. If the Sovereign desires to govern, 
or the magistrate to give laws, or if the subjects refuse to obey, 
disorder takes the place of regularity, force and will no longer act 
together, and the State is dissolved and falls into despotism or 
anarchy. Lastly, as there is only one mean proportional between each 
relation, there is also only one good government possible for a State. 
But, as countless events may change the relations of a people, not only 
may different governments be good for different peoples, but also for 
the same people at different times. 
</p><p> 
In attempting to give some idea of the various relations that may hold 
between these two extreme terms, I shall take as an example the number 
of a people, which is the most easily expressible. 
</p><p> 
Suppose the State is composed of ten thousand citizens. The Sovereign 
can only be considered collectively and as a body; but each member, as 
being a subject, is regarded as an individual: thus the Sovereign is to 
the subject as ten thousand to one, i.e., each member of the State has 
as his share only a ten-thousandth part of the sovereign authority, 
although he is wholly under its control. If the people numbers a hundred 
thousand, the condition of the subject undergoes no change, and each 
equally is under the whole authority of the laws, while his vote, being 
reduced to a hundred-thousandth part, has ten times less influence in 
drawing them up. The subject therefore remaining always a unit, the 
relation between him and the Sovereign increases with the number of the 
citizens. From this it follows that, the larger the State, the less the 
liberty. 
</p><p> 
When I say the relation increases, I mean that it grows more unequal. 
Thus the greater it is in the geometrical sense, the less relation there 
is in the ordinary sense of the word. In the former sense, the relation, 
considered according to quantity, is expressed by the quotient; in the 
latter, considered according to identity, it is reckoned by similarity. 
</p><p> 
Now, the less relation the particular wills have to the general will, 
that is, morals and manners to laws, the more should the repressive 
force be increased. The government, then, to be good, should be 
proportionately stronger as the people is more numerous. 
</p><p> 
On the other hand, as the growth of the State gives the depositaries of 
the public authority more temptations and chances of abusing their 
power, the greater the force with which the government ought to be 
endowed for keeping the people in hand, the greater too should be the 
force at the disposal of the Sovereign for keeping the government in 
hand. I am speaking, not of absolute force, but of the relative force of 
the different parts of the State. 
</p><p> 
It follows from this double relation that the continuous proportion 
between the Sovereign, the prince and the people, is by no means an 
arbitrary idea, but a necessary consequence of the nature of the body 
politic. It follows further that, one of the extreme terms, viz., the 
people, as subject, being fixed and represented by unity, whenever the 
duplicate ratio increases or diminishes, the simple ratio does the same, 
and is changed accordingly. From this we see that there is not a single 
unique and absolute form of government, but as many governments 
differing in nature as there are States differing in size. 
</p><p> 
If, ridiculing this system, any one were to say that, in order to find 
the mean proportional and give form to the body of the government, it is 
only necessary, according to me, to find the square root of the number 
of the people, I should answer that I am here taking this number only as 
an instance; that the relations of which I am speaking are not measured 
by the number of men alone, but generally by the amount of action, which 
is a combination of a multitude of causes; and that, further, if, to 
save words, I borrow for a moment the terms of geometry, I am none the 
less well aware that moral quantities do not allow of geometrical 
accuracy. 
</p><p> 
The government is on a small scale what the body politic which includes 
it is on a great one. It is a moral person endowed with certain 
faculties, active like the Sovereign and passive like the State, and 
capable of being resolved into other similar relations. This accordingly 
gives rise to a new proportion, within which there is yet another, 
according to the arrangement of the magistracies, till an indivisible 
middle term is reached, i.e., a single ruler or supreme magistrate, who 
may be represented, in the midst of this progression, as the unity 
between the fractional and the ordinal series. 
</p><p> 
Without encumbering ourselves with this multiplication of terms, let us 
rest content with regarding government as a new body within the State, 
distinct from the people and the Sovereign, and intermediate between 
them. 
</p><p> 
There is between these two bodies this essential difference, that the 
State exists by itself, and the government only through the Sovereign. 
Thus the dominant will of the prince is, or should be, nothing but the 
general will or the law; his force is only the public force concentrated 
in his hands, and, as soon as he tries to base any absolute and 
independent act on his own authority, the tie that binds the whole 
together begins to be loosened. If finally the prince should come to 
have a particular will more active than the will of the Sovereign, and 
should employ the public force in his hands in obedience to this 
particular will, there would be, so to speak, two Sovereigns, one 
rightful and the other actual, the social union would evaporate 
instantly, and the body politic would be dissolved. 
</p><p> 
However, in order that the government may have a true existence and a 
real life distinguishing it from the body of the State, and in order 
that all its members may be able to act in concert and fulfil the end 
for which it was set up, it must have a particular personality, a 
sensibility common to its members, and a force and will of its own 
making for its preservation. This particular existence implies 
assemblies, councils, power and deliberation and decision, rights, 
titles, and privileges belonging exclusively to the prince and making 
the office of magistrate more honourable in proportion as it is more 
troublesome. The difficulties lie in the manner of so ordering this 
subordinate whole within the whole, that it in no way alters the general 
constitution by affirmation of its own, and always distinguishes the 
particular force it possesses, which is destined to aid in its 
preservation, from the public force, which is destined to the 
preservation of the State; and, in a word, is always ready to sacrifice 
the government to the people, and never to sacrifice the people to the 
government. 
</p><p> 
Furthermore, although the artificial body of the government is the work 
of another artificial body, and has, we may say, only a borrowed and 
subordinate life, this does not prevent it from being able to act with 
more or less vigour or promptitude, or from being, so to speak, in more 
or less robust health. Finally, without departing directly from the end 
for which it was instituted, it may deviate more or less from it, 
according to the manner of its constitution. 
</p><p> 
From all these differences arise the various relations which the 
government ought to bear to the body of the State, according to the 
accidental and particular relations by which the State itself is 
modified, for often the government that is best in itself will become 
the most pernicious, if the relations in which it stands have altered 
according to the defects of the body politic to which it belongs.

CHAPTER 2.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
THE CONSTITUENT PRINCIPLE IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF GOVERNMENT 
</head> 
 
<p> 
TO set forth the general cause of the above differences, we must here 
distinguish between government and its principle, as we did before 
between the State and the Sovereign. 
</p><p> 
The body of the magistrate may be composed of a greater or a less number 
of members. We said that the relation of the Sovereign to the subjects 
was greater in proportion as the people was more numerous, and, by a 
clear analogy, we may say the same of the relation of the government to 
the magistrates. 
</p><p> 
But the total force of the government, being always that of the State, 
is invariable; so that, the more of this force it expends on its own 
members, the less it has left to employ on the whole people. 
</p><p> 
The more numerous the magistrates, therefore, the weaker the government. 
This principle being fundamental, we must do our best to make it clear. 
</p><p> 
In the person of the magistrate we can distinguish three essentially 
different wills: first, the private will of the individual, tending only 
to his personal advantage; secondly, the common will of the magistrates, 
which is relative solely to the advantage of the prince, and may be 
called corporate will, being general in relation to the government, and 
particular in relation to the State, of which the government forms part; 
and, in the third place, the will of the people or the sovereign will, 
which is general both in relation to the State regarded as the whole, 
and to the government regarded as a part of the whole. 
</p><p> 
In a perfect act of legislation, the individual or particular will 
should be at zero; the corporate will belonging to the government should 
occupy a very subordinate position; and, consequently, the general or 
sovereign will should always predominate and should be the sole guide of 
all the rest. 
</p><p> 
According to the natural order, on the other hand, these different wills 
become more active in proportion as they are concentrated. Thus, the 
general will is always the weakest, the corporate will second, and the 
individual will strongest of all: so that, in the government, each 
member is first of all himself, then a magistrate, and then a citizen -- 
in an order exactly the reverse of what the social system requires. 
</p><p> 
This granted, if the whole government is in the hands of one man, the 
particular and the corporate will are wholly united, and consequently 
the latter is at its highest possible degree of intensity. But, as the 
use to which the force is put depends on the degree reached by the will, 
and as the absolute force of the government is invariable, it follows 
that the most active government is that of one man. 
</p><p> 
Suppose, on the other hand, we unite the government with the legislative 
authority, and make the Sovereign prince also, and all the citizens so 
many magistrates: then the corporate will, being confounded with the 
general will, can possess no greater activity than that will, and must 
leave the particular will as strong as it can possibly be. Thus, the 
government, having always the same absolute force, will be at the lowest 
point of its relative force or activity. 
</p><p> 
These relations are incontestable, and there are other considerations 
which still further confirm them. We can see, for instance, that each 
magistrate is more active in the body to which he belongs than each 
citizen in that to which he belongs, and that consequently the 
particular will has much more influence on the acts of the government 
than on those of the Sovereign; for each magistrate is almost always 
charged with some governmental function, while each citizen, taken 
singly, exercises no function of Sovereignty. Furthermore, the bigger 
the State grows, the more its real force increases, though not in direct 
proportion to its growth; but, the State remaining the same, the number 
of magistrates may increase to any extent, without the government 
gaining any greater real force; for its force is that of the State, the 
dimension of which remains equal. Thus the relative force or activity of 
the government decreases, while its absolute or real force cannot 
increase. 
</p><p> 
Moreover, it is a certainty that promptitude in execution diminishes as 
more people are put in charge of it: where prudence is made too much of, 
not enough is made of fortune; opportunity is let slip, and deliberation 
results in the loss of its object. 
</p><p> 
I have just proved that the government grows remiss in proportion as the 
number of the magistrates increases; and I previously proved that, the 
more numerous the people, the greater should be the repressive force. 
From this it follows that the relation of the magistrates to the 
government should vary inversely to the relation of the subjects to the 
Sovereign; that is to say, the larger the State, the more should the 
government be tightened, so that the number of the rulers diminish in 
proportion to the increase of that of the people. 
</p><p> 
It should be added that I am here speaking of the relative strength of 
the government, and not of its rectitude: for, on the other hand, the 
more numerous the magistracy, the nearer the corporate will comes to the 
general will; while, under a single magistrate, the corporate will is, 
as I said, merely a particular will. Thus, what may be gained on one 
side is lost on the other, and the art of the legislator is to know how 
to fix the point at which the force and the will of the government, 
which are always in inverse proportion, meet in the relation that is 
most to the advantage of the State.

CHAPTER 3.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
THE DIVISION OF GOVERNMENTS 
</head> 
 
<p> 
WE saw in the last chapter what causes the various kinds or forms of 
government to be distinguished according to the number of the members 
composing them: it remains in this to discover how the division is made. 
</p><p> 
In the first place, the Sovereign may commit the charge of the 
government to the whole people or to the majority of the people, so that 
more citizens are magistrates than are mere private individuals. This 
form of government is called democracy. 
</p><p> 
Or it may restrict the government to a small number, so that there are 
more private citizens than magistrates; and this is named aristocracy. 
</p><p> 
Lastly, it may concentrate the whole government in the hands of a single 
magistrate from whom all others hold their power. This third form is the 
most usual, and is called monarchy, or royal government. 
</p><p> 
It should be remarked that all these forms, or at least the first two, 
admit of degree, and even of very wide differences; for democracy may 
include the whole people, or may be restricted to half. Aristocracy, in 
its turn, may be restricted indefinitely from half the people down to 
the smallest possible number. Even royalty is susceptible of a measure 
of distribution. Sparta always had two kings, as its constitution 
provided; and the Roman Empire saw as many as eight emperors at once, 
without it being possible to say that the Empire was split up. Thus 
there is a point at which each form of government passes into the next, 
and it becomes clear that, under three comprehensive denominations, 
government is really susceptible of as many diverse forms as the State 
has citizens. 
</p><p> 
There are even more: for, as the government may also, in certain 
aspects, be subdivided into other parts, one administered in one fashion 
and one in another, the combination of the three forms may result in a 
multitude of mixed forms, each of which admits of multiplication by all 
the simple forms. 
</p><p> 
There has been at all times much dispute concerning the best form of 
government, without consideration of the fact that each is in some cases 
the best, and in others the worst. 
</p><p> 
If, in the different States, the number of supreme magistrates should be 
in inverse ratio to the number of citizens, it follows that, generally, 
democratic government suits small States, aristocratic government those 
of middle size, and monarchy great ones. This rule is immediately 
deducible from the principle laid down. But it is impossible to count 
the innumerable circumstances which may furnish exceptions.

CHAPTER 4.<lb/>

DEMOCRACY 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d58"> 
 
 
<p> 
HE who makes the law knows better than any one else how it should be 
executed and interpreted. It seems then impossible to have a better 
constitution than that in which the executive and legislative powers are 
united; but this very fact renders the government in certain respects 
inadequate, because things which should be distinguished are confounded, 
and the prince and the Sovereign, being the same person, form, so to 
speak, no more than a government without government. 
</p><p> 
It is not good for him who makes the laws to execute them, or for the 
body of the people to turn its attention away from a general standpoint 
and devote it to particular objects. Nothing is more dangerous than the 
influence of private interests in public affairs, and the abuse of the 
laws by the government is a less evil than the corruption of the 
legislator, which is the inevitable sequel to a particular standpoint. 
In such a case, the State being altered in substance, all reformation 
becomes impossible, A people that would never misuse governmental powers 
would never misuse independence; a people that would always govern well 
would not need to be governed. 
</p><p> 
If we take the term in the strict sense, there never has been a real 
democracy, and there never will be. It is against the natural order for 
the many to govern and the few to be governed. It is unimaginable that 
the people should remain continually assembled to devote their time to 
public affairs, and it is clear that they cannot set up commissions for 
that purpose without the form of administration being changed. 
</p><p> 
In fact, I can confidently lay down as a principle that, when the 
functions of government are shared by several tribunals, the less 
numerous sooner or later acquire the greatest authority, if only because 
they are in a position to expedite affairs, and power thus naturally 
comes into their hands. 
</p><p> 
Besides, how many conditions that are difficult to unite does such a 
government presuppose! First, a very small State, where the people can 
readily be got together and where each citizen can with ease know all 
the rest; secondly, great simplicity of manners, to prevent business 
from multiplying and raising thorny problems; next, a large measure of 
equality in rank and fortune, without which equality of rights and 
authority cannot long subsist; lastly, little or no luxury -- for luxury 
either comes of riches or makes them necessary; it corrupts at once rich 
and poor, the rich by possession and the poor by covetousness; it sells 
the country to softness and vanity, and takes away from the State all 
its citizens, to make them slaves one to another, and one and all to 
public opinion. 
</p><p> 
This is why a famous writer has made virtue the fundamental principle of 
Republics; for all these conditions could not exist without virtue. 
But, for want of the necessary distinctions, that great thinker was 
often inexact, and sometimes obscure, and did not see that, the 
sovereign authority being everywhere the same, the same principle should 
be found in every well-constituted State, in a greater or less degree, 
it is true, according to the form of the government. 
</p><p> 
It may be added that there is no government so subject to civil wars and 
intestine agitations as democratic or popular government, because there 
is none which has so strong and continual a tendency to change to 
another form, or which demands more vigilance and courage for its 
maintenance as it is. Under such a constitution above all, the citizen 
should arm himself with strength and constancy, and say, every day of 
his life, what a virtuous Count Palatine 
<ref target="n19">[19]</ref> 
said in the Diet of Poland: <foreign lang="lat">Malo periculosam 
libertatem quam quietum servitium.</foreign> 
</p><p> 
Were there a people of gods, their government would be democratic. So 
perfect a government is not for men.

ARISTOCRACY 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d61"> 
 
 
<p> 
WE have here two quite distinct moral persons, the government and the 
Sovereign, and in consequence two general wills, one general in relation 
to all the citizens, the other only for the members of the 
administration. Thus, although the government may regulate its internal 
policy as it pleases, it can never speak to the people save in the name 
of the Sovereign, that is, of the people itself, a fact which must not 
be forgotten. 
</p><p> 
The first societies governed themselves aristocratically. The heads of 
families took counsel together on public affairs. The young bowed 
without question to the authority of experience. Hence such names as 
<hi rend="italic">priests,</hi> <hi rend="italic">elders,</hi> <hi rend="italic">senate,</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">gerontes.</hi> The savages of North America govern themselves in this way even now, and their government is 
admirable. 
</p><p> 
But, in proportion as artificial inequality produced by institutions 
became predominant over natural inequality, riches or power 
<ref target="n20">[20]</ref> 
were put before age, and aristocracy became elective. Finally, the 
transmission of the father's power along with his goods to his children, 
by creating patrician families, made government hereditary, and there 
came to be senators of twenty. 
</p><p> 
There are then three sorts of aristocracy -- natural, elective and 
hereditary. The first is only for simple peoples; the third is the worst 
of all governments; the second is the best, and is aristocracy properly 
so called. 
</p><p> 
Besides the advantage that lies in the distinction between the two 
powers, it presents that of its members being chosen; for, in popular 
government, all the citizens are born magistrates; but here magistracy 
is confined to a few, who become such only by election. 
<ref target="n21">[21]</ref> 
By this means uprightness, understanding, experience and all other 
claims to pre-eminence and public esteem become so many further 
guarantees of wise government. 
</p><p> 
Moreover, assemblies are more easily held, affairs better discussed and 
carried out with more order and diligence, and the credit of the State 
is better sustained abroad by venerable senators than by a multitude 
that is unknown or despised. 
</p><p> 
In a word, it is the best and most natural arrangement that the wisest 
should govern the many, when it is assured that they will govern for its 
profit, and not for their own. There is no need to multiply instruments, 
or get twenty thousand men to do what a hundred picked men can do even 
better. But it must not be forgotten that corporate interest here begins 
to direct the public power less under the regulation of the general 
will, and that a further inevitable propensity takes away from the laws 
part of the executive power. 
</p><p> 
If we are to speak of what is individually desirable, neither should the 
State be so small, nor a people so simple and upright, that the 
execution of the laws follows immediately from the public will, as it 
does in a good democracy. Nor should the nation be so great that the 
rulers have to scatter in order to govern it and are able to play the 
Sovereign each in his own department, and, beginning by making 
themselves independent, end by becoming masters. 
</p><p> 
But if aristocracy does not demand all the virtues needed by popular 
government, it demands others which are peculiar to itself; for 
instance, moderation on the side of the rich and contentment on that of 
the poor; for it seems that thorough-going equality would be out of 
place, as it was not found even at Sparta. 
</p><p> 
Furthermore, if this form of government carries with it a certain 
inequality of fortune, this is justifiable in order that as a rule the 
administration of public affairs may be entrusted to those who are most 
able to give them their whole time, but not, as Aristotle maintains, in 
order that the rich may always be put first. On the contrary, it is of 
importance that an opposite choice should occasionally teach the people 
that the deserts of men offer claims to pre-eminence more important than 
those of riches.

 It is of great importance that the form of the election of 
magistrates should be regulated by law; for if it is left at the 
discretion of the prince, it is impossible to avoid falling into 
hereditary aristocracy, as the Republics of Venice and Berne actually 
did. The first of these has therefore long been a State dissolved; the 
second, however, is maintained by the extreme wisdom of the senate, and 
forms an honourable and highly dangerous exception.

MONARCHY 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d64"> 
 
 
<p> 
So far, we have considered the prince as a moral and collective person, 
unified by the force of the laws, and the depositary in the State of the 
executive power. We have now to consider this power when it is gathered 
together into the hands of a natural person, a real man, who alone has 
the right to dispose of it in accordance with the laws. Such a person is 
called a monarch or king. 
</p><p> 
In contrast with other forms of administration, in which a collective 
being stands for an individual, in this form an individual stands for a 
collective being; so that the moral unity that constitutes the prince is 
at the same time a physical unity, and all the qualities, which in the 
other case are only with difficulty brought together by the law, are 
found naturally united. 
</p><p> 
Thus the will of the people, the will of the prince, the public force of 
the State, and the particular force of the government, all answer to a 
single motive power; all the springs of the machine are in the same 
hands, the whole moves towards the same end; there are no conflicting 
movements to cancel one another, and no kind of constitution can be 
imagined in which a less amount of effort produces a more considerable 
amount of action. Archimedes, seated quietly on the bank and easily 
drawing a great vessel afloat, stands to my mind for a skilful monarch, 
governing vast states from his study, and moving everything while he 
seems himself unmoved. 
</p><p> 
But if no government is more vigorous than this, there is also none in 
which the particular will holds more sway and rules the rest more 
easily. Everything moves towards the same end indeed, but this end is by 
no means that of the public happiness, and even the force of the 
administration constantly shows itself prejudicial to the State. 
</p><p> 
Kings desire to be absolute, and men are always crying out to them from 
afar that the best means of being so is to get themselves loved by their 
people. This precept is all very well, and even in some respects very 
true. Unfortunately, it will always be derided at court. The power which 
comes of a people's love is no doubt the greatest; but it is precarious 
and conditional, and princes will never rest content with it. The best 
kings desire to be in a position to be wicked, if they please, without 
forfeiting their mastery: political sermonisers may tell them to their 
hearts' content that, the people's strength being their own, their first 
interest is that the people should be prosperous, numerous and 
formidable; they are well aware that this is untrue. Their first 
personal interest is that the people should be weak, wretched, and 
unable to resist them. I admit that, provided the subjects remained 
always in submission, the prince's interest would indeed be that it 
should be powerful, in order that its power, being his own, might make 
him formidable to his neighbours; but, this interest being merely 
secondary and subordinate, and strength being incompatible with 
submission, princes naturally give the preference always to the 
principle that is more to their immediate advantage. This is what Samuel 
put strongly before the Hebrews, and what Machiavelli has clearly shown. 
He professed to teach kings; but it was the people he really taught. His 
<hi rend="italic">Prince</hi> is the book of Republicans. 
<ref target="n22">[22]</ref> 
</p><p> 
We found, on general grounds, that monarchy is suitable only for great 
States, and this is confirmed when we examine it in itself. The more 
numerous the public administration, the smaller becomes the relation 
between the prince and the subjects, and the nearer it comes to 
equality, so that in democracy the ratio is unity, or absolute equality. 
Again, as the government is restricted in numbers the ratio increases 
and reaches its maximum when the government is in the hands of a single 
person. There is then too great a distance between prince and people, 
and the State lacks a bond of union. To form such a bond, there must be 
intermediate orders, and princes, personages and nobility to compose 
them. But no such things suit a small State, to which all class 
differences mean ruin. 
</p><p> 
If, however, it is hard for a great State to be well governed, it is 
much harder for it to be so by a single man; and every one knows what 
happens when kings substitute others for themselves. 
</p><p> 
An essential and inevitable defect, which will always rank monarchical 
below the republican government, is that in a republic the public voice 
hardly ever raises to the highest positions men who are not enlightened 
and capable, and such as to fill them with honour; while in monarchies 
those who rise to the top are most often merely petty blunderers, petty 
swindlers, and petty intriguers, whose petty talents cause them to get 
into the highest positions at Court, but, as soon as they have got 
there, serve only to make their ineptitude clear to the public. The 
people is far less often mistaken in its choice than the prince; and a 
man of real worth among the king's ministers is almost as rare as a fool 
at the head of a republican government. Thus, when, by some fortunate 
chance, one of these born governors takes the helm of State in some 
monarchy that has been nearly overwhelmed by swarms of "gentlemanly" 
administrators, there is nothing but amazement at the resources he 
discovers, and his coming marks an era in his country's history. 
</p><p> 
For a monarchical State to have a chance of being well governed, its 
population and extent must be proportionate to the abilities of its 
governor. It is easier to conquer than to rule. With a long enough 
lever, the world could be moved with a single finger; to sustain it 
needs the shoulders of Hercules. However small a State may be, the 
prince is hardly ever big enough for it. When, on the other hand, it 
happens that the State is too small for its ruler, in these rare cases 
too it is ill governed, because the ruler, constantly pursuing his great 
designs, forgets the interests of the people, and makes it no less 
wretched by misusing the talents he has, than a ruler of less capacity 
would make it for want of those he had not. A kingdom should, so to 
speak, expand or contract with each reign, according to the prince's 
capabilities; but, the abilities of a senate being more constant in 
quantity, the State can then have permanent frontiers without the 
administration suffering. 
</p><p> 
The disadvantage that is most felt in monarchical government is the want 
of the continuous succession which, in both the other forms, provides an 
unbroken bond of union. When one king dies, another is needed; elections 
leave dangerous intervals and are full of storms; and unless the 
citizens are disinterested and upright to a degree which very seldom 
goes with this kind of government, intrigue and corruption abound. He to 
whom the State has sold itself can hardly help selling it in his turn 
and repaying himself, at the expense of the weak, the money the powerful 
have wrung from him. Under such an administration, venality sooner or 
later spreads through every part, and peace so enjoyed under a king is 
worse than the disorders of an interregnum. 
</p><p> 
What has been done to prevent these evils? Crowns have been made 
hereditary in certain families, and an order of succession has been set 
up, to prevent disputes from arising on the death of kings. That is to 
say, the disadvantages of regency have been put in place of those of 
election, apparent tranquillity has been preferred to wise 
administration, and men have chosen rather to risk having children, 
monstrosities, or imbeciles as rulers to having disputes over the choice 
of good kings. It has not been taken into account that, in so exposing 
ourselves to the risks this possibility entails, we are setting almost 
all the chances against us. There was sound sense in what the younger 
Dionysius said to his father, who reproached him for doing some shameful 
deed by asking, "Did I set you the example?" "No," answered his son, 
"but your father was not king." 
</p><p> 
Everything conspires to take away from a man who is set in authority 
over others the sense of justice and reason. Much trouble, we are told, 
is taken to teach young princes the art of reigning; but their education 
seems to do them no good. It would be better to begin by teaching them 
the art of obeying. The greatest kings whose praises history tells were 
not brought up to reign: reigning is a science we are never so far from 
possessing as when we have learnt too much of it, and one we acquire 
better by obeying than by commanding. <foreign lang="lat">"Nam 
utilissimus idem ac brevissimus bonarum malarumque rerum delectus 
cogitare quid aut nolueris sub alio principe, aut volueris."</foreign> 
<ref target="n23">[23]</ref> 
</p><p> 
One result of this lack of coherence is the inconstancy of royal 
government, which, regulated now on one scheme and now on another, 
according to the character of the reigning prince or those who reign for 
him, cannot for long have a fixed object or a consistent policy -- and 
this variability, not found in the other forms of government, where the 
prince is always the same, causes the State to be always shifting from 
principle to principle and from project to project. Thus we may say that 
generally, if a court is more subtle in intrigue, there is more wisdom 
in a senate, and Republics advance towards their ends by more consistent 
and better considered policies; while every revolution in a royal 
ministry creates a revolution in the State; for the principle common to 
all ministers and nearly all kings is to do in every respect the reverse 
of what was done by their predecessors. 
</p><p> 
This incoherence further clears up a sophism that is very familiar to 
royalist political writers; not only is civil government likened to 
domestic government, and the prince to the father of a family -- this 
error has already been refuted -- but the prince is also freely credited 
with all the virtues he ought to possess, and is supposed to be always 
what he should be. This supposition once made, royal government is 
clearly preferable to all others, because it is incontestably the 
strongest, and, to be the best also, wants only a corporate will more in 
conformity with the general will. 
</p><p> 
But if, according to Plato, 
<ref target="n24">[24]</ref> 
the "king by nature" is such a rarity, how often will nature and fortune 
conspire to give him a crown? And, if royal education necessarily 
corrupts those who receive it, what is to be hoped from a series of men 
brought up to reign? It is, then, wanton self-deception to confuse royal 
government with government by a good king. To see such government as it 
is in itself, we must consider it as it is under princes who are 
incompetent or wicked: for either they will come to the throne wicked or 
incompetent, or the throne will make them so. 
</p><p> 
These difficulties have not escaped our writers, who, all the same, are 
not troubled by them. The remedy, they say, is to obey without a murmur: 
God sends bad kings in His wrath, and they must be borne as the scourges 
of Heaven. Such talk is doubtless edifying; but it would be more in 
place in a pulpit than in a political book. What are we to think of a 
doctor who promises miracles, and whose whole art is to exhort the 
sufferer to patience? We know for ourselves that we must put up with a 
bad government when it is there; the question is how to find a good one.

 Machiavelli was a proper man and a good citizen; but, being attached 
to the court of the Medici, he could not help veiling his love of 
liberty in the midst of his country's oppression. The choice of his 
detestable hero, Caesar Borgia, clearly enough shows his hidden aim; and 
the contradiction between the teaching of the <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi> and that of the 
<hi rend="italic">Discourses on Livy</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">History of Florence</hi> shows that this profound 
political thinker has so far been studied only by superficial or corrupt

MIXED GOVERNMENTS 
</head> 
 
<p> 
STRICTLY speaking, there is no such thing as a simple government. An 
isolated ruler must have subordinate magistrates; a popular government 
must have a head. There is therefore, in the distribution of the 
executive power, always a gradation from the greater to the lesser 
number, with the difference that sometimes the greater number is 
dependent on the smaller, and sometimes the smaller on the greater. 
</p><p> 
Sometimes the distribution is equal, when either the constituent parts 
are in mutual dependence, as in the government of England, or the 
authority of each section is independent, but imperfect, as in Poland. 
This last form is bad; for it secures no unity in the government, and 
the State is left without a bond of union. 
</p><p> 
Is a simple or a mixed government the better? Political writers are 
always debating the question, which must be answered as we have already 
answered a question about all forms of government. 
</p><p> 
Simple government is better in itself, just because it is simple. But 
when the executive power is not sufficiently dependent upon the 
legislative power, i.e., when the prince is more closely related to the 
Sovereign than the people to the prince, this lack of proportion must be 
cured by the division of the government; for all the parts have then no 
less authority over the subjects, while their division makes them all 
together less strong against the Sovereign. 
</p><p> 
The same disadvantage is also prevented by the appointment of 
intermediate magistrates, who leave the government entire, and have the 
effect only of balancing the two powers and maintaining their respective 
rights. Government is then not mixed, but moderated. 
</p><p> 
The opposite disadvantages may be similarly cured, and, when the 
government is too lax, tribunals may be set up to concentrate it. This 
is done in all democracies. In the first case, the government is divided 
to make it weak; in the second, to make it strong: for the maxima of 
both strength and weakness are found in simple governments, while the 
mixed forms result in a mean strength.

THAT ALL FORMS OF GOVERNMENT DO NOT SUIT ALL COUNTRIES 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d68"> 
 
 
<p> 
LIBERTY, not being a fruit of all climates, is not within the reach of 
all peoples. The more this principle, laid down by Montesquieu,[E2] is 
considered, the more its truth is felt; the more it is combated, the 
more chance is given to confirm it by new proofs. 
</p><p> 
In all the governments that there are, the public person consumes 
without producing. Whence then does it get what it consumes? From the 
labour of its members. The necessities of the public are supplied out of 
the superfluities of individuals. It follows that the civil State can 
subsist only so long as men's labour brings them a return greater than 
their needs. 
</p><p> 
The amount of this excess is not the same in all countries. In some it 
is considerable, in others middling, in yet others nil, in some even 
negative. The relation of product to subsistence depends on the 
fertility of the climate, on the sort of labour the land demands, on the 
nature of its products, on the strength of its inhabitants, on the 
greater or less consumption they find necessary, and on several further 
considerations of which the whole relation is made up. 
</p><p> 
On the other side, all governments are not of the same nature: some are 
less voracious than others, and the differences between them are based 
on this second principle, that the further from their source the public 
contributions are removed, the more burdensome they become. The charge 
should be measured not by the amount of the impositions, but by the path 
they have to travel in order to get back to those from whom they came. 
When the circulation is prompt and well-established, it does not matter 
whether much or little is paid; the people is always rich and, 
financially speaking, all is well. On the contrary, however little the 
people gives, if that little does not return to it, it is soon exhausted 
by giving continually: the State is then never rich, and the people is 
always a people of beggars. 
</p><p> 
It follows that, the more the distance between people and government 
increases, the more burdensome tribute becomes: thus, in a democracy, 
the people bears the least charge; in an aristocracy, a greater charge; 
and, in monarchy, the weight becomes heaviest. Monarchy therefore suits 
only wealthy nations; aristocracy, States of middling size and wealth; 
and democracy, States that are small and poor. 
</p><p> 
In fact, the more we reflect, the more we find the difference between 
free and monarchical States to be this: in the former, everything is 
used for the public advantage; in the latter, the public forces and 
those of individuals are affected by each other, and either increases as 
the other grows weak; finally, instead of governing subjects to make 
them happy, despotism makes them wretched in order to govern them. 
</p><p> 
We find then, in every climate, natural causes according to which the 
form of government which it requires can be assigned, and we can even 
say what sort of inhabitants it should have. 
</p><p> 
Unfriendly and barren lands, where the product does not repay the 
labour, should remain desert and uncultivated, or peopled only by 
savages; lands where men's labour brings in no more than the exact 
minimum necessary to subsistence should be inhabited by barbarous 
peoples: in such places all polity is impossible. Lands where the 
surplus of product over labour is only middling are suitable for free 
peoples; those in which the soil is abundant and fertile and gives a 
great product for a little labour call for monarchical government, in 
order that the surplus of superfluities among the subjects may be 
consumed by the luxury of the prince: for it is better for this excess 
to be absorbed by the government than dissipated among the individuals. 
I am aware that there are exceptions; but these exceptions themselves 
confirm the rule, in that sooner or later they produce revolutions which 
restore things to the natural order. 
</p><p> 
General laws should always be distinguished from individual causes that 
may modify their effects. If all the South were covered with Republics 
and all the North with despotic States, it would be none the less true 
that, in point of climate, despotism is suitable to hot countries, 
barbarism to cold countries, and good polity to temperate regions. I see 
also that, the principle being granted, there may be disputes on its 
application; it may be said that there are cold countries that are very 
fertile, and tropical countries that are very unproductive. But this 
difficulty exists only for those who do not consider the question in all 
its aspects. We must, as I have already said, take labour, strength, 
consumption, etc., into account. 
</p><p> 
Take two tracts of equal extent, one of which brings in five and the 
other ten. If the inhabitants of the first consume four and those of the 
second nine, the surplus of the first product will be a fifth and that 
of the second a tenth. The ratio of these two surpluses will then be 
inverse to that of the products, and the tract which produces only five 
will give a surplus double that of the tract which produces ten. 
</p><p> 
But there is no question of a double product, and I think no one would 
put the fertility of cold countries, as a general rule, on an equality 
with that of hot ones. Let us, however, suppose this equality to exist: 
let us, if you will, regard England as on the same level as Sicily, and 
Poland as Egypt -- further south, we shall have Africa and the Indies; 
further north, nothing at all. To get this equality of product, what a 
difference there must be in tillage: in Sicily, there is only need to 
scratch the ground; in England, how men must toil! But, where more hands 
are needed to get the same product, the superfluity must necessarily be 
less. 
</p><p> 
Consider, besides, that the same number of men consume much less in hot 
countries. The climate requires sobriety for the sake of health; and 
Europeans who try to live there as they would at home all perish of 
dysentery and indigestion. "We are," says Chardin, "carnivorous animals, 
wolves, in comparison with the Asiatics. Some attribute the sobriety of 
the Persians to the fact that their country is less cultivated; but it 
is my belief that their country abounds less in commodities because the 
inhabitants need less. If their frugality," he goes on, "were the effect 
of the nakedness of the land, only the poor would eat little; but 
everybody does so. Again, less or more would be eaten in various 
provinces, according to the land's fertility; but the same sobriety is 
found throughout the kingdom. They are very proud of their manner of 
life, saying that you have only to look at their hue to recognise how 
far it excels that of the Christians. In fact, the Persians are of an 
even hue; their skins are fair, fine and smooth; while the hue of their 
subjects, the Armenians, who live after the European fashion, is rough 
and blotchy, and their bodies are gross and unwieldy." 
</p><p> 
The nearer you get to the equator, the less people live on. Meat they 
hardly touch; rice, maize, curcur, millet and cassava are their ordinary 
food. There are in the Indies millions of men whose subsistence does not 
cost a halfpenny a day. Even in Europe we find considerable differences 
of appetite between Northern and Southern peoples. A Spaniard will live 
for a week on a German's dinner. In the countries in which men are more 
voracious, luxury therefore turns in the direction of consumption. In 
England, luxury appears in a well-filled table; in Italy, you feast on 
sugar and flowers. 
</p><p> 
Luxury in clothes shows similar differences. In climates in which the 
changes of season are prompt and violent, men have better and simpler 
clothes; where they clothe themselves only for adornment, what is 
striking is more thought of than what is useful; clothes themselves are 
then a luxury. At Naples, you may see daily walking in the Pausilippeum 
men in gold-embroidered upper garments and nothing else. It is the same 
with buildings; magnificence is the sole consideration where there is 
nothing to fear from the air. In Paris and London, you desire to be 
lodged warmly and comfortably; in Madrid, you have superb salons, but 
not a window that closes, and you go to bed in a mere hole. 
</p><p> 
In hot countries foods are much more substantial and succulent; and the 
third difference cannot but have an influence on the second. Why are so 
many vegetables eaten in Italy? Because there they are good, nutritious 
and excellent in taste. In France, where they are nourished only on 
water, they are far from nutritious and are thought nothing of at table. 
They take up all the same no less ground, and cost at least as much 
pains to cultivate. It is a proved fact that the wheat of Barbary, in 
other respects inferior to that of France, yields much more flour, and 
that the wheat of France in turn yields more than that of northern 
countries; from which it may be inferred that a like gradation in the 
same direction, from equator to pole, is found generally. But is it not 
an obvious disadvantage for an equal product to contain less 
nourishment? 
</p><p> 
To all these points may be added another, which at once depends on and 
strengthens them. Hot countries need inhabitants less than cold 
countries, and can support more of them. There is thus a double surplus, 
which is all to the advantage of despotism. The greater the territory 
occupied by a fixed number of inhabitants, the more difficult revolt 
becomes, because rapid or secret concerted action is impossible, and the 
government can easily unmask projects and cut communications; but the 
more a numerous people is gathered together, the less can the government 
usurp the Sovereign's place: the people's leaders can deliberate as 
safely in their houses as the prince in council, and the crowd gathers 
as rapidly in the squares as the prince's troops in their quarters. The 
advantage of tyrannical government therefore lies in acting at great 
distances. With the help of the rallying-points it establishes, its 
strength, like that of the lever, 
<ref target="n25">[25]</ref> 
grows with distance. The strength of the people, on the other hand, acts 
only when concentrated: when spread abroad, it evaporates and is lost, 
like powder scattered on the ground, which catches fire only grain by 
grain. The least populous countries are thus the fittest for tyranny: 
fierce animals reign only in deserts.

 This does not contradict what I said before (Book II, ch. 9) about 
the disadvantages of great States; for we were then dealing with the 
authority of the government over the members, while here we are dealing 
with its force against the subjects. Its scattered members serve it as 
rallying-points for action against the people at a distance, but it has 
no rallying-point for direct action on its members themselves. Thus the 
length of the lever is its weakness in the one case, and its strength in 
the other.

THE MARKS OF A GOOD GOVERNMENT 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d71"> 
 
 
<p> 
THE question "What absolutely is the best government?" is unanswerable 
as well as indeterminate; or rather, there are as many good answers as 
there are possible combinations in the absolute and relative situations 
of all nations. 
</p><p> 
But if it is asked by what sign we may know that a given people is well 
or ill governed, that is another matter, and the question, being one of 
fact, admits of an answer. 
</p><p> 
It is not, however, answered, because everyone wants to answer it in his 
own way. Subjects extol public tranquillity, citizens individual 
liberty; the one class prefers security of possessions, the other that 
of person; the one regards as the best government that which is most 
severe, the other maintains that the mildest is the best; the one wants 
crimes punished, the other wants them prevented; the one wants the State 
to be feared by its neighbours, the other prefers that it should be 
ignored; the one is content if money circulates, the other demands that 
the people shall have bread. Even if an agreement were come to on these 
and similar points, should we have got any further? As moral qualities 
do not admit of exact measurement, agreement about the mark does not 
mean agreement about the valuation. 
</p><p> 
For my part, I am continually astonished that a mark so simple is not 
recognised, or that men are of so bad faith as not to admit it. What is 
the end of political association? The preservation and prosperity of its 
members. And what is the surest mark of their preservation and 
prosperity? Their numbers and population. Seek then nowhere else this 
mark that is in dispute. The rest being equal, the government under 
which, without external aids, without naturalisation or colonies, the 
citizens increase and multiply most, is beyond question the best. The 
government under which a people wanes and diminishes is the worst. 
Calculators, it is left for you to count, to measure, to compare.

 On the same principle it should be judged what centuries deserve 
the preference for human prosperity. Those in which letters and arts 
have flourished have been too much admired, because the hidden object of 
their culture has not been fathomed, and their fatal effects not taken 
into account. <foreign lang="lat">"ldque apud imperitos humanitas 
vocabatur, cum pars servitutis esset."</foreign> [Fools called 
"humanity" what was a part of slavery, Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Agricola,</hi> 31.] Shall we 
never see in the maxims books lay down the vulgar interest that makes 
their writers speak? No, whatever they may say, when, despite its 
renown, a country is depopulated, it is not true that all is well, and 
it is not enough that a poet should have an income of 100,000 francs to 
make his age the best of all. Less attention should be paid to the 
apparent repose and tranquillity of the rulers than to the well-being of 
their nations as wholes, and above all of the most numerous States. A 
hail-storm lays several cantons waste, but it rarely makes a famine. 
Outbreaks and civil wars give rulers rude shocks, but they are not the 
real ills of peoples, who may even get a respite, while there is a 
dispute as to who shall tyrannise over them. Their true prosperity and 
calamities come from their permanent condition: it is when the whole 
remains crushed beneath the yoke, that decay sets in, and that the 
rulers destroy them at will, and<foreign lang="lat"> "ubi solitudinem 
faciunt, pacem appellant."</foreign> (Where they create solitude, they 
call it peace, Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Agricola,</hi> 31.] When the bickerings of the great 
disturbed the kingdom of France, and the Coadjutor of Paris took a 
dagger in his pocket to the Parliament, these things did not prevent the 
people of France from prospering and multiplying in dignity, ease and 
freedom.  Long ago Greece flourished in the midst of the most savage 
wars; blood ran in torrents, and yet the whole country was covered with 
inhabitants.  It appeared, says Machiavelli, that in the midst of 
murder, proscription and civil war, our republic only throve: the 
virtue, morality and independence of the citizens did more to strengthen 
it than all their dissensions had done to enfeeble it. A little 
disturbance gives the soul elasticity; what makes the race truly 
prosperous is not so much peace as liberty.

<lb/> 
THE ABUSE OF GOVERNMENT AND ITS TENDENCY TO DEGENERATE 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d74"> 
 
 
<p> 
AS the particular will acts constantly in opposition to the general 
will, the government continually exerts itself against the Sovereignty. 
The greater this exertion becomes, the more the constitution changes; 
and, as there is in this case no other corporate will to create an 
equilibrium by resisting the will of the prince, sooner or later the 
prince must inevitably suppress the Sovereign and break the social 
treaty. This is the unavoidable and inherent defect which, from the very 
birth of the body politic, tends ceaselessly to destroy it, as age and 
death end by destroying the human body. 
</p><p> 
There are two general courses by which government degenerates: i.e., 
when it undergoes contraction, or when the State is dissolved. 
</p><p> 
Government undergoes contraction when it passes from the many to the 
few, that is, from democracy to aristocracy, and from aristocracy to 
royalty. To do so is its natural propensity. 
<ref target="n27">[27]</ref> 
If it took the backward course from the few to the many, it could be 
said that it was relaxed; but this inverse sequence is impossible. 
</p><p> 
Indeed, governments never change their form except when their energy is 
exhausted and leaves them too weak to keep what they have. If a 
government at once extended its sphere and relaxed its stringency, its 
force would become absolutely nil, and it would persist still less. It 
is therefore necessary to wind up the spring and tighten the hold as it 
gives way: or else the State it sustains will come to grief. 
</p><p> 
The dissolution of the State may come about in either of two ways. 
</p><p> 
First, when the prince ceases to administer the State in accordance with 
the laws, and usurps the Sovereign power. A remarkable change then 
occurs: not the government, but the State, undergoes contraction; I mean 
that the great State is dissolved, and another is formed within it, 
composed solely of the members of the government, which becomes for the 
rest of the people merely master and tyrant. So that the moment the 
government usurps the Sovereignty, the social compact is broken, and all 
private citizens recover by right their natural liberty, and are forced, 
but not bound, to obey. 
</p><p> 
The same thing happens when the members of the government severally 
usurp the power they should exercise only as a body; this is as great an 
infraction of the laws, and results in even greater disorders. There are 
then, so to speak, as many princes as there are magistrates, and the 
State, no less divided than the government, either perishes or changes 
its form. 
</p><p> 
When the State is dissolved, the abuse of government, whatever it is, 
bears the common name of <hi rend="italic">anarchy.</hi> To distinguish, democracy degenerates 
into <hi rend="italic">ochlocracy,</hi> and aristocracy into <hi rend="italic">oligarchy;</hi> and I would add that 
royalty degenerates into <hi rend="italic">tyranny;</hi> but this last word is ambiguous and 
needs explanation. 
</p><p> 
In vulgar usage, a tyrant is a king who governs violently and without 
regard for justice and law. In the exact sense, a tyrant is an 
individual who arrogates to himself the royal authority without having a 
right to it. This is how the Greeks understood the word "tyrant": they 
applied it indifferently to good and bad princes whose authority was not 
legitimate. 
<ref target="n28">[28]</ref> 
<hi rend="italic">Tyrant</hi> and <hi rend="italic">usurper</hi> are thus perfectly synonymous terms. </p><p> 
In order that I may give different things different names, I call him 
who usurps the royal authority a tyrant, and him who usurps the 
sovereign power a despot. The tyrant is he who thrusts himself in 
contrary to the laws to govern in accordance with the laws; the despot 
is he who sets himself above the laws themselves. Thus the tyrant cannot 
be a despot, but the despot is always a tyrant.

 The slow formation and the progress of the Republic of Venice in its 
lagoons are a notable instance of this sequence; and it is most 
astonishing that, after more than twelve hundred years' existence, the 
Venetians seem to be still at the second stage, which they reached with 
the <foreign lang="ita"><hi rend="italic">Serrar di Consiglio</hi></foreign> in 1198. As for the ancient Dukes who are 
brought up against them, it is proved, whatever the <foreign 
lang="ita"><hi rend="italic">Squittinio della libert&agrave; veneta</hi></foreign> may say of them, that they were in no sense sovereigns. 
<lb/> 
A case certain to be cited against my view is that of the Roman 
Republic, which, it will be said, followed exactly the opposite course, 
and passed from monarchy to aristocracy and from aristocracy to 
democracy. I by no means take this view of it. 
<lb/> 
What Romulus first set up was a mixed government, which soon 
deteriorated into despotism. From special causes, the State died an 
untimely death, as new-born children sometimes perish without reaching 
manhood. The expulsion of the Tarquins was the real period of the birth 
of the Republic. But at first it took on no constant form, because, by 
not abolishing the patriciate, it left half its work undone. For, by 
this means, hereditary aristocracy, the worst of all legitimate forms of 
administration, remained in conflict with democracy, and the form of the 
government, as Machiavelli has proved, was only fixed on the 
establishment of the tribunate: only then was there a true government 
and a veritable democracy. In fact, the people was then not only 
Sovereign, but also magistrate and judge; the senate was only a 
subordinate tribunal, to temper and concentrate the government, and the 
consuls themselves, though they were patricians, first magistrates, and 
absolute generals in war, were in Rome itself no more than presidents of 
the people. 
<lb/> 
From that point, the government followed its natural tendency, and 
inclined strongly to aristocracy. The patriciate, we may say, abolished 
itself, and the aristocracy was found no longer in the body of 
patricians as at Venice and Genoa, but in the body of the senate, which 
was composed of patricians and plebeians, and even in the body of 
tribunes when they began to usurp an active function: for names do not 
affect facts, and, when the people has rulers who govern for it, 
whatever name they bear, the government is an aristocracy. 
<lb/> 
The abuse of aristocracy led to the civil wars and the triumvirate. 
Sulla, Julius Caesar and Augustus became in fact real monarchs; and 
finally, under the despotism of Tiberius, the State was dissolved. Roman 
history then confirms, instead of invalidating, the principle I have 
laid down.

former governs in his own interest, and the latter only for the good of 
his subjects; but not only did all Greek authors in general use the word 
tyrant in a different sense, as appears most clearly in Xenophon's

THE DEATH OF THE BODY POLITIC 
</head> 
 
<p> 
SUCH is the natural and inevitable tendency of the best constituted 
governments. If Sparta and Rome perished, what State can hope to endure 
for ever? If we would set up a long-lived form of government, let us not 
even dream of making it eternal. If we are to succeed, we must not 
attempt the impossible, or flatter ourselves that we are endowing the 
work of man with a stability of which human conditions do not permit. 
</p><p> 
The body politic, as well as the human body, begins to die as soon as it 
is born, and carries in itself the causes of its destruction. But both 
may have a constitution that is more or less robust and suited to 
preserve them a longer or a shorter time. The constitution of man is the 
work of nature; that of the State the work of art. It is not in men's 
power to prolong their own lives; but it is for them to prolong as much 
as possible the life of the State, by giving it the best possible 
constitution. The best constituted State will have an end; but it will 
end later than any other, unless some unforeseen accident brings about 
its untimely destruction. 
</p><p> 
The life-principle of the body politic lies in the sovereign authority. 
The legislative power is the heart of the State; the executive power is 
its brain, which causes the movement of all the parts. The brain may 
become paralysed and the individual still live. A man may remain an 
imbecile and live; but as soon as the heart ceases to perform its 
functions, the animal is dead. 
</p><p> 
The State subsists by means not of the laws, but of the legislative 
power. Yesterday's law is not binding to-day; but silence is taken for 
tacit consent, and the Sovereign is held to confirm incessantly the laws 
it does not abrogate as it might. All that it has once declared itself 
to will it wills always, unless it revokes its declaration. 
</p><p> 
Why then is so much respect paid to old laws? For this very reason. We 
must believe that nothing but the excellence of old acts of will can 
have preserved them so long: if the Sovereign had not recognised them as 
throughout salutary, it would have revoked them a thousand times. This 
is why, so far from growing weak, the laws continually gain new strength 
in any well constituted State; the precedent of antiquity makes them 
daily more venerable: while wherever the laws grow weak as they become 
old, this proves that there is no longer a legislative power, and that 
the State is dead.

HOW THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY MAINTAINS ITSELF 
</head> 
 
<p> 
THE Sovereign, having no force other than the legislative power, acts 
only by means of the laws; and the laws being solely the authentic acts 
of the general will, the Sovereign cannot act save when the people is 
assembled. The people in assembly, I shall be told, is a mere chimera. 
It is so to-day, but two thousand years ago it was not so. Has man's 
nature changed? 
</p><p> 
The bounds of possibility, in moral matters, are less narrow than we 
imagine: it is our weaknesses, our vices and our prejudices that confine 
them. Base souls have no belief in great men; vile slaves smile in 
mockery at the name of liberty. 
</p><p> 
Let us judge of what can be done by what has been done. I shall say 
nothing of the Republics of ancient Greece; but the Roman Republic was, 
to my mind, a great State, and the town of Rome a great town. The last 
census showed that there were in Rome four hundred thousand citizens 
capable of bearing arms, and the last computation of the population of 
the Empire showed over four million citizens, excluding subjects, 
foreigners, women, children and slaves. 
</p><p> 
What difficulties might not be supposed to stand in the way of the 
frequent assemblage of the vast population of this capital and its 
neighbourhood. Yet few weeks passed without the Roman people being in 
assembly, and even being so several times. It exercised not only the 
rights of Sovereignty, but also a part of those of government. It dealt 
with certain matters, and judged certain cases, and this whole people 
was found in the public meeting-place hardly less often as magistrates 
than as citizens. 
</p><p> 
If we went back to the earliest history of nations, we should find that 
most ancient governments, even those of monarchical form, such as the 
Macedonian and the Frankish, had similar councils. In any case, the one 
incontestable fact I have given is an answer to all difficulties; it is 
good logic to reason from the actual to the possible.

THE SAME (<hi rend="italic">continued</hi>) 
</head> 
 
<p> 
IT is not enough for the assembled people to have once fixed the 
constitution of the State by giving its sanction to a body of law; it is 
not enough for it to have set up a perpetual government, or provided 
once for all for the election of magistrates. Besides the extraordinary 
assemblies unforeseen circumstances may demand, there must be fixed 
periodical assemblies which cannot be abrogated or prorogued, so that on 
the proper day the people is legitimately called together by law, 
without need of any formal summoning. 
</p><p> 
But, apart from these assemblies authorised by their date alone, every 
assembly of the people not summoned by the magistrates appointed for 
that purpose, and in accordance with the prescribed forms, should be 
regarded as unlawful, and all its acts as null and void, because the 
command to assemble should itself proceed from the law. 
</p><p> 
The greater or less frequency with which lawful assemblies should occur 
depends on so many considerations that no exact rules about them can be 
given. It can only be said generally that the stronger the government 
the more often should the Sovereign show itself. 
</p><p> 
This, I shall be told, may do for a single town; but what is to be done 
when the State includes several? Is the sovereign authority to be 
divided? Or is it to be concentrated in a single town to which all the 
rest are made subject? 
</p><p> 
Neither the one nor the other, I reply. First, the sovereign authority 
is one and simple, and cannot be divided without being destroyed. In the 
second place, one town cannot, any more than one nation, legitimately be 
made subject to another, because the essence of the body politic lies in 
the reconciliation of obedience and liberty, and the words subject and 
Sovereign are identical correlatives the idea of which meets in the 
single word "citizen." 
</p><p> 
I answer further that the union of several towns in a single city is 
always bad, and that, if we wish to make such a union, we should not 
expect to avoid its natural disadvantages. It is useless to bring up 
abuses that belong to great States against one who desires to see only 
small ones; but how can small States be given the strength to resist 
great ones, as formerly the Greek towns resisted the Great King, and 
more recently Holland and Switzerland have resisted the House of 
Austria? 
</p><p> 
Nevertheless, if the State cannot be reduced to the right limits, there 
remains still one resource; this is, to allow no capital, to make the 
seat of government move from town to town, and to assemble by turn in 
each the Provincial Estates of the country. 
</p><p> 
People the territory evenly, extend everywhere the same rights, bear to 
every place in it abundance and life: by these means will the State 
become at once as strong and as well governed as possible. Remember that 
the walls of towns are built of the ruins of the houses of the 
countryside. For every palace I see raised in the capital, my mind's eye 
sees a whole country made desolate.

<p> 
THE moment the people is legitimately assembled as a sovereign body, the 
jurisdiction of the government wholly lapses, the executive power is 
suspended, and the person of the meanest citizen is as sacred and 
inviolable as that of the first magistrate; for in the presence of the 
person represented, representatives no longer exist. Most of the tumults 
that arose in the comitia at Rome were due to ignorance or neglect of 
this rule. The consuls were in them merely the presidents of the people; 
the tribunes were mere speakers; 
<ref target="n29">[29]</ref> 
the senate was nothing at all. </p><p> 
These intervals of suspension, during which the prince recognises or 
ought to recognise an actual superior, have always been viewed by him 
with alarm; and these assemblies of the people, which are the aegis of 
the body politic and the curb on the government, have at all times been 
the horror of rulers: who therefore never spare pains, objections, 
difficulties, and promises, to stop the citizens from having them. When 
the citizens are greedy, cowardly, and pusillanimous, and love ease more 
than liberty, they do not long hold out against the redoubled efforts of 
the government; and thus, as the resisting force incessantly grows, the 
sovereign authority ends by disappearing, and most cities fall and 
perish before their time. 
</p><p> 
But between the sovereign authority and arbitrary government there 
sometimes intervenes a mean power of which something must be said.

DEPUTIES OR REPRESENTATIVES 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d83"> 
 
 
<p> 
AS soon as public service ceases to be the chief business of the 
citizens, and they would rather serve with their money than with their 
persons, the State is not far from its fall. When it is necessary to 
march out to war, they pay troops and stay at home: when it is necessary 
to meet in council, they name deputies and stay at home. By reason of 
idleness and money, they end by having soldiers to enslave their country 
and representatives to sell it. 
</p><p> 
It is through the hustle of commerce and the arts, through the greedy 
self-interest of profit, and through softness and love of amenities that 
personal services are replaced by money payments. Men surrender a part 
of their profits in order to have time to increase them at leisure. Make 
gifts of money, and you will not be long without chains. The word 
finance is a slavish word, unknown in the city-state. In a country that 
is truly free, the citizens do everything with their own arms and 
nothing by means of money; so far from paying to be exempted from their 
duties, they would even pay for the privilege of fulfilling them 
themselves. I am far from taking the common view: I hold enforced labour 
to be less opposed to liberty than taxes. 
</p><p> 
The better the constitution of a State is, the more do public affairs 
encroach on private in the minds of the citizens. Private affairs are 
even of much less importance, because the aggregate of the common 
happiness furnishes a greater proportion of that of each individual, so 
that there is less for him to seek in particular cares. In a 
well-ordered city every man flies to the assemblies: under a bad 
government no one cares to stir a step to get to them, because no one is 
interested in what happens there, because it is foreseen that the 
general will will not prevail, and lastly because domestic cares are 
all-absorbing. Good laws lead to the making of better ones; bad ones 
bring about worse. As soon as any man says of the affairs of the State 
<hi rend="italic">What does it matter to me?</hi> the State may be given up for lost. 
</p><p> 
The lukewarmness of patriotism, the activity of private interest, the 
vastness of States, conquest and the abuse of government suggested the 
method of having deputies or representatives of the people in the 
national assemblies. These are what, in some countries, men have 
presumed to call the Third Estate. Thus the individual interest of two 
orders is put first and second; the public interest occupies only the 
third place. 
</p><p> 
Sovereignty, for the same reason as makes it inalienable, cannot be 
represented; it lies essentially in the general will, and will does not 
admit of representation: it is either the same, or other; there is no 
intermediate possibility. The deputies of the people, therefore, are not 
and cannot be its representatives: they are merely its stewards, and can 
carry through no definitive acts. Every law the people has not ratified 
in person is null and void -- is, in fact, not a law. The people of 
England regards itself as free; but it is grossly mistaken; it is free 
only during the election of members of parliament. As soon as they are 
elected, slavery overtakes it, and it is nothing. The use it makes of 
the short moments of liberty it enjoys shows indeed that it deserves to 
lose them. 
</p><p> 
The idea of representation is modern; it comes to us from feudal 
government, from that iniquitous and absurd system which degrades 
humanity and dishonours the name of man. In ancient republics and even 
in monarchies, the people never had representatives; the word itself was 
unknown. It is very singular that in Rome, where the tribunes were so 
sacrosanct, it was never even imagined that they could usurp the 
functions of the people, and that in the midst of so great a multitude 
they never attempted to pass on their own authority a single 
<hi rend="italic">plebiscitum.</hi> We can, however, form an idea of the difficulties caused 
sometimes by the people being so numerous, from what happened in the 
time of the Gracchi, when some of the citizens had to cast their votes 
from the roofs of buildings. 
</p><p> 
Where right and liberty are everything, disadvantages count for nothing. 
Among this wise people everything was given its just value, its lictors 
were allowed to do what its tribunes would never have dared to attempt; 
for it had no fear that its lictors would try to represent it. 
</p><p> 
To explain, however, in what way the tribunes did sometimes represent 
it, it is enough to conceive how the government represents the 
Sovereign. Law being purely the declaration of the general will, it is 
clear that, in the exercise of the legislative power, the people cannot 
be represented; but in that of the executive power, which is only the 
force that is applied to give the law effect, it both can and should be 
represented. We thus see that if we looked closely into the matter we 
should find that very few nations have any laws. However that may be, it 
is certain that the tribunes, possessing no executive power, could never 
represent the Roman people by right of the powers entrusted to them, but 
only by usurping those of the senate. 
</p><p> 
In Greece, all that the people had to do, it did for itself; it was 
constantly assembled in the public square. The Greeks lived in a mild 
climate; they had no natural greed; slaves did their work for them; 
their great concern was with liberty. Lacking the same advantages, how 
can you preserve the same rights? Your severer climates add to your 
needs; 
<ref target="n30">[30]</ref> 
for half the year your public squares are uninhabitable; the flatness of 
your languages unfits them for being heard in the open air; you 
sacrifice more for profit than for liberty, and fear slavery less than 
poverty. 
</p><p> 
What then? Is liberty maintained only by the help of slavery? It may be 
so. Extremes meet. Everything that is not in the course of nature has 
its disadvantages, civil society most of all. There are some unhappy 
circumstances in which we can only keep our liberty at others' expense, 
and where the citizen can be perfectly free only when the slave is most 
a slave. Such was the case with Sparta. As for you, modern peoples, you 
have no slaves, but you are slaves yourselves; you pay for their liberty 
with your own. It is in vain that you boast of this preference; I find 
in it more cowardice than humanity. 
</p><p> 
I do not mean by all this that it is necessary to have slaves, or that 
the right of slavery is legitimate: I am merely giving the reasons why 
modern peoples, believing themselves to be free, have representatives, 
while ancient peoples had none. In any case, the moment a people allows 
itself to be represented, it is no long free: it no longer exists. 
</p><p> 
All things considered, I do not see that it is possible henceforth for 
the Sovereign to preserve among us the exercise of its rights, unless 
the city is very small. But if it is very small, it will be conquered? 
No. I will show later on how the external strength of a great people 
<ref target="n31">[31]</ref> 
may be combined with the convenient polity and good order of a small 
State.

CHAPTER 16.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
THAT THE INSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT A CONTRACT 
</head> 
 
<p> 
THE legislative power once well established, the next thing is to 
establish similarly the executive power; for this latter, which operates 
only by particular acts, not being of the essence of the former, is 
naturally separate from it. Were it possible for the Sovereign, as such, 
to possess the executive power, right and fact would be so confounded 
that no one could tell what was law and what was not; and the body 
politic, thus disfigured, would soon fall a prey to the violence it was 
instituted to prevent. 
</p><p> 
As the citizens, by the social contract, are all equal, all can 
prescribe what all should do, but no one has a right to demand that 
another shall do what he does not do himself. It is strictly this right, 
which is indispensable for giving the body politic life and movement, 
that the Sovereign, in instituting the government, confers upon the 
prince. 
</p><p> 
It has been held that this act of establishment was a contract between 
the people and the rulers it sets over itself, -- a contract in which 
conditions were laid down between the two parties binding the one to 
command and the other to obey. It will be admitted, I am sure, that this 
is an odd kind of contract to enter into. But let us see if this view 
can be upheld. 
</p><p> 
First, the supreme authority can no more be modified than it can be 
alienated; to limit it is to destroy it. It is absurd and contradictory 
for the Sovereign to set a superior over itself; to bind itself to obey 
a master would be to return to absolute liberty. 
</p><p> 
Moreover, it is clear that this contract between the people and such and 
such persons would be a particular act; and from this is follows that it 
can be neither a law nor an act of Sovereignty, and that consequently it 
would be illegitimate. 
</p><p> 
It is plain too that the contracting parties in relation to each other 
would be under the law of nature alone and wholly without guarantees of 
their mutual undertakings, a position wholly at variance with the civil 
state. He who has force at his command being always in a position to 
control execution, it would come to the same thing if the name 
"contract" were given to the act of one man who said to another: "I give 
you all my goods, on condition that you give me back as much of them as 
you please." 
</p><p> 
There is only one contract in the State, and that is the act of 
association, which in itself excludes the existence of a second. It is 
impossible to conceive of any public contract that would not be a 
violation of the first. 
</p> 
</div2> 
 
<div2 type="chapter" n="17" id="d86">

CHAPTER 17.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
THE INSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT 
</head> 
 
<p> 
UNDER what general idea then should the act by which government is 
instituted be conceived as falling? I will begin by stating that the act 
is complex, as being composed of two others -- the establishment of the 
law and its execution. 
</p><p> 
By the former, the Sovereign decrees that there shall be a governing 
body established in this or that form; this act is clearly a law. 
</p><p> 
By the latter, the people nominates the rulers who are to be entrusted 
with the government that has been established. This nomination, being a 
particular act, is clearly not a second law, but merely a consequence of 
the first and a function of government. 
</p><p> 
The difficulty is to understand how there can be a governmental act 
before government exists, and how the people, which is only Sovereign or 
subject, can, under certain circumstances, become a prince or 
magistrate. 
</p><p> 
It is at this point that there is revealed one of the astonishing 
properties of the body politic, by means of which it reconciles 
apparently contradictory operations; for this is accomplished by a 
sudden conversion of Sovereignty into democracy, so that, without 
sensible change, and merely by virtue of a new relation of all to all, 
the citizens become magistrates and pass from general to particular 
acts, from legislation to the execution of the law. 
</p><p> 
This changed relation is no speculative subtlety without instances in 
practice: it happens every day in the English Parliament, where, on 
certain occasions, the Lower House resolves itself into Grand Committee, 
for the better discussion of affairs, and thus, from being at one moment 
a sovereign court, becomes at the next a mere commission; so that 
subsequently it reports to itself, as House of Commons, the result of 
its proceedings in Grand Committee, and debates over again under one 
name what it has already settled under another. 
</p><p> 
It is, indeed, the peculiar advantage of democratic government that it 
can be established in actuality by a simple act of the general will. 
Subsequently, this provisional government remains in power, if this form 
is adopted, or else establishes in the name of the Sovereign the 
government that is prescribed by law; and thus the whole proceeding is 
regular. It is impossible to set up government in any other manner 
legitimately and in accordance with the principles so far laid down.

CHAPER 18.<lb/> 
<lb/> 
HOW TO CHECK THE USURPATIONS OF GOVERNMENT 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d88"> 
 
 
<p> 
WHAT we have just said confirms Chapter 16, and makes it clear that the 
institution of government is not a contract, but a law; that the 
depositaries of the executive power are not the people's masters, but 
its officers; that it can set them up and pull them down when it likes; 
that for them there is no question of contract, but of obedience and 
that in taking charge of the functions the State imposes on them they 
are doing no more than fulfilling their duty as citizens, without having 
the remotest right to argue about the conditions. 
</p><p> 
When therefore the people sets up an hereditary government, whether it 
be monarchical and confined to one family, or aristocratic and confined 
to a class, what it enters into is not an undertaking; the 
administration is given a provisional form, until the people chooses to 
order it otherwise. 
</p><p> 
It is true that such changes are always dangerous, and that the 
established government should never be touched except when it comes to 
be incompatible with the public good; but the circumspection this 
involves is a maxim of policy and not a rule of right, and the State is 
no more bound to leave civil authority in the hands of its rulers than 
military authority in the hands of its generals. 
</p><p> 
It is also true that it is impossible to be too careful to observe, in 
such cases, all the formalities necessary to distinguish a regular and 
legitimate act from a seditious tumult, and the will of a whole people 
from the clamour of a faction. Here above all no further concession 
should be made to the untoward possibility than cannot, in the strictest 
logic, be refused it. From this obligation the prince derives a great 
advantage in preserving his power despite the people, without it being 
possible to say he has usurped it; for, seeming to avail himself only of 
his rights, he finds it very easy to extend them, and to prevent, under 
the pretext of keeping the peace, assemblies that are destined to the 
re-establishment of order; with the result that he takes advantage of a 
silence he does not allow to be broken, or of irregularities he causes 
to be committed, to assume that he has the support of those whom fear 
prevents from speaking, and to punish those who dare to speak. Thus it 
was that the decemvirs, first elected for one year and then kept on in 
office for a second, tried to perpetuate their power by forbidding the 
comitia to assemble; and by this easy method every government in the 
world, once clothed with the public power, sooner or later usurps the 
sovereign authority. 
</p><p> 
The periodical assemblies of which I have already spoken are designed to 
prevent or postpone this calamity, above all when they need no formal 
summoning; for in that case, the prince cannot stop them without openly 
declaring himself a law-breaker and an enemy of the State. 
</p><p> 
The opening of these assemblies, whose sole object is the maintenance of 
the social treaty, should always take the form of putting two 
propositions that may not be suppressed, which should be voted on 
separately. 
</p><p> 
The first is: "Does it please the Sovereign to preserve the present form 
of government?" 
</p><p> 
The second is: "Does it please the people to leave its administration in 
the hands of those who are actually in charge of it?" 
</p><p> 
I am here assuming what I think I have shown; that there is in the State 
no fundamental law that cannot be revoked, not excluding the social 
compact itself; for if all the citizens assembled of one accord to break 
the compact, it is impossible to doubt that it would be very 
legitimately broken. Grotius even thinks that each man can renounce his 
membership of his own State, and recover his natural liberty and his 
goods on leaving the country. 
<ref target="n32">[32]</ref> 
It would be indeed absurd if all the citizens in assembly could not do 
what each can do by himself.

 Provided, of course, he does not leave to escape his obligations and 
avoid having to serve his country in the hour of need. Flight in such a

desertion.

THAT THE GENERAL WILL IS INDESTRUCTIBLE 
</head> 
 
<p> 
AS long as several men in assembly regard themselves as a single body, 
they have only a single will which is concerned with their common 
preservation and general well-being. In this case, all the springs of 
the State are vigorous and simple and its rules clear and luminous; 
there are no embroilments or conflicts of interests; the common good is 
everywhere clearly apparent, and only good sense is needed to perceive 
it. Peace, unity and equality are the enemies of political subtleties. 
Men who are upright and simple are difficult to deceive because of their 
simplicity; lures and ingenious pretexts fail to impose upon them, and 
they <hi rend="italic">are not</hi> even subtle enough to be dupes. When, among the happiest 
people in the world, bands of peasants are seen regulating affairs of 
State under an oak, and always acting wisely, can we help scorning the 
ingenious methods of other nations, which make themselves illustrious 
and wretched with so much art and mystery? 
</p><p> 
A State so governed needs very few laws; and, as it becomes necessary to 
issue new ones, the necessity is universally seen. The first man to 
propose them merely says what all have already felt, and there is no 
question of factions or intrigues or eloquence in order to secure the 
passage into law of what every one has already decided to do, as soon as 
he is sure that the rest will act with him. 
</p><p> 
Theorists are led into error because, seeing only States that have been 
from the beginning wrongly constituted, they are struck by the 
impossibility of applying such a policy to them. They make great game of 
all the absurdities a clever rascal or an insinuating speaker might get 
the people of Paris or London to believe. They do not know that Cromwell 
would have been put to "the bells" by the people of Berne, and the Duc 
de Beaufort on the treadmill by the Genevese. 
</p><p> 
But when the social bond begins to be relaxed and the State to grow 
weak, when particular interests begin to make themselves felt and the 
smaller societies to exercise an influence over the larger, the common 
interest changes and finds opponents: opinion is no longer unanimous; 
the general will ceases to be the will of all; contradictory views and 
debates arise; and the best advice is not taken without question. 
</p><p> 
Finally, when the State, on the eve of ruin, maintains only a vain, 
illusory and formal existence, when in every heart the social bond is 
broken, and the meanest interest brazenly lays hold of the sacred name 
of "public good," the general will becomes mute: all men, guided by 
secret motives, no more give their views as citizens than if the State 
had never been; and iniquitous decrees directed solely to private 
interest get passed under the name of laws. 
</p><p> 
Does it follow from this that the general will is exterminated or 
corrupted? Not at all: it is always constant, unalterable and pure; but 
it is subordinated to other wills which encroach upon its sphere. Each 
man, in detaching his interest from the common interest, sees clearly 
that he cannot entirely separate them; but his share in the public 
mishaps seems to him negligible beside the exclusive good he aims at 
making his own. Apart from this particular good, he wills the general 
good in his own interest, as strongly as any one else. Even in selling 
his vote for money, he does not extinguish in himself the general will, 
but only eludes it. The fault he commits is that of changing the state 
of the question, and answering something different from what he is 
asked. Instead of saying, by his vote, "It is to the advantage of the 
State," he says, "It is of advantage to this or that man or party that 
this or that view should prevail." Thus the law of public order in 
assemblies is not so much to maintain in them the general will as to 
secure that the question be always put to it, and the answer always 
given by it. 
</p><p> 
I could here set down many reflections on the simple right of voting in 
every act of Sovereignty -- a right which no one can take from the 
citizens -- and also on the right of stating views, making proposals, 
dividing and discussing, which the government is always most careful to 
leave solely to its members, but this important subject would need a 
treatise to itself, and it is impossible to say everything in a single 
work.

VOTING 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d93"> 
 
 
<p> 
IT may be seen, from the last chapter, that the way in which general 
business is managed may give a clear enough indication of the actual 
state of morals and the health of the body politic. The more concert 
reigns in the assemblies, that is, the nearer opinion approaches 
unanimity, the greater is the dominance of the general will. On the 
other hand, long debates, dissensions and tumult proclaim the ascendancy 
of particular interests and the decline of the State. 
</p><p> 
This seems less clear when two or more orders enter into the 
constitution, as patricians and plebeians did at Rome; for quarrels 
between these two orders often disturbed the comitia, even in the best 
days of the Republic. But the exception is rather apparent than real; 
for then, through the defect that is inherent in the body politic, there 
were, so to speak, two States in one, and what is not true of the two 
together is true of either separately. Indeed, even in the most stormy 
times, the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">plebiscita</hi></foreign> of the people, when the Senate did not interfere 
with them, always went through quietly and by large majorities. The 
citizens having but one interest, the people had but a single will. 
</p><p> 
At the other extremity of the circle, unanimity recurs; this is the case 
when the citizens, having fallen into servitude, have lost both liberty 
and will. Fear and flattery then change votes into acclamation; 
deliberation ceases, and only worship or malediction is left. Such was 
the vile manner in which the senate expressed its views under the 
Emperors. It did so sometimes with absurd precautions. Tacitus observes 
that, under Otho, the senators, while they heaped curses on Vitellius, 
contrived at the same time to make a deafening noise, in order that, 
should he ever become their master, he might not know what each of them 
had said. 
</p><p> 
On these various considerations depend the rules by which the methods of 
counting votes and comparing opinions should be regulated, according as 
the general will is more or less easy to discover, and the State more or 
less in its decline. 
</p><p> 
There is but one law which, from its nature, needs unanimous consent. 
This is the social compact; for civil association is the most voluntary 
of all acts. Every man being born free and his own master, no one, under 
any pretext whatsoever, can make any man subject without his consent. To 
decide that the son of a slave is born a slave is to decide that he is 
not born a man. 
</p><p> 
If then there are opponents when the social compact is made, their 
opposition does not invalidate the contract, but merely prevents them 
from being included in it. They are foreigners among citizens. When the 
State is instituted, residence constitutes consent; to dwell within its 
territory is to submit to the Sovereign. 
<ref target="n33">[33]</ref> 
</p><p> 
Apart from this primitive contract, the vote of the majority always 
binds all the rest. This follows from the contract itself. But it is 
asked how a man can be both free and forced to conform to wills that are 
not his own. How are the opponents at once free and subject to laws they 
have not agreed to? 
</p><p> 
I retort that the question is wrongly put. The citizen gives his consent 
to all the laws, including those which are passed in spite of his 
opposition, and even those which punish him when he dares to break any 
of them. The constant will of all the members of the State is the 
general will; by virtue of it they are citizens and free. 
<ref target="n34">[34]</ref> 
When in the popular assembly a law is proposed, what the people is asked 
is not exactly whether it approves or rejects the proposal, but whether 
it is in conformity with the general will, which is their will. Each 
man, in giving his vote, states his opinion on that point; and the 
general will is found by counting votes. When therefore the opinion that 
is contrary to my own prevails, this proves neither more nor less than 
that I was mistaken, and that what I thought to be the general will was 
not so. If my particular opinion had carried the day I should have 
achieved the opposite of what was my will; and it is in that case that I 
should not have been free. 
</p><p> 
This presupposes, indeed, that all the qualities of the general will 
still reside in the majority: when they cease to do so, whatever side a 
man may take, liberty is no longer possible. 
</p><p> 
In my earlier demonstration of how particular wills are substituted for 
the general will in public deliberation, I have adequately pointed out 
the practicable methods of avoiding this abuse; and I shall have more to 
say of them later on. I have also given the principles for determining 
the proportional number of votes for declaring that will. A difference 
of one vote destroys equality; a single opponent destroys unanimity; but 
between equality and unanimity, there are several grades of unequal 
division, at each of which this proportion may be fixed in accordance 
with the condition and the needs of the body politic. 
</p><p> 
There are two general rules that may serve to regulate this relation. 
First, the more grave and important the questions discussed, the nearer 
should the opinion that is to prevail approach unanimity. Secondly, the 
more the matter in hand calls for speed, the smaller the prescribed 
difference in the numbers of votes may be allowed to become: where an 
instant decision has to be reached, a majority of one vote should be 
enough. The first of these two rules seems more in harmony with the 
laws, and the second with practical affairs. In any case, it is the 
combination of them that gives the best proportions for determining the 
majority necessary.</p> 
</div3>

<head>Footnotes</head> 
<note id="n33"><seg type="note-symbol">[33]</seg> <p>
 This should of course be understood as applying to a free State; for 
elsewhere family, goods, lack of a refuge, necessity, or violence may 
detain a man in a country against his will; and then his dwelling there 
no longer by itself implies his consent to the contract or to its 
violation.

 At Genoa, the word Liberty may be read over the front of the prisons 
and on the chains of the galley-slaves. This application of the device 
is good and just. It is indeed only malefactors of all estates who 
prevent the citizen from being free. In the country in which all such 
men were in the galleys, the most perfect liberty would be enjoyed.

CHAPTER 3.<lb/>

ELECTIONS 
</head> 
 
<p> 
IN the elections of the prince and the magistrates, which are, as I have 
said, complex acts, there are two possible methods of procedure, choice 
and lot. Both have been employed in various republics, and a highly 
complicated mixture of the two still survives in the election of the 
Doge at Venice. 
</p><p> 
"Election by lot," says Montesquieu, "is democratic in nature."[E3] I 
agree that it is so; but in what sense? "The lot," he goes on, "is a way 
of making choice that is unfair to nobody; it leaves each citizen a 
reasonable hope of serving his country." These are not reasons. 
</p><p> 
If we bear in mind that the election of rulers is a function of 
government, and not of Sovereignty, we shall see why the lot is the 
method more natural to democracy, in which the administration is better 
in proportion as the number of its acts is small. 
</p><p> 
In every real democracy, magistracy is not an advantage, but a 
burdensome charge which cannot justly be imposed on one individual 
rather than another. The law alone can lay the charge on him on whom the 
lot falls. For, the conditions being then the same for all, and the 
choice not depending on any human will, there is no particular 
application to alter the universality of the law. 
</p><p> 
In an aristocracy, the prince chooses the prince, the government is 
preserved by itself, and voting is rightly ordered. 
</p><p> 
The instance of the election of the Doge of Venice confirms, instead of 
destroying, this distinction; the mixed form suits a mixed government. 
For it is an error to take the government of Venice for a real 
aristocracy. If the people has no share in the government, the nobility 
is itself the people. A host of poor Barnabotes never gets near any 
magistracy, and its nobility consists merely in the empty title of 
Excellency, and in the right to sit in the Great Council. As this Great 
Council is as numerous as our General Council at Geneva, its illustrious 
members have no more privileges than our plain citizens. It is 
indisputable that, apart from the extreme disparity between the two 
republics, the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> of Geneva is exactly equivalent to the 
<hi rend="italic">patriciate</hi> of Venice; our <hi rend="italic">natives</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">inhabitants</hi> correspond to the <hi rend="italic">townsmen</hi> and the 
<hi rend="italic">people</hi> of Venice; our <hi rend="italic">peasants</hi> correspond to the 
<hi rend="italic">subjects</hi> on the mainland; and, however that republic be regarded, if its 
size be left out of account, its government is no more aristocratic than 
our own. The whole difference is that, having no life-ruler, we do not, 
like Venice, need to use the lot. 
</p><p> 
Election by lot would have few disadvantages in a real democracy, in 
which, as equality would everywhere exist in morals and talents as well 
as in principles and fortunes, it would become almost a matter of 
indifference who was chosen. But I have already said that a real 
democracy is only an ideal. 
</p><p> 
When choice and lot are combined, positions that require special 
talents, such as military posts, should be filled by the former. The 
latter does for cases, such as judicial offices, in which good sense, 
justice, and integrity are enough, because in a State that is well 
constituted, these qualities are common to all the citizens. 
</p><p> 
Neither lot nor vote has any place in monarchical government. The 
monarch being by right sole prince and only magistrate, the choice of 
his lieutenants belongs to none but him. When the Abbe de Saint-Pierre 
proposed that the Councils of the King of France should be multiplied, 
and their members elected by ballot, he did not see that he was 
proposing to change the form of government. 
</p><p> 
I should now speak of the methods of giving and counting opinions in the 
assembly of the people; but perhaps an account of this aspect of the 
Roman constitution will more forcibly illustrate all the rules I could 
lay down. It is worth the while of a judicious reader to follow in some 
detail the working of public and private affairs in a Council consisting 
of two hundred thousand men.

THE ROMAN COMITIA 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d97"> 
 
 
<p> 
WE are without well-certified records of the first period of Rome's 
existence; it even appears very probable that most of the stories told 
about it are fables; indeed, generally speaking, the most instructive 
part of the history of peoples, that which deals with their foundation, 
is what we have least of. Experience teaches us every day what causes 
lead to the revolutions of empires; but, as no new peoples are now 
formed, we have almost nothing beyond conjecture to go upon in 
explaining how they were created.</p><p> 
The customs we find established show at least that these customs had an origin. The 
traditions that go back to those origins, that have the greatest 
authorities behind them, and that are confirmed by the strongest proofs, 
should pass for the most certain. These are the rules I have tried to 
follow in inquiring how the freest and most powerful people on earth 
exercised its supreme power.</p><p> 
After the foundation of Rome, the new-born republic, that is, the army of its founder, composed of Albans, 
Sabines and foreigners, was divided into three classes, which, from this 
division, took the name of <hi rend="italic">tribes.</hi> Each of these tribes was 
subdivided into ten <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curi&aelig;</hi></foreign>, 
and each <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curia</hi></foreign> into <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">decuri&aelig;</hi></foreign>, headed by leaders called 
<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curiones</hi></foreign> and <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">decuriones</hi></foreign>.</p><p> 
Besides this, out of 
each tribe was taken a body of one hundred <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Equites</hi></foreign> or Knights, called a 
<hi rend="italic">century,</hi> which shows that these divisions, being unnecessary in 
a town, were at first merely military. But an instinct for greatness 
seems to have led the little township of Rome to provide itself in 
advance with a political system suitable for the capital of the world.</p><p> 
Out of this original division an awkward situation soon arose. 
The tribes of the Albans (Ramnenses) and the Sabines (Tatienses) 
remained always in the same condition, while that of the foreigners 
(Luceres) continually grew as more and more foreigners came to live at 
Rome, so that it soon surpassed the others in strength. Servius remedied 
this dangerous fault by changing the principle of cleavage, and 
substituting for the racial division, which he abolished, a new one 
based on the quarter of the town inhabited by each tribe. Instead of 
three tribes he created four, each occupying and named after one of the 
hills of Rome.  Thus, while redressing the inequality of the moment, he 
also provided for the future; and in order that the division might be 
one of persons as well as localities, he forbade the inhabitants of one 
quarter to migrate to another, and so prevented the mingling of the 
races.</p><p> 
He also doubled the three old centuries of Knights and 
added twelve more, still keeping the old names, and by this simple and 
prudent method, succeeded in making a distinction between the body of 
Knights, and the people, without a murmur from the latter.</p><p> 
To 
the four urban tribes Servius added fifteen others called rural tribes, 
because they consisted of those who lived in the country, divided into 
fifteen cantons. Subsequently, fifteen more were created, and the Roman 
people finally found itself divided into thirty-five tribes, as it 
remained down to the end of the Republic.</p><p> 
The distinction between urban and rural tribes had one effect which is worth mention, 
both because it is without parallel elsewhere, and because to it Rome 
owed the preservation of her morality and the enlargement of her empire. 
We should have expected that the urban tribes would soon monopolise 
power and honours, and lose no time in bringing the rural tribes into 
disrepute; but what happened was exactly the reverse. The taste of the 
early Romans for country life is well known.  This taste they owed to 
their wise founder, who made rural and military labours go along with 
liberty, and, so to speak, relegated to the town arts, crafts, intrigue, 
fortune and slavery.</p><p> 
Since therefore all Rome's most illustrious citizens lived in the fields and tilled the earth, men grew 
used to seeking there alone the mainstays of the republic. This 
condition, being that of the best patricians, was honoured by all men; 
the simple and laborious life of the villager was preferred to the 
slothful and idle life of the bourgeoisie of Rome; and he who, in the 
town, would have been but a wretched proletarian, became, as a labourer 
in the fields, a respected citizen. Not without reason, says Varro, did 
our great-souled ancestors establish in the village the nursery of the 
sturdy and valiant men who defended them in time of war and provided for 
their sustenance in time of peace. Pliny states positively that the 
country tribes were honoured because of the men of whom they were 
composed; while cowards men wished to dishonour were transferred, as a 
public disgrace, to the town tribes. The Sabine Appius Claudius, when he 
had come to settle in Rome, was loaded with honours and enrolled in a 
rural tribe, which subsequently took his family name.  Lastly, freedmen 
always entered the urban, arid never the rural, tribes:  nor is there a 
single example, throughout the Republic, of a freedman, though he had 
become a citizen, reaching any magistracy.</p><p> 
This was an excellent rule; but it was carried so far that in the end it led to a 
change and certainly to an abuse in the political system.</p><p> 
First the censors, after having for a long time claimed the right of 
transferring citizens arbitrarily from one tribe to another, allowed 
most persons to enrol themselves in whatever tribe they pleased. This 
permission certainly did no good, and further robbed the censorship of 
one of its greatest resources. Moreover, as the great and powerful all 
got themselves enrolled in the country tribes, while the freedmen who 
had become citizens remained with the populace in the town tribes, both 
soon ceased to have any local or territorial meaning, and all were so 
confused that the members of one could not be told from those of another 
except by the registers; so that the idea of the word tribe became 
personal instead of real, or rather came to be little more than a 
chimera.</p><p> 
It happened in addition that the town tribes, being 
more on the spot, were often the stronger in the comitia and sold the 
State to those who stooped to buy the votes of the rabble composing 
them.</p><p> 
As the founder had set up ten <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curi&aelig;</hi></foreign> in each tribe, the whole Roman 
people, which was then contained within the walls, consisted of thirty 
<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curi&aelig;,</hi></foreign> each with its 
temples, its gods, its officers, its priests and its festivals, which 
were called <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">compitalia</hi></foreign> and 
corresponded to the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">paganalia,</hi></foreign> 
held in later times by the rural tribes.  </p><p> When Servius made his 
new division, as the thirty curi&aelig; could not be shared equally 
between his four tribes, and as he was unwilling to interfere with them, 
they became a further division of the inhabitants of Rome, quite 
independent of the tribes: but in the case of the rural tribes and their 
members there was no question of <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curi&aelig;,</hi></foreign> as the tribes had then become 
a purely civil institution, and, a new system of levying troops having 
been introduced, the military divisions of Romulus were superfluous. 
Thus, although every citizen was enrolled in a tribe, there were very 
many who were not members of a <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curia.</hi></foreign></p><p> 
Servius made yet a third division, quite distinct from the two we have mentioned, which became, 
in its effects, the most important of all. He distributed the whole 
Roman people into six classes, distinguished neither by place nor by 
person, but by wealth; the first classes included the rich, the last the 
poor, and those between persons of moderate means. These six classes 
were subdivided into one hundred and ninety-three other bodies, called 
centuries, which were so divided that the first class alone comprised 
more than half of them, while the last comprised only one. Thus the 
class that had the smallest number of members had the largest number of 
centuries, and the whole of the last class only counted as a single 
subdivision, although it alone included more than half the inhabitants 
of Rome.</p><p> 
In order that the people might have the less insight 
into the results of this arrangement, Servius tried to give it a 
military tone: in the second class he inserted two centuries of 
armourers, and in the fourth two of makers of instruments of war: in 
each class, except the last, he distinguished young and old, that is, 
those who were under an obligation to bear arms and those whose age gave 
them legal exemption. It was this distinction, rather than that of 
wealth, which required frequent repetition of the census or counting. 
Lastly, he ordered that the assembly should be held in the Campus 
Martius, and that all who were of age to serve should come there armed. 
</p><p> 
The reason for his not making in the last class also the 
division of young and old was that the populace, of whom it was 
composed, was not given the right to bear arms for its country: a man 
had to possess a hearth to acquire the right to defend it, and of all 
the troops of beggars who to-day lend lustre to the armies of kings, 
there is perhaps not one who would not have been driven with scorn out 
of a Roman cohort, at a time when soldiers were the defenders of 
liberty.</p><p> 
In this last class, however, <hi rend="italic">proletarians</hi> 
were distinguished from <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">capite 
censi.</hi></foreign> The former, not quite reduced to nothing, at least 
gave the State citizens, and sometimes, when the need was pressing, even 
soldiers.  Those who had nothing at all, and could be numbered only by 
counting heads, were regarded as of absolutely no account, and Marius 
was the first who stooped to enrol them.</p><p> 
Without deciding now whether this third arrangement was good or bad in itself, I think I may 
assert that it could have been made practicable only by the simple 
morals, the disinterestedness, the liking for agriculture and the scorn 
for commerce and for love of gain which characterised the early Romans. 
Where is the modern people among whom consuming greed, unrest, intrigue, 
continual removals, and perpetual changes of fortune, could let such a 
system last for twenty years without turning the State upside down? We 
must indeed observe that morality and the censorship, being stronger 
than this institution, corrected its defects at Rome, and that the rich 
man found himself degraded to the class of the poor for making too much 
display of his riches.</p><p> 
From all this it is easy to understand why only five classes are almost always mentioned, though there were 
really six. The sixth, as it furnished neither soldiers to the army nor 
votes in the Campus Martius, 
<ref target="n35">[35]</ref> 
and was almost without function in the State, was seldom regarded as of any 
account.</p><p> 
These were the various ways in which the Roman people 
was divided. Let us now see the effect on the assemblies. When lawfully 
summoned, these were called comitia: they were usually held in the 
public square at Rome or in the Campus Martius, and were distinguished 
as <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Curiata</hi></foreign>, <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Centuriata</hi></foreign>, and <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Tributa</hi></foreign>, according to the form 
under which they were convoked. The <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia 
Curiata</hi></foreign> were founded by Romulus; the <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Centuriata</hi></foreign> by Servius; and the <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Tributa</hi></foreign> by the tribunes of the people. No 
law received its sanction and no magistrate was elected, save in the 
<foreign lang="lat">comitia;</foreign> and as every citizen was enrolled 
in a <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curia,</hi></foreign> a century, or a tribe, 
it follows that no citizen was excluded from the right of voting, and 
that the Roman people was truly sovereign both <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">de jure</hi></foreign> and <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">de 
facto.</hi></foreign> </p> 
<p> 
For the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">comitia</hi></foreign> to be lawfully assembled, 
and for their acts to have the force of law, three conditions were 
necessary. First, the body or magistrate convoking them had to possess 
the necessary authority; secondly, the assembly had to be held on a day 
allowed by law; and thirdly, the auguries had to be favourable. 
</p><p> 
The reason for the first regulation needs no explanation; the second is 
a matter of policy. Thus, the comitia might not be held on festivals or 
market-days, when the country-folk, coming to Rome on business, had not 
time to spend the day in the public square. By means of the third, the 
senate held in check the proud and restive people, and meetly restrained 
the ardour of seditious tribunes, who, however, found more than one way 
of escaping this hindrance. 
</p><p> 
Laws and the election of rulers were not the only questions submitted to 
the judgment of the comitia: as the Roman people had taken on itself the 
most important functions of government, it may be said that the lot of 
Europe was regulated in its assemblies. The variety of their objects 
gave rise to the various forms these took, according to the matters on 
which they had to pronounce. 
</p><p> 
In order to judge of these various forms, it is enough to compare them. 
Romulus, when he set up <foreign lang="lat">curia,</foreign> had in view the checking of the senate by 
the people, and of the people by the senate, while maintaining his 
ascendancy over both alike. He therefore gave the people, by means of 
this assembly, all the authority of numbers to balance that of power and 
riches, which he left to the patricians. But, after the spirit of 
monarchy, he left all the same a greater advantage to the patricians in 
the influence of their clients on the majority of votes. This excellent 
institution of patron and client was a masterpiece of statesmanship and 
humanity without which the patriciate, being flagrantly in contradiction 
to the republican spirit, could not have survived. Rome alone has the 
honour of having given to the world this great example, which never led 
to any abuse, and yet has never been followed. 
</p><p> 
As the assemblies by <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curi&aelig;</hi></foreign> persisted under the kings till the time of 
Servius, and the reign of the later Tarquin was not regarded as legitimate, royal laws were called generally <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">leges curiat&aelig;.</hi></foreign> 
</p><p> 
Under the Republic, the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curi&aelig;,</hi></foreign> 
still confined to the four urban tribes, and including only the populace of Rome, suited neither the senate, 
which led the patricians, nor the tribunes, who, though plebeians, were 
at the head of the well-to-do citizens. They therefore fell into 
disrepute, and their degradation was such, that thirty lictors used to 
assemble and do what the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Curiata</hi></foreign> should have done. 
</p><p> 
The division by centuries was so favourable to the aristocracy that it 
is hard to see at first how the senate ever failed to carry the day in 
the <foreign lang="lat">comitia</foreign> bearing their name, by which 
the consuls, the censors and the other <foreign 
lang="lat">curule</foreign> magistrates were elected. Indeed, of the 
hundred and ninety-three centuries into which the six classes of the 
whole Roman people were divided, the first class contained ninety-eight; 
and, as voting went solely by centuries, this class alone had a majority 
over all the rest. When all these centuries were in agreement, the rest 
of the votes were not even taken; the decision of the smallest number 
passed for that of the multitude, and it may be said that, in the 
<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Centuriata</hi></foreign>, decisions were 
regulated far more by depth of purses than by the number of votes. 
</p><p> 
But this extreme authority was modified in two ways. First, the tribunes 
as a rule, and always a great number of plebeians, belonged to the class 
of the rich, and so counterbalanced the influence of the patricians in 
the first class. 
</p><p> 
The second way was this. Instead of causing the centuries to vote 
throughout in order, which would have meant beginning always with the 
first, the Romans always chose one by lot which proceeded alone to the 
election; after this all the centuries were summoned another day 
according to their rank, and the same election was repeated, and as a 
rule confirmed. Thus the authority of example was taken away from rank, 
and given to the lot on a democratic principle. 
</p><p> 
From this custom resulted a further advantage. The citizens from the 
country had time, between the two elections, to inform themselves of the 
merits of the candidate who had been provisionally nominated, and did 
not have to vote without knowledge of the case. But, under the pretext 
of hastening matters, the abolition of this custom was achieved, and 
both elections were held on the same day. 
</p><p> 
The <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Tributa</hi></foreign> were properly the council of the Roman people. They 
were convoked by the tribunes alone; at them the tribunes were elected 
and passed their <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">plebiscita.</hi></foreign> The senate not only had no standing in 
them, but even no right to be present; and the senators, being forced to 
obey laws on which they could not vote, were in this respect less free 
than the meanest citizens. This injustice was altogether ill-conceived, 
and was alone enough to invalidate the decrees of a body to which all 
its members were not admitted. Had all the patricians attended the 
comitia by virtue of the right they had as citizens, they would not, as 
mere private individuals, have had any considerable influence on a vote 
reckoned by counting heads, where the meanest proletarian was as good as 
the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">princeps senatus</hi></foreign>. 
</p><p> 
It may be seen, therefore, that besides the order which was achieved by 
these various ways of distributing so great a people and taking its 
votes, the various methods were not reducible to forms indifferent in 
themselves, but the results of each were relative to the objects which 
caused it to be preferred. 
</p><p> 
Without going here into further details, we may gather from what has 
been said above that the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Tributa</hi></foreign> 
were the most favourable to popular government, and the <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Centuriata</hi></foreign> to aristocracy. The 
<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Curiata,</hi></foreign> in which the populace of Rome formed the majority, 
being fitted only to further tyranny and evil designs, naturally fell 
into disrepute, and even seditious persons abstained from using a method 
which too clearly revealed their projects. It is indisputable that the 
whole majesty of the Roman people lay solely in the <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Centuriata,</hi></foreign> which alone included all; for the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia 
Curiata</hi></foreign> excluded the rural tribes, and the <foreign 
lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Comitia Tributa</hi></foreign> the senate and the patricians. 
</p><p> 
As for the method of taking the vote, it was among the ancient Romans as 
simple as their morals, although not so simple as at Sparta. Each man 
declared his vote aloud, and a clerk duly wrote it down; the majority in 
each tribe determined the vote of the tribe, the majority of the tribes 
that of the people, and so with <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">curi&aelig;</hi></foreign> and centuries. This custom was 
good as long as honesty was triumphant among the citizens, and each man 
was ashamed to vote publicly in favour of an unjust proposal or an 
unworthy subject; but, when the people grew corrupt and votes were 
bought, it was fitting that voting should be secret in order that 
purchasers might be restrained by mistrust, and rogues be given the 
means of not being traitors. 
</p><p> 
I know that Cicero attacks this change, and attributes partly to it the 
ruin of the Republic. But though I feel the weight Cicero's authority 
must carry on such a point, I cannot agree with him; I hold, on the 
contrary, that, for want of enough such changes, the destruction of the 
State must be hastened. Just as the regimen of health does not suit the 
sick, we should not wish to govern a people that has been corrupted by 
the laws that a good people requires. There is no better proof of this 
rule than the long life of the Republic of Venice, of which the shadow 
still exists, solely because its laws are suitable only for men who are 
wicked. 
</p><p> 
The citizens were provided, therefore, with tablets by means of which 
each man could vote without any one knowing how he voted: new methods 
were also introduced for collecting the tablets, for counting voices, 
for comparing numbers, etc.; but all these precautions did not prevent 
the good faith of the officers charged with these functions 
<ref target="n36">[36]</ref> 
from being often suspect. Finally, to prevent intrigues and trafficking 
in votes, edicts were issued; but their very number proves how useless 
they were. 
</p><p> 
Towards the close of the Republic, it was often necessary to have 
recourse to extraordinary expedients in order to supplement the 
inadequacy of the laws. Sometimes miracles were supposed; but this 
method, while it might impose on the people, could not impose on those 
who governed. Sometimes an assembly was hastily called together, before 
the candidates had time to form their factions: sometimes a whole 
sitting was occupied with talk, when it was seen that the people had 
been won over and was on the point of taking up a wrong position. But in 
the end ambition eluded all attempts to check it; and the most 
incredible fact of all is that, in the midst of all these abuses, the 
vast people, thanks to its ancient regulations, never ceased to elect 
magistrates, to pass laws, to judge cases, and to carry through business 
both public and private, almost as easily as the senate itself could 
have done.

THE TRIBUNATE 
</head> 
 
<p> 
WHEN an exact proportion cannot be established between the constituent 
parts of the State, or when causes that cannot be removed continually 
alter the relation of one part to another, recourse is had to the 
institution of a peculiar magistracy that enters into no corporate unity 
with the rest. This restores to each term its right relation to the 
others, and provides a link or middle term between either prince and 
people, or prince and Sovereign, or, if necessary, both at once. 
</p><p> 
This body, which I shall call the <hi rend="italic">tribunate,</hi> is the preserver of the 
laws and of the legislative power. It serves sometimes to protect the 
Sovereign against the government, as the tribunes of the people did at 
Rome; sometimes to uphold the government against the people, as the 
Council of Ten now does at Venice; and sometimes to maintain the balance 
between the two, as the Ephors did at Sparta. 
</p><p> 
The tribunate is not a constituent part of the city, and should have no 
share in either legislative or executive power; but this very fact makes 
its own power the greater: for, while it can do nothing, it can prevent 
anything from being done. It is more sacred and more revered, as the 
defender of the laws, than the prince who executes them, or than the 
Sovereign which ordains them. This was seen very clearly at Rome, when 
the proud patricians, for all their scorn of the people, were forced to 
bow before one of its officers, who had neither auspices nor 
jurisdiction. 
</p><p> 
The tribunate, wisely tempered, is the strongest support a good 
constitution can have; but if its strength is ever so little excessive, 
it upsets the whole State. Weakness, on the other hand, is not natural 
to it: provided it is something, it is never less than it should be. 
</p><p> 
It degenerates into tyranny when it usurps the executive power, which it 
should confine itself to restraining, and when it tries to dispense with 
the laws, which it should confine itself to protecting. The immense 
power of the Ephors, harmless as long as Sparta preserved its morality, 
hastened corruption when once it had begun. The blood of Agis, 
slaughtered by these tyrants, was avenged by his successor; the crime 
and the punishment of the Ephors alike hastened the destruction of the 
republic, and after Cleomenes Sparta ceased to be of any account. Rome 
perished in the same way: the excessive power of the tribunes, which 
they had usurped by degrees, finally served, with the help of laws made 
to secure liberty, as a safeguard for the emperors who destroyed it. As 
for the Venetian Council of Ten, it is a tribunal of blood, an object of 
horror to patricians and people alike; and, so far from giving a lofty 
protection to the laws, it does nothing, now they have become degraded, 
but strike in the darkness blows of which no one dare take note. 
</p><p> 
The tribunate, like the government, grows weak as the number of its 
members increases. When the tribunes of the Roman people, who first 
numbered only two, and then five, wished to double that number, the 
senate let them do so, in the confidence that it could use one to check 
another, as indeed it afterwards freely did. 
</p><p> 
The best method of preventing usurpations by so formidable a body, 
though no government has yet made use of it, would be not to make it 
permanent, but to regulate the periods during which it should remain in 
abeyance. These intervals, which should not be long enough to give 
abuses time to grow strong, may be so fixed by law that they can easily 
be shortened at need by extraordinary commissions. 
</p><p> 
This method seems to me to have no disadvantages, because, as I have 
said, the tribunate, which forms no part of the constitution, can be 
removed without the constitution being affected. It seems to be also 
efficacious, because a newly restored magistrate starts not with the 
power his predecessor exercised, but with that which the law allows him.

THE DICTATORSHIP 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d101"> 
 
 
<p> 
THE inflexibility of the laws, which prevents them from adapting 
themselves to circumstances, may, in certain cases, render them 
disastrous, and make them bring about, at a time of crisis, the ruin of 
the State. The order and slowness of the forms they enjoin require a 
space of time which circumstances sometimes withhold. A thousand cases 
against which the legislator has made no provision may present 
themselves, and it is a highly necessary part of foresight to be 
conscious that everything cannot be foreseen. 
</p><p> 
It is wrong therefore to wish to make political institutions so strong 
as to render it impossible to suspend their operation. Even Sparta 
allowed its laws to lapse. 
</p><p> 
However, none but the greatest dangers can counterbalance that of 
changing the public order, and the sacred power of the laws should never 
be arrested save when the existence of the country is at stake. In these 
rare and obvious cases, provision is made for the public security by a 
particular act entrusting it to him who is most worthy. This commitment 
may be carried out in either of two ways, according to the nature of the 
danger. 
</p><p> 
If increasing the activity of the government is a sufficient remedy, 
power is concentrated in the hands of one or two of its members: in this 
case the change is not in the authority of the laws, but only in the 
form of administering them. If, on the other hand, the peril is of such 
a kind that the paraphernalia of the laws are an obstacle to their 
preservation, the method is to nominate a supreme ruler, who shall 
silence all the laws and suspend for a moment the sovereign authority. 
In such a case, there is no doubt about the general will, and it is 
clear that the people's first intention is that the State shall not 
perish. Thus the suspension of the legislative authority is in no sense 
its abolition; the magistrate who silences it cannot make it speak; he 
dominates it, but cannot represent it. He can do anything, except make 
laws. 
</p><p> 
The first method was used by the Roman senate when, in a consecrated 
formula, it charged the consuls to provide for the safety of the 
Republic. The second was employed when one of the two consuls nominated 
a dictator: 
<ref target="n37">[37]</ref> 
a custom Rome borrowed from Alba.</p><p> 
During the first period of the Republic, recourse was very often had to 
the dictatorship, because the State had not yet a firm enough basis to 
be able to maintain itself by the strength of its constitution alone. As 
the state of morality then made superfluous many of the precautions 
which would have been necessary at other times, there was no fear that a 
dictator would abuse his authority, or try to keep it beyond his term of 
office. On the contrary, so much power appeared to be burdensome to him 
who was clothed with it, and he made all speed to lay it down, as if 
taking the place of the laws had been too troublesome and too perilous a 
position to retain. 
</p><p> 
It is therefore the danger not of its abuse, but of its cheapening, that 
makes me attack the indiscreet use of this supreme magistracy in the 
earliest times. For as long as it was freely employed at elections, 
dedications and purely formal functions, there was danger of its 
becoming less formidable in time of need, and of men growing accustomed 
to regarding as empty a title that was used only on occasions of empty 
ceremonial. 
</p><p> 
Towards the end of the Republic, the Romans, having grown more 
circumspect, were as unreasonably sparing in the use of the dictatorship 
as they had formerly been lavish. It is easy to see that their fears 
were without foundation, that the weakness of the capital secured it 
against the magistrates who were in its midst; that a dictator might, in 
certain cases, defend the public liberty, but could never endanger it; 
and that the chains of Rome would be forged, not in Rome itself, but in 
her armies. The weak resistance offered by Marius to Sulla, and by 
Pompey to C&aelig;sar, clearly showed what was to be expected from authority 
at home against force from abroad. 
</p><p> 
This misconception led the Romans to make great mistakes; such, for 
example, as the failure to nominate a dictator in the Catilinarian 
conspiracy. For, as only the city itself, with at most some province in 
Italy, was concerned, the unlimited authority the laws gave to the 
dictator would have enabled him to make short work of the conspiracy, 
which was, in fact, stifled only by a combination of lucky chances human 
prudence had no right to expect. 
</p><p> 
Instead, the senate contented itself with entrusting its whole power to 
the consuls, so that Cicero, in order to take effective action, was 
compelled on a capital point to exceed his powers; and if, in the first 
transports of joy, his conduct was approved, he was justly called, later 
on, to account for the blood of citizens spilt in violation of the laws. 
Such a reproach could never have been levelled at a dictator. But the 
consul's eloquence carried the day; and he himself, Roman though he was, 
loved his own glory better than his country, and sought, not so much the 
most lawful and secure means of saving the State, as to get for himself 
the whole honour of having done so. 
<ref target="n38">[38]</ref> 
He was therefore justly honoured as the liberator of Rome, and also 
justly punished as a law-breaker.  However brilliant his recall may have 
been, it was undoubtedly an act of pardon. 
</p><p> 
However this important trust be conferred, it is important that its 
duration should be fixed at a very brief period, incapable of being ever 
prolonged. In the crises which lead to its adoption, the State is either 
soon lost, or soon saved; and, the present need passed, the dictatorship 
becomes either tyrannical or idle. At Rome, where dictators held office 
for six months only, most of them abdicated before their time was up. If 
their term had been longer, they might well have tried to prolong it 
still further, as the decemvirs did when chosen for a year. The dictator 
had only time to provide against the need that had caused him to be 
chosen; he had none to think of further projects.

 That is what he could not be sure of, if he proposed a dictator; for 
he dared not nominate himself, and could not be certain that his 
colleague would nominate him.

THE CENSORSHIP 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d104"> 
 
 
<p> 
AS the law is the declaration of the general will, the censorship is the 
declaration of the public judgment: public opinion is the form of law 
which the censor administers, and, like the prince, only applies to 
particular cases. 
</p><p> 
The censorial tribunal, so far from being the arbiter of the people's 
opinion, only declares it, and, as soon as the two part company, its 
decisions are null and void. 
</p><p> 
It is useless to distinguish the morality of a nation from the objects 
of its esteem; both depend on the same principle and are necessarily 
indistinguishable. There is no people on earth the choice of whose 
pleasures is not decided by opinion rather than nature. Right men's 
opinions, and their morality will purge itself. Men always love what is 
good or what they find good; it is in judging what is good that they go 
wrong. This judgment, therefore, is what must be regulated. He who 
judges of morality judges of honour; and he who judges of honour finds 
his law in opinion. 
</p><p> 
The opinions of a people are derived from its constitution; although the 
law does not regulate morality, it is legislation that gives it birth. 
When legislation grows weak, morality degenerates; but in such cases the 
judgment of the censors will not do what the force of the laws has 
failed to effect. 
</p><p> 
From this it follows that the censorship may be useful for the 
preservation of morality, but can never be so for its restoration. Set 
up censors while the laws are vigorous; as soon as they have lost their 
vigour, all hope is gone; no legitimate power can retain force when the 
laws have lost it. 
</p><p> 
The censorship upholds morality by preventing opinion from growing 
corrupt, by preserving its rectitude by means of wise applications, and 
sometimes even by fixing it when it is still uncertain. The employment 
of seconds in duels, which had been carried to wild extremes in the 
kingdom of France, was done away with merely by these words in a royal 
edict: "As for those who are cowards enough to call upon seconds." This 
judgment, in anticipating that of the public, suddenly decided it. But 
when edicts from the same source tried to pronounce duelling itself an 
act of cowardice, as indeed it is, then, since common opinion does not 
regard it as such, the public took no notice of a decision on a point on 
which its mind was already made up. 
</p><p> 
I have stated elsewhere 
<ref target="n39">[39]</ref> 
that as public opinion is not subject to any constraint, there need be 
no trace of it in the tribunal set up to represent it. It is impossible 
to admire too much the art with which this resource, which we moderns 
have wholly lost, was employed by the Romans, and still more by the 
Laced&aelig;monians. 
</p><p> 
A man of bad morals having made a good proposal in the Spartan Council, 
the Ephors neglected it, and caused the same proposal to be made by a 
virtuous citizen. What an honour for the one, and what a disgrace for 
the other, without praise or blame of either! Certain drunkards from 
Samos 
<ref target="n40">[40]</ref> 
polluted the tribunal of the Ephors: the next day, a public edict gave 
Samians permission to be filthy. An actual punishment would not have 
been so severe as such an impunity. When Sparta has pronounced on what 
is or is not right, Greece makes no appeal from her judgments.

CIVIL RELIGION 
</head> 
 
<div3 type="section" id="d107"> 
 
 
<p> 
AT first men had no kings save the gods, and no government save 
theocracy. They reasoned like Caligula, and, at that period, reasoned 
aright. It takes a long time for feeling so to change that men can make 
up their minds to take their equals as masters, in the hope that they 
will profit by doing so. 
</p><p> 
From the mere fact that God was set over every political society, it 
followed that there were as many gods as peoples. Two peoples that were 
strangers the one to the other, and almost always enemies, could not 
long recognise the same master: two armies giving battle could not obey 
the same leader. National divisions thus led to polytheism, and this in 
turn gave rise to theological and civil intolerance, which, as we shall 
see hereafter, are by nature the same. 
</p><p> 
The fancy the Greeks had for rediscovering their gods among the 
barbarians arose from the way they had of regarding themselves as the 
natural Sovereigns of such peoples. But there is nothing so absurd as 
the erudition which in our days identifies and confuses gods of 
different nations. As if Moloch, Saturn, and Chronos could be the same 
god! As if the Phoenician Baal, the Greek Zeus, and the Latin Jupiter 
could be the same! As if there could still be anything common to 
imaginary beings with different names! 
</p><p> 
If it is asked how in pagan times, where each State had its cult and its 
gods, there were no wars of religion, I answer that it was precisely 
because each State, having its own cult as well as its own government, 
made no distinction between its gods and its laws. Political war was 
also theological; the provinces of the gods were, so to speak, fixed by 
the boundaries of nations. The god of one people had no right over 
another. The gods of the pagans were not jealous gods; they shared among 
themselves the empire of the world: even Moses and the Hebrews sometimes 
lent themselves to this view by speaking of the God of Israel. It is 
true, they regarded as powerless the gods of the Canaanites, a 
proscribed people condemned to destruction, whose place they were to 
take; but remember how they spoke of the divisions of the neighbouring 
peoples they were forbidden to attack! "Is not the possession of what 
belongs to your god Chamos lawfully your due?" said Jephthah to the 
Ammonites. "We have the same title to the lands our conquering God has 
made his own." 
<ref target="n41">[41]</ref> 
Here, I think, there is a recognition that the rights of Chamos and 
those of the God of Israel are of the same nature. 
</p><p> 
But when the Jews, being subject to the Kings of Babylon, and, 
subsequently, to those of Syria, still obstinately refused to recognise 
any god save their own, their refusal was regarded as rebellion against 
their conqueror, and drew down on them the persecutions we read of in 
their history, which are without parallel till the coming of 
Christianity. 
<ref target="n42">[42]</ref> 
</p><p> 
Every religion, therefore, being attached solely to the laws of the 
State which prescribed it, there was no way of converting a people 
except by enslaving it, and there could be no missionaries save 
conquerors. The obligation to change cults being the law to which the 
vanquished yielded, it was necessary to be victorious before suggesting 
such a change. So far from men fighting for the gods, the gods, as in 
Homer, fought for men; each asked his god for victory, and repayed him 
with new altars. The Romans, before taking a city, summoned its gods to 
quit it; and, in leaving the Tarentines their outraged gods, they 
regarded them as subject to their own and compelled to do them homage. 
They left the vanquished their gods as they left them their laws. A 
wreath to the Jupiter of the Capitol was often the only tribute they 
imposed. 
</p><p> 
Finally, when, along with their empire, the Romans had spread their cult 
and their gods, and had themselves often adopted those of the 
vanquished, by granting to both alike the rights of the city, the 
peoples of that vast empire insensibly found themselves with multitudes 
of gods and cults, everywhere almost the same; and thus paganism 
throughout the known world finally came to be one and the same religion. 
</p><p> 
It was in these circumstances that Jesus came to set up on earth a 
spiritual kingdom, which, by separating the theological from the 
political system, made the State no longer one, and brought about the 
internal divisions which have never ceased to trouble Christian peoples. 
As the new idea of a kingdom of the other world could never have 
occurred to pagans, they always looked on the Christians as really 
rebels, who, while feigning to submit, were only waiting for the chance 
to make themselves independent and their masters, and to usurp by guile 
the authority they pretended in their weakness to respect. This was the 
cause of the persecutions. 
</p><p> 
What the pagans had feared took place. Then everything changed its 
aspect: the humble Christians changed their language, and soon this 
so-called kingdom of the other world turned, under a visible leader, 
into the most violent of earthly despotisms. 
</p><p> 
However, as there have always been a prince and civil laws, this double 
power and conflict of jurisdiction have made all good polity impossible 
in Christian States; and men have never succeeded in finding out whether 
they were bound to obey the master or the priest. 
</p><p> 
Several peoples, however, even in Europe and its neighbourhood, have 
desired without success to preserve or restore the old system: but the 
spirit of Christianity has everywhere prevailed. The sacred cult has 
always remained or again become independent of the Sovereign, and there 
has been no necessary link between it and the body of the State. Mahomet 
held very sane views, and linked his political system well together; 
and, as long as the form of his government continued under the caliphs 
who succeeded him, that government was indeed one, and so far good. But 
the Arabs, having grown prosperous, lettered, civilised, slack and 
cowardly, were conquered by barbarians: the division between the two 
powers began again; and, although it is less apparent among the 
Mahometans than among the Christians, it none the less exists, 
especially in the sect of Ali, and there are States, such as Persia, 
where it is continually making itself felt. 
</p><p> 
Among us, the Kings of England have made themselves heads of the Church, 
and the Czars have done the same: but this title has made them less its 
masters than its ministers; they have gained not so much the right to 
change it, as the power to maintain it: they are not its legislators, 
but only its princes. Wherever the clergy is a corporate body, 
<ref target="n43">[43]</ref> 
it is master and legislator in its own country. There are thus two 
powers, two Sovereigns, in England and in Russia, as well as elsewhere. 
</p><p> 
Of all Christian writers, the philosopher Hobbes alone has seen the evil 
and how to remedy it, and has dared to propose the reunion of the two 
heads of the eagle, and the restoration throughout of political unity, 
without which no State or government will ever be rightly constituted. 
But he should have seen that the masterful spirit of Christianity is 
incompatible with his system, and that the priestly interest would 
always be stronger than that of the State. It is not so much what is 
false and terrible in his political theory, as what is just and true, 
that has drawn down hatred on it. 
<ref target="n44">[44]</ref> 
</p><p> 
I believe that if the study of history were developed from this point of 
view, it would be easy to refute the contrary opinions of Bayle and 
Warburton, one of whom holds that religion can be of no use to the body 
politic, while the other, on the contrary, maintains that Christianity 
is its strongest support. We should demonstrate to the former that no 
State has ever been founded without a religious basis, and to the 
latter, that the law of Christianity at bottom does more harm by 
weakening than good by strengthening the constitution of the State. To 
make myself understood, I have only to make a little more exact the too 
vague ideas of religion as relating to this subject. 
</p><p> 
Religion, considered in relation to society, which is either general or 
particular, may also be divided into two kinds: the religion of man, and 
that of the citizen. The first, which has neither temples, nor altars, 
nor rites, and is confined to the purely internal cult of the supreme 
God and the eternal obligations of morality, is the religion of the 
Gospel pure and simple, the true theism, what may be called natural 
divine right or law. The other, which is codified in a single country, 
gives it its gods, its own tutelary patrons; it has its dogmas, its 
rites, and its external cult prescribed by law; outside the single 
nation that follows it, all the world is in its sight infidel, foreign 
and barbarous; the duties and rights of man extend for it only as far as 
its own altars. Of this kind were all the religions of early peoples, 
which we may define as civil or positive divine right or law. 
</p><p> 
There is a third sort of religion of a more singular kind, which gives 
men two codes of legislation, two rulers, and two countries, renders 
them subject to contradictory duties, and makes it impossible for them 
to be faithful both to religion and to citizenship. Such are the 
religions of the Lamas and of the Japanese, and such is Roman 
Christianity, which may be called the religion of the priest. It leads 
to a sort of mixed and anti-social code which has no name. 
</p><p> 
In their political aspect, all these three kinds of religion have their 
defects. The third is so clearly bad, that it is waste of time to stop 
to prove it such. All that destroys social unity is worthless; all 
institutions that set man in contradiction to himself are worthless. 
</p><p> 
The second is good in that it unites the divine cult with love of the 
laws, and, making country the object of the citizens' adoration, teaches 
them that service done to the State is service done to its tutelary god. 
It is a form of theocracy, in which there can be no pontiff save the 
prince, and no priests save the magistrates. To die for one's country 
then becomes martyrdom; violation of its laws, impiety; and to subject 
one who is guilty to public execration is to condemn him to the anger of 
the gods:<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">Sacer estod.</hi></foreign> 
</p><p> 
On the other hand, it is bad in that, being founded on lies and error, 
it deceives men, makes them credulous and superstitious, and drowns the 
true cult of the Divinity in empty ceremonial. It is bad, again, when it 
becomes tyrannous and exclusive, and makes a people bloodthirsty and 
intolerant, so that it breathes fire and slaughter, and regards as a 
sacred act the killing of every one who does not believe in its gods. 
The result is to place such a people in a natural state of war with all 
others, so that its security is deeply endangered. 
</p><p> 
There remains therefore the religion of man or Christianity -- not the 
Christianity of to-day, but that of the Gospel, which is entirely 
different. By means of this holy, sublime, and real religion all men, 
being children of one God, recognise one another as brothers, and the 
society that unites them is not dissolved even at death. 
</p><p> 
But this religion, having no particular relation to the body politic, 
leaves the laws in possession of the force they have in themselves 
without making any addition to it; and thus one of the great bonds that 
unite society considered in severally fails to operate. Nay, more, so 
far from binding the hearts of the citizens to the State, it has the 
effect of taking them away from all earthly things. I know of nothing 
more contrary to the social spirit. 
</p><p> 
We are told that a people of true Christians would form the most perfect 
society imaginable. I see in this supposition only one great difficulty: 
that a society of true Christians would not be a society of men. 
</p><p> 
I say further that such a society, with all its perfection, would be 
neither the strongest nor the most lasting: the very fact that it was 
perfect would rob it of its bond of union; the flaw that would destroy 
it would lie in its very perfection. 
</p><p> 
Every one would do his duty; the people would be law-abiding, the rulers 
just and temperate; the magistrates upright and incorruptible; the 
soldiers would scorn death; there would be neither vanity nor luxury. So 
far, so good; but let us hear more. 
</p><p> 
Christianity as a religion is entirely spiritual, occupied solely with 
heavenly things; the country of the Christian is not of this world. He 
does his duty, indeed, but does it with profound indifference to the 
good or ill success of his cares. Provided he has nothing to reproach 
himself with, it matters little to him whether things go well or ill 
here on earth. If the State is prosperous, he hardly dares to share in 
the public happiness, for fear he may grow proud of his country's glory; 
if the State is languishing, he blesses the hand of God that is hard 
upon His people. 
</p><p> 
For the State to be peaceable and for harmony to be maintained, all the 
citizens without exception would have to be good Christians; if by ill 
hap there should be a single self-seeker or hypocrite, a Catiline or a 
Cromwell, for instance, he would certainly get the better of his pious 
compatriots. Christian charity does not readily allow a man to think 
hardly of his neighbours. As soon as, by some trick, he has discovered 
the art of imposing on them and getting hold of a share in the public 
authority, you have a man established in dignity; it is the will of God 
that he be respected: very soon you have a power; it is God's will that 
it be obeyed: and if the power is abused by him who wields it, it is the 
scourge wherewith God punishes His children. There would be scruples 
about driving out the usurper: public tranquillity would have to be 
disturbed, violence would have to be employed, and blood spilt; all this 
accords ill with Christian meekness; and after all, in this vale of 
sorrows, what does it matter whether we are free men or serfs? The 
essential thing is to get to heaven, and resignation is only an 
additional means of doing so. 
</p><p> 
If war breaks out with another State, the citizens march readily out to 
battle; not one of them thinks of flight; they do their duty, but they 
have no passion for victory; they know better how to die than how to 
conquer. What does it matter whether they win or lose? Does not 
Providence know better than they what is meet for them? Only think to 
what account a proud, impetuous and passionate enemy could turn their 
stoicism! Set over against them those generous peoples who were devoured 
by ardent love of glory and of their country, imagine your Christian 
republic face to face with Sparta or Rome: the pious Christians will be 
beaten, crushed and destroyed, before they know where they are, or will 
owe their safety only to the contempt their enemy will conceive for 
them. It was to my mind a fine oath that was taken by the soldiers of 
Fabius, who swore, not to conquer or die, but to come back victorious -- 
and kept their oath. Christians would never have taken such an oath; 
they would have looked on it as tempting God. 
</p><p> 
But I am mistaken in speaking of a Christian republic; the terms are 
mutually exclusive. Christianity preaches only servitude and dependence. 
Its spirit is so favourable to tyranny that it always profits by such a 
regime. True Christians are made to be slaves, and they know it and do 
not much mind: this short life counts for too little in their eyes. 
</p><p> 
I shall be told that Christian troops are excellent. I deny it. Show me 
an instance. For my part, I know of no Christian troops. I shall be told 
of the Crusades. Without disputing the valour of the Crusaders, I answer 
that, so far from being Christians, they were the priests' soldiery, 
citizens of the Church. They fought for their spiritual country, which 
the Church had, somehow or other, made temporal. Well understood, this 
goes back to paganism: as the Gospel sets up no national religion, a 
holy war is impossible among Christians. 
</p><p> 
Under the pagan emperors, the Christian soldiers were brave; every 
Christian writer affirms it, and I believe it: it was a case of 
honourable emulation of the pagan troops. As soon as the emperors were 
Christian, this emulation no longer existed, and, when the Cross had 
driven out the eagle, Roman valour wholly disappeared. 
</p><p> 
But, setting aside political considerations, let us come back to what is 
right, and settle our principles on this important point. The right 
which the social compact gives the Sovereign over the subjects does not, 
we have seen, exceed the limits of public expediency. 
<ref target="n45">[45]</ref> 
The subjects then owe the Sovereign an account of their opinions only to 
such an extent as they matter to the community. Now, it matters very 
much to the community that each citizen should have a religion. That 
will make him love his duty; but the dogmas of that religion concern the 
State and its members only so far as they have reference to morality and 
to the duties which he who professes them is bound to do to others. Each 
man may have, over and above, what opinions he pleases, without it being 
the Sovereign's business to take cognisance of them; for, as the 
Sovereign has no authority in the other world, whatever the lot of its 
subjects may be in the life to come, that is not its business, provided 
they are good citizens in this life. 
</p><p> 
There is therefore a purely civil profession of faith of which the 
Sovereign should fix the articles, not exactly as religious dogmas, but 
as social sentiments without which a man cannot be a good citizen or a 
faithful subject. 
<ref target="n46">[46]</ref> 
While it can compel no one to believe them, it can banish from the State 
whoever does not believe them -- it can banish him, not for impiety, but 
as an anti-social being, incapable of truly loving the laws and justice, 
and of sacrificing, at need, his life to his duty. If any one, after 
publicly recognising these dogmas, behaves as if he does not believe 
them, let him be punished by death: he has committed the worst of all 
crimes, that of lying before the law. 
</p><p> 
The dogmas of civil religion ought to be few, simple, and exactly 
worded, without explanation or commentary. The existence of a mighty, 
intelligent and beneficent Divinity, possessed of foresight and 
providence, the life to come, the happiness of the just, the punishment 
of the wicked, the sanctity of the social contract and the laws: these 
are its positive dogmas. Its negative dogmas I confine to one, 
intolerance, which is a part of the cults we have rejected. 
</p><p> 
Those who distinguish civil from theological intolerance are, to my 
mind, mistaken. The two forms are inseparable. It is impossible to live 
at peace with those we regard as damned; to love them would be to hate 
God who punishes them: we positively must either reclaim or torment 
them. Wherever theological intolerance is admitted, it must inevitably 
have some civil effect; 
<ref target="n47">[47]</ref> 
and as soon as it has such an effect, the Sovereign is no longer 
Sovereign even in the temporal sphere:  thenceforce priests are the real 
masters, and kings only their ministers. 
</p><p> 
Now that there is and can be no longer an exclusive national religion, 
tolerance should be given to all religions that tolerate others, so long 
as their dogmas contain nothing contrary to the duties of citizenship. 
But whoever dares to say: Outside the Church is no salvation, ought to 
be driven from the State, unless the State is the Church, and the prince 
the pontiff. Such a dogma is good only in a theocratic government; in 
any other, it is fatal. The reason for which Henry IV is said to have 
embraced the Roman religion ought to make every honest man leave it, and 
still more any prince who knows how to reason.

 <foreign lang="lat">Nonne ea qu&aelig; possidet Chamos deus tuus,

Vulgate. Father de Carri&egrave;res translates:  "Do you not regard 
yourselves as having a right to what your god possesses?" I do not know 
the force of the Hebrew text: but I perceive that, in the Vulgate, 
Jephthah positively recognises the right of the god Chamos, and that the 
French translator weakened this admission by inserting an "according to 
you," which is not in the Latin.

 It is quite clear that the Phocian War, which was called "the Sacred

 It should be noted that the clergy find their bond of union not so 
much in formal assemblies, as in the communion of Churches. Communion 
and excommunication are the social compact of the clergy, a compact 
which will always make them masters of peoples and kings. All priests 
who communicate together are fellow-citizens, even if they come from 
opposite ends of the earth. This invention is a masterpiece of 
statesmanship: there is nothing like it among pagan priests; who have 
therefore never formed a clerical corporate body.

 "In the republic," says the Marquis d'Argenson, "each man is 
perfectly free in what does not harm others." This is the invariable 
limitation, which it is impossible to define more exactly. I have not 
been able to deny myself the pleasure of occasionally quoting from this 
manuscript, though it is unknown to the public, in order to do honour to 
the memory of a good and illustrious man, who had kept even in the 
Ministry the heart of a good citizen, and views on the government of his 
country that were sane and right.

 C&aelig;sar, pleading for Catiline, tried to establish the dogma that the 
soul is mortal: Cato and Cicero, in refutation, did not waste time in 
philosophising. They were content to show that C&aelig;sar spoke like a bad 
citizen, and brought forward a doctrine that would have a bad effect on 
the State. This, in fact, and not a problem of theology, was what the 
Roman senate had to judge.

Marriage, for instance, being a civil contract, has civil effects 
without which society cannot even subsist. Suppose a body of clergy 
should claim the sole right of permitting this act, a right which every 
intolerant religion must of necessity claim, is it not clear that in 
establishing the authority of the Church in this respect, it will be 
destroying that of the prince, who will have thenceforth only as many 
subjects as the clergy choose to allow him? Being in a position to marry 
or not to marry people according to their acceptance of such and such a 
doctrine, their admission or rejection of such and such a formula, their 
greater or less piety, the Church alone, by the exercise of prudence and 
firmness, will dispose of all inheritances, offices and citizens, and 
even of the State itself, which could not subsist if it were composed 
entirely of bastards? But, I shall be told, there will be appeals on the 
ground of abuse, summonses and decrees; the temporalities will be 
seized. How sad! The clergy, however little, I will not say courage, but 
sense it has, will take no notice and go its way: it will quietly allow 
appeals, summonses, decrees and seizures, and, in the end, will remain 
the master. It is not, I think, a great sacrifice to give up a part, 
when one is sure of securing all.

CONCLUSION

<p> 
Now that I have laid down the true principles of political right, and 
tried to give the State a basis of its own to rest on, I ought next to 
strengthen it by its external relations, which would include the law of 
nations, commerce, the right of war and conquest, public right, leagues, 
negotiations, treaties, etc. But all this forms a new subject that is 
far too vast for my narrow scope. I ought throughout to have kept to a 
more limited sphere.
