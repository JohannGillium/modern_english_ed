				<head>OBSERVATIONS on the SLAVES and the INDENTED SERVANTS, inlisted in the Army,
					and in the Navy of the United States.</head>

				<p>
					<hi rend="bold">T</hi>HE Resolve of Congress, for prohibiting the importation of
					Slaves, demonstrates the consistent zeal of our rulers in the cause of mankind.
					They have endeavoured, as early and as extensively as it then was in their
					power, to reform our morals, by checking the progress of the general
					depravation, which, sooner or later, proves the ruin of the countries, where
					domestic slavery is introduced. From the liberal spirit of that resolve, which,
					soon after, was most cheerfully supported by their constituents, it is natural
					to infer that, had not the necessity of repelling the hostilities of powerful
					invaders so deeply engaged the attention of the several legislative bodies of
					our Union, laws would, long since, have been made, with every precaution, which
					our safety might have dictated, for facilitating emancipations. Many Slaves,
					however, too many perhaps, are incautiously allowed to fight under our banners.
					They share in the dangers and glory of the efforts made by US, the freeborn
					members of the United States, to enjoy, undisturbed, the common rights of human
					nature; and THEY remain SLAVES! </p>
				<p> The exquisite sensibility, the enlightened equity of a free people, cannot
					suffer them to be ungrateful.&mdash;To stand indebted for the recovery of
					the least portion of our rights, to a race of men, whose unhappy lot must be to
					continue in a state of the most dishonourable degradation, would be too painful,
					too humiliating.&mdash;Have we not ourselves taught those men, on the most
					rational principles, and with all the energy which our feeling could give us, to
					execrate that state as unnatural, and contrary to the laws of GOD? Would public
					faith had been pledged to the Slaves, before they were permitted to fight in our
					cause, that their own liberty was one of the recompences, which they were to
					receive, for their courage and fidelity! It would have been a restitution, not a
					recompence, though policy, to conceal our blushes, should have suggested a name
					for it, which could not wound our pride. </p>
				<p> Other States Have likewise, on extraordinary emergencies, hazarded to employ
					Slaves in their wars; but immediate, or conditional emancipation was, at the
					same time, held up, and most religiously bestowed on them, as the sacred
					retribution of gratitude. GOD forbid, we should act with less generosity and
					justice on similar occasions! France, in the islands of Guadaloupe and
					Martinico, as well as Spain, in the island of Cuba, have, during the course of
					the last war, exhibited to us such laudable examples. The Slaves, whom they
					intrusted with arms, in the defence of their territories, were not only allowed
					to dispose of their whole pay as they thought fit, but indiscriminately partook
					of every other advantage given to the freeborn soldiers of their respective
					States. Britain knows, and we may remember, that these freedmen, animated by
					such encouragements, fought with the greatest intrepidity. They were remarkably
					faithful, and none of them deserted. \-s\Were they not certain, that, had they
					been guilty of that crime, or had they been made prisoners of war, the enemy
					would have sold them, in the same manner that they sold the Slaves who fell into
					their hands? But the owners were indemnified by the State to which they
					belonged, for the loss they sustained, on account of their Slaves, who were
					emancipated for having $$Word$$ in its defence. </p>
				<p> Neither the Slaves who bear arms for us, nor their owners, have, as yet,
					obtained such advantages from any of the United States. Our non-emancipated
					soldiers are almost irresistably tempted to desert to our foes, who never fail
					to employ them against us. There, at least, besides the uncontroled disposal of
					their whole pay, they have a chance for being gifted by the enemy, whom sound
					policy may inspire be generous in this case, with that freedom, which our laws
					do not authorize them to claim as their reward from us, for whose liberty they
					daily expose their lives. It is true, that they are proportionally but few in
					the service; and yet, could we rest assured, that no great misfortune ever will
					arise from the want of benevolent resolves in their behalves, our domestic
					peace, and the jealousy of that honour which impels men to warlike
					atchievements, would demand the most serious attention of the Congress,
					respecting the political existence of inlisted Slaves, or the propriety of
					excluding them from being at any time employed, as soldiers or seamen, in our
					wars. </p>
				<p> There is in the army and navy of the United States another class of oppressed
					men, whose singular usefulness, were they interested to remain with us, and
					whose power to do us numberless injuries, if provoked to fly to the enemy for an
					asylum, are of the greatest importance at this juncture. Their education,
					national prejudices and attachments, the moral principles of a considerable part
					of them, and the opprobrious state to which they are all very unjustly degraded,
					cannot have been considered in their different points of view, before they were
					invited to inlist; otherwise, the possibility of many evils which the resolve,
					relative to them, portends, in its original tenor, would have been discovered,
					and consequently prevented. </p>
				<p> The oppressed persons here meant, are, few of them excepted, Europeans, and born
					in the dominions of Great-Britain. They are those unhappy beings, whom the
					covetousness and treachery of the British merchants, as well as the collusion of
					the British administration, have doomed, whether convicts or not, to temporary
					slavery amongst us, before we became free. Even now, these temporary Slaves are,
					to our dishonour! as remorelesly sold as the Africans, or their offspring; nay,
					the flagitiousness of the deed is aggravated by the mockery and hypocritical
					stile of the owners who advertise them for sale; who, ashamed of their own
					iniquitousness, vainly recur to subterfuges, that it may be extenuated in the
					minds of others&mdash;It is THE TIME, not THE BODY or the <hi rend="italic"
						>person</hi>, of the indented servant, of either sex, which is TO BE SOLD!
					The body or person of such servant is, however, subjected, not by law, but
					connivence, to the wanton barbarity or lewd attempts of the purchaser. It is, in
					fact, as absolutely subjected as the body or person of a Negro, man or woman,
					who is sold as a <hi rend="italic">legal</hi> Slave.&mdash;Can it be much longer
					suffered, in this land of freedom, thus to sport with human nature? </p>
				<p> Now that we are an independent people, the dissoluteness and oppression, which
					are inseparable from that impious trade, will have but a very short duration.
					They must cease of themselves at the expiration of the limited terms of
					servitude, the longest of which can scarcely exceed four years, from this time;
					and but few of our brethren will so long groan under the scandalous yoke. It is
					therefore unreasonable to believe, and it would be excessively cruel to
					insinuate, that any other consideration prevailed on our Delegates, to deprive
					themselves and their constituents of the god-like pleasure of giving
					unconditional deliverance from slavery to all the men, women and children of
					European descent, who had been betrayed into it, and sold to us, by their
					European brethren. But pardonable as the omission may be, neither humanity nor
					self-love will let us reflect upon it without regret. </p>
				<p> Oh! may we soon blot out the reproach which that neglect has justly rendered us
					liable to, since we abolished the novercal government of Britain! May we soon
					impart, at least to those victims, devoted by her degenerate and unnatural sons
					to temporary slavery, the same blessings, to the enjoyment of which we are now
					restored! Let us endear ourselves to them by acts of justice;&mdash;let our
					selfishness and severity no longer strengthen the prejudices of their education,
					nor induce them to behold us as their oppressors and enemies. </p>
				<p> They have already been courted to inlist in our service; but, unhappily for us,
					as well as for them, the indemnification allowed to the mastery was not a gift
					to the redeemed servants&mdash;It was no more than a loan to
					them&mdash;They must discharge it out of their bounty money; and, if that be
					insufficient, out of their pay! An amazing number of these men eagerly seized
					the unexpected opportunity offered them, to rescue themselves from unlawful
					bondage; but the conditions on which they were to obtain their freedom,
					impressing no idea of gratitude on their minds, they determined to desert to the
					enemy, as soon as they could. In the mean while, most of them quickly
					disappeared from the corps in which they inlisted. They afterwards re-inlisted,
					and deserted, as often as they found officers who, over-anxious to fill up their
					companies with greater expedition, or led by sordid motives, were less
					inquisitive than they ought to have been. </p>
				<p> The treasury of the United States has been, by these means, spoliated of an
					immense sum: The extravagant stipulations received, and so easily acquired by
					such unprincipled recruits, who have been mustered as Substitutes, for exempting
					Militia men from being draughted, have been squandered, together with the bounty
					money, in the most flagrant riots; and the lowest kind of profusion has been
					exhibited all over our territories. That profusion is, perhaps, one of the
					principal causes, which have concurred in raising the spirit of extortion with
					such stupendous rapidity, and to that progressive height, in every part of the
					United States, that it must now be speedily forced down, to a degree which may
					admit some toleration.&mdash;And indeed, should our absurd complaisance to
					extortioners, that is to traitors, continue but a few weeks longer, we might
					experience far greater woes than those we could reasonably fear from the
					combined malice and power of Great-Britain, unassisted by our own rapaciousness
					or conspiracy. </p>
				<p> The service of the Militia men who have already procured, or may hereafter
					procure, substitutes of the cast we have described, will be lost to the United
					States, during the war, or three years; for, the wording of the recommendatory
					resolve of the Congress declaring that two Militia men shall be exempted from
					being draughted, if they procure one mustered substitute, the abuses which
					result from the resolve, are striking.&mdash;Every State which has made laws
					corresponding with the recommendation, will have reason to repent their
					compliance, two men being reputed in actual service, even after the desertion of
					their substitute. They are legally represented, and consequently exempted from
					being draughted, during the whole term. </p>
