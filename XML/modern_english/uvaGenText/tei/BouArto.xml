<p>
   Theodore Dreiser has had the good fortune
to evoke a peculiar quality of pugnacious interest among
the younger American <hi rend="italic">intelligentsia</hi> such as has
been the lot of almost nobody else writing today unless
it be Miss Amy Lowell.  We do not usually take literature
seriously enough to quarrel over it.
Or else we take it so seriously that we urbanely avoid squabbles.
Certainly there are none of the vendettas that rage in a culture
like that of France.  But Mr. Dreiser seems
to have made himself, particularly since the
suppression of "The 'Genius,'" a veritable
issue.  Interesting and surprising are the
reactions to him.  Edgar Lee Masters makes
him a "soul-enrapt demi-urge, walking the
earth, stalking life"; Harris Merton Lyon saw
in him a "seer of inscrutable mien"; Arthur
Davison Ficke sees him as master of a passing
throng of figures, "labored with immortal illusion, the
terrible and beautiful, cruel and
wonder-laden illusion of life"; Mr. Powys
makes him an epic philosopher of the "life-tide";
H. L. Mencken puts him ahead of Conrad, with
"an agnosticism that has almost
passed beyond curiosity."  On the other
hand, an unhappy critic in the "Nation" last
year gave Mr. Dreiser his place for all time
in a neat antithesis between the realism that
was based on a theory of human conduct and
the naturalism that reduced life to a mere
animal behavior.  For Dreiser this last special
hell was reserved, and the jungle-like and
simian activities of his characters rather exhaustively outlined.
At the time this antithesis looked silly.  With the appearance of
Mr. Dreiser's latest book, "A Hoosier Holiday," it becomes nonsensical.
For that wise and delightful book reveals him as a very human critic
of very common human life, romantically sensual and poetically realistic,
with an artist's vision and a thick, warm feeling for American life.</p><p>
   This book gives the clue to Mr. Dreiser, to
his insatiable curiosity about people, about
their sexual inclinations, about their dreams,
about the homely qualities that make them
American.  His memories give a picture of
the floundering young American that is so
typical as to be almost epic.  No one has ever
pictured this lower middle-class American
life so winningly, because no one has had the
necessary literary skill with the lack of self-consciousness.
Mr. Dreiser is often sentimental, but it is a sentimentality
that captivates
you with its candor.  You are seeing this
vacuous, wistful, spiritually rootless, middle-Western life
through the eyes of a na&iuml;ve but very wise boy.  Mr. Dreiser
seems queer only because he has carried along his youthful
attitude in unbroken continuity.  He is fascinated with sex
because youth is usually obsessed with sex.  He puzzles about the universe
because youth usually puzzles.  He thrills to
crudity and violence because sensitive youth
usually recoils from the savagery of the industrial world.
Imagine incorrigible, sensuous
youth endowed with the brooding skepticism
of the philosopher who feels the vanity of
life, and you have the paradox of Mr. Dreiser.
For these two attitudes in him support rather
than oppose each other.  His spiritual evolution was out
of a pious, ascetic atmosphere
into intellectual and personal freedom.  He
seems to have found himself without losing
himself.  Of how many American writers can
this be said?  And for this much shall be forgiven him,
&mdash;his slovenliness of style, his lack
of nuances, his apathy to the finer shades of
beauty, his weakness for the mystical and the
vague.  Mr. Dreiser suggests the over-sensitive
temperament that protects itself by an admiration for
crudity and cruelty.  His latest
book reveals the boyhood shyness and timidity
of this Don Juan of novelists.  Mr. Dreiser is
complicated, but he is complicated in a very
understandable American way, the product of
the uncouth forces of small-town life and the
vast disorganization of the wider American
world.  As he reveals himself, it is a revelation
of a certain broad level of the American soul.
  </p><p> Mr. Dreiser seems uncommon only because
he is more na&iuml;ve than most of us.  It is not so
much that he swarms his pages with sexful
figures as that he rescues sex for the scheme
of personal life.  He feels a holy mission to
slay the American literary superstition that
men and women are not sensual beings.  But
<pb/>

he does not brush this fact in the sniggering
way of the popular magazines.  He takes it
very seriously, so much so that some of his
novels become caricatures of desire.  It is,
however, a misfortune that it has been Brieux
and Freud and not native Theodore Dreiser
who soaked the sexual imagination of the
younger American <hi rend="italic">intelligentsia</hi>.  It would
have been far healthier to have absorbed Mr.
Dreiser's literary treatment of sex than to
have gone hysterical over its pathology.  Sex
has little significance unless it is treated in
personally artistic, novelistic terms.  The
American tradition had tabooed the treatment
of those infinite gradations and complexities
of love that fill the literary imagination of a
sensitive people.  When curiosity got too
strong and reticence was repealed in America,
we had no means of articulating ourselves
except in a deplorable pseudo-scientific jargon
that has no more to do with the relevance of
sex than the chemical composition of orange
paint has to do with the artist's vision.
Dreiser has done a real service to the American
imagination in despising the underworld
and going gravely to the business of picturing
sex as it is lived in the personal relations of
bungling, wistful, or masterful men and
women.  He seemed strange and rowdy only
because he made sex human, and American
tradition had never made it human.  It had
only made it either sacred or vulgar, and
when these categories no longer worked, we
fell under the dubious and perverting magic
of the psycho-analysts.</p><p>
   In spite of his looseness of literary gait
and heaviness of style Dreiser seems a sincere
groper after beauty.  It is natural enough
that this should so largely be the beauty of
sex.  For where would a sensitive boy, brought
up in Indiana and in the big American cities,
get beauty expressed for him except in
women?  What does mid-Western America
offer to the starving except its personal
beauty?  A few landscapes, an occasional picture
in a museum, a book of verse perhaps!
Would not all the rest be one long, flaunting
offense of ugliness and depression?  "The
'Genius,'" instead of being that mass of pornographic
horror which the Vice Societies
repute it to be, is the story of a groping artist
whose love of beauty runs obsessingly upon
the charm of girlhood.  Through different social planes,
through business and manual labor and the feverish world
of artists, he pursues this lure.  Dreiser is refreshing
in his air of the moral democrat, who sees life
impassively, neither praising nor blaming, at the
same time that he realizes how much more
terrible and beautiful and incalculable life is
than any of us are willing to admit.  It may
be all <hi rend="italic">apologia,</hi> but it comes with the grave
air of a mind that wants us to understand just
how it all happened.  "Sister Carrie" will always
retain the fresh charm of a spontaneous
working-out of mediocre, and yet elemental
and significant, lives.  A good novelist catches
hold of the thread of human desire.  Dreiser
does this, and that is why his admirers forgive
him so many faults.</p><p>
   If you like to speculate about personal and
literary qualities that are specifically American,
Dreiser should be as interesting as any
one now writing in America.  This becomes
clearer as he writes more about his youth.  His
hopelessly unorientated, half-educated, boyhood
is so typical of the uncritical and careless
society in which wistful American talent
has had to grope.  He had to be spiritually a
self-made man, work out a philosophy of life,
discover his own sincerity.  Talent in America outside
of the ruling class flowers very
late, because it takes so long to find its bearings.
It has had almost to create its own soil,
before it could put in its roots and grow.  It
is born shivering into an inhospitable and
irrelevant group.  It has to find its own kind
of people and piece together its links of
comprehension.  It is a gruelling and tedious
task, but those who come through it contribute, like
Vachel Lindsay, creative work
that is both novel and indigenous.  The
process can be more easily traced in Dreiser
than in almost anybody else.  "A Hoosier
Holiday" not only traces the personal process,
but it gives the social background.  The common
life, as seen throughout the countryside,
is touched off quizzically, and yet sympathetically,
with an artist's vision.  Dreiser sees
the American masses in their commonness
and at their pleasure as brisk, rather vacuous
people, a little pathetic in their innocence of
the possibilities of life and their optimistic
trustfulness.  He sees them ruled by great
<pb/>
barons of industry, and yet unconscious of
their serfdom.  He seems to love this countryside,
and he makes you love it.</p><p>
   Dreiser loves, too, the ugly violent bursts
of American industry,&mdash;the flaming steel-mills
and gaunt lakesides.  "The Titan" and "The
Financier" are unattractive novels, but they
are human documents of the brawn of a passing
American era.  Those stenographic conversations,
webs of financial intrigue, bare
bones of enterprise, insult our artistic sense.
There is too much raw beef, and yet it all
has the taste and smell of the primitive
business-jungle it deals with.  These crude and
greedy captains of finance with their wars
and their amours had to be given some kind
of literary embodiment, and Dreiser has hammered
a sort of raw epic out of their lives.
</p><p>
   It is not only his feeling for these themes
of crude power and sex and the American
common life that makes Dreiser interesting.
His emphases are those of a new America
which is latently expressive and which must
develop its art before we shall really have
become articulate.  For Dreiser is a true
hyphenate, a product of that conglomerate
Americanism that springs from other roots
than the English tradition.  Do we realize
how rare it is to find a talent that is
thoroughly American and wholly un-English?
Culturally we have somehow suppressed the
hyphenate.  Only recently has he forced his
way through the unofficial literary censorship.
The <hi rend="italic">vers-librists</hi> teem with him, but Dreiser
is almost the first to achieve a largeness of
utterance.  His outlook, it is true, flouts the
American canons of optimism and redemption,
but these were never anything but
conventions.  There stirs in Dreiser's books a new
American quality.  It is not at all German.
It is an authentic attempt to make something
artistic out of the chaotic materials that lie
around us in American life.  Dreiser interests
because we can watch him grope and feel
his clumsiness.  He has the artist's vision
without the sureness of the artist's technique.
This is one of the tragedies of America.  But
his faults are those of his material and of
uncouth bulk, and not of shoddiness.  He expresses
an America that is in process of forming.
The interest he evokes is part of the
eager interest we feel in that growth.</p>
