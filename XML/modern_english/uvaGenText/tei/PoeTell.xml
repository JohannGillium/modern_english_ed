<head>The Tell-Tale Heart</head>
<pb n="242"/>  
<p>TRUE! nervous, very, very dreadfully nervous 
I had been and am; but why WILL you say 
that I am mad? The disease had sharpened 
my senses, not destroyed, not dulled them. Above 
all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things 
in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things 
in hell. How then am I mad? Hearken! and observe 
how healthily, how calmly, I can tell you the 
whole story. 
</p><p>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered 
my brain, but, once conceived, it haunted me day 
and night. Object there was none. Passion there 
was none. I loved the old man. He had never 
wronged me. He had never given me insult. For 
his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! 
Yes, it was this! One of his eyes resembled that 
of a vulture &mdash; a pale blue eye with a film over it. 
Whenever it fell upon me my blood ran cold, and 
so by degrees, very gradually, I made up my mind 
to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself 
of the eye for ever. 
</p><p>Now this is the point. You fancy me mad. Madmen 
know nothing. But you should have seen me. 
You should have seen how wisely I proceeded &mdash; 
with what caution &mdash; with what foresight, with what 
dissimulation, I went to work! I was never kinder 
to the old man than during the whole week before 
I killed him. And every night about midnight I 
<pb n="243"/> 
turned the latch of his door and opened it oh, so 
gently! And then, when I had made an opening 
sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern all 
closed, closed so that no light shone out, and then 
I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed 
to see how cunningly I thrust it in! I moved it 
slowly, very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb 
the old man's sleep. It took me an hour to 
place my whole head within the opening so far that 
I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha! would 
a madman have been so wise as this? And then 
when my head was well in the room I undid the 
lantern cautiously &mdash; oh, so cautiously &mdash; cautiously 
(for the hinges creaked), I undid it just so much 
that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. 
And this I did for seven long nights, every night 
just at midnight, but I found the eye always closed, 
and so it was impossible to do the work, for it was 
not the old man who vexed me but his Evil Eye. 
And every morning, when the day broke, I went 
boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to 
him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring 
how he had passed the night. So you see 
he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, 
to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I 
looked in upon him while he slept. 
</p><p>Upon the eighth night I was more than usually 
cautious in opening the door. A watch's minute 
hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never 
before that night had I felt the extent of my own 
powers, of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain 
my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was 
opening the door little by little, and he not even to 
dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly 
chuckled at the idea, and perhaps he heard me, for 
he moved on the bed suddenly as if startled. Now 
you may think that I drew back &mdash; but no. His room 
was as black as pitch with the thick darkness (for 
<pb n="244"/> 
the shutters were close fastened through fear of 
robbers), and so I knew that he could not see the 
opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on 
steadily, steadily. 
</p><p>I had my head in, and was about to open the 
lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, 
and the old man sprang up in the bed, crying 
out, "Who's there?" 
</p><p>I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole 
hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime 
I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting 
up in the bed, listening; just as I have done night 
after night hearkening to the death watches in the 
wall. 
</p><p>Presently, I heard a slight groan, and I knew it 
was the groan of mortal terror. It was not a groan of 
pain or of grief &mdash; oh, no! It was the low stifled sound 
that arises from the bottom of the soul when over-charged with awe. I knew the sound well. Many 
a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, 
it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, 
with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted 
me. I say I knew it well. I knew what the old 
man felt, and pitied him although I chuckled at 
heart. I knew that he had been lying awake ever 
since the first slight noise when he had turned in 
the bed. His fears had been ever since growing 
upon him. He had been trying to fancy them 
causeless, but could not. He had been saying to 
himself, "It is nothing but the wind in the chimney, 
it is only a mouse crossing the floor," or, "It is merely 
a cricket which has made a single chirp." Yes he 
has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions; 
but he had found all in vain. ALL IN VAIN, 
because Death in approaching him had stalked with 
his black shadow before him and enveloped the 
victim. And it was the mournful influence of the 
unperceived shadow that caused him to feel, although 
<pb n="245"/> 
he neither saw nor heard, to feel the presence 
of my head within the room. 
</p><p>When I had waited a long time very patiently 
without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open 
a little &mdash; a very, very little crevice in the lantern. 
So I opened it &mdash; you cannot imagine how stealthily, 
stealthily &mdash; until at length a single dim ray like the 
thread of the spider shot out from the crevice and 
fell upon the vulture eye. 
</p><p>It was open, wide, wide open, and I grew furious 
as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness &mdash; 
all a dull blue with a hideous veil over it that 
chilled the very marrow in my bones, but I could 
see nothing else of the old man's face or person, for 
I had directed the ray as if by instinct precisely upon 
the damned spot. 
</p><p>And now have I not told you that what you mistake 
for madness is but over-acuteness of the senses? 
now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick 
sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in 
cotton. I knew that sound well too. It was the 
beating of the old man's heart. It increased my fury 
as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into 
courage. 
</p><p>But even yet I refrained and kept still. I scarcely 
breathed. I held the lantern motionless. I tried 
how steadily I could maintain the ray upon the eye. 
Meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. 
It grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder, 
every instant. The old man's terror must have 
been extreme! It grew louder, I say, louder every 
moment! &mdash; do you mark me well? I have told you 
that I am nervous: so I am. And now at the dead 
hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that 
old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to 
uncontrollable terror. Yet, for some minutes longer 
I refrained and stood still. But the beating grew 
louder, louder! I thought the heart must burst. 
<pb n="246"/> 
And now a new anxiety seized me &mdash; the sound would 
be heard by a neighbour! The old man's hour had 
come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern 
and leaped into the room. He shrieked once &mdash; once 
only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and 
pulled the heavy bed over him. I then smiled 
gaily, to find the deed so far done. But for many 
minutes the heart beat on with a muffled sound. 
This, however, did not vex me; it would not be 
heard through the wall. At length it ceased. The 
old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined 
the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed 
my hand upon the heart and held it there many 
minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone 
dead. His eye would trouble me no more. 
</p><p>If still you think me mad, you will think so no 
longer when I describe the wise precautions I took 
for the concealment of the body. The night waned, 
and I worked hastily, but in silence. 
</p><p>I took up three planks from the flooring of the 
chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. 
I then replaced the boards so cleverly so cunningly, 
that no human eye &mdash; not even his &mdash; could have detected 
anything wrong. There was nothing to wash 
out &mdash; no stain of any kind &mdash; no blood-spot whatever. 
I had been too wary for that. 
</p><p>When I had made an end of these labours, it was 
four o'clock &mdash; still dark as midnight. As the bell 
sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the 
street door. I went down to open it with a light 
heart, &mdash; for what had I now to fear? There entered 
three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect 
suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been 
heard by a neighbour during the night; suspicion 
of foul play had been aroused; information had been 
lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) 
had been deputed to search the premises. 
</p><p>I smiled, &mdash; for what had I to fear? I bade the 
<pb n="247"/> 
gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my 
own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was 
absent in the country. I took my visitors all over 
the house. I bade them search &mdash; search well. I led 
them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his 
treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm 
of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, 
and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, 
while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect 
triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot 
beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim. 
</p><p>The officers were satisfied. My MANNER had convinced 
them. I was singularly at ease. They sat 
and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of 
familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting 
pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and 
I fancied a ringing in my ears; but still they sat, 
and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: 
I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: 
but it continued and gained definitiveness &mdash; until, 
at length, I found that the noise was NOT within my 
ears. 
</p><p>No doubt I now grew VERY pale; but I talked 
more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet 
the sound increased &mdash; and what could I do? It was 
A LOW, DULL, QUICK SOUND &mdash; MUCH SUCH A SOUND AS A 
WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON. I gasped for 
breath, and yet the officers heard it not. I talked 
more quickly, more vehemently but the noise 
steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, 
in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but 
the noise steadily increased. Why WOULD  they not 
be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy 
strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of 
the men, but the noise steadily increased. O God! 
what COULD I do? I foamed &mdash; I raved &mdash; I swore! I 
swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and 
grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over 
<pb n="248"/> 
all and continually increased. It grew louder &mdash; 
louder &mdash; louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, 
and smiled. Was it possible they heard 
not? Almighty God! &mdash; no, no? They heard! &mdash; 
they suspected! &mdash; they KNEW! &mdash; they were making 
a mockery of my horror! &mdash; this I thought, and this 
I think. But anything was better than this agony! 
Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I 
could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I 
felt that I must scream or die! &mdash; and now &mdash; again 
&mdash; hark! louder! louder! louder! LOUDER! &mdash; 
</p><p>"Villains!" I shrieked, "dissemble no more! I 
admit the deed! &mdash; tear up the planks! &mdash; here, here! 
&mdash; it is the beating of his hideous heart!"
