<head>MANY SWANS<lb/> 
Sun Myth of the North American Indians<lb/> 
BY AMY LOWELL</head> 
 
 
 
<p>When the Goose Moon rose and walked upon a pale sky, and water made a 
     noise once more beneath the ice on the river, his heart was sick 
     with longing for the great good of the sun. One Winter again had 
     passed, one Winter like the last. A long sea with waves biting each 
     other under grey clouds, a shroud of snow from ocean to forest, 
     snow mumbling stories of bones and driftwood beyond his red fire. 
     He desired space, light; he cried to himself about himself, he made 
     songs of sorrow and wept in the corner of his house.  He gave his 
     children toys to keep them away from him. His eyes were dim 
     following the thin sun. He said to his wife: "I want that sun. Some 
     day I shall go to see it." And she said: "Peace, be still. You will 
     wake the children." 
 
</p><p>So he waited, and the Whirlwind Moon came, a crescent&mdash;mounted, 
     and marched down beyond the morning, and was gone. Then the 
     Extreme Cold Moon came and shone, it mounted, moved night by 
     night into morning and faded through day to darkness. He 
     watched the Old Moon pass, he saw the Eagle Moon come and go. 
     Slowly the moons wound across the snow, and many nights he 
     could not see them, he could only hear the waves raving foam 
     and fury until dawn. 
 
</p><p>Now the Goose Moon told him things, but his blood lay sluggish within 
     him until the moon stood full and apart in the sky. His wife 
	asked why he was silent. "I have wept my eyes dry," he answered.  
     "Give me my cedar bow and my two-winged arrows 
     with the copper points. I will go into the forest and kill a moose, 
     and bring fresh meat for the children." 
 
</p><p>All day he stalked the forest. He saw the marks of bears' claws on the 
 
   <pb n="251"/>        
 
	trees. He saw the wide tracks of a lynx, and the little slot-slot-of 
     a jumping rabbit, but nothing came along. Then he made a melancholy  
     song for himself: "My name is Many Swans, but I have 
     seen neither sparrow nor rabbit, neither duck nor crane. I will 
     go home and sit by the fire like a woman and spin cedar bark for 
     fish-lines." 
 
</p><p>Then silver rain ran upon him through the branches from the moon, 
     and he stepped upon open grass and laughed at the touch of it 
     under his foot." I will shoot the moon," he thought, "and cut 
     it into cakes for the children." 
</p><p>He laid an arrow on his bow and shot, and the copper tip made it shine 
     like a star flying. He watched to see it fall, but it did not. He 
     shot again, and his arrow was a bright star until he lost it in the 
     brilliance of the moon. Soon he had shot all his arrows, and he 
     stood gaping up at the moonshine wishing he had not lost them. 
</p><p>Then Many Swans laughed again because his feet touched grass, not 
     snow. And he gathered twigs and stuck them in his hair, and saw 
     his shadow like a tree walking there. But something tapped the 
     twigs, he stood tangled in something. With his hand he felt it, 
     it was the feather head of an arrow. It dangled from the sky, and 
     the copper tip jangled upon wood and twinkled brightly. This&mdash;that&mdash;and  
     other twinkles, pricking against the soft flow of the 
     moon, and the wind crooned in the arrow-feathers and tinkled the 
     bushes in his hair. 
 
</p><p>Many Swans laid his hand on the arrow and began to climb&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash; a  
     long time. The earth lay beneath him wide and blue, he climbed 
     through white moonlight and purple air until he fell asleep from 
     weariness. 
</p><p>Sunlight struck sidewise on a chain of arrows, below were cold clouds 
     above a sky blooming like an open flower and he aiming to the 
     heart of it. Many  Swans saw that up was far, and down was also 
     far, but he cried to himself that he had begun his journey to the 
     sun. Then he pulled a bush from his hair, and the twigs had 
     leaved and fruited, and there were salmon-berries dancing beneath 
     the leaves. "My father, the sun, is good," said Many Swans, and 
     he eat the berries and went on climbing the arrows into the heart 
     of the sky. 
</p><p>He climbed till the sun set and the moon rose, and at midmost moon he 
     fell asleep to the sweeping of the arrow-ladder like a cradle in 
     the wind. 
</p><p>When dawn struck gold across the ladder, he awoke. "It is Summer," 
     said Many Swans, "I cannot go back, it must be more days down 
     than I have travelled. I should be ashamed to see my children, for 
     I have no meat for them."Then he remembered the bushes, and 
     pulled another from his hair, and there were blue huckleberries 
     shining like polished wood in the midst of leaves. "The sun 
     weaves the seasons," thought Many Swans, "I have been under 
     and over the warp of the world, now I am above the world," 
     and he went on climbing into the white heart of the sky. 
</p><p>Another night and day he climbed, and he eat red huckleberries from 
     his last bush, and went on&mdash;up and up&mdash;his feet scratching on 
   <pb n="252"/>       the ladder with a great noise because of the hush all round him. 
     When he reached an edge he stepped over it carefully, for edges 
     are thin and he did not wish to fall. He found a tall pine-tree by 
     a pond. "Beyond can wait," reasoned Many Swans, "this is 
     surely a far country." And he lay down to sleep under the pine-tree,  
     and it was the fourth sleep he had had since he went hunting 
     moose to bring meat to his family. 
 
</p><p>The shadow crept away from him, and the sun came and sat upon his 
     eyelids, so that by and by he opened them and rubbed his eyes 
     because a woman stared at him, and she was beautiful as a salmon 
     leaping in Spring. Her skirt was woven of red and white cedar 
     bark, she had carved silver bracelets and copper bracelets set with 
     haliotis shell, and earrings of sharks' teeth. She sparkled like 
     a river salmon, and her smile was water tipping to a light South 
     breeze. She pleased the heart of Many Swans so that fear was not 
     in him, only longing to take her for himself as a man does a 
     woman, and he asked her name. "Grass-Bush-and-Blossom is my 
     name," she answered, "I am come after you. My grandmother 
     has sent me to bring you to her house." "And who is your grand-mother?"  
     asked Many Swans. But the girl shook her head, and 
     took a pinch of earth from the ground and threw it toward the 
     sun. "She has many names. The grass knows her, and the trees, 
     and the fishes in the sea. I call her 'grandmother,' but they speak 
     of her as 'The-One-Who-Walks-All-Over-the-Sky.'" Many 
     Swans marvelled and said nothing, for things are different in a 
     far country. 
</p><p>They walked together, and the man hungered for the woman and could 
     not wait. But he said no word, and he eat up her beauty as though 
     it were a ripe foam-berry and still went fasting until his knees 
     trembled, and his heart was like hot dust, and his hands ached to 
     thrust upon her and turn her toward him. So they went, and 
     Many Swans forgot his wife and children and the earth hanging 
     below the sharp edge of the sky. 
                      </p><p> *       *       * 
</p><p>The South wind sat on a rock and never ceased to blow, locking the 
     branches of the trees together; a flock of swans rose out of the 
     South-East, one and seven, making strange, changing lines across 
     a smooth sky. Wild flax-blossoms ran blue over the bases of 
     black and red totem poles. The colours were strong as blood and 
     death, they rattled like painted drums against the eyesight. 
     "Many Swans!" said the girl and smiled. "Blood and death," 
     drummed the totem poles. "Alas!" nodded the flax. The man 
     heeded nothing but the woman and the soles of his feet beating on 
     new ground. 
</p><p>The houses were carved with the figures of the Spring Salmon. They 
     were carved in the form of a rainbow. Hooked noses stood out 
     above doorways; crooked wooden men crouched, frog-shaped, 
     gazing under low eaves. It was a beautiful town, ringing with 
     colours, singing brightly, terribly, in the smooth light. All the 
     way was sombre and gay, and the man walked and said nothing. 
   <pb n="253"/>  They came to a house painted black and carved with stars. In the 
     centre was a round moon with a door in it. So they entered and 
     sat beside the fire, and the woman gave the man fish-roes and 
     gooseberries, but his desire burnt him and he could not eat. 
</p><p>Grass-Bush-and-Blossom saw his trouble, and she led him to a corner 
     and showed him many things. There were willow arrows and 
     quivers for them. There were mountain-goat blankets and painted 
     blankets of two elkskins, there were buffalo skins, and dressed 
     buckskins, and deerskins with young, soft hair. But Many Swans 
     cared for nothing but the swing of the woman's bark skirt, and the 
     sting of her loveliness which gave him no peace. 
</p><p>Grass-Bush-and-Blossom led him to another corner, and showed him 
     crest helmets, and wooden armour; she showed him coppers like 
     red rhododendron blooms, and plumes of eagles' wings. She gave 
     him clubs of whalebone to handle, and cedar trumpets which blow 
     a sound cool and sweet as the noise of bees. But Many Swans 
     found no ease in looking save at her arms between the bracelets, 
     and his trouble grew and pressed upon him until he felt strangled. 
</p><p>She led him farther and showed him a canoe painted silver and vermilion  
     with white figures of fish upon it, and the gunwales fore 
     and aft were set with the teeth of the sea-otter. She lifted out 
     the paddles, the blades were shaped like hearts and striped with 
     fire-hues. She said, "Choose. These are mine and my grand-mother's.  
     Take what you will." But Many Swans was filled 
     with the glory of her standing as a young tree about to blossom, 
     and he took her and felt her sway and: fold about him with the 
     tightness of new leaves. "This"&mdash;said Many Swans, "this&mdash;for 
     am I not a man!" So they abode and the day ran gently past 
     them, slipping as river water, and evening came, and someone 
     entered, darkening the door. 
</p><p>Then Grass-Bush-and-Blossom wrapped her cedar-bark skirt about 
     her and sprang up, and her silver and copper ornaments rang 
     sweetly with her moving. The-One-Who-Walks-All-Over-the-Sky  
     looked at Many Swans. "You have not waited," she said. 
     "Alas! It is an evil beginning. My son, my son, I wished to 
     love you." But he was glad and thought: "It is a querulous old 
     woman, I shall heed her no more than the snapping of a fire of 
     dead twigs." 
</p><p>The old woman went behind the door and hung up something. It 
     pleased him. It was shining. When he woke in the night, he saw 
     it in the glow of the fire. He liked it, and he liked the skins he 
     lay on and the woman who lay with him. He thought only of 
     these things. 
</p><p>In the morning, the old woman unhooked the shining object and went 
     out, and he turned about to his wife and said sharp, glad words to 
     her and she to him, and the sun shone into the house until evening, 
     and in the night again he was happy, because of the thing that 
     glittered and flashed and moved to and fro, clashing softly on 
     the wall. 
</p><p>The days were many. He did not count them. Every morning the old 
     woman took out the shining thing, and every evening she brought 
   <pb n="254"/>   
     it home, and all night it shone and cried "Ching-a-ling" as it 
     dangled against the wall. 
 
</p><p>Moons and moons went by, no doubt. Many Swans did not reckon 
     them out. Was there an earth? Was there a sky? He remembered  
     nothing. He did not try. And then one day, wandering 
     along the street of carved houses, he heard a song. He heard the 
     beat of rattles and drums, and the shrill humming of trumpets 
     blown to a broken rhythm:</p> 
<lg type="poem"> 
         <l> "Haioo'a! Haioo! 
         </l><l> Many salmon are coming ashore, 
         </l><l	> They are coming ashore to you, the post of our heaven, 
         </l><l> They are dancing from the salmon's country to the shore. 
         </l><l> I come to dance before you at the right-hand side of the world, 
               overtowering, outshining, surpassing all. I, the Salmon! 
          </l><l>Haioo'a! Haioo!"</l> 
</lg> 
<p>And the drums rumbled like the first thunder of a year, and the rattles 
     pattered like rain on flower petals, and the trumpets hummed as 
     wind hums in round-leafed trees; and people ran, jumping, out of 
     the Spring Salmon house and leapt to the edge of the sky and 
     disappeared, falling quickly, calling the song to one another as 
     they fell so that the sound of it continued rising up for a long 
     time. 

</p><p>Many Swans listened, and he recollected that when the Spring
     Salmon jump, the children say: "Ayuu! Do it again!" He thought of
     his children and his wife whom he had left on the earth, and
     wondered who had brought them meat, who had caught fish for them,
     and he was sad at his thoughts and wept, saying: "I want to shoot
     birds for my children. I want to spear trout for my children."  So
     he went back to his house, and his feet dragged behind him like
     nets drawn across sand.

</p><p>He lay down upon his bed and grieved, because he had no children in 
     the sky, and because the wife of his youth was lost to him. He 
     would not eat, but lay with his head covered and made no sound. 
</p><p>Then Grass-Bush-and-Blossom asked him: "Why do you grieve?" 
     But he was silent. And again she said: "Why do you grieve?" But 
     he answered nothing. And she asked him many times, until at last 
     he told her of his children, of his other wife whom he had left, 
     and she was pitiful because she loved him. 
</p><p>When the old woman came, she also said: "What ails your husband 
     that he lies there saying nothing?" And Grass-Bush-and-Blossom 
     answered: "He is homesick. We must let him depart." 
</p><p>Many Swans heard what she said, and he got up and made himself 
     ready. Now the old woman looked sadly at him. "My son," 
     she said, "I told you it was a bad beginning. But I wish to love 
     you. Choose among these things what you will have and return 
     to your people." 
</p><p>Many Swans pointed to the shining thing behind the door and said, 
     "I will have that." But the old woman would not give it to him. 
     She offered him spears of bone, and yew bows, and arrows winged 
     with ducks' feathers. But he would not have them. She offered 
     him strings of blue and white shells, and a copper canoe with a 
   <pb n="255"/>       stern-board of copper and a copper bailer. He would not take 
     them. He wanted the thing that glittered and cried "Ching-a-ling"  
     as it dangled against the wall. She offered him all that was 
     in the house. But he liked that great thing that was shining there. 
     When that thing turned round it was shining so that one had to 
     close one's eyes. He said: "That only will I have." Then she 
     gave it to him saying: "You wanted it. I wished to love you, 
     and I do love you." She hung it on him. "Now go home." 
</p><p>Many Swans ran swiftly, he ran to  the edge of the sky, there he found 
     the land of the rainbow. He put his foot on it and went down, 
     and he felt strong and able to do anything. He forgot the sky 
     and thought only of the earth. 
 
</p><p>Many Swans made a song as he went down the rainbow ladder. He 
     sang with a loud voice:</p> 
<lg type="poem"> 
          <l>"I will go and tear to pieces Mount Stevens, I will use it for stones 
               for my fire. 
          </l><l>I will go and break Mount Qa-tsta-is, I will use it for stones for 
               my fire.</l> 
</lg> 
<p>All day and all night he went down, and he was so strong he did not 
     need to sleep. The next day he made a new song. He shouted 
     it with a great noise:</p> 
<lg type="poem"> 
          <l>"I am going all round the world, 
          </l><l>I am at the centre of the world, 
          </l><l>I am the post of the world, 
          </l><l>On account of what I am carrying in my hand."</l> 
</lg> 
<p>This pleased him, and he sang it all day and was not tired at all. 
</p><p>Four nights and days he was going down the ladder, and every day he 
     made a song, and the last was the best. This was it!</p> 
<lg type="poem"> 
        <l>"Oh wonder! He is making a turmoil on the earth. 
        </l><l>Oh wonder! He makes the noise of falling objects on the earth. 
        </l><l>Oh wonder! He makes the noise of breaking objects on the earth."</l> 
</lg> 
<p>He did not mean this at all, but it was a good song. That is the way 
     with people who think themselves clever. Many Swans sang this 
     song a great many times, and on the fourth day, when the dawn 
     was red, he touched the earth and walked off upon it. 
                       </p><p>*       *       * 
</p><p>When Many Swans arrived on the earth, he was not very near his 
     village. He stood beneath a sea-cliff, and the rocks of the cliff 
     were sprinkled with scarlet moss as it might have been a fall of 
     red snow, and lilac moss shouldered between boulders of pink 
     granite. Far out, the sea sparkled all colours like an abalone 
     shell, and red fish sprang from it&mdash;one and another, over its surface.  
     As he gazed, a shadow slipped upon the water, and, looking 
     up, he saw a raven flying and overturning as it flew. Red fish, 
     black raven&mdash;blood and death&mdash;but Many Swans called "Haioho-ho!"  
     and danced a long time on the sea-sand because he felt happy 
     in his heart. 
</p><p>He heard a robin singing, and as it sang he walked along the shore 
     and counted his fingers for the headlands he must pass to reach 
     home. He saw the canoes come out to fish, he said the names of 
   <pb n="256"/>       his friends who should be in them. He thought of his house and 
     the hearth strewn with white shells and sand. When the canoes 
     of twelve rowers passed, he tried to signal them, but they went by 
     too far from land. The way seemed short, for all day he told 
     himself stories of what people would say to him. "I shall be 
     famous, my fame will reach to the ends of the world. People 
     will try to imitate me. Every one will desire to possess my power." 
     So Many Swans said foolish things to himself, and the day seemed 
     short until the evening when he came in sight of his village. 
 
</p><p>At the dusky time of night, he came to it, and he heard singing, so he 
     knew his people were having a festival. He could hear the dance-sticks  
     clattering on the cedar boards and the moon-rattles whirling, 
     and he could see the smoke curling out of the smoke-holes. Then 
     he shouted very much and ran fast, but as he ran, the thing which 
     he carried in his hands shook and cried: "We shall strike your 
     town." Then Many Swans went mad; he turned, swirling like a 
     great cloud, he rose as a pillar of smoke and bent in the wind as 
     smoke bends, he streamed as bands of black smoke, and out of 
     him darted flames, red-mouthed flames, so that they scorched his 
     hair. His hands were full of blood, and he yelled "Break! Break! 
     Break! Break!" and did not know whose voice it was shouting. 
</p><p>There was a tree, and a branch standing out from it, and fire came 
     down and hung on the end of the branch. He thought it was 
     copper which swung on the tree, because it twirled and had a 
     hard edge. Then it split as though a wedge had riven it, and 
     burst into purple flame. The tree was consumed, and the fire 
     leapt laughing upon the houses and poured down through the 
     roofs upon the people. The flame-mouths stuck themselves to 
     the houses and sucked the life from all the people, the flames 
     swallowed themselves and brought forth little flames which ran 
     a thousand ways like young serpents just out of their eggs, till 
     the fire girdled the village and the water in front curdled and 
     burned like oil. 
</p><p>Then Many Swans knew what he had done, and he tried to throw 
     away his power which was killing everybody. But he could not 
     do it. The people lay there dead, and his wife and children among 
     the dead people. His heart was sick, and he cried: "The weapon 
     flew into my hands with which I am murdering," and he tried to 
     throw it away, but it stuck to his flesh. He tried to cut it apart 
     with his knife, but the blade turned and blunted. He cried 
     bitterly: "Ka! Ka! Ka! Ka!" and tried to break what he wore 
     on a stone, but it did not break. Then he cut off his hair and 
     blackened his face, and turned inland to the spaces of the forest, 
     for his heart was dead with his people. And the moon followed 
     him over the tops of the trees, but he hated the moon because it 
     reminded him of the sky. 
                       </p><p>*       *       * 
</p><p>A long time Many Swans wandered in the forest. White-headed 
     eagles flew over the trees and called down to him: "There is 
     the man who killed everybody." By night the owls hooted to 
   <pb n="257"/>       each other: "The man who sleeps has blood on him, his mouth 
     is full of blood, he let loose his power on his own people." Many 
     Swans beat upon his breast and pleaded with the owls: "You 
     with ears far apart who hear everything, you the owls, it was not 
     I who killed but this evil thing I carry and which I cannot put 
     down." But the owls laughed, shrill, mournful, broken laughs, 
     repeating the words they had said, so that Many Swans could not 
     sleep and in the morning he was so weak he shook when he 
     walked. 
</p><p>He walked among pines which flowed before him in straight, opening 
     lines like water, and the wind in the pine-branches wearied his 
     soul as he heard it all day long. At first he eat nothing, but 
     when he stumbled and fell for faintness he gathered currants and       
     partridge-berries and so made his feet carry him on. 
</p><p>He came to a wood of red firs where fire had been before him. The 
     heartwood of the firs was all burnt out, but the trees stood on 
     stilts of sapwood and mocked the man who slew with fire. 
</p><p>He passed through woods of spear-leaf trees, with sharp vines head-high  
     all about them. He thrust the thing he carried into the vines 
     and tried to let go of it, but it would not stay tangled and came 
     away in his hand. 
</p><p>He heard beavers drumming with their tails on water, and saw musk-rats  
     building burrows with the stalks of wild rice in shoal water 
     but they scattered as he came near. The little animals fled before 
     him in fear, chattering to each other. Even the bears deserted 
     the huckleberry bushes when they heard the fall of his foot, so 
     that he walked alone. Above him, the waxwings were catching 
     flies in the spruce-tops, they were happy because it was Summer 
     and warm, they were the only creatures too busy to look down 
     at the man who moved on as one who never stops, making his 
     feet go always because there was nothing else to do. 
 
</p><p>By and by the trees thinned, and Many Swans saw beyond them to a 
     country of tall grass. He rested here some time eating fox-grapes  
     and blackberries, for indeed he was almost famished, and 
     weary with the sickness of solitude. He thought of the ways of 
     men, and hungered after speech and comforting. But he saw no 
     man, and the prairie frightened him, rolling endlessly to the sky. 
</p><p>At last his blood quickened again, and the longing for people beat a 
     hard pulse in his throat so that he rose and went on, seeking 
     where he might find men. For days he sought, following the 
     trails of wild horses and buffalo, tripping among the crawling 
     pea-vines, bruised and baffled, blind with the sharp shimmer of the 
     grass. 
</p><p>Then suddenly they came, riding out of the distance on both sides of 
     him. These men wore eagle-plume bonnets, and their horses went 
     so fast he could not see their legs. They ran glittering toward 
     one another, whooping and screaming, and the horses' tails 
     streamed out behind them stiffly like bunches of bones. Each man 
     lay prone on his horse and shot arrows, hawk-feathered arrows, 
     owl-feathered arrows, and they were terrible in swiftness because 
     the feathers had not been cut or burned to make them low. 
   <pb n="258"/>  </p><p>The arrows flew across one another like a swarm of grasshoppers 
     leaping, and the men foamed forward as waves foam at a double 
     tide. 
</p><p>They came near, bright men, fine as whips, striding lithe cat horses. 
     One rode a spotted horse, and on his head was an upright plume 
     of the tail-feathers of the black eagle. One rode a buckskin 
     horse, long-winded and chary as a panther. One rode a sorrel 
     horse painted with zigzag lightnings. One rode a clay-coloured 
     horse, and the figure of a kingfisher was stamped in blue on its 
     shoulder. Wildcat running horses, and their hoofs rang like 
     thunder-drums on the ground, and the men yelled with brass 
     voices:</p> 
<lg type="poem">

</lg> 
<p>Many Swans lay in a buffalo wallow and hid, and a white fog slid 
     down from the North and covered the prairie. For a little time he 
     heard the war-whoops and the pit-pit of hitting arrows, and then 
     he heard nothing, and he lay beneath the cold fog hurting his ears 
     with listening. When the sky was red in the evening and the fog 
     was lifted, he shifted himself and looked above the grass. "Alas!" 
     Alas!" wept Many Swans, "the teeth of their arrows were like 
     dogs' teeth. They have devoured their enemies." For nobody was 
     there, but the arrows were sticking up straight in the ground. 
     Then Many Swans went a long way round that place for he thought 
     that the stomachs of the arrows must be full of blood. And so he 
     went on alone over the prairie, and his heart was black with what 
     he had seen. 
                       </p><p>*       *       * 
</p><p>A stream flowed in a sunwise turn across the prairie, and the name 
     of the stream was "Burnt Water," because it tasted dark like 
     smoke. The prairie ran out tongues of raw colors&mdash;blue of camass,  
     red of geranium, yellow of parsley&mdash;at the young green grass. 
     The prairie flung up its larks on a string of sunshine, it lay like a      catching-sheet beneath the black breasts balancing down on a wind, 
     calling "See it! See it! See it!" in little round voices.</p> 
<lg type="poem">

                      <p> *       *       * 
</p><p>Now when he heard the barking of dogs, and saw the bundles of the 
     dead lashed to the cottonwood trees, Many Swans knew that he 
     was near a village. He stood still, for he dared not go on because  
     of the thing which he had with him. He said to himself, 
     "My mind is not strong enough to manage it. My mind is afraid 
     of it." But he longed to speak with men, and so he crept a little  
     nearer until he could see the painted tepees standing in the edge 
     of the sunshine, and smell the smoke of dried sweet grass. Many 
     Swans heard the tinkling of small bells from the buffalo tails 
     hung on the tepees, he saw the lodge ears move gently in the 
     breeze. He heard talk, the voices of men, and he cried aloud and 
     wept, holding his hands out toward the village. 
</p><p>Then the thing which he was carrying shook, and said: "We shall 
     strike that town." Many Swans heard it, and he tried to keep 
     quiet. He tried to throw the thing down, but his hands closed. 
     He could not keep his mind, and his senses flew away so that he 
     was crazy. He heard a great voice shouting: "Break! Break! 
     Break! Break!" but he did not know that it was his own voice. 
</p><p>Back over the prairie sprang up a round cloud, and fire rose out of the 
     heart of the grass. The reds and yellows of the flowers exploded 
     into flame, showers of sparks rattled on the metal sky, which 
     turned purple and hurtled itself down upon the earth. Winds 
     charged the fire, lashing it with long thongs of green lightning, 
     herding the flames over the high grass; and the fire screamed and 
     danced and blew blood whistles, and the scarlet feet of the fire 
     clinked a tune of ghost-bells on the shells of the dry cane brakes. 
     Animals ran&mdash;ran&mdash;ran&mdash;and were overtaken, shaken grass 
     glittered up with a roar and spilled its birds like burnt paper 
     into the red air. The eagle's wing melted where it flew, the hills 
     of the prairie grew mountain-high, amazed with light, and were 
     obscured. The people in the village ran&mdash;ran&mdash;and the fire shot 
     them down with its red and gold arrows and whirled on, crumpling 
     the tepees so that the skins of them popped like corn. Then the 
     bodies of the dead in the trees took fire with a hard smoke, and 
     the burning of the cottonwoods choked Many Swans as he fled. 
     His nostrils smelt the dead, and he was very sick and could not 
     move. Then the fire made a ring round him, and he stood in the 
     midst by the Burnt River and wrung his hands until the skin tore. 
     He took the thing he wore and tried to strip it off in the fork of 
     a tree, but it did not come off at all. He cried: "Ka! Ka! Ka! 
     Ka!" and leapt into the river and tried to drown the thing, but 
     when he rose it rose with him and came out of the water gleaming 
     so that its wake rippled red and silver a long way down the 
     stream. 
</p><p>Then Many Swans lamented bitterly and cried: "The thing I wanted 
     is bad," but he had the thing and he could not part from it. He 
     rolled in the stones and the bushes to scrape it off, but it clung 
   <pb n="260"/>  to him and grew in his flesh like hair. Therefore Many Swans 
     dragged himself up to go on, although the heat of the burnt grass 
     scorched his feet and everything was dead about him. He heard 
     nothing, for there was nobody to mock any more. 
                       </p><p>*       *       * 
</p><p>Mist rises along the river bottoms, and ghost-voices hiss an old death-song  
     to a false, faint tune. The branches of willows beat on the 
     moon, pound, pound, with a thin, far sound, shaking and shrilling 
     the wonder tale, the thunder tale, of a nation's killing:</p>

</lg> 
                      <p>*       *       * 
</p><p>Now Many Swans walked over cinders, and there was no sprig or 
     root that the fire had left. Therefore he grew weaker day by 
     day, and at night he lay awake tortured for food, and he prayed 
     to the Earth, saying: "Mother Earth have pity on me and give 
     me to eat," but the ears of the Earth were stopped with cinders. 
     Then, after five sleeps, suddenly before him grew a bush of 
     service-berries which the fire had not taken. Many Swans 
     gathered the berries and appeased his hunger. He said: "The 
     berries that grow are blessed, for now I shall live." Yet he knew 
     that he did not want to live, only his hunger raged fiercely within 
     him and he could not stand against it. He took cinders and 
     powdered them, and mixed them with river water, and made his 
     body black, and so he set his back to the river and his face to the 
     mountains and journeyed on. 
 
</p><p>Up and over the Backbone-of-the-World went Many Swans. Above 
     the peaks of solitude hang the winds of all directions, and because 
   <pb n="261"/>       there are a multitude of winds they can hold fire and turn it. 
     Therefore Many Swans felt leaves once more about his face, and 
     the place was kind to his eyes with laurels, and quaking aspens, 
     and honeysuckle trees. All the bushes and flowers were talking, 
     but it was not about Many Swans. The oaks boasted of their 
     iron sinews: "Fire is a plaything, a ball to be tossed and flung 
     away," and they rustled their leaves and struck their roots farther 
     into the moist soil. The red firs stirred at the challenge: "In 
     Winter your leaves are dry," they called to the oaks, "then the 
     fire-bear can eat you. But our leaves are never dry. They are 
     whips to sting the lips of all fires." But the cedars and the pines 
     said nothing, for they knew that nobody would believe them if 
     they spoke. 
</p><p>Now when the hemlocks ran away from him, and the cold rocks 
     glittered with snow, Many Swans knew that he stood at the Peak 
     of the World, and again the longing for men came upon him. 
     "I will descend into a new country," he said. "I will be very 
     careful not to swing the sacred implement, truly it kills people 
     so that they have no time to escape." He thought he could do it, 
     he believed himself, and he knew no rest because of his quest for 
     men. 
 
</p><p>There was no way to find, but Many Swans went down through the 
     firs, and the yellow pines, and the maples, to a white plain which 
     ran right, and left, and forward, with only a steep sky stopping it 
     very far off; and the sun on the plain was like molten lead 
     pressing him down and his tongue rattled with thirst. So he 
     lifted himself against the weight of the sun and wished a great 
     wish for men and went on with his desire sobbing in his heart. 
</p><p>To the North was sand, to the East was sand, to the West was sand, 
     to the South was sand, and standing up out of the sand the great 
     flutes of the cactus-trees beckoned him, and flung their flowers 
     out to tempt him&mdash;their wax-white flowers, their magenta flowers, 
     their golden-yellow flowers perking through a glass-glitter of 
     spines; all along the ridges of the desert they called to him and 
     he knew not which way to turn. He asked a humming-bird in a 
     scarlet trumpet-flower, and the humming-bird answered: "Across 
     the sunset to the Red Hills." The sun rose and set three times, 
     and again he knew not where to go, so he asked a gilded flicker 
     who was clicking in a giant cactus. And the flicker told him: 
     "Across the sunset to the Red Hills." But when, after many 
     days, he saw no hills, he thought "The birds deceived me," and 
     he asked a desert lily: "Where shall I find men?" And the 
     lily opened her green-and-blue-veined blossom, and discovered 
     the pure whiteness of her heart. "Across the desert to the Red 
     Hills," she told him, and he believed her, and, on the ninth 
     morning after, he saw the hills, and they were heliotrope and 
     salmon, and as the sun lifted, they were red, and when the sun 
     was in the top of the sky, they were blood scarlet. Then Many 
     Swans lay and slept, for he did not wish to reach the hills at 
     nightfall lest the people should take him for an enemy and kill 
     him. 
                 </p><p>*         *             * 
   <pb n="262"/>  </p><p>In the morning, Many Swans got up and made haste forward to the 
     hills, and soon he was among cornfields, and the rows of the 
     cornfields were newly plowed and from them there came a sound 
     of singing. Then Many Swans felt the fear come upon him 
     because of the thing he loathed and yet carried, and he thought: 
     "If it should kill these people!" The music of the song was so 
     beautiful that he shed tears, but his fears overcame his longing, 
     for already he loved these people who sang in cornfields at dawn. 
     Many Swans hid in a tuft of mesquite bushes and listened, and 
     the words the people were singing were these, but the tune was 
     like a sun wind in the tree-of-green-sticks:</p>

<p>When the song was finished, Many Swans knew that he must not 
     hurt this people. He swore, and even upon the sacred and terrible 
     thing itself, to make them his safe keeping. Therefore when they 
     returned up the trail to the Mesa, he wandered in the desert 
     below among yellow rabbit-grass and grey iceplants, and visited 
     the springs, and the shrines full of prayer-sticks, and his heart 
     distracted him with love so that he could not stay still. 
</p><p>That night he heard an elf owl calling from a pinyon-tree, and he 
     went to the owl and sought to know the name of this people who 
     sang in the fields at dawn. The owl answered: "Do not disturb 
     me, I am singing a love-song. Who are you that you do not 
     know that this is the land of Tusayan." And Many Swans considered  
     in himself: "Truly I have come a long way." 
 
</p><p>Four moons Many Swans abode on the plain, eating mesquite pods 
     and old dried nopals, but he kept away from the Mesa lest the 
     thing he had with him should be beyond his strength to hold.

<p>They dare, the men of Tusayan. With their eagle-whips they stroke

     in the rattlers&mdash;Tigers, Diamonds, Sidewinders, drop in Bull

     basket on the wall, he must not see all these Rattlesnakes, he 
     would die of an apoplexy. 
</p><p>They have hunted them toward the four directions. Toward the 
     yellow North, the blue West, the red South, the white East. Now 
     they sit by the sand altar and smoke, chanting of the clouds and 
     the four-coloured lightning-snakes who bring rain. They have 
     made green prayer-sticks with black points and left them at the 
     shrines to tell the snake people that their festival is here. Bang!

     Twixt this side, twixt that side, twixt toes and twixt ankles, go 
     the snakes a smooth way, and the priests coax them with their 
     eagle-feather whips and turn them always backward. Rattle&mdash;rattle&mdash;rattle&mdash;snake-tails  
     threshing a hot air. Whizz! Clatter! 
     Clap! Clap! Corn-gourds shaking in hard hands. A band of 
     light down the ladder, cutting upon a mad darkness. 
 
</p><p>Cottonwood kisi flickering in a breeze, little sprigs of cotton-leaves 
     clapping hands at Hopi people, crowds of Hopi people waiting in 
     the Plaza to see a monstrous thing. Houses make a shadow, 
     desert is in sunshine, priests step out of kiva. 
</p><p>Antelope priests in front of the kisi, making slow leg-motions to a 
     slow time. Turtle-shell knee-rattles spill a double rhythm, arms 
     shake gourd-rattles, goat-toes; necklaces&mdash;turquoise and sea-shell&mdash;swing 
     a round of clashing. Striped lightning antelopes waiting 
     for the Snake Priests. Red-kilted Snake Priests facing them, 
     going forward and back, coming back and over, waving the snake-whips,  
     chanting a hundred ask-songs. Go on, go back&mdash;white&mdash;black&mdash;red blood-feather,  
     white breath-feather, little cotton-leaf 
     hands clap&mdash;clap&mdash; He is at the flap of the kisi, they have given 
     him a spotted rattlesnake. Put him in the mouth, kiss the Snake 
     Brother, fondle him with the tongue. 
</p><p>Tripping on a quick tune, they trot round the square. Rattle&mdash;rattle&mdash;goat-toes,  
     turtle-shells, snake-tails. Hiss oily snake-mouths, 
     drip wide priest-mouths over the snake-skins, wet slimy snake-skins.  
     "Aye-ya-ha! Ay-ye-he! Ha-ha-wa-ha! Oway-ha!" 
     The red snake-whips tremble and purr. Blur, Plaza, with running 
     priests, with streaks of snake-bodies. The Rain-Mother's children 
     are being honoured. They must travel before the setting of the 
     sun. 
                       </p><p>*       *       * 
</p><p>When the town was on a roar with dancing, Many Swans heard it 
     far down in the plain, and he could not contain his hunger for his 
     own kind. He felt very strong because the cool of sundown was 
     spreading over the desert. He said, "I need fear nothing. My 
     arms are grown tough in this place, my hands are hard as a sheep's 
     skull. I can surely control this thing," and he set off up the 
     path to ease his sight only, for he had sworn not to discover 
     himself to the people. But when he turned the last point in 
     the road, the thing in his hands shook, and said: "We shall 
     strike that town." 
</p><p>Many Swans was strong, he turned and ran down the Mesa, but, as 
     he was running, a priest passed him carrying a handful of snakes 
     home. As the priest went by him, the thing in Many Swan's 
     hand leapt up, and it was the King Snake. It was all ringed with 
     red and yellow and black flames. It hissed, and looped, and 
     darted its head at the priest and killed him. Now when the priest 
     was dead, all the snakes he was holding burst up with a great 
     noise and went every which way, twixt this side, twixt that side, 
     twixt upwards, twixt downwards, twixt rock-stone and bunch-grass. 
   <pb n="266"/>   
 
     And they were little slipping flames of hot fire. They 
     went up the hill in fourteen red and black strings, and they were 
     the strings of blood and death. The snakes went up a swift, 
     smooth way and Many Swans went up with them, for he was 
     mad. He beat his hands together to make a drum, and shouted 
     "Break! Break! Break! Break!" And he thought it was the 
     priests above singing a new song. 
</p><p>Many Swans reached the town, but the fire-snakes were running down 
     all the streets. They struck the people so that they died, and the 
     bodies took fire and were consumed. The house windows were 
     hung with snakes who were caught by their tails and swung down 
     vomiting golden stars into the rain-gutters. In one of the gutters 
     was a blue salvia plant, and, as Many Swans passed, it nodded 
     and said "Alas! Alas!" It reminded Many Swans of the flax-flowers  
     in the sky, and his senses came back to him and he tore 
     his clothes and his hair and cried "Ka! Ka! Ka! Ka!" a great 
     many times. Then he beat himself on the sharp rocks and tried 
     to crush the thing he had, but he could not; he tried to split it, 
     but it did not split. 
</p><p>Many Swans saw that he was alone in the world. He lifted his eyes 
     to the thing and cursed it, then he ran to hurl himself over the 
     cliff. Now a boulder curled into the path and, as he turned its 
     edge, The-One-Who-Walks-All-Over-the-Sky stood before him. 
     Her eyes were moons for sadness, and her voice was like the 
     coiling of the sea. She said to him: "I tried to love you; I 
     tried to be kind to your people; why do you cry? You wished for 
     it." She took it off him and left him. 
</p><p>Many Swans looked at the desert. He looked at the dead town. He 
     wept.</p>
