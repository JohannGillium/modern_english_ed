<row><cell>CHAPTER ONE:  THE ARGUMENT</cell><cell>17</cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER TWO</cell><cell>27</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic"> The First Question, Proposed by Philocpo. A young woman, asked
   to show which of two lovers she loves the more, each of whom
   claims to be the favoured one, places on the head of one her
   own garland, and taking from the other that which he wears,
   wears it herself. To which did she show the more favour.</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER THREE</cell><cell>33</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Second Question, proposed by Parmenio.  A young
   gentleman in love with a young maiden takes as a go-between an
   old, wrinkled beggar-woman. She contrives to bring him to the
   maiden but all are taken together by the brothers of the maid,
   who condemn the young gentleman to stay both with their sister
   and the old woman each for a year and to have converse
   precisely alike with each.  Only he may choose which he will take
   first and which last. Then which should he have taken for the
   first year?</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER FOUR</cell><cell>42</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Third Question, proposed by a young gentlewoman.  To
   which of three aspirants should a lady give her preference, to
   him who excels in valour, or to him who is most courteous and
   liberal, or to him who is wisest?</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER FIVE</cell><cell>48</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Fourth Question, proposed by Menedon.  A story in which
   the question has to be resolved which of three persons, the
   husband, the lover or the magician has behaved most
   generously.</hi></cell></row>

<pb n="11"/>

<row><cell>CHAPTER SIX</cell><cell>68</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Fifth Question, Proposed by Clonico.  Which is the more
    unhappy, a lover who cannot obtain the favour of his mistress,
    or he who having obtained it has reason for
jealousy.</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER SEVEN</cell><cell>76</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The  Sixth Question, proposed by a young gentlewoman.  Two
    maidens in love with the same youth wish to induce him to
    choose between them.  Agreed on this, one runs to him, embraces
    and kisses him; the other cannot but remains apart all shy and
    shameful.  Which loved him better and more deserved his
    love?</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER EIGHT</cell><cell>83</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Seventh Question, proposed by Caleone.  Is love a good or
    an evil? It is in this Question that Galeon, or, as the better
    reading is, Caleon, in a charming ballad, explains the sense of
    the name Fiammetta.</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER NINE</cell><cell>94</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Eighth Question, proposed by a young gentlewoman named
    Paola.  Of two women whom he likes equally, ought a young
    man to prefer her who is superior to him by noble birth and
    parentage and riches, or her who is inferior to him in all these
    things?  Fiammeta, who answers this question by saying that
    a young man should prefer her who is superior in birth and
    station, was of course herself in this position in regard to
    Boccaccio.</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER TEN</cell><cell>99</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Ninth Question, proposed by Feramonte, Duke of Montorio.
    Which is it better that a young man should fall in love with,
    a maiden, a married woman or a widow?</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER ELEVEN</cell><cell>108</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Tenth Question, Proposed by Ascaleone.  A beautiful and
    noble lady beloved of all but especially by two young knights,
    is falsely accused and condemned to the fire.  The judge however
    in doubt leaves open a way of escape.  If any knight could be
    found who would fight in defence of her honour against the
    first who should maintain the contrary and should overcome,
    she should be free, but if he should be beaten, she should be
    burned.  The two lovers come forward and fight and one allows
    himself to be vanquished for her sake.  Which should she have
    loved the better?</hi></cell></row>

<pb n="12"/>


<row><cell>CHAPTER TWELVE</cell><cell>112</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Eleventh Question, proposed by a gentlewoman named
    Graciosa.  Which is the greater delight to the lover, to see his
    mistress present, or not seeing her to think lovingly of
her?</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</cell><cell>116</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Twelfth Question, Proposed by Longano.  Which is the
    more unhappy, the lady who after having tasted love, loves her
    lover, who must go into exile without hope of return; or she
    to whom fate has never allowed to taste with a lover the joys
    of love at all.</hi></cell></row>

<row><cell>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</cell><cell>122</cell></row>

<row><cell><hi rend="italic">The Thirteenth Question, Proposed by Massaline.  Which, in the
    story told by Massaline, was the greater:  the loyalty of the
    lover or the good fortune of the husband who got again his lost
    wife whom he thought dead and who had been brought out alive
    from her tomb by her lover who touched her not, but restored
    her to her husband?</hi></cell></row>

<lb/>

<p>IN how much the thankfull sorte are desirous (as reason
willeth and experience dailie teacheth) to gratifie such
their dear frindes, as to whom sundrie good turnes and
received benefits they are not a little beholding, the sundrie
dealing of thousands dayly in use and apparent to the
worlde, to the great prayse and commendation both of the
one and the other, giveth a sufficient testimonie.  So that,
taking occasion thereby to shew the good will I have, to pay
in parte the debt many yeares due, for that your bountie
towards me (the least sparke whereof I am unable to satisfie:)
I do give unto you this Italian Disport, the which I
have turned out of his native attire into this our English
habite to the ende the same may be no less familiar to you,
and to such other (for your sake) as shall vouchsafe thereof,
than it is either to the Italian or the Frenche, and desire
that the same may marche abrode under your charge: to
whom I recount the protection thereof.  Not doubting but
as the reading thereof shall bring plesure and delite: so
the matter beeing there with all duely considered shal
give sundry profitable lessons meet to be folowed.  And
bicause the name of the author (being of no small credit

<pb n="15"/>

with the learned, for those his sundry well written workes)
is of it selfe sufficient to cary greater commendation
therewith, than my pen is able to write, I leave to labour therein,
least my lacke may be an occasion to the leesing of his due
praise.  And untill fortune (the only hope of the unhappy)
shall make me better able, I shall desire you thankefully to
accept this as a token and pledge of the good will I have
to performe that wherunto my abilitie is unable to stretch.
Thus taking my leave, I betake you to the tuition of
almightie God, who preserve you in health to his pleasure,
and after this life make you possessor of those joyes whereof
we all hope to be partakers.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="1" id="d8"><head>Questions of Love<lb/>THE ARGUMENT</head>

<p>FLORIO, surnamed Philocopo, accompanied with the
duke Montorio, Ascaleon, Menedon and Massalina,
in sailing to seek his friend Biancofiore, was through
a very obscure and dark night by the fierce winds driven into
great dangers.  But the perils once passed, they were cast into
the port of the ancient Parthenope, whereas the mariners
(espying themselves in a haven) received comfort.  Not
knowing into what coast fortune had forced him they yielded
thanks to the gods and so tarried the new day, the which
after it once appeared the place was of the mariners descried,
so that they all glad of suretie and of so acceptable arrival,
came ashore, Philocopo with his companions.  Who rather
seemed to come forth new-risen again out of their
sepulchres than disbarked from ship, looked back towards the
wayward waters and repeating in themselves the passed
perils of the spent night, could yet scarcely think themselves
in suretie.
</p><p>They all then with one voice praised their gods that had
guided them safe out of so crooked a course, offered their
pitiful sacrifices, and began to receive comfort.  They were
by a friend of Ascaleon's honourably received into the city,
whereas they caused their ship to be all new repaired and
decked of mast, sail and better stern than were the others
which they had lost.  And so tarrying time for their further

<pb n="17"/>

voyage, the which was much longer lengthened than they
looked for; by occasion whereof Philocopo would many
times have taken his journey by land, but discouraged
therein by Ascaleon, stayed, in tarrying a more prosperous
hour in the aforesaid place, where he and his companions
saw Phoebus five times round and as many times homed,
before that Notus did abandon his violent forces.
</p><p>And in so long a while they never almost saw time to be
merry, whereupon Philocopo, who was very desirous to
perform his deferred journey, one day called his companions
unto him and said: "Let us go take the pleasant air and pass
the time upon the salt sea shore, in reasoning and providing
for our future voyage."
</p><p>Thus he with the Duke Parmenion and the rest of his
companions directed their walk with a mild pace
(discoursing divers matters) towards that place where rested the
reverend ashes of the most renowned poet Maro.  They all
thus talking a good space were not gone far from the city
but that they came to the side of a garden, wherein they
heard gracious and joyous feasting of young gentlemen,
dames and damsels.
</p><p>There the air did all resound with the noise of sundry
instruments and as it were of angelical voices, entering with
sweet delight into the hearts of them to whose ears it came.
The which noise it pleased Philcopo to stay a while to hear,
to the end his former melancholy through the sweetness
thereof might by little and little depart away.  Then
Ascaleon restrained their talk.
</p><p>And while fortune held thus Philocopo and his
companions without the garden intentively listening, a young
gentleman coming forth thereof espied them and forthwith
by sight, port and visage knew them to be noble gentlemen
and worthy to be reverenced.  Wherefor he without tarrying

<pb n="18"/>

returned to his company and said "Come, let us go
welcome certain young men, seeming to be gentlemen of
great calling, the which perhaps bashful to enter herein,
not being bidden, stay without, giving ear to our disport."
</p><p>The companions then of this gentleman left the ladies at
their pastime and went forth of the garden and came to
Philocopo, whom by sight they knew to be chief of all the
rest; to whom they spoke with that reverence their reason
could devise and that was most convenient for the welcoming
of such a guest, praying him that in honour and increase
of this their feast it would please him and his companions to
enter with them the garden, constraining him through many
requests that he would in no wise deny them this courtesy.
</p><p>These sweet prayers so pierced the gentle heart of
Philocopo and no less the hearts of his companions, that he
answered the entreaters in this sort:
</p><p>"Friends, of truth such a feast was of us neither sought
for nor fled from.  But like weather-beaten mates cast into
your port, we to the end to flee drowsy thoughts which
spring of idleness, did in reciting our adversities, pass by
these sea banks.  But how fortune has allured us to give ear
unto you I know not, unless as we think, desirous to remove
from us all pensiveness, she has of you in whom I know to
be infinite courtesy, made us this offer.  And therefor we will
satisfy your desire, though peradventure in part we become
somewhat lavish of the courtesy which otherwise towards
others ought to proceed from us."
</p><p>And thus talking they entered together into the garden,
whereas they found many fair gentlewomen, of whom they
were very graciously received and by them welcomed to
their feast.  After Philocopo had a good while beheld this
their feasting and likewise had feasted with them, he
thought it good to depart, and willed to take his leave of the

<pb n="19"/>

young gentlemen and to give them thanks for the honour
he had received.  But one lady more honourable than the
rest, endowed with marvelous beauty and virtue, came forth
where he stood and thus said unto him:
</p><p>"Most noble sir, you have this morning through this
your great courtesy shewed no small pleasure to these young
gentlemen, for the which they shall be always beholden unto
you; that is to wit in that you have vouchsafed to come to
honour their our feast.  May it please you then not to refuse
to shew unto me, and to these other dames, that favour that
I am secondarily to entreat you for."
</p><p>To whom Philocopo with a sweet voice answered: "Most
gentle lady, nothing may justly be denied you.  Command
therefor, for both I and these my companions are all pressed
at your will."
</p><p>To whom the lady said in this wise: "Forasmuch as this
your coming has increased this our feasting with a most
noble and goodly company, I shall desire you that you will
not with departure lessen the same, but rather help us here
to spend this day even to the last hour, to that end we have
already begun the same."
</p><p>Philocopo beheld her in the face as she thus spoke, and
seeing her eyes replete with burning rays to twinkle like
unto the morning star, and her face exceeding pleasant and
fair, thought never to have seen (his Biancofiore excepted)
so fair a creature.  To whose demand he thus made answer:
"Madame, I shall dispose myself to satisfy rather your
desire than my own.  Wherefor so long as it shall please you so
long will I abide with you, and these my companions also."
</p><p>The lady gave him great thanks, and returning to the
others, began together with them all to be very merry.
Philocopo, abiding with them in this sort, entered into great
familiarity with a young gentleman named Galeon, adorned

<pb n="20"/>

with good qualities and of a singular eloquence, to whom in
talking he said thus: "Oh how much are you more than any
other beholden to the immortal gods, the which preserve
you quiet in one will in this your mirth-making."
</p><p>"We acknowledge us to be greatly bounden unto them,"
answered Galeon.  "But what occasion moves you to say
this?"
</p><p>Philocopo answered: "Truly none other occasion but that
I see you all here assembled in one will."
</p><p>"Oh," said Galeon, "marvel not at all thereat, for this
lady (in whom all excellency does rest) both moves us
hereunto and holds us herein."
</p><p>Then demanded Philocopo: "And this lady, who is she?"
</p><p>Galeon answered: "lt is she that made request unto you,
that you would tarry here, whenas a while since you would
have departed."
</p><p>"By sight she seems unto me," said Philocopo, "exceeding
fair and of a surmounting worthiness.  But yet, if my
demand be not unlawful, manifest her name unto me, of
whence she is and of what parents descended."
</p><p>Unto whom Galeon answered: "No ways may your
request be unjust; besides there is none publicly talking of
her which does not vouchsafe to publish the renown of so
worthy a lady, and therefor I shall fully satisfy your
demand.  Her name is of us here called Fiametta, howbeit the
greatest part of the people call her by the name of Her
through whom that wound is shut up that the prevarication
of the first mother opened.  She is the daughter of a most
high prince, under whose scepter these countries are quietly
governed.  She is also lady unto us all.  And briefly, there is
no virtue that ought to be in a noble heart that is not in hers.
And as I think, in tarrying this day with us, you shall have
good experience thereof."

<pb n="21"/>

</p><p>"That which you say," said Philocopo, "cannot be hidden
in her semblance.  The gods guide her to that end that her
singular gifts do merit, for assuredly I believe both that
and much more than you have affirmed.  But these other
dames, who are they?"
</p><p>"These gentlewomen," said Galeon, "some of them are of
Parthenope and othersome of places elsewhere, come as are
you yourselves hither into her company."
</p><p>And after they had thus held talk a good space, Galeon
said: "Ah, my sweet friend, if it might not displease you,
it should be very acceptable unto me to know further of
your estate and condition than your outward appearance
represents, to the end that by knowing you we may do you
that honour you worthily merit.  Because sometimes want of
knowledge brings lack of duetie to them that honour others
in not doing their due reverence."
</p><p>To, whom Philocopo answered: "No lack in doing me
reverence could any ways happen on your behalf, but rather
you have therein so far exceeded as with excess you have
passed the bound and limits thereof.  But since you desire
to know further of my condition, it should be unjust not to
satisfy your desire therein.  And therefor (in how much
it is lawful for me to discover) I shall tell you.  I am a poor
pilgrim of love, and go seeking as you see a lady of mine,
taken away from me by subtle means by my parents.  And
these gentlemen whom you see with me of their courtesy
keep me company in this my pilgrimage.  My name is
Philocopo, of nation a Spaniard, driven through tempestuous
weather (seeking for the island of Cicilia) into your ports."
</p><p>But he knew not so covertly to talk as that the young
gentleman understood not more of his condition than he
willingly desired he should.  And having compassion of those
his hard fortunes, somewhat comforted him with these

<pb n="22"/>

words, which promised him hereafter a more lucky life,
and from that time forward to increase his honour, willed
that he should be honoured of them all, not as a pilgrim or
as a bidden guest, but rather as the chief and principal patron
of the feast.  The lady who understood his state and
condition through the report of Galeon, esteeming dearly of such
a hap, commanded specially that so it should be.
</p><p>Apollo was now with his chariot of light mounted to the
meridian circle and did scarcely behold with levelled eye
the new-apparelled earth, whenas these dames, damsels and
young gentlemen, being thus assembled together in that
place (setting their feasting apart) seeking forth by sundry
quarters of the garden the delightful shade, and fleeing the
noisesome heat that might offend their delicate bodies, took
by divers companies divers delights.
</p><p>And the lady accompanied with four others took
Philocopo by the hand, saying: "Sir, the heat does constrain us
to seek out the fresh air.  Let us therefore go to yonder
meadow you see here before us, and there with sundry
discourses pass over the heat of the day."
</p><p>Philocopo then greatly praised the lady's device and
followed her motion, and with him his companions.  Galeon
also with two others went with them to the appointed
meadow, which was exceeding fair of grass and flowers, and
filled with a great suavity of smells, about the which grew
store of young trees very fair and thick of green leaves,
wherewith the place was defended from the parching beams
of the great planet.
</p><p>There was in the midst of that meadow a proper
fountain very fair and clear like crystal, about the which they
all sat them down, where some gazing in the water and
othersome gathering flowers, they began to talk of sundry
matters.  But because sometimes that unawares the one did

<pb n="23"/>

interrupt the other's tale, the fair lady said unto them thus:
</p><p>"To the end that this our discourse may proceed in a more
better order and so continue until the fresh cool hours, the
which we attend for our further feasting, let us ordain one
of us in place of our king, to whom each one shall propound
a question of love, and shall receive from him an apt
resolution thereof.  And truly (as I think) we shall no sooner have
made an end of our questions, but that the heat (we not
knowing how) shall be passed, and the time spent to our
profit and delight."
</p><p>This device pleased them all and among them it was said,
Let there be a king.  And with one voice they chose Ascaleon
to their king, for that he was somewhat more grown in years
than was any of the rest.
</p><p>To whom he made answer, to be altogether insufficient
for so great an office, because he had spent more years in
the service of Mars than of Venus.  But yet he prayed them
all to leave unto him the election of such a king.
</p><p>They that thought him to be such a one (knowing so well
beforehand the qualities of them all) as would constitute
one such as should yield true answers to all their demands,
did then wholly consent that the election should freely be
remitted unto him since he would not take such a dignity
upon himself.
</p><p>Ascaleon then rose him up and gathered certain twigs of a
green laurel the shade whereof did overspread the fresh
fountain, and thereof made a rich coronet, the which he
brought in presence of them all and said in this wise:
</p><p>"From the time that I in my most youthful years began
to have understanding, I swear by those gods whom I
worship that I do not remember to have seen or heard named a
woman of like worthiness to Fiametta, of whom love holds
us all here in her presence inflamed, and by whom we have

<pb n="24"/>


this day been honoured in such sort as we ought never
forget the same.  And because she (as without doubt I know) is
plentifully endowed with every good grace, adorned both
with beauty and good qualities and endowed with a flowing
eloquence, I therefor make choice of her to be our queen.
For assuredly it is convenient that the imperial crown be
bestowed upon her magnificence, being descended from a
royal house and to whom the secret ways of love being (as
they are all) open, it shall be an easy matter for her to
content us in these our questions."
</p><p>And this said, he humbly kneeled before this noble lady,
saying: "Most courteous lady, vouchsafe to deck your head
with this crown, the which is no less dearly to be esteemed
of them that are worthy through their virtues to cover their
heads with the like, than if it were of gold."
</p><p>The lady with a new red bepainted her white visage and
said: "Truly you have not in due sort provided a queen for
this amorous people (that have more need of a most able
king) for that of all you that are present I am the most
simple and of least virtue; neither is there any one of you
that is not more meet to be invested of such a crown than
I am.
</p><p>"But since it thus pleases you, I cannot withstand this
your election.  And to the end I be not found contrary to
our made promise, I will receive it and, as I hope, shall also
receive from the gods with it the stomach due to such an
office.  And through the help of him to whom these leaves
were always acceptable, I shall answer you all according
to my small knowledge.  Nevertheless I devoutly pray him
that he will enter into my breast, and renew my voice with
that sound wherewith he caused the valiant, vanquished
Marsyas to deserve to be drawn forth of the sheath of his
members.  I, by way of mirth, shall give you light answers

<pb n="25"/>

without sifting unto the depth of your propounded
questions, the going about to search for the which should rather
bring tediousness than delight to your minds."
</p><p>And having thus said, she took with her delicate hand
the offered garland, and therewithal crowned her head.  She
then commanded that each one, upon pain to be deprived of
the amorous joys, should prepare to forth some question,
the which might be apt and convenient to the purpose
whereof they did intend to treat, and such a one as it should
rather be an increaser of mirth than through too great
subtlety or otherwise, a destroyer of the same.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="2" id="d9">
<head>THE FIRST QUESTION,<lb/>PROPOSED BY PHILOCOPO</head>

<p>ON the right hand of the queen sat Philocopo, to
whom she said: "Noble sir, you shall begin to
propound your question to the end that the rest,
orderly as we are here placed, may after you with more suretie
propound theirs also."
</p><p>To whom Philocopo thus made answer: "Most noble lady,
without any delay I shall obey your commandment."  And
thus he said:
</p><p>I do remember that in the city wherein I was born, there
was one day made a bountiful great feast, whereat to honour
the same were many gentlemen and gentlewomen.  And I
that was there likewise, roaming about and beholding them
that were in the place, espied among the rest two young
gentlemen very gracious to behold, that earnestly eyed an
exceedingly fair woman.  Neither was I any ways able to
discern which of them her beauty had most inflamed.  And
as she in like sort had a good space beheld them, not
making greater semblance to the one than to the other, they
between themselves began to reason of her.  And among the
other words that I understood of their talk, was that each
one said that he was her best beloved; and for proof thereof
either of them alleged in the furtherance of himself divers
gestures then before done by the young woman.

<pb n="27"/>

</p><p>And they thus remaining in this contention a long time,
being now through many words at daggers drawing, they
acknowledged that herein they did very evil, because in thus
doing they wrought hurt and shame to themselves and
displeasure to the woman.  Wherefore (moved of an equal
agreement) both two went unto the mother of the maid,
who was also at the same feast, and thus said unto her: That
forasmuch as above all other women of the world either of
them best liked her daughter, and that they were at
contention which of them was best liked of her, it would therefor
please her to grant them this favour, to the end no greater
inconvenience might spring thereof, as to will her daughter
that she either by word or deed would show which of them
she best loved.
</p><p>The entreated gentlewoman smiling thus answered:
Willingly.  And so calling her daughter to her, said: "My
fair daughter, each one of these prefers the love of you
above the love of himself.  And in this contention they are,
which of them is best beloved of you.  And they seek of
me this favour, that you either by signs or word resolve
them herein.  And therefor to the end that love, from whom
all peace and goodness ought always to spring, breed not
now the contrary, content them in this and with gentle
courtesy shew towards which of them you mind is most bent."
</p><p>The young damsel said: "It liketh me right well."  And
so beholding them both a while she saw the one of them to
have upon his head a fair garland of fresh flowers, and the
other to stand without any garland at all.  Then she, that
had likewise upon her head a garland of green leaves, first
took the same from her head and set it upon his that stood
before her without a garland.  And after she took that which
the other young man had upon his head and set the same
upon hers; and so leaving them she returned to the feast,

<pb n="28"/>

saying that she had both performed the commandment of
her mother and also their desire.
</p><p>The young men being thus left, returned also to their
former contention, each one affirming that she loved him
best.  He whose garland she took and set upon her head
said: "Assuredly she loves me best because she has taken
my garland to none other end but for that what mine is
pleases her, and to give occasion to be beholden unto me.
But to you she has given hers, as it were in place of her last
farewell, unwilling that like a country girl the love which
you bear her be without requittal; and therefore lastly she
gives you that garland you had merited."
</p><p>The other replying with the contrary thus answered:
"Truly she loves that yours is better than you, and that may
be seen in her taking thereof.  And me she loves better than
what mine is inasmuch as she has given me of hers; and
therefor it is no token of her last deserved gift, as you
affirm, but rather a beginning of amity and love.  A gift makes
the receiver a subject to the giver; and because she
peradventure uncertain of me, to the end she might be more
certain to have me her subject, will bind me (if perhaps I were
not bound unto her before) to be hers by gift.  But how may
you think, if she at the first takes away from you, that ever
she may vouchsafe to give?"
</p><p>And thus they abode a long time contending, and in the
end departed without any definition at all.  Now say I, most
puissant queen, if you should be demanded of the last
sentence of such a contention, what would you judge?
</p><p>The fair lady somewhat smiling turned towards
Philocopo her eyes sparkling with an amorous light, and after a
soft sigh thus made answer.
</p><p>"Most noble youth, proper is your question; and truly, as
very wisely the young woman behaved herself so each one

<pb n="29"/>

of the young men right well defended his cause.  But
because you require what we lastly will judge thereof, thus
we make you answer: It seems unto us and so it ought to
seem to each one that takes good heed, that the woman
had in hate neither the one nor the other, but to keep her
intent covert did two contrary acts, as appears, and not
without occasion.  And to the end she might get more assured
the love of him whom she loved, as not to lose the love of
the other whom she hated not, it was but wisely done.  But
to come to our question, which is, to which of the two
greatest love was shewed.
</p><p>"We say that she loved him best and he chiefest in her
favour to whom she gave her garland.  And this seems to
be the reason: Whatsoever man or woman that loves any
person, each one through force of the love they bear is so
strongly bound to the person loved that above all other
things they desire to please the same.  Neither to bind him
or her more strongly that thus loves needs either gifts or
services; and this is manifest.
</p><p>"And yet we see, that whoso loves, though he endeavour
himself sundry ways, is not able to make the person loved
in any sort benign and subject unto him, whereby he may
bring it to his pleasure and so with a more bold face demand
his desire.  And that this is in such sort as we say, the
inflamed Dido with her doings does very well manifest the
same unto us.  Burning in the love of Aeneas, so long as
it seemed her neither with honours nor with gifts able
to win him, had not the courage to attempt the doubtful
way of asking the question.  So that then the young woman
sought to make him most beholden unto her whom she best
loved.  And thus we say that he that received the gift of
the garland was her best beloved."
</p><p>As the queen became silent Philocopo answered: "Discreet

<pb n="30"/>

lady, greatly is your answer to be commended.  But
for all that you do bring me into a great admiration of
that you have defined touching the propounded question,
because I would have judged rather the contrary.  For so
much as generally among lovers this was the wonted
custom, that is, to desire to bear upon them some jewel or
some other thing of the person's loved, to the end that most
times they might glory themselves more therein than in
all the remnant they had; and perceiving the same about
them therewith to gladden their minds as you have heard.
</p><p>"Paris seldom times or never entered into the bloody
battles against the Greeks without bearing some token upon
him that had been given him by his Helen, believing better
to prevail therewith than if he had gone without the same.
And truly, in mine opinion, his thought was not vain.
Therefor I should thus say (that as you said) the young
woman did very wisely, not defining it for all that as you
have done, but in this manner: She, knowing that she was
very well loved of two young men and that she could not
love more than one, for that love is an indivisible thing, she
would reward the one for the love he bore her to the end
that such good will should not be unrewarded, and so give
him her garland in requittal thereof.  To the other, whom
she loved, she thought she would give courage and assured
hope of her love, taking his garland and decking herself
therewith, in token whereof she plainly shewed to be
beholden unto him for the same.  And therefor in my
judgment, she loved him better from whom she took than him
to whom she gave."
</p><p>To whom the queen thus made answer: "Your argument
should have pleased us right well if yourself in your tale
had not condemned the same.  See how pillage and perfect
love can agree together.  How can you shew me that we love

<pb n="31"/>

him whom we despoil better than him to whom we give?
According to the question propounded, to the one she gave a
garland and from the other she took a garland; neither had
he unto whom she gave aught to give her.  And that which
we see every day, for example may here suffice.  As is
commonly said: They are of gentlemen far better loved on whom
they bestow favour and gifts than those that are by them
deprived of them.  And for that cause we lastly hold opinion,
concluding that he is better loved to whom is given than he
from whom is taken.
</p><p>"We know very well that in these our reasonings much
might be objected against this our definition, and much also
answered to the contrary reasons, but lastly such
determination shall remain true.  And because time now serves not to
stay with this our talk upon matter only without more, we
will give ear to the rest if it please you."
</p><p>To whom Philocopo said that it pleased him right well,
and that very well sufficed such a resolution to his demanded
question; and so held his peace.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="3" id="d10">
<head>THE SECOND QUESTION,<lb/>
PROPOSED BY PARMENIO</head>

<p>PARMENIO sat next, and without attending further,
as the queen had left, thus began:
</p><p>Most mighty queen, I was of long time
companion with a young gentleman to whom that happened
which I intend to shew.
</p><p>He as much as any man could love a woman, loved a
fair young gentlewoman of our city, gracious, gentle and
very rich, both of wealth and parents, and she also loved
him for aught that I (to whom his love was discovered)
could understand.
</p><p>This gentleman then loved her in most secret sort,
fearing that if it should be betrayed that he should no ways be
able to speak unto her.  To the end therefor that he might
discover his intent and be certified likewise of hers, he
trusted no one that should attempt to speak of this matter.
Yet his desire enforcing him, he purposed since he could
not betray himself unto her, to make her understand by
some other that which he suffered for her sake.
</p><p>And bethinking him many days by whom he might most
closely signify unto her that his intent, he saw one day a
poor old woman, wrinkled out of an orange tawny colour, so
despiteful to behold as none the like, the which being
entered the house of the young woman to ask her alms, followed

<pb n="33"/>

forth of the door, and many times after in like sort,
and for like occasion he saw her return thither.  In this
woman his heart gave him to repose his whole trust
imagining that he should never be had in suspicion and that she
might fully bring his desire to effect.  Therefor calling her
to him, he promised her great gifts if she would help him
in that which he should demand of her.  She swore to do
her endeavour, to whom this gentleman then discovered his
mind.
</p><p>The old woman departed and after a while, having
certified the young woman of the love that my companion bare
her, and him likewise that she above all other things of the
world did love him, she devised how this young man should
be secretly one evening with the desired woman.
</p><p>And so he going before her, as she had appointed, she
guided him to this young gentlewoman's house, wherein he
was no sooner entered than through his misfortune the
young woman, the old and he, were all three found and
taken together by the brethren of the woman and
compelled to tell the truth of that they made there, who
confessed the whole matter as it was.
</p><p>These brethren, for that they were the friends of this
gentleman, and knowing that he as yet had attained
nothing that might redound to their shame, would not do him
any harm as they might have done.  But laughing, said to
him in this sort: "You are now in our hands and have sought
to dishonour us, and for that we may punish you if we will.
Of these two ways see that you take the one: either that
you will we take your life from you, or else that you stay
with this old woman and this our sister, either of them one
year, swearing faithfully that if you shall take upon you
to be with either of them a year, and the first year with the
young woman, that as many times as you shall kiss or have

<pb n="34"/>
<pb n="35"/>
<pb n="36"/>

to do with her, as many times shall you kiss and have to do
with the old woman the second year.  And if you shall take
the first year the old woman look how many times you shall
kiss and touch her so many times likewise and neither more
nor less shall you do the like to the young woman the
second year."
</p><p>The young man listening to the sentence and desiring to
live, said that he would be with these two two years.  It was
granted him.  But he remained in doubt with which of them
he should first begin, either with the young or with the old.
Whether of them would you give counsel he should first for
his most consolation withal?
</p><p>The queen and likewise the whole company somewhat
smiled at this tale, and after she thus made answer:
</p><p>"According to our judgment the young gentleman ought
rather to take the fair young woman than the foul old.
Because no present good turn ought to be left for the
future, neither the evil to be taken for the future good,
because we know that we are uncertain of things to come.  And
in doing the contrary hereof many have already sorrowed
too late, and if any have praised himself herein, not duty
but fortune has therein helped him.  Let the fair therefor to
be the first taken."
</p><p>"You make me greatly to marvel," said Parmenio,
"seeing that the present good ought not to be left for the future.
To what end then is it convenient for us with a valiant mind
to follow and bear worldly troubles, whereas we may flee
them if it were not through the future eternal kingdoms
promised to us through hope? It is a marvelous thing that
such a shock of people as are in the world, all moiling to
the end that one time to taste of rest, and being able to rest
before trouble, should remain so long while in such an error
as trouble after rest were better than before.

<pb n="37"/>

</p><p>"It is a thing very just (as it seems unto me) after
troubles to seek rest; but to desire to rest without trouble in my
judgment ought not to be, neither can it bring delight.  Who
then will give counsel to any that he lie first with a fair
gentlewoman one year, the which is the only rest and joy
of him that must stay with her, in shewing him after that
there must follow so great annoy and unpleasant life as he
must in every act, wherein he abode with the young woman,
have to do as long with a loathesome old woman?
</p><p>"Nothing is so noisome to a delightful life as to
remember that after death we shall be found spotted.  This death
return to our memory as enemy contrary to our being, does
disturb us of all goodness and pleasure.  And while this is
remembered there can never be joy tasted in worldly things.
Likewise no delight can be had with the young woman that
is not troubled or destroyed in thinking and remembering
that it behoove him to do as much with a most vile old
woman, who shall always be remaining before the eyes of
his mind.  The time that flies with an inestimable wing shall
seem unto him to overfly, lessening each day a great
quantity of the due hours.  And this mirth is not tasted whereas
infallible future sorrow is tarried for.
</p><p>"Wherefor I would judge that the contrary were better
counsel, that is, that all trouble whereof gracious rest is
hoped for, is more delightful than the delight whereof
annoy is tarried for.  The cold waters seemed warm and the
dreadful time of the dark night seemed clear and sound
day and turmoils rest, to Leander, at what time he went to
Hero, swimming with the force of his arms through the
salt surges between Sestus and Abydos, for the delight that
he conceived to have of her tarrying his coming.
</p><p>"God forbid then that a man should covet rest before
travel, or reward before the doing his service or delight before

<pb n="38"/>

he has tasted tribulation.  For as much as if that way
(as we have already said) should be taken, the future annoy
should so much hinder the present joy that not joy, but
rather annoy it might be said.  What delight could the
delicate meats and instruments sounded with cunning hand and
the other marvelous joys made to Dionysus the tyrant bring
when as he saw a sharp-pointed sword hang by a fine thread
over his head? Let then sorrowful occasions be first fled,
that afterward with pleasure and that without suspicion
gracious delights may be followed."
</p><p>The queen made him answer saying: "You answer in
part as though we did reason of eternal joys, for the
purchasing whereof there is no doubt but that all troubles
ought to be taken in hand, and all worldly wealth and
delight to be left apart.  But at this instance we do not speak
of them but do move a question of worldly delights and of
worldly annoys.  Whereunto we answer as we said before,
that every worldly delight that is followed with worldly
annoy ought rather to be taken than the worldly annoy
that tarries worldly delight.  Because who that has time,
and tarries time, loves time.  Fortune grants her goodness
with sundry mutations, the which is rather to be taken
whenas she gives than to moil to the end after turmoils to
get the same.  If her wheel stood firm and stable until that
a man had toiled so much as he should need to toil no more,
we would then say that it were to be granted to take pains
first.  But who is certain that after the evil may not follow
the worst, as well as the better that is tarried for?
</p><p>"The times, together with worldly things, are all
transitory, and therefor in taking the old woman before the year
complete, the which shall never seem to wax less, the young
woman may die, and her brethren repent them of this they
have done; or else she may be given to some other, or

<pb n="39"/>

peradventure stolen away; so that after one evil there shall
follow a worse to the taker.
</p><p>"But contrary-wise, if the young woman be taken, the
taker shall thereby have his desire so long time of him
desired, neither shall thereafter follow the annoy of thought
that you say must follow thereby, because that we must die
infallible.  But to stay with an old woman is a thing able
enough with many remedies to be of a wise man avoided,
and worldly things are to be taken of the discreet with this
condition, that each one while he holds and enjoys them he
dispose himself with a liberal mind when he shall be
required to restore or leave them.
</p><p>"Who that busys himself to the end to rest brings a
manifest example, that without that he cannot have rest.
And since he therefor takes troubles to the end to have rest,
how much more is it to be presumed that if rest were as
ready as trouble but that he would sooner take that than
this? Neither is to be thought that Leander, if he had been
able to have had Hero without passing the
tempestuous arm of the sea, whereinafter he perished, would not
rather have taken her than have swum the same.  It is
convenient to take fortune's chances what times she gives
them.
</p><p>"For no gift is so small that is not better than a promised
greater.  And as for future things, let remedies be taken and
the present governed according to their qualities.  It is a
natural thing to desire rather the good than the evil, whenas
equally they concur, and who that does the contrary
follows not natural reason but his own folly.  We confess that
after troubles quietness is more gracious and better known
than before, but yet not that it is rather to be taken than
the other.  It is possible for wise men and fools to use the
counsels both of fools and wise men according to their liking.

<pb n="40"/>
But for all that the infallible verity is not altered, the
which does give us leave to see that rather the fair young
woman than the loathesome old is to be taken of him, to
whom was made such a choice."</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="d11">
<head>THE THIRD QUESTION,<lb/>
PROPOSED BY A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN</head>

<p>ON the right side of Longano sat an excellent fair
gentlewoman, and very pleasant, who as she perceived
the question by the queen determined, thus
began with a sweet voice to say:
</p><p>Most renowned queen, your ears grant hearing to my
words, and first by those gods whom you worship, and
next by the power of our pastime, I pray you that you will
give to my demands profitable counsel.
</p><p>I as you know, being descended of noble parents, was born
in this city and was named with a very gracious name,
although my surname (being Cara) presents me grateful to
the ears and as by my face it may appear, I have received
from the gods and nature, a singular gift of beauty, the
which I now have (in following my proper name more
than my surname) I have adorned with an infinite pleasantness
showing myself benign to whom that is delighted to
behold the same.  By occasion whereof many have
endeavored themselves for their pleasure to occupy my eyes,
against all whom I have withstood with strong resistance,
holding a stable heart against their assaults.  But because
it seems to me unlawful that I only should ignore the laws
kept and observed of all others, that is, not to love being
loved of many, I have determined to become enamoured;

<pb n="42"/>

and setting apart many seekers of such love, whereof some
do excell Midas in riches, some others pass Absolom in
beauty, and others some in courtesy (according to the
common report of all) are more splendid than any other, I
have of all these chosen three, of whom each one pleases
me alike.
</p><p>Of the which three the one of bodily force (as I believe)
would excell the good Hector, he is at every proof so
vigorous and strong.  The courtesy and liberality of the
second is such that (as I think) his frame does sound to each
pole.  That the third is all full of wisdom so that he
surmounts all other wise men above measure.
</p><p>But for that (as ye have heard) their qualities are divers,
I doubt which of them to take, finding in the antique age
each one of these to have diversely the courages of women
and of yielding men; as of Dianira, Hercules, of our
Clytemnestra, Egistus and of Lucretius Sextus.
</p><p>Counsel me therefore to which of the soonest would
least blame and greater surety I ought to give myself.
</p><p>The pleasant queen having heard the purpose of this
gentlewoman, thus made answer: "There is never a one
of the three that does not worthily merit the love of a fair
and gracious lady.  But because in this case I am not to fight
against castles or to give away the kingdoms of great
Alexander or the treasures of Ptolomey, but that only that love
and honour are with discretion a long time to be kept, the
which are maintained neither by force nor courtesy, but
only by wisdom, we say that both you and every other
woman ought rather to give her love to a wise man than
any of the rest."
</p><p>"Oh how different is my judgment from yours,"
answered the gentlewoman, "to me it seems that each one of
the others were sooner to be taken than the wise.  And this

<pb n="43"/>

seems to be the reason: Love (as we see) is of that nature
as multiplying his force in one heart every other thing he
vanishes out thence, retaining that for his seat and moving
it according to his pleasure; whereunto no foresight is able
to resist but that it is convenient for them to follow him, by
whom it is (as I have said) governed.  And who doubts that
Byblis knew it not to be evil to love her brother? Who
will gainsay that it was not manifest to Leander that he
might drown in Hellespont in his fortunate time if he cast
himself therein? And none will deny that Pasiphae knew
not a man to be more fair than a bull? And yet they and
each one overcome with an amorous pleasure, rejecting all
knowledge, followed the same.  Then if it has power to take
knowledge from the learned, taking away the wit from the
wise, they shall have nothing left.  But if from the strong
and courteous it shall take away the little wit they have,
it shall yet increase them in their virtues, and so they shall
become more than the wise enamoured.  Further, love has
this property: it is a thing that cannot long be hid, and in
revealing himself he is wont oftimes to bring grievous perils,
whereto what remedy shall the wise give that has now lost
his wit? He shall give none at all.  But the strong that
useth his force can help in a peril both himself and others.
The courteous through his courtesy shall with grateful
benevolence win the minds of many, whereby he may be
both helped and considered, and others also for his sake.
See now what it is to be of your judgment."
</p><p>She was by the queen answered thus: "If, there was such
a one as you speak of, who should then be wise? Not one.
But if he whom you propound wise and enamoured of you
should be made a fool, he is not to be taken.  The gods forbid
that that whereof you speak should come to pass.  And yet
we will not deny but that the wise know the evil and do

<pb n="44"/>
<pb n="45"/>
<pb n="46"/>

it. But for all that we will say that they thereby lose not
their wit, forasmuch as what time it pleases them with the
reason they have to bridle their wills, they will reduce
themselves to their accustomed wit, guiding their motions in
a due and straight order.  And in this manner their love shall
be altogether or at the least a long time kept secret; and
that without any doubtful diligence the which shall not
happen to one of little wit, be he never so strong or courteous.
And yet if perhaps it does happen, that such love be
discovered, a wise man will with a hundred foresights shut
up the eyes and understanding of the tatlers thereof, and
shall provide a safety both for his own honour and the
honour of his loved lady.  And if need of safety be, the help of
the wise cannot fail.  That of the strong comes less.  And
the friends that are gotten by liberality are accustomed in
adversity to shrink away.  What is she of so little
discretion that is brought to such a pass as has need of manifest
help? or that if her love be disclosed seeks same in having
loved a strong or liberal man? I believe there is none such.
Let the wise then be soonest loved, hoping that he must be
in each case more worthy than any of the rest."</p>

THE FOURTH QUESTION,<lb/>
PROPOSED BY MENEDON</head>

<p>THE gentlewoman by her countenance, seemed
content, when Menedon, sitting next to her side, said:
</p><p>"Most high and noble queen, now it is come unto
my turn to propound my question here in your presence.
Wherefore by your license if in my talk I shall be very long,
yet during the same I shall first of all of you, and next of
the standers-about, pray pardon.  Because ye cannot be made
fully to understand that which I intend to propound unless
a tale that peradventure shall not be short, do precede the
same."  And after these words thus he began to say:
</p><p>In the country where I was born I remember there was
a noble knight, surpassing rich, the which loved in most
loyal love, a noble gentlewoman, born likewise there, whom
he took to wife.  Of whom being as she was exceeding fair,
another knight, called Tarolfo, was after enamoured and
with so great good will loved her as he saw nothing he more
desired than her.  And in sundry sorts, now with passing
before her house, now jousting, now at the barriers, now
with the often sending her messages, peradventure promising
her great gifts whereby she might know his intent, and
now with other like feats, he endeavoured himself to purchase
her love.
</p><p>All which things the lady closely supported without giving

<pb n="48"/>

sign or good answer unto the knight, saying to herself:
"Whenas this knight shall discover that he can have neither
answer nor yet good countenance of me, perhaps he will
forbear any further either to love me or to give me these
allurements."
</p><p>Now for all this Tarolfo ceased not, following the
precepts of Ovid, who says that a man must not through the
hardness of a woman leave to persevere because with
continuance the soft water pierces the hard stone.  The lady,
doubting lest these things should come to the ears of her
husband, and that he should believe that the same happened
through her good will, purposed to let him understand the
same.
</p><p>But yet after being persuaded through better advicement,
she said: "I might, if I tell him, make such a brawl between
them as I should never after live a merry life, and therefore
he must be shaken off by some other means."
</p><p>And so she imagined a trim guile.  She sent to Tarolfo,
saying that if he loved her so well as he made show of, she
would require one thing at his hands; the which if she
received she swore by her gods and by that loyalty that ought
to be in a gentlewoman, that she would accomplish all his
desire.  And if he would not give her what she required,
he should then content himself, no further to allure her
hereafter but in what he would be willing she should
reveal to her husband.
</p><p>The gift she required was this: She said that she would
have in that country in the month of January, a very fair
garden and large, replenished with herbs, flowers and
blossoming trees and fruits, as if it were in the month of May.
She sent him this message, saying to herself that this is an
impossible thing so that in this way I shall rid him from
me.

<pb n="49"/>

</p><p>Tarolfo, hearing this demand, although it seemed to him
impossible to be done, and that he knew very well to what
end she required the same, answered: that he would never
rest, neither yet return into her presence, until such time
as he might give her the demanded gift.  And so forthwith
departed his country with such a company as pleased him
to take with him.
</p><p>He sought all the west parts for counsel how to attain
his desire, but not finding there what he looked for, sought
the most hot regions, and so came into Thessaly, as he had
been sent by a discreet man for that purpose.  And having
made his abode there many days, not yet finding what he
sought for, it happened that now being almost desperate of
his desire and rising one morning before the sun, prepared
to enter the dawning day, he all alone began to wander the
miserable plains that were now all imbued with Roman
blood.  And having travelled a long while upon the same, he
suddenly espied before him at the foot of a mountain, a man
not young nor of too many years, bearded, small and very
spare of person, whose attire showed him to be but poor, who
roamed hither and thither gathering herbs and with a little
knife digged up sundry roots whereof he had filled one of
the skirts of his coat.  Whom as Tarolfo saw, he marvelled
not a little, and doubted greatly lest it had been some other
thing; but after his look did certainly show him to be a
man, he drew near unto him, saluted him and asked him
who he was and of whence and what he did there at so
timely an hour.
</p><p>To whom the old man answered: "I am of Thebes and
Theban is my name, and I go up and down this place
gathering of these herbs to the end that with the juice thereof
I make divers necessary and profitable things for divers
infirmities, whereby I may wherewithal to live.  And to

<pb n="50"/>

come at this hour it is need and not delight that constraineth
me. But who are you, that in countenance resembles noble
and walk here all alone solitary?
</p><p>To whom Tarolfo answered: "I am of the extremes of
the west, very rich and vanquished of conceits, pricked
forwards to an enterprise, not being able hitherto to achieve
the same and therefor to be the better able without
impediment to bewail my lot, I go thus all alone wandering."
</p><p>To whom Theban said: "Do you not know the quality
of the place and what it is? Wherefore have you rather
taken your way on the one side? You might easily here be
rebuked with furious spirits."
</p><p>Tarolfo answered: "God can do here as elsewhere.  It is
He that has my life and honour in His hands.  Let Him do
with me according to His pleasure, for assuredly death
would be to me a rich pleasure."
</p><p>Then said Theban: "What is that your enterprise, for the
which (not being able to perform it) you abide thus
sorrowful?"
</p><p>To whom Tarolfo answered: "It is such as seems to me
impossible to be able ever to attain, since hitherto I have
here found no counsel."
</p><p>Then said Theban: "Dare you utter it?"
</p><p>Tarolfo answered: "Yea, but what profits it?"
</p><p>"Peradventure nothing," said Theban, "but what does it
hurt?"
</p><p>Then said Tarolfo: "I seek counsel how may be had in
the coldest month, a garden full of flowers, fruits and herbs,
as fair as if it were in the month of May.  Neither do I
find who can therein either help me or give me encouragement
that it is possible to be had."
</p><p>Theban stayed a while in a muse without answer, and
after said: "You and many others do judge the skill and

<pb n="51"/>

virtue of men according to their garments.  If my goods
were such as are yours, you would not have lingered so long
in discovering your lack.  Or if peradventure you had found
me near unto some rich prince, as you have in gathering of
herbs.  But many times under the vilest vesture are hidden
the greatest treasures of science, and therefor no one
conceals his lack to whom is proffered counsel or help; and if
therefor he opens the same it cannot prejudice him at all.
But what would you give him that should bring to effect
that which you go about thus seeking for?"
</p><p>Tarolfo beheld him in the face as he uttered these words,
and doubted lest he went about to deride him for that it
seemed to him incredible that he should be able to bring
the same to pass unless he were a god.  Notwithstanding he
answered him thus:
</p><p>"I have under my rule in my country many castles and
therwithal great treasures, all the which I would divide
with him evenly that would give me so great a pleasure."
</p><p>"Truly," said Theban, "if you would do so much for
me, I should no more need to go thus about in gathering
of herbs."
</p><p>"Assuredly," said Tarolfo, "if you be able to give true
effect to what you promise and give it to me indeed, you
shall never need to care nor yet to trouble yourself to
become rich.  But how and when can you bring me this to
pass?"
</p><p> Then said Theban: "The time when shall be at your
choice, but for the manner how trouble not yourself.  And
I will go with you, trusting unto the word and promise you
have made me, and when we shall be there where it pleases
you to be, command what you would have done and I shall
without fail perform the same."
</p><p>Of this good fortune Tarolfo was so well contented in

<pb n="52"/>

himself as little more gladness could he have received if
he had then held his lady embraced in his arms, and said:
"Friend, unto me it seems long until you have performed
what you have promised; wherefor let us depart without
further tarrying and go thither where this is to be done."
</p><p>Theban cast away his herbs and took his books and other
things necessary unto his science, and with Tarolfo took
his journey, and in short time they both came unto the
desired city, very near unto the month in which the garden had
been required to be made.  Whereas all secret and close they
did repose themselves until the wished time.
</p><p>And now the month being entered, Tarolfo commanded
the garden to be made to the end that he might give the
same to his loved lady.
</p><p>So soon as Theban had received this command he tarried
the night ensuing, the which being once come he saw the
horns of the moon gathered into a perfect roundness and
to shine upon the frequented earth.  Then he went him all
alone forth of the city, leaving his apparel apart,
bare-legged, and his dishevelled locks hanging upon his naked
shoulders.  The restless degrees of the night did pass.  Birds,
wild beasts and men without any noise did take their rest.
The unfallen leaves without moving did hang upon the
trees, and the moist air abode in mild peace.  Only the stars
did shine when as he oftentimes went about the grounds
and came unto a place on a riverside, which it pleased him to
choose for his garden.
</p><p>There he stretched forth his arm three times towards the
stars, and turning himself unto them he as often bathed his
white locks in the running stream, crying as many times with
a most high voice their help.  And after setting his knees
to the hard earth, began thus to say:
</p><p>"O night, most faithful secreter of high things, and you,

<pb n="53"/>


O ye stars, which together with the moon do succeed the
splendid day, and thou, O singular Hecates, become a helper
to this my begun enterprise.  And thou, O holy Ceres, the
renewer of the ample face of the earth, also.  And you
whatsoever verses either arts or herbs, and thou whatsoever are
bringing forth virtuous plants, and thou, O air, winds,
mountains, rivers and lakes, and each god of the woods, and
of the secret night, by whose help I have heretofore made
the running streams to recoil, forcing them to return to
their springs, and things running to become firm, and things
firm to become running, and that has also given power to
my verses to dry up the seas, that I at my pleasure might
search the bottom thereof, and to make the cloudy times
clear and (at my will) to fill the clear heavens with
obscure clouds, to make the winds to cease and to turn as it
seemed me best breaking therewith the hard jaws of the
fearful dragon, making also the standing woods to move and
the high mountains to tremble, and to return to their bodies
out of the lake Styx those their shadows, and alive to come
forth of their sepulchers, and sometimes thee, O moon, to
draw to thy perfect roundness the attaining whereunto a
ring of basons was wont to be a help, making also the clear
face of the sun many times to become pale, be ye all present
and aid me with your help.  I have at this instant need of
the sap and juice of herb, through which I may make in
part the dry earth fastened through autumn and after
through the withering cold winter, spoil of his flowers, fruits
and herbs, to become flowering and to spring before the due
time."
</p><p>And having thus said, he said after many other things
softly which he added unto his prayers.  And these being
ended and he a while silent, the stars gave not their light
in vain.  For more swifter than the flight of swiftest bird

Questions Of Love

there appeared before him a chariot drawn by two dragons,
whereupon he mounted, and taking the reins of the bridles
of the two bridled dragons in his hand, was carried into the
air.
</p><p>He then leaving Spain and all Africa took his journey by
other regions and first sought for the Isle of Crete.  And
from thence after with a short course he sought Pelion,
Othrys and Ossa, Mount Nerium, Pachinus, Pelorus, and
Appenine.  Upon them all, plucking up and with a sharp
sickle cutting such roots and herbs as best liked him, neither
forgot he those which he had before gathered when he was
found by Tarolfo in Thessaly.  He took stones also upon the
mount Caucasus and on the sands of Ganges; and out of
Lybia he brought lungs of venemous serpents.
</p><p>He searched the watery banks of Rodanus, of Seine at
Paris and the great Po, of Arnus, of the imperial Tiber, of
Niscus, of Tana and Danube; on those eke gathering such
herbs as seemed to him most necessary for his purpose,
putting these together with the others gathered on the tops of
the savage mountains.
</p><p>He also sought the islands of Lesbos and Patmos and
every other wherein he perceived any profitable thing to
be had for his attempt.
</p><p>With all which things he came (the third day being not
yet passed) to that place from whence he departed and the
dragons that only had felt the odor of the gathered herbs
did cast off their old hides of many years and were with
new renewed and became young.  There he dismounted from
his chariot and on the green earth he made two altars, on
his right hand that of Hecates and on the left that of the
running goddess.  That being done and devout fires
kindled thereupon, with locks dispersed upon his old shoulders,
he began with a murmuring noise to go about the same

<pb n="55"/>

and with let blood oftentimes he bespread the blazing
brands.
</p><p>After he placed the same blood upon the altars
sometimes softening therewithal appointed for his garden, and
after that he softened again the selfsame three times, with
fire, water and sulphur, setting after a great vessel full of
blood, milk and water upon the burning brands, which he
caused to boil a good space, and put thereto the herbs and
roots gathered in strange places, mingling therewith also
divers seeds and flowers of unknown herbs, he added thereto
stones, sought in the extreme parts of the east, and dew
gathered the nights past, together with the flesh of
infamous witches, the stones of a wolf, the hinder part of a
fat Cyniphis and the skin of a Chilinder.  And lastly a liver,
with the lungs of an exceeding old hart and herewithal a
thousand other things, both without name and so strange
as my memory cannot again tell them.
</p><p>After he took a dry bough of an olive tree and therewith
began to mingle all these things together, in doing whereof
the dry bough began to wax green and within a while after
to bear leaves; and not long after the new apparelling
thereof, it was laden with black olives.  As Theban saw this
he took the boiling liquors and began therewithal to
sprinkle and water in every place the chosen soil, whereon he
had set slips of so many woods as he would have trees, and
of as many sorts as could be found.
</p><p>The which liquor the earth had no sooner tasted but that
it began to spring, yielding flowers and new herbs, and the
dry slips began to become all green and fruitful plants.
</p><p>All this being done, Theban entering the city returned
to Tarolfo, whom he found all in a muse, fearing to be
scorned through his long abode.  To whom he said: "Tarolfo,
the thing you required is done to your liking."

<pb n="56"/>

</p><p>This news pleased Tarolfo not a little, and happening the
day following to be a great solemnity in the city, he went
into the presence of his loved lady, who had not now seen
him for a long time past.  And thus he said to her:
</p><p>"Madame, after a long and tedious travail I have
performed that which you have commanded, and whenas it
shall please you to see it or to take it, it is ready at your
pleasure."
</p><p>She in seeing him marvelled much, and the more hearing
what he said and not believing the same to be true, made
him this answer: "It pleaseth me right well.  You shall let
me see it tomorrow."
</p><p>The second day was come and Tarolfo went again to his
lady and said: "Madame, may it please you to walk to the
garden, the which you required to have this cold month."
</p><p>She then, accompanied by many others, was moved to
see the same; and they all being come to the garden entered
therein by a fair portal, whereas they felt not the cold as
abroad but the same to have a sweet temperate air.  The lady
went about the same and into every corner thereof,
gathering both herbs and flowers, whereof she saw it very
plentiful.  And thus much more also had the virtue of the magical
liquors wrought; the fruits which August was accustomed
to bring forth, the trees there in this savage time did yield
them very fair, whereof sundry did eat that accompanied the
lady thither.
</p><p>This garden seemed to the lady exceeding fair and
admirable, neither did she think to have ever seen the like, and
since she sundry ways knew it to be a true garden and the
knight to have performed her request, she came toward him
and said: "Without doubt, Sir Knight, you have deserved
my love, and I am ready to stand to my promise.  But I
would pray of you this favour: that it would please you to

<pb n="57"/>

tarry the time or ever you require me to your desire, that
my knight be gone a-hunting or into some other place out of
the city, to the end you may the more safely and without
any suspicion take your delight of me."
</p><p>This contented Tarolfo, who left her the garden and
so departed.  This garden was manifest to the whole country
although never a one knew of a long time how it came to
pass.  And the lady that had now received it all sorrowful
departed from the same.  Returning to her chamber full of
noisome care and grief, bethinking her in what way she
might return back according to her promise; and as not
finding any lawful excuse, so much the more increased her care.
The which thing her husband espying began many times and
often to marvel thereat, and to ask the cause of that her
grief, to whom she answered: that she ailed nothing, being
bashful to discover to him her given promise for her craved
gift, doubting lest in so doing he should account her for
lewd.  Lastly she being unable to withstand the continual
instigations of her husband that now still importunately
desired to know the cause of her annoy, discoursed the same
unto him from the beginning to the end, and that therefor
she abode thus pensive.
</p><p>The husband hearing this of long time suspected no less
and thereby knowing in his conceit the purity of the lady,
thus said unto her: "Go and covertly keep your oath and
liberally perform to Tarolfo what you have promised.  For
he has with his great toil, of rights deserved the same."
</p><p>And having thus said the lady began to weep and to say
unto him: "'The gods keep me far from such a fault, in no
wise will I so do.  I will rather rid myself of life than do
anything displeasing to you or dishonour to your person."
</p><p>To whom the knight replied saying: "Wife for this
matter that I will that you do no injury to yourself neither yet

<pb n="58"/>

conceive any grief therefor.  For in no wise shall it displease
me. Go therefor and perform what you have promised.  For
you shall never be never a whit less dear to me but as you
have performed this your promise to take you better heed
hereafter of such like although a demanded gift may seem
unto you impossible to be had."
</p><p>As the lady perceived the will of her husband she decked
and trimmed her and made herself very fair; took
company with her and so went to Tarolfo's lodging and
bepainted with bashfulness presented herself unto him.
Tarolfo as soon as he saw her all marvelling rose from
Theban and encountered her with great gladness and very
honourable received her demanding the cause of her
coming.
</p><p>To whom she answered: "I am come to be wholly at
your will.  Do with me as it pleases you."
</p><p>Then said Tarolfo: "You make me to muse above
measure considering the time and the company wherewith you
are come.  This cannot be without some great alteration
between you and your husband.  Tell me therefor, I pray
you, how the matter goes."
</p><p>The lady then showed Tarolfo fully in order the whole
matter and how it went, the which Tarolfo hearing he began
then to enter into a far greater admiration than he had
ever done before.  And greatly to bethink him thereof and
so in the end to conceive the great liberality of the husband
that had sent his wife unto him.  Whereupon he said to
himself: whatsoever he be that should so much as but think
villainy toward such a knight were surely worthy of great
blame.
</p><p>And so taking and talking with the lady he thus said unto
her: "Madame, like a worthy lady you have performed
what to me due is, for the which cause I account that

<pb n="59"/>

received of your hands that I have of you desired.  And
therefore when it shall please you you may return unto
your husband, and thank him, I pray you, on my behalf.
For this is so great a pleasure done unto me and excuse me
of the folly I have heretofor committed towards him,
assuring him that hereafter I shall never put the like in
practice."
</p><p>The lady, giving great thanks to Tarolfo for that his so
great courtesy, merrily departed thence and returned to her
husband, to whom she recited in order all that had been
happened.
</p><p>But Theban now coming to Tarolfo demanded how the
case stood.  Tarolfo declared unto him the whole discourse.
To whom Theban then said: "And I, shall I then lose that
which you have promised me?"
</p><p>Tarolfo answered: "No, but when it pleases you take you
half of all the castles and treasures I have in sort heretofor
promised you.  For I acknowledge that you have fully
served my turn."
</p><p>To whom Theban answered: "It may never please the
gods since the knight was so liberal to you of his wife, and
you again was not a villain to him and that his offer, that I
become less than courteous.  For above all things in the
world that content me in that I have served your turn, and
therefore I will that all that I ought to receive in payment
of my travail remain all yours, in such sort as it has ever
been heretofor."
</p><p>Neither would he take of what was Tarolfo's anything at
all.
</p><p>It is now doubted, in which of these was the greatest
liberality, either in the knight that had given liberty to his
wife to go to Tarolfo, either in Tarolfo who sent the lady
(whom he had always desired and for whose sake he had

<pb n="60"/>

done so much to come to that pass, whereunto he was come,
whenas she came unto him) back unto her husband free, or
in Theban, who having abandoned his country, being now
old for to gain the promised rewards, and being come
thither, toiled himself to bring that to an end which he had
promised, whereby he justly deserved the same, did now
remit the whole to Tarolfo, and remained poor as he was
at the first.
</p><p>"Very excellent is both the tale and the demand," said
the queen.  "Of truth each one was very liberal, considering
the first of his honour, the second of his lascivious desire
and the third that of his rewarded riches, was very courteous.
Now if we will know which of them used the greatest
liberality or courtesy, it is meet we consider which of these
three deeds is most acceptable.  The which being well weighed
we shall manifestly know the most liberal, because who most
gives is to be held most liberal.
</p><p>"Of the which three the one is dear, that is Honour, the
which Paulus Aemilius vanquishing Perseus, King of
Macedonia, rather desired than to gain treasures.  The second is to
be fled, that is, the wanton delights of Venus, according to
the sentence of Sophocles and of Xenocrates, saying that lust
is to be fled as a furious government.  The third is not to be
desired, that is, riches, for so much as the most times they
are noisome to a virtuous life; and to such a one as can
virtuously live with moderate poverty as lived Marcus
Curtius, Attilius Regulus and Valerius Publicola, as by their
works is manifest.
</p><p>"If then of these three only honour is to be held dear, and
the others not, he used the greatest liberality that gave his
wife to another, although he did less than wisely therein.
He was also the chiefest in liberality wherein the others
followed him.  Therefor, according to our judgment, he

<pb n="61"/>

that gave his wife, in whom consisted his honour, was above
the rest the most liberal."
</p><p>"I," said Menedon, "agree that inasmuch as you have
thus said it be as you say.  But yet each one of the others
seems to me to be more liberal, and you shall hear now.  It
is very true that the first granted his wife but he used therein
not so great a liberality as you speak of because if he would
have denied her he might not justly have done it, by reason
of the oath she made, the which was convenient for her to
keep.  And therefor that he may not deny does but well in
making himself liberal thereof.  And it was but a trifle he
gave, and therefor (as I have said) each one of the others
was more courteous.
</p><p>"And for that (as it is already said) Tarolfo had now a
long time desired this lady and loved her far above all
others.  He, for to attain her, had of long time abode great
troubles, offering himself to satisfy her request, to seek
for things almost impossible to be had, the which now
obtained he deserved (through her promised faith) to obtain
her also, whom (as we say) being obtained there is no doubt
but that the honour of the husband the release of that she
had promised (the which he released) was in his hands.
Then was he, to conclude, liberal both of the honour of the
husband of the oath of his lady and of his own long desire.
</p><p>"It is a great matter to have endured long thirst and to
come to a pleasant fountain and not to drink, but to suffer
others to drink.
</p><p>"The third was also very liberal considering that poverty
is one of the most loathesome things of the world to bear,
for so much as it is the chaser-away both of mirth and of
rest, a stealer of honour, a frequenter of virtue and the
inducer of crabbed care, so that everyone naturally endeavour
themselves with a fiery desire to flee the same, the which

<pb n="62"/>

desire is so kindled in many to the end to live splendidly in
rest, as they give themselves no less to dishonest gain than
to disordinate expenses, peradventure not knowing or not
otherwise being able to feed that their desire which is cause
many times either of death or of exile.
</p><p>"How much then ought to riches to please and to be
acceptable unto them that in due sort do both gain and possess
them? And who will doubt that Theban was not most poor,
if he behold how he, abandoning his night's rest, went
gathering of herbs and digging up of roots in doubtful
places, for the better sustenance of his poor life? And that
this poverty did occupy his virtue may be also believed in
hearing how Tarolfo deemed to be by him deceived when
he beheld him apparelled in vile vesture and seeing him
desirous to shake off that misery to become rich, knowing he
came as far as from Thessaly to Spain, hazarding himself to
perilous chances, through doubtful journeys and uncertain
air, to the end to perform the promise he had made, and to
receive the like from another.
</p><p>"Also it may be evidently seen that without doubt who
gives himself to such and so many mysteries to the end to
flee poverty knows the same to be full of all grief and
troubles.  And how much the more he has shaken off the
greatest poverty and is entered a rich life so much the more
is the same life acceptable unto him.
</p><p>"Then who that is become of poor, rich, if therewith his
life delights him, how great and what manner of liberality
does he use if he gives the same away and consents to
return to that state the which he has with so many troubles
fled? Assuredly he does a thing exceeding great and liberal.
And this seems far greater than the rest, considering also
the age of the giver that was now old, forasmuch as avarice
was wont to be continually of greater force in old men than

<pb n="63"/>

of young.  Whereupon I gather that each one of the two
following have used the greater liberality than had the first,
so much commended by you; and the third far more than
either of the others."
</p><p>"In how much your reason might be well by anyone
defended, so well is the same defended by you," said the
queen, "but we mind to show unto you briefly how our
judgment rather than yours ought to take place.
</p><p>"You will say that he showed no liberality at all,
granting the use of his wife to another, because of reason it was
convenient to the oath made by the lady that he should do
so.  The which ought to be indeed if the oath might hold.
But the wife, forsomuch as she is a member of her husband,
or rather one body with him, could not justly make such an
oath without the will of her husband.  And yet if she did
make such an oath it was nothing, because the first oath
lawfully made could not with reason be denied by any
following, chiefly not by those that are not duly made for a
necessary cause.
</p><p>"And the manner is in matrimonial unitings the man to
swear to be content with the woman and the woman with
the man, and never to change the one the other for another.
Now then the woman cannot swear and if she do swear (as
we have said) she swears for a thing unlawful, and so
contrary to the former oath it ought not to prevail, and not
prevailing otherwise then for his pleasure he ought not to
commit his wife to Tarolfo.  And if he do commit her to
him then is he liberal of his honour, and not Tarolfo as
you hold opinion.  Neither could he be liberal of his oath in
releasing it forasmuch as the oath was nothing.
</p><p>"Then only remain Tarolfo liberal of his wanton desire,
the which thing of proper duty is convenient for every
man to do, because we all through reason are bound to

<pb n="64"/>

banish vice, and to follow virtue.  And who that does that,
whereunto he is of reason bound, is (as you have said)
nothing at all liberal but that which is done more than duty
requires may well and justly be termed liberality.
</p><p>"But because you peradventure in silence argue in your
mind what honour may that be of a chaste woman to her
husband which ought to be so dear, we will prolong
somewhat our talk, in showing you to the end that you may the
more clearly see that.  Tarolfo and Theban, of whom we
intend next to speak, used no liberality in respect of the
knight.
</p><p>"You shall know that chastity, together with the other
virtues, yield no other reward to the possessors thereof than
honour, the which honour among virtuous men makes the
least virtuous the most excellent.  This honour, if men with
humility seek to support it, it makes them friends to God
and so by consequence to live and after death to possess
the goods eternal.  The which if the woman conserves for
her husband he may live merrily and certain of his offspring,
and frequent in open sight among the people content to see
her for such her virtues honoured among the most high
and chiefest dames.  And in his mind is manifest token that
she is good, fears God and loves him, which is no small
pleasure, seeing she is given him for an everlasting
companion, indivisible saving by death.  He, through this
obtained favour, is seen continually to increase both in spiritual
and worldly wealth.
</p><p>"And so on the contrary he whose wife has default of
such virtues can never pass one hour with true consolation.
Nothing is acceptable unto him and continually the one
desires the death of the other.  He perceives himself
through this disordered voice to be carried in the mouths of
the veriest misers, neither seems it unto him that such a

<pb n="65"/>

fault should not be believed of whomsoever it is heard.  And
if she were largely endowed with all other virtues yet this
vice seems to have such a force as to bring her in contempt
and to utter ruin.
</p><p>"Then is this honour that makes the woman both chaste
and good to her husband a most great gift and so is to be
held most dearly.  Blessed may he be called to whom
through grace is granted such a gift, although we believe
they are but few towards whom is born envy for so great a
benefit.
</p><p>"But to return unto our purpose it to be seen how much
the knight did give.  It is not fled our memory whenas you
said that Theban was of the rest most liberal, who being with
trouble enriched had not doubted to return into the misery
of poor estate in giving away that which he had gotten.  It
appears that you are evil acquainted with poverty, who if
she come unto us merry surmounts all riches.
</p><p>"Theban now peradventure through the attained wealth
felt himself replete of sundry sour cares.  He did now
imagine that it seemed Tarolfo to have done very evil and
therefor would practice by murdering him to recover again
his castles.  He abode in fear to be peradventure betrayed of
his tenants.  He was entered into care touching the
government of his lands.  He now knew all the prepared guiles to
be done unto his co-partner.  He saw himself greatly envied
for his riches and doubted lest these should secretly spoil
him thereof.  He was stuffed with so many such and sundry
thoughts and cares as all quietness was fled from him.
Through the which occasion calling to mind his former life
and that without so many cares he passed the same merrily,
he said to himself: I desire to grow rich to the end to attain
great rest, but I see it is the increaser of troubles and
cogitations, so it is the flier of quietness.  And therefor desirous to

<pb n="66"/>


be in his former estate he rendered them all to him by
whom they were given.
</p><p>"Poverty is the refused riches, a goodness unknown, a
fire of provocation, the which was of Diogenes fully
understood.  As much suffices poverty as nature requires.  He lives
safe from every deceit that patiently approaches therewith,
neither is he disabled to attain to great honours that (as we
have said) virtuously lives therewith.  And therefor as
Theban rejected this allurement he was not liberal but wise.
So gracious he was to Tarolfo in that it pleased him to give
the same rather to him than another, whereas he might have
bestowed the same upon many others.
</p><p>"Then to conclude, the knight was more liberal that
granted his honour than any of the others.  And think this
one thing, that the honour he gave was not to be again
recovered, the which happens not in many other things, as of
battles, prowess and others like, for if they are at one time
lost they are recovered at another, and the same is possible.
Therefor this may suffice for answer unto your demand."</p>

THE FIFTH QUESTION,<lb/>
PROPOSED BY CLONICO</head>

<p>AFTER the queen became silent and Menedon
satisfied, a worthy young gentleman called Clonico,
that sat next to Menedon, thus began to say:
</p><p>Most mighty queen, this gentlewoman's tale has been so
excellent and therewithal so long, as I in what I may shall
briefly shew unto you this my concept, to the end the rest
may the better at their more leisure say theirs.  Then
forasmuch as I, though very young, know the life of the subjects
of our lord Love to be replete with many cares and sundry
pining provocations, yet with small delight I have long time
as I was able fled the like, rather eschewing than
commending them which follow him.  And although I was sundry
times tempted, yet with a valiant mind (leaving the pitched
snares) I always resisted; but because I being not strong
enough, could no way resist that force whereunto Phoebus
was unable to gainstand Cupid, having taken heart to bring
me into the number of his thralls, was taken before I knew
how.
</p><p>For, one day being allured abroad through the fresh
renewed time, walking all merry, and for my delight
gathering of shell-fish upon the salt sea banks, it happened as I
turned my eyes towards the glittering waves I suddenly saw
a little bark coming towards me, as wherein with one only

<pb n="68"/>

mariner, were four young gentlewomen, so fair as it was a
marvelous thing to behold the beauty they seemed to have.
</p><p>They now being approached somewhat near unto me and
I not having yet turned my eye from them, saw in the
midst of them an exceeding great light, wherein as my
estimation gave me, methought I saw the figure of an angel,
very young and so fair as I never beheld thing more fairer.
Whom as I thus eyed methought he said unto me with a
voice far different from ours:
</p><p>"O young fool, persecuter of our power (and being
therewith arrived) I am come hither with four young damsels.
Let your eye make choice of her for your mistress that
best likes you."
</p><p>I when I heard this voice abode all appalled, and devised
both with eye and heart to avoid that which heretofor I had
many times fled.  But all was bootless for the strength of
my legs failed me and beside he had bow and wings to
overtake me quickly.  Whereupon I in gazing among them
espied one so fair, so benign of cheer and so piteous of
semblance as I imagined to make choice of her, as of a singular
mistress, saying to myself: this damsel presents herself to
humble to my eyes as assuredly she will never become enemy
to my desires, as many others have been to them, whom I
have in beholding full of troubles always scorned, but she
shall rather be a chaser-away of my annoys.
</p><p>And having thus thought I forthwith answered: "The
gracious beauty of that young damsel that (O my lord)
sits on your right hand, makes me desire to be both to you
and to her a most faithful servant.  I am therefor ready to
obey your will; do with me as shall best like you."
</p><p>I had not ended my tale but that I felt my left side
wounded with a shining shaft, shot from the bow which he
bare, as methought the same was of gold.  And assuredly I

<pb n="69"/>

saw him as he turned towards her to strike her with another,
of lead.  And thus I being in this sort taken abode in the
snares I had of long time fled.
</p><p>This young damsel has and does so much content my eye
as all other pleasure is very scarce in comparison of this;
which the espying of long time shewed herself content.  But
after that she knew me to be so taken with this delight as
not to love her was a thing impossible, incontinent she
discovered her guile towards me, with an undeserved disdain,
shewing herself in appearance a most cruel enemy, always
turning her eye the contrary way as she happened to espy
me, and with words on my part undeserved always
dispraising me, by occasion whereof I have in sundry sorts
endeavoured myself both with prayers and humility to appease her,
But being unable I oftentimes beweep and lament this my
hard fortune, neither can I anyways withdraw me from
loving her, but rather how much the more I find her cruel so
much the more methink the flame of her pleasure does set
my sorrowful heart on fire.
</p><p>As I through these occasions one day being all solitary in
a garden, bewailed my fortune with infinite sighs
accompanied with many tears, there came upon me a singular
friend of mine, to whom part of my griefs were discovered,
who with pitiful words began to comfort me the best he
could.  But I, giving thereunto no ear at all, answered him
that my misery exceeded all others.  Whereunto he made
me this answer: "A man is so much the more miserable,"
said he "as he either makes or reputes himself a miser;
but be assured I have greater cause to lament than have
you."
</p><p>I then all angry turned toward him with a disdainful
look, saying: "And how? Who can have greater cause than
I? Do I not for good receive evil recompense? Is not my

<pb n="70"/>

faithful love rewarded with hatred? So that any may be as
sorrowful as I, but more he cannot be."
</p><p>"Truly," said my friend, "I have greater cause of grief
than have you, and hear now.  It is not unknown unto you
but that I have of long time and yet do love a gentlewoman,
as you know.  Neither was there ever anything that I thought
might pleasure her which I gave not myself with all my wit
and power to being to effect.  And truly when she understood
the sum of that I desired, she made me a gracious gift, the
which as I had received and receiving it at what time it
pleased me, methought none by a great way to have a life
comparable to mine in gladness.
</p><p>"Only one thing pricked me, that I could not make her
believe how perfectly I loved her.  Further than this, she
perceiving me to love her (as I said) passed lightly for me.
But the gods that will grant no wordly good turn without
some bitterness, to the end that the heavenly may be the
better known and by consequence the more desired, it
happened one day as I abode with her all alone in a secret place,
seeing without being again seen by them that passed by,
espied a proper young man and of pleasant countenance to
come along by us, whom she beheld (as I perceived) with a
fired eye, and being past, she fetched a pitiful sigh.  The
which I espying, said: 'Alas, do you so soon repent as that
you now sigh for the love of another?'
</p><p>"She, whose face was through this occasion painted a new
red, swearing by the power of the high gods, began with
many excuses to endeavour herself to make me believe the
contrary of that which I had received through the sigh.  But
all was to no purpose because she kindled my heart with an
anger so exceeding fierce as she made me then almost ready
to chide with her, but yet I withheld me therefrom.
</p><p>"And certainly it will never out of my mind but that she

<pb n="71"/>

loves him or some other better than me; and all those
persuasions, the which at other times heretofor she used for my
help, that was, that she loved me better than she did any
other, I now esteem them all in contrary, imagining that she
has fainedly said and done all that she has heretofor
wrought.  Whereby I endure intolerable grief, neither does
any comfort at all prevail therein, but because shame often-times does bridle the will I have rather to sorrow me than
glad me, I do not continue my bitter grief, so as I make any
appearance thereof.  But briefly, I am never without cares
and cogitations, the which bring me far greater annoy than
I willingly would.  Learn then to bear the less griefs since
you see the greatest with a valiant mind borne of me."
</p><p>To whom I answered: That as it seemed to me, his grief,
though it were great was no ways to be compared to mine.
He answered me the contrary, and thus we abode in a long
contention, and in the end parted without any definition.
Wherefor I pray you that you will say your judgment
hereof.
</p><p>"Young gentleman," said the queen, "great is that pain
of yours and great wrong does the damsel commit in not
loving you.  But yet all times your grief may by hope be
eased, the which happens not to your companion, because
that since he is once entered in suspect nothing is able to
draw it away.  Therefor continually while love lasts he
sorrows without comfort.  So that in our judgment greater
seems the grief of the jealous than that of the unloved
lover."
</p><p>Then said Clonico: "O noble queen, since you say so, it
plainly appears that you have always been loved again of
him whom you have loved.  By occasion whereof you hardly
know what my pain is.  How may it appear that jealousy
brings greater grief than is that I feel? For so much as the

<pb n="72"/>

jealous possess that he desires, and may in holding the same
take more delight thereof in one hour than in a long time
after to feel any pain through want thereof.  And
nevertheless he may (through experience) abandon such jealousy
if it happen that this judgment be found false.  But I being
kindled with a fiery desire, how much the more I see myself
far off from attaining the same so much the more I burn
and consume myself assaulted of a thousand instigations.
Neither is any experience able to help me therein because
through the often reproving her and finding her every hour
the more sharp, I live desperate.  Wherefor your answer
seems contrary to the truth, because I doubt not but that it
is much better to hold with suspicion than to desire with
tears."
</p><p>"That amorous flame that does shine in our eyes and that
every hour does adorn our sight with the greater beauty,
does never consent," replied the queen, "that we love in
vain, as you affirm.  But for all that it is not unknown to us
how great and what manner of pain that is both of the one
and of the other and therefor as our answer has been
confirmable to the truth, one thing we will shew to you.  It is
manifest that those things which most do hinder the quiet of
the mind are cares, the which are some of them come to
a merry end, so some we see to end with great sorrow,
whereof how much more the mind is replete so much the
more has it of grief, and chiefest whenas the same are
noisome.  And that the jealous have more store thereof than
have you is manifest because you heed nothing else but only
to get the good-will of the damsel whom you love.  The
which not being able to attain is to you grief most grievous.
</p><p>"But yet it is certain that it may easily come to pass to
attain the same at one instant, not thinking thereof (for so
much as womens hearts are inconstant) besides peradventure

<pb n="73"/>

she loves you notwithstanding (to prove if you also
love her) she shows the contrary, and so perhaps will show
until such time as she shall be well assured of your love.
So that with these thoughts hope can mitigate unfeigned
grief.
</p><p>"But the jealous has his mind full fraught of infinite
cares, against the which neither hope nor other delight can
bring comfort or ease the pain.  For he stands intentive to
give a law to the wandering eyes, the which his possessor
cannot give.  He will and does endeavour himself to give a
law to the feet, to the hands and to every other act of his
mistress.  He will be a circumspect knower both of her
thoughts and of her mirth interpreting everything in evil
part towards himself, believing that each one desires and
loves her whom he loves.  Likewise he imagines every word
that she speaks to be twain and full of deceit.  And if he ever
committed any detraction towards her it is death to him to
remember it, imagining to be by the like means deceived.
</p><p>"He will with conjectures shut up the ways of the air and
of the earth.  And briefly the heavens, the earth, the birds,
beasts and every other creature that he thinks does hinder
his devices.  And to remove him from this hope has no place,
because in this doing if he find a woman faithful he thinks
that she espies that which he does, and is therefor heedful
therein.  If he finds that he seeks for, and that he would not
find, who is more dolorous than he? If peradventure you
think that the embracing her in his arms be so great a delight
to him as should mitigate these pangs, your judgment is
then false, because such brings him in choler in thinking that
others as well as he have embraced her in the like sort.  And
if the woman peradventure do lovingly entertain him, he
deems that she does it to the end to remove him from such
his imaginations, and not for the true love she bears him.  If

<pb n="74"/>

he finds her maliciously disposed he thinks that she then
loves another and is not content with him.
</p><p>"And thus we can shew you an infinite number of other
suspicions and cares that are harbored in a jealous person.
What shall we then say of his life but that it is far more
grievous than that of any other living creature? He lives
believing and not believing, and still alluring the woman.
And most times it happens that these jealous persons do end
their lives through the selfsame malice, whereof they live
fearful, and not without cause, for that with their reprehensions
they show the way unto their own harm.
</p><p>"Considering then the aforesaid reasons more cause has
your friend that is jealous to sorrow than have you, because
you may hope to get and he lives in fear to lose that which
he scarcely holds for his own.  And therefor if he have more
cause of grief than you, and yet comforts himself the best he
can, much more ought you to comfort yourself and to set
aside bewailings that are meet for faint hearts; and hope
that the assured love which you bear toward your lady shall
not lose his due desert.  For though she shew herself sharp
toward you at this present, it cannot be but that she loves
you, because that love never pardoned any loved to love;
and you shall know that with the fierce vehement winds are
sooner broken the stubborn oaks than the consenting reeds."</p>

THE SIXTH QUESTION,<lb/>
PROPOSED BY A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN</head>

<p>NEXT to Clonico sat a fair gentlewoman apparelled
in a black vesture, under an honest veil, who as
she perceived the queen to have made an end of
her words thus began to say:
</p><p>Most gracious queen, I remember that being a little girl,
how one day I with my brother, who was a proper young
man and of ripe years, abode all alone in a garden without
other company.  And in tarrying there together, it happened
that two young damsels of noble blood, abounding in riches,
and born in this our city, who loved this my brother very
well, and perceiving him to be in the said garden, came
thither and began afar off to behold him that was altogether
ignorant of their purpose.
</p><p>And after a while, seeing him all alone saving for me of
whom they reckoned naught because I was but a little one,
thus the one began to say to the other:
</p><p>"We love this young gentleman above all others, neither
do know whether he loves us or no.  Yet is it meet that he
loves us both.  So that now it is lawful for us to satisfy our
desire and to know whether he love either of us or which
of us he best loves, to the end that she to whom he shall
best like may after remain his without being hindered of the
other.  Wherefor since he is all alone and that we have a

<pb n="76"/>
<pb n="77"/>
<pb n="78"/>

meet time offered, let us run into him and each one embrace
and kiss him.  That done he shall take which of us best
pleases him."
</p><p>These two young gentlewomen being thus determined
upon this resolution, began to run their race towards my
said brother.  Whereat he marvelled greatly, espying them,
and seeing in what sort they came.  But the one of them or
ever she came at us by a good way stayed all bashful, and
almost weeping ripe.  The other ran through and came to
him, whom she embraced and kissed, and so sat her down
by him, recommending herself unto him.
</p><p>And he, after the admiration conceived of her boldness,
was somewhat crassed, prayed her as ever she loved him to
tell him truly what moved them thus to do.  She concealed
nothing from him, the which he hearing, and examining
well in his mind that which the one and other had done,
knew not how to persuade himself which of them best loved
him, neither yet which of them he might best love.
</p><p>And so happening at that time to depart from them he
after prayed counsel of many of his friends touching this
matter.  Neither has anyone ever satisfied his desire touching
that demand.  For the which cause (I pray you) from whom
I assuredly believe to have a true definition of this my
question, that you will tell me which of these two damsels
ought soonest to be loved of the young man.
</p><p>To this gentlewoman the queen thus made answer:
</p><p>"Truly of the two young women, she as it seems loved
your brother best and soonest ought to be loved of him
again that (doubting) bashfully abode without embracing
him.  And why I thus think, this is the reason: Love (as we
know) makes those always fearful in whom he does abide.
And where he is of greatest force there is likewise the greatest
fear.  And this happens because the intent or consent of

<pb n="79"/>

the person loved cannot be fully known.  And if it could be
known many things should be done that in fearing to offend
are left undone, because the one knows that in displeasing
is taken away every occasion to be loved; and with this fear
and love shamefulness is always accompanied, and not
without reason.
</p><p>"Returning then to our question.  We say that it was an
act of one unfeignedly enamoured, that of the gentlewoman,
whereby she showed herself both fearful and bashful.  And
that of the other was rather the part of one both lewd and
licentious.  And therefor he being of her best beloved, ought
the rather (according to our judgment) to love her best."
</p><p>Then answered the gentlewoman: "Most courtous queen,
it is true that where love abides with moderation there fear
and bashfulness does altogether frequent; but where he
does abound in such quantity as he takes away the sight
from the most wise (as is already said) I say that fear has
there no place, but that the motions of him that feels the
same are according to him that urges them forwards.  And
therefor that gentlewoman, seeing her desire before her
eyes, was so hotly kindled as all shamefulness abandoned
she ran straight to him by whom she was so vehemently
pricked forwards as till then unable to abide.  The other,
not so much inflamed, observed the amorous terms, being
bashful and remaining behind, as you say.  So that then she
that ran loved most, and most ought to be loved again."
</p><p>"Discreet gentlewoman," said the queen, "true it is that
excessive love takes away the sight and every other due
perseverance in things that are aught of this nature, but not
in these that belong unto him, the which as he increases so
grow they.  Then how great a quantity of love is found in
anyone, so much the more fear (as we said at the first) is
there also found.  And that this is true, the cruel heart of

<pb n="80"/>

Bibylis does manifest the same unto us, who how much she
loved was seen by the sequel thereof.  For she seeing herself
abandoned and refused, had not the audacity to discover
herself with her proper words but writing, she disclosed her
unfitting desire.  Likewise Phaedra many times gave the
attempt to go to Hippolytus, to whom she thought boldly
to speak and to tell how much she loved him; but the words
she had to utter no sooner came into her mouth but they
stayed upon her tongue and there died.
</p><p>"Oh how fearful is the person that loves! Who has been
more mighty than Alcides, to whom satisfied not the victory
of human things, but also he gave himself to bear up the
heavens; and notwithstanding, was lastly so enamoured not
of a woman but of a young wench, a slave, which he had
gained, as fearing her commandments did like an humble
subject or servant even the very basest things.  Also Paris in
what he durst not attempt, neither with eye nor tongue, in
the presence of his love, with his finger writing first her
name with wine that had been spilt wrote after: I love you.
</p><p>"How far passing all these does Pasiphae bring us a due
example of fear, the which without any reasonable intention,
yea, and without understanding, durst not so much as
express her desire to a beast; but with her proper hands
gathering the soft grass endeavoured herself to make him benign
unto her, oftentimes decking herself at the glass for to please
him and to kindle him in the like desire that she was in, to
the end he might attempt to seek that which she durst not
demand.
</p><p>"It is not meet for a woman enamoured, neither for any
other, to be prompt and ready, forasmuch as the great
shamefastedness only which ought to be in us does remain as the
guarder of our honour.  We have the voice among men (and
the truth is so) to know better how to hide the amorous flame

<pb n="81"/>

than they do, and nothing else engendereth this in us but
the great fear which does rather occupy our forces than those
of men.  How many has there been of them (and peradventure
we have known some) which many times have
caused themselves to have been bidden, to the end thereby
they might have achieved to the amorous effects, the which
willingly would rather have bidden the bidder, before he
them, if due bashfulness and fear had not detained them.
And not only that but every time that No is escaped their
mouth, they have had in their minds a thousand repentings,
saying from their hearts a thousand times, Yea.
</p><p>"Their remains then the like scellerate fire on the behalf
of Semiramis and Cleopatra, the which loved not but sought
to quiet the rage of their wanton wiles, and the same being
quieted they after remembered not themselves the one or the
other.  Wise merchants unwillingly do adventure at one time
all their treasures to the hazard of fortune, and yet
notwithstanding they care not to grant her some small portion, the
which if they happen to lose yet do they feel no grief of
mind at all for the same.
</p><p>"The young woman therefor that embraced your brother
loved him but a little, and that little she committed to
fortune, saying: This gentleman if I may hereby get him, it
is well.  But if he refuse me there shall be no more but let
him take another.  The other, that abode all bashful,
forasmuch as she loved him above all others, she doubted to put
so great love in adventure, imagining lest this peradventure
should displease him and he so refuse her that her grief
should be then such and so much that she should die thereof.
Let therefor the second be loved before the first."</p>

THE SEVENTH QUESTION,<lb/>
PROPOSED BY GALEON</head>

<p>A CLEAR sun beam piercing through amongst the
green leaves did strike upon the aforesaid fountain
and did rebound the light thereof upon the
fair face of the adorned queen, who was thereby apparelled
with that color whereof the heavens make show whenas both
the children of Latona (from us hidden) with their stars
only give us light.  And besides the splendour it brought to
her face it did so lighten the place as among the fresh shade
it yielded a marvelous lustre to the whole company.
Further, what time the reflected rays did extend even to that
place where the laurel crown on her head on the one side
and the golden tresses on the other did determine it so
intermingled there among with twinings not artificial as
at the first sight one would have said that there had issued
forth among the green leaves a clear flame of burning fire,
which did spread in such sort as the auburn hairs were easily
seen to the standers-about.
</p><p>Galeon that was peradventure sooner or better awares of
this marvelous sight than any of the rest, (being set in circle
over against the queen, divided only with the water) did
very intentively behold the same almost as though he cared
for nothing else.  So that he moved not his mouth to the
question that was now come to his turn.

<pb n="83"/>

</p><p>To whom the queen therefor (having now both kept
silence a good space, as eke contented the witty gentlewoman)
thus said: "The only desire peradventure of the thing which
you behold stays you, tell what is the occasion that holds
you thus appalled, as in following the order of the rest
you speak not? It is only (as we believe) the gazing at our
head as if you had never seen the same before.  Tell us
first, and after as the others have propounded, even so
propound you."
</p><p>At this sudden voice Galeon lifted up his mind replete
with sweet thoughts, somewhat coming to himself, at what
time he is wont to do, that through a sudden fear does break
his golden sleep, and thus said:
</p><p>"Most noble and renowned queen, whose worthiness it
should be impossible for me to declare, my mind was so
wrapt in gracious thoughts (whenas I did so firmly look at
your head) as in beholding the bright ray streaming into the
fresh fountain and rebounding upon your face, methought
there issued forth of the water a little sprite so gentle and
gracious to see unto as he plucked my mind back to behold
that which he did and perceiving peradventure my eyes
altogether insufficient to behold so great a joy, he mounted
by the clear ray into your eyes and there for a good space
made marvelous mirth, adorning the same with a new clearness.
</p><p>"And after mounting more high I saw how he ascended
by this light (leaving his footsteps in your eyes) upon your
crown, whereas he together with the ray kindled (as it
seemed unto me) a new flame, such a one as was of yore
seen by Tanaquil, to appear to Servius Tullius a little boy
while he slept, and so went about your crown, leaping from
sprig to sprig like a little amorous bird that singing does
visit many leaves, moving your heart with sundry gestures,

<pb n="84"/>

sometimes wrapping and hiding himself therein, being more
merry every time he came forth thereof, and therewith (as
it seemed unto me) so jocund in himself as nothing more,
and that singing or with a sweet voice, he uttered these
words:

</p><p>"'Of the third rolling sky, the benign babe divine
</p><p></p><p>I am enamoured so, to nest in these two eyne,
</p><p>That doubtless die I should, were I of mortal rout:
</p><p></p><p>From twig to twig I twine, to feed this my delight,
</p><p>These golden Tresses whirling in and out:
</p><p></p><p>My self, inflaming my self, right
</p><p>So as with flame I shew th' effect, the potent might,
</p><p></p><p>Of my darts divine, piercing where I go,
</p><p>Each one wounding, that with sweet sight,
</p><p></p><p>Doth gaze her in the eyes, whereas each hour low,
</p><p>If such her pleasure be, I there descend adown,
</p><p></p><p>For of my kingdoms the queen is of great renown.'

</p><p>"And herewith he said much more, going about as at what
time you called me, and you had no sooner spoken but that
he suddenly retired into your eyes, the which sparkling like
unto the morning star, gave a new light that made all the
place to shine.  You have now heard with what joy new
thoughts have stayed me for a time."
</p><p>Philocopo and the rest marvelled not a little hereat and
turned their eyes towards their queen saw that which to hear
tell would have seemed to them impossible.  And she that
was attired with humility listened to the words that were
truly reported of her and abode with a stable countenance,
making no answer at all.  And therefor Galeon speaking in
this wise, followed with his question.
</p><p>"Most gracious queen, I desire to know whether a man

<pb n="85"/>

ought to be enamoured for his delight or no? And to
demand this many things move me, both seen, heard and held
through the sundry opinions of many."
</p><p>The queen beheld Galeon a good while in the face and
afterwards, after a certain sigh, thus made answer: "It is
convenient we speak against that which with desire we seek
to follow.  And truly that which you in asking do propound
in doubt, ought to be manifest to you.  In answering you
therefor, there shall be kept the begun order.  And he whose
subjects we are pardon us the words that we, as constrained
through force of judgment shall (more sooner than
willing) say against his divine majesty, lest thereby his
indignation do fall upon us.  And you that likewise as well as
we are his subject, with a bold mind give ear unto them,
neither do you for all that change your purpose at all.
</p><p>"And to the end that so much the better, and with a more
apparent intendment our words may be received, we will
somewhat digress from our matter, turning again thereunto
as briefly as possible we may, and thus we say:
</p><p>"Love is of three sorts, through which three all other
things are loved, some through the virtue of one and some
through the power of another, according as is the thing loved
and likewise the lover.  The first of the which three is
called honest love.  This is the good, upright and loyal love
the which of all persons ought to be received.  This the high
and first creator holds linked to his creatures, and them he
ties therewith unto him.  Through this the heavens, the
world, realms, provinces and cities do remain in their state.
Through this we do merit to be eternal possessors of the
celestial kingdom, and without this is lost all that we have
in power of well-doing.
</p><p>"The second is called love for delight.  And this is he,
whose subjects we are.  This is our god; him we do worship,

<pb n="86"/>

him we do pray unto, in him do we trust, that he may be our
contentment and that he may fully bring our desire to pass.
Of this is put the question, whereunto we shall duly answer.
</p><p>"The third is love for utility.  Of this love the world is
replenished more than of any of the other things.  This is
coupled with fortune; while she tarries he likewise abides
but if they part he is then the waster of many goods.  And
to speak unreasonably, he ought to be deemed rather hate
than love.
</p><p>"Now as touching the propounded question, we need to
speak neither of the first nor of the last.  We will speak of
the second, that is, of love for delight, to whom truly no
person that desires to lead a virtuous life ought to submit
himself, because he is the depriver of honours, the bringer
of troubles, the revealer of vices, the copious giver of vain
cares and the worthy occupier of the liberty of others; a
thing above all things to be held most dear.  What is he
then regarding his own wealth (being wise) that will not
flee such a government? Let him that may live free,
following those things that do every way increase his liberty, and
let vicious governors govern vicious vassals."
</p><p>"I did not think," said Galeon then, "to give occasion
to these my words to the lessening of this our disport, nor
to disquiet the regiment of our lord love, neither yet to
trouble the minds of any others; but did rather imagine
(you defining it according to the intent of me and many
others) that you might thereby confirm those that are his
subjects with a valiant mind, and invite those which are not,
with a greedy appetite.  But I see that your intent is all
contrary unto mine, because you with your words do show to be
three sorts of love, of the which three the first and the last
I consent they be as you say.  But the second, which answers
to my demand, you say it is much to be fled, as I hold

<pb n="87"/>

opinion, it is (as the increaser of virtue) to be followed of
him that desires a glorious end, as I believe to make
apparent unto you by this that follows.
</p><p>"This love, of whom we reason (as it may be manifest
to all the world, because we prove it) does work this
property in human hearts: that after that it has disposed the
mind to a thing which pleases, it spoils the same of all
pride and of all fierceness, making them humble in each
doing, as it is manifest unto us by Mars, whom we find that
in loving Venus became of a fierce and sharp duke in battle
a most humble lover.  It makes the greedy and covetous
liberal and courteous.  Medea, the most careful hider of her art,
after she felt his claims, liberally yielded herself, her
honour and her arts to Jason.  Who makes men more diligent
to high attempts than he? And what he can do behold by
Paris and Menelaus.  Who furthers forward the angry fires
more than does he? He shows us how oftentimes the anger
of Achilles was quieted through the sweet prayer of Polyxena.
He above all others makes men courageous and strong.
Neither know I what greater example may be given us than
that of Perseus, who for Andromache did make a marvelous
proof of his virtuous force.  He decks all them that are by
him apparelled with excellent qualities, with ornate talk,
with magnificence and with pleasantness.
</p><p>"He I say bestows upon all his subjects fineness and
gentleness.  Oh how many are the good things which proceed
from him? Who moved Virgil? Who Ovid? Who the other
poets to leave of themselves eternal fame and those their
holy verses, the which (if he had not been) should never
have come to our ears, but he? What shall we say further
of his virtues? But that he was able to give such a sweetness
to Orpheus' harp, as after that he had called to that sound
all the woods, standers-about, and made the running streams

<pb n="88"/>

to stay, and to come into his presence in mild peace the
fierce lions together with the faint-hearted harts, and all
other beasts.  He made likewise the infernal furies quiet
and gave rest and sweetness to the troubled souls, and after
all this the sound was of such Virtue as he attained to have
again his lost wife.
</p><p>"Then is he not the chaser away of honour as you say,
neither the giver of unfitting troubles, nor the provoker of
vices, nor the disposer of vain cares, nor the unworthy user
of the liberty of others.  So that everyone of whom he makes
no account and is not as yet his servant ought with all their
wit and diligence to endeavour and to occupy themselves
in the attaining the favour of such a lord, and to become
his subject, since through him he becomes virtuous.  That
which pleases the gods and men of greatest strength ought
likewise to please us.  Let such a lord therefor be loved,
served and live always in our minds."
</p><p>"Greatly deceived you your opinion," said the queen,
"and it is no marvel, because as far as we understand you
are so far enamoured as none the like, and without doubt
the judgment of the enamoured is merely false, because
as they have lost the sight of the eyes of their mind, so
have they banished reason as their utter enemy.  And for
this cause it shall be convenient that we against our will
speak of love, the which grieves us, since we be his subjects.
But yet to pluck you from your error, we shall turn our
silence to a true report, and will, therefor, that you know
this: that this love is nothing else than unreasonable will
sprung of a passion entered the heart through a wanton
pleasure that is opened unto the eyes, nourished with
idleness, by the memory and thoughts of foolish minds.  And
many times in how much it multiplies, so much it
takes away the intent of him in whom it abides from things

<pb n="89"/>

necessary, and disposes the same unto things unprofitable.
</p><p>"But because that you through good example giving do
endeavour yourself to show, that all goodness and all
virtue do proceed from him, we shall proceed to the
disproofs of your proofs.  It is no part of humility unjustly to
bring unto a man's self that which belongs to another, but
rather an arrogancy and an unfitting presumption.  The
which thing Mars (whom you make through love to become
humble) assuredly used in taking away from Vulcan, Venus,
his most lawful wife.  And without doubt this humility that
appears in the face of lovers does not proceed of a benign
heart but takes root from guile and deceit, neither makes
this love the courteous liberal but when as such abundance
as you say to have been in Medea, does abound in the heart
and does deprive the same of the sight of the mind, and
most foolishly is become prodigal of things heretofore duly
esteemed dear; and not giving the same with measure but
unprofitably casting them away, believing to please, and
displeases.  Medea, nothing wise of her prodigality, in
short time repented very much without utility and knew
that if she had modestly used those her dear gifts she should
not have come to so vile an end.
</p><p>"And, that soliciting that purchases or works hurt to the
solicitors, as it seemed to us, ought not any ways to be sought
for, for much better is it to stand idle than work harm,
although that neither the one nor the other is to be praised.
Paris was a solicitor to his own destruction, if he beheld the
end of his soliciting.  Menelaus was become diligent, not for
love but to recover his honour lost, as each discreet person
ought to do.
</p><p>"Neither yet is this love a mean to mitigate anger, but
the benignity of mind, the brunt being past that induces it

<pb n="90"/>

makes it to become nothing and remits the offence against
whom it was angry.  And yet lovers and discreet persons were
wont at the prayers of the person loved, or of some friend,
to forgive offences, to shew themselves courteous of that
which cost them nothing, and to make the cravers thereof
beholden unto them.  And in this sort Achilles many times
shewed himself to expell from him this congealed anger.
</p><p>"Likewise it seems that this makes men courageous and
worthy, but thereof I can shew you the contrary.  Who was
a man of greater valour than Hercules? And yet being
enamoured he became vile and forgetful of his force, so
that he did spin thread with the women of Iole.  Assuredly
in things wherein occurs no danger a most hardy people are
the enamoured, and wherein danger happens they shew
themselves in appearance hardy and put themselves
forward; neither does love, but little wit, allure them so to do,
to the end they may after have glory in the sight of their
loves.  Although it happens seldom because they doubt so
much the losing the person loved that they are rather
contented to be held vile and of little courage than to give
themselves to peril.
</p><p>"And yet we doubt not but this love reposed all
sweetness in Orpheus' harp.  We agree that it is true that you have
shewed, that truly in general love loads the tongues of his
subjects with such a sweetness and with so many
enticements as they many times would thereby make the stones
turn upside down, so that to entice is not only the property
of wavering and inconstant men but of vile men.  How shall
we say, that such a lord ought to be followed, through the
good property of the follower? Assuredly he (in whom he
abides) makes wise and profitable counsels to be despised.
For it was evil with the Trojans that those of Cassandra
were not heard of Paris.  He makes likewise his subjects to

<pb n="91"/>

forget and despise their good fame, the which ought to
remain to us all on earth as an eternal heir of our memory.
And how much these aforesaid did condemn the same
Aegisthus may serve for an example, although Scylla
wrought no less hurt than Pasiphae.
</p><p>"Is not he the occasion that does break the sacred bonds
of the promised pure faith? Yea truly, what had Ariadne
done to Duke Theseus whereby contaminating the
matrimonial bands and giving himself and his promised faith to
the winds, he should abandon his poor one among the desert
rocks? A little pleasure in gazing in the eyes of Phaedra
was occasion to bring about so much evil and such requittall
for the received honour.  In him also is found no law, and
that it is true may be seen by the doings of Tereus, who
having received Philomena from her pitiful father and
carnally known her, made no stay to contaminate the most holy
laws matrimonially contracted between him and Procne the
sister of Philomena.  This also calling and causing himself
to be called a god, occupys the reasons of the gods.  Who
could ever fully with words shew the iniquity of him?
</p><p>"He (to speak briefly) leads them that follow him to all
evils; and if by chance his followers do any virtuous act
(which happens very seldom) with a vicious beginning they
begin it, desiring thereby to come very quickly into the
desired end of their loathesome wills.  The which may be
rather said vices, than virtues, forsomuch as that is not to
be heeded only which man does but with what mind it is
done, and so according to the will of the worker to repute
the same vicious or virtuous, because that never of an evil
root sprang a good tree nor from an evil tree good fruit.
</p><p>"This love then is lewd and naught, and if he be naught
he is to be fled.  And who that flees things evil of consequence
follows the good, and so is both good and virtuous.  The

<pb n="92"/>

beginning of this love is none other thing than fear, the sequel
is sin and the end is grief and misery.  It ought then to be
fled and to be reproved and to fear to have him in you
because he is violent, neither knows he is any of his doings
to keep measure and is altogether devoid of reason.  He is
without all doubt the destroyer of the mind; the shame,
anguish, passion, grief and plaint of the same; never contents
that the heart of whom that lodges him without
bitterness.  Who will then pray that he is to be followed, but
fools?
</p><p>"Truly if it were lawful we would willingly live without
him.  But of such a harm we are too late awares, and therefor
it is convenient for us, since we are caught in his nets, to
follow his life until what time as that light which guided
Aeneas out of the dark ways, fleeing the perilous fires may
appear to us and guide us to his pleasures."</p>

THE EIGHTH QUESTION, PROPOSED BY A YOUNG<lb/>
GENTLEWOMAN NAMED PAOLA</head>

<p>ON the right hand of Galeon sat a fair gentlewoman
named Paola, pleasant and yet under an honest
coverture, who after the queen had done thus
began to say:
</p><p>"O noble queen, you have decreed at this present that
no person ought to follow this our lord love, and I for my
part consent thereunto.  But yet it seems to me impossible
that the youthful race both of men and women should be run
over without this benign love.  I gather at this present,
setting apart (by your leave) your sentence that to be
enamoured is lawful, taking the evil doing for good working.
And in following the same, I desire to know of you which
of these two women ought rather to be loved of a young
man, both two pleasing him alike, either she that is of noble
blood and of able kinsfolk and copious of having much
more than the young man, or the other, that is neither noble
nor rich nor of kinsfolk so abounding as is the young
man?"
</p><p>To whom the queen thus made answer: "Fair
gentlewoman, admitting the case that both man and woman ought
to follow love as we have before affirmed, we give
judgment: that in how much the woman is richer, greater and
more noble than the young man, of whatsoever degree or

<pb n="94"/>

dignity he be, even so she ought to be rather preferred to
the love of a young man than ought she that has anything
less than he, because man's mind was created to follow
high things.  And therefor he must seek rather to advance
than anyways to debase himself.  Further, there is a common
proverb which says:

</p><p></p><p>The good to covet better 'tis,
</p><p></p><p>Than to possess that which bad is.

</p><p>"Wherefor in our judgment you are better to love the
most noble and with good reason to refuse the less noble."
</p><p>Then said pleasant Paola: "Noble queen, I would have
given another judgment (if it had been to me) of this
question, as you shall hear.  We all naturally do rather desire
short and brief than long and tedious troubles, and that it is
a less and more brief trouble to get the love of the less
noble than of the more noble is manifest.  Then the less
ought to be followed, for as much as the love of the less
may be said to be already won, the which of the more is yet
to get.  Further, many perils may follow to a man loving a
woman of a greater condition than himself is of, neither has
he lastly thereby any greater delight than of the lesser.
</p><p>"For we see a great woman to have many kinsfolks and
a great family, and them all as diligent heeders of her
honour to have an eye unto her, so that if any one of them
happen to espy this love, thereof may follow (as we have
already said) great peril to the lover, the which of the less
noble can not so lightly come to pass.  And these perils each
one (as he is able) ought to flee, for as much as who that
receives harm is sure thereof and who that has done it
laughs him after to scorn, saying he speeds well, where he
likes there let him love; yet dies he more  than once? But

<pb n="95"/>

how that once happens, where, and for what occasion
besides, each one ought to take good heed.  It is very credible
that a gentlewoman will lightly esteem of him, for that
she will desire to love one more noble or greater than
herself and not one inferior to herself; whereby seldom or
never he shall attain his desire.  But of the lesser shall
happen the contrary, because that she will glory to be loved of
such a lover, and will endeavour herself to please him, to
the end to nourish love.  And yet if this were not the power
of the lover only might be able without fear to bring to
pass to fulfill his desire.  Wherefor I gather that the less
noble ought to be preferred in love before the more
noble."
</p><p>"Your judgment deceives you," said the queen to the
fair gentlewoman, "because love is of this nature, that how
much the more one loves so much the more he desires to
love.  And this may be seen by them that through love feel
the greater grief, the which although it troubles them not
a little yet love they continually the more.  Neither does
anyone from his heart, although he make great appearance in
words, desire thereof a speedy end.  Then as small troubles
are sought for of the slothful, and the wise, things that are
attained with most trouble are held most dear and delightful.
And therefor in loving the less woman, to get her
should be (as you say) little trouble, and the love both
little and short, and should be followed as though one in
loving would desire to love less and less.  Which is contrary
to the nature of love as we have said.  But in loving the
greater, that is gotten with trouble, happens the contrary;
because that as a thing dearly gotten with travail is reposed
all diligence to the well heeding of the gained love, even
so is she every hour the more loved and the longer does
continue the delight and pleasure thereof.

<pb n="96"/>

</p><p>"And yet if you will say that all the doubt is of their
kinsmen we will not deny it, for this is one of the
occasions.  Wherefor it is a trouble to have the love of one
of these great women.  But notwithstanding the desert in
such cases proceed by a secret way.  And we doubt not but
that the honour both of the greatest and meanest women
is by some of their kinsfolks according to their power looked
to, in such sort as a fool may come to an evil adventure,
loving as well in a base as in a noble stock.
</p><p>"But what shall he be that will pass Pesistrato in cruelty,
having offended them which loved him without forethinking
that which he should afterwards have done to those
that had had the same in heart? In saying also that loving
a greater woman than himself he shall never be able to come
to the end of his desire, because the woman covets to love
one greater than herself and therefor will make of him no
estimation at all.  You show yourself to be ignorant that
the meanest man (in what belongs to natural virtues) is of
greater and better condition than the noblest woman of the
world.  Whatsoever man she then desires she desires him
that is of greater and better condition than herself, because
the virtuous or vicious life makes many times the mean
great, and the great mean.  Inasmuch therefor as any woman
shall be solicited by any man in due sort, even so without
doubt she shall yield to his desire, though the great with
more trouble than the mean.
</p><p>"For we see the soft water with a continual fall to break
and pierce the hard stone.  And therefor let none despair
to love.  For so much goodness shall follow him that loves
a greater woman than himself as he shall endeavour
himself to please her, to have decent qualities, the company of
noble personages, to be ornate of sweet talk, bold in
enterprises and splendid in apparel; and if she attain to greater

<pb n="97"/>

glory the greater delight shall he have of mind, likewise
he shall be exalted with the good report of the people and
reputed of a noble mind.  Let him therefor follow the most
noble, as we have already said."</p>

<head>
THE NINTH QUESTION, PROPOSED BY FERAMONT<lb/>
DUKE OF MONTORIO</head>

<p>NEXT unto Paola sat Feramont, Duke of
Montorio, who after the queen had said, thus began:
</p><p>"I consent that if it be convenient to love that
you have already fully answered this gentlewoman to her
question.  And that a man also love rather a more noble
woman than a less noble than himself, may very well be
yielded to, through the sundry reasons by you shewed
touching the same.  But forasmuch as there are sundry
gentlewomen of sundry sorts attired with diversities of habits
(as it is thought) do diversely love, some more, some less;
some more hotly and some others more lukewarm.  I desire
to understand of you which of these three a young man
should bring his desire to a most happy end, ought soonest
to be enamoured of either of her that is married, or of
the maid or of the widow?"
</p><p>To whom the queen made this answer: "Of the three the
one, that is, the married woman, ought in no wise to be
desired, because she is not her own, neither has liberty to
give herself to any.  And therefor either to desire or to take
her is both to commit an offence against the divine laws as
also against the laws natural and positive, the offending
whereof is to heap upon ourselves the divine anger, and
by consequence heavy judgement.  Howbeit who that gropes

<pb n="99"/>

not his conscience so far inwardly, does oftentimes speed
better in loving her than of any other of the two, either
maid or widow, inasmuch as he (although such love be
with great peril) is to have the effect of his desire.  And
why this love may divers times bring the lover to his desire
sooner than the love of the others, this is the reason.  It is
manifest that in how much more the fire is blown so much
the more it flames, and without blowing it becomes
dead.  And as all other things through much use do decay,
so contrarywise lust the more it is used the more it
increases.
</p><p>"The widow in that she has been a long time without
the like effect, does feel the same almost as though it had
never been and so is rather kindled with the memory
thereof than with any concupiscence at all.
</p><p>"The maid, that has yet no skill thereof, neither knows
the same but by imagination, desires as it were one
lukewarm.  And therefore the married woman kindled in such
passions does more than any of the others desire such
effects.  What time the married are wont to receive from their
husbands outrageous words or deeds, whereof willingly they
would take revenge if they might, there is no way left more
readier unto them than in despite of their husbands to give
their love to him by whom they are allured to receive the
like.  And although it be expedient that such manner of
revenge be very secret, that no shame grow thereby,
nevertheless are they yet content in their minds.  Further the
always using of one kind of meat is tedious.  And we have
oftentimes the delicate meats left for the gross, turning
afterwards unto the same again, what time the appetite has
been satisfied of the others.
</p><p>"But because (as we have said) it is not lawful through
any unjust occasion to desire that which is another man's,

<pb n="100"/>
<pb n="101"/>
<pb n="102"/>

we will leave the married to their husbands and take the
others, whereof a copious number our city does set before
our eyes.  And we would in bestowing our love rather seek
the widows than the rude maids unlearned for such a
mystery and that are not without great trouble (the which
is widows needs not) made able to a man's desire.  Further,
if maids love, they know not what they desire, and therefor
they do not follow with an intentive mind the steps of the
lover as do the widows, in whom now the antique fire takes
force and makes them to desire that which through long
depriving they had forgotten.  So that to come to such effect
they (too late) beweep the lost times and the solitary long
nights the which they have passed in their widows' beds.
These are therefor (as it seems unto us) rather to be loved
of them in whom is the liberty to submit themselves unto
others than any of the rest."
</p><p>Then answered Feramont: "Most excellent queen, what
you have said of the married I had determined in my mind
that so it ought to be; and now hearing the same from you
I am the rather assured thereof.  But touching the maids
and widows I am of the contrary opinion because (setting the
married apart for the reasons by you alleged) it seems unto
me very good that the maid rather than the widow ought
to be desired.  Forasmuch as the love of the maid seems
more firm and assured than that of the widow.  For the
widow without doubt has already loved one other time
before and has seen and felt many things of love, and knows
what shame may follow thereof.  And therefor knowing
these things better than the maid, loves fair and softly;
and doubting and not loving firmly desires now this and
now that, and knows not to whether (for her most delight
and greatest honour) to link herself, for sometimes she will
neither the one nor the other.  So that deliberation does

<pb n="103"/>

waver in her mind, neither is the amorous passion able to
take there stability.
</p><p>"But to the maid these things are altogether unknown.
And therefor as she persuades herself with good
advisement, that of many young men she greatly pleases one, so
without further examination she makes choice of him as her
lover and to him only disposes her love, not knowing how
for her pleasure to show any contrary act.  Neither is there
for the more sure tying of the lover any new deliberation
by her sought forth touching her love, so that she is then
pure at the will and pleasure of him that simply pleases
her and quickly disposes her wounded heart, him only to
serve as lord.  The which thing (as I have already said)
happens not oft with widow and therefor is the other the
rather to be followed.
</p><p>"Further, with more efficacy the maid tarries those things
that never anyone of her sort has seen, heard or proved.
And yet she desires more to see, hear and prove them than
who that has many times both seen, heard and proved them,
and this is manifest.  Among the other occasions for the
which our life does greatly delight us and is desired to be
long, is for to see new things such as we have never yet seen
before.  And also for to see things most new we have a great
delight to run with a diligent pace to that which we above
all other things do endeavour ourselves to flee, that is,
death, the last end of our bodies.
  "The maid knows not that delightful conjunction through
the which we come into the world, and yet it is natural to
every creature through a desire to be drawn thereunto.
Further, she many times has heard from them that know
what manner of thing it is, how much sweetness does
consist therein, the which words have given fire to the desire
and therefor, drawn of nature and of a desire to prove the

<pb n="104"/>

thing of her not as yet proved, does through the words
which she has heard desire boldly with a kindled heart this
concourse.  And with whom is it presumed to be had but only
with him whom she has already made lord of her mind?
This heat shall not be in the widow because having once
proved and felt what manner of thing it was she is thereby
provoked thereunto.  So that the maid shall then love more
and be more diligent (through the reasons aforesaid) to
the pleasure of her lover than the widow.  To what end shall
we then wade any further in seeking that the maid ought
not rather to be loved than the widow?"
</p><p>"You," said the queen, "reason well, and very well you
defend your judgement.  But yet we will show you with
apparent reason how you likewise ought to hold the same
opinion that we do hold of this contention, if with a straight
eye you look unto the nature of love.
</p><p>"Thus in the maid as in the widow, and so in the widow
as in the maid, we do see him to be firm, strong and
constant.  And that this is true Dido and Ariadne with their
doings have left us an example.  And whereas this love is
neither in the one nor in the other, none of the aforesaid
operations will thereof follow.  Then is it convenient that
each one of them do love, if we will have that to follow
whereof both you and I have already talked.  And therefor
in loving either maid or widow without going about to
seek which of them is most discreetly enamoured (as we are
certain of the widow) we shall show you how the widow is
more diligent to the pleasure of the lover than is the maid.
</p><p>"For doubtless among those things that a woman esteems
dear above the rest, is her virginity, and this is the reason:
because therein consists all the honour of her following life.
And without doubt she shall never be so much urged
forwards to love as she shall not willingly be courteous thereof

<pb n="105"/>

but yet to him only to whom she believes to be coupled as
wife through the matrimonial law.  And therefor we go not
about seeking for this; for there is no doubt but that who
will love to marry ought rather to love the maid than the
widow because she shall be slow and negligent in giving
herself to him that loves her not (if she know it) to that
effect.
</p><p>"Further, maids are generally fearful, neither are they
subtle enough to find the ways and means whereby they
may take the stolen delights.  But the widow of these things
makes no doubt at all because that she already has
honourably given that which the other tarries to give, and
being without the same doubts not in giving herself to
another that token which may accuse.  Whereby afterwards
she becomes more adventurous because (as it is said) the
chiefest occasion that brings doubt is not in her.  Besides,
she knows better the secret ways and so puts them in effect.
</p><p>"In that which you say, that the maid as desirous of a
thing which she never proved may be made more diligent
to this than the widow, that knows what manner of thing it
is, thereof the contrary.  Maids do not at the first time for
their delight run to such effect (although the thing that
delights the oftener it is seen, heard or felt the more it
pleases, and the more careful is everyone to follow the
same) because it is then more noisome than pleasant to
them.  This thing whereof we reason does not follow the
order of many other things, that once or twice being seen,
are afterward no more desired, but rather the oftener it is
put in effect with so much the more affection it covets to
return and more desires he the thing whom it pleases than
does he whom it ought to please and has not as yet tasted
thereof.
</p><p>"Wherefor the widow forasmuch as she gives least, and

<pb n="106"/>

is best able to give, she shall be the most liberal and the
more sooner than the maid, that must give the dearest thing
she has.  Also the widow shall be sooner drawn (as we have
shewed) than the maid to such effects.  For which occasion
let the widow be rather loved than the maid."</p>

THE TENTH QUESTION,<lb/>
PROPOSED BY ASCALEON</head>

<p>IT was convenient that Ascaleon, who in circle sat next
to the duke Feramont, should now propound.  And
therefor thus he said:
</p><p>Most excellent queen, I remember that there was
heretofor in this our city, a fair and noble gentlewoman left a
widow of a worthy husband, the which for that her
marvelous beauty was of many and noble young gentlemen
beloved.  And of those many there were two gentle and
courageous knights, each one in what he could did
endeavour himself to attain her love.  And while this continued,
by chance it happened that unjust accusation was brought
against her by certain of her kinsfolks, before the
magistrate, and after by false evidence proved, through which
untrue process she was condemned to the fire.  But because
the conscience of the judge was perplexed, for  that it
seemed him as it were to know the unjust proof, he was
willing to commit her life unto the gods and to fortune's
chance, and so tied such a condition to his given sentence:
As after the gentlewoman should be led unto the pyre, if
any knight could be found the which would combat in the
defence of her honour against him that would maintain
the contrary, and should happen to overcome, she should
then be free; and if the contrary, to be burned according
to the deemed sentence.

<pb n="108"/>

</p><p>As the condition was understood of her two lovers, and
by chance sooner known to the one than to the other, he
which knew the same soonest forewith took him to his
armour, mounted on horseback and came into the field,
gainsaying him that would come and maintain the death of the
gentlewoman.
</p><p>The other, that somewhat later than the first understood
of this sentence, and hearing how that the knight was
already in field in her defence, neither that there was then
place for any other to go thither in that enterprise.  And
therefor not knowing herein what to do, became very
sorrowful, imagining that through his slackness he had lost the
love of the loved gentlewoman and that the other had
justly deserved the same.
</p><p>And while he thus sorrowed his mishap he bethought him
that if he before any other should go armed into the field,
saying that the gentlewoman ought to die, and to suffer
himself to be overcome, he might thereby cause her to
escape, and so according to his device he put the same in
effect.
</p><p>The gentlewoman hereby escaped and was delivered from
peril.  So that then after certain days, the first knight went
unto her and recommended himself to her, putting her in
remembrance how that he, to preserve her from death, had
a few days past offered himself to the peril of death, and
thanks be to the gods and to his force, he had delivered
both her and himself from so hard a happening.
Whereupon it would please her according to his desert to give her
love, the which above all things he had always desired.
</p><p>Afterward with the like prayers came the second knight,
saying: "For your sake I have hazarded my life and
because you should not die suffered myself to be overcome,
whereupon I have purchased to myself eternal infamy.
Whereas I contrary-wise with encountering your surety

<pb n="109"/>

and willing to use my force, might have been able to have
gotten the honour of the victory."
</p><p>The gentlewoman thanked each of them very benignedly,
promising them both due recompense for the received
service.  And now they being departed, she abode in great
doubt to which of them she should the rather give her
love, to the first or to the second; and therefor prays
counsel of you on which of them you would say that she ought
soonest to bestow the same.
</p><p>"We deem," said the queen, "that the first is to be
loved and the last to be left.  Because the first used force
and showed his assured love in diligent sort, giving himself
to every peril that might happen through the future
battle even unto the death; whereby it might very well
have followed, forasmuch as if such a battle to be done
against him had been as lawful to any of the enemies of the
gentlewoman as it was to the lover, he had been in peril
of death for his defence.  Neither was it manifest to him
that one should come against him that would suffer
himself to be overcome, as it happened.  The last truly went
well-advised not to die, neither to suffer the gentlewoman
to die.  Then, forasmuch as he put least in adventure he
merits to gain the less.  Let the first then have the love of
the fair gentlewoman, as the just deserver thereof."
</p><p>Ascaleon said: "O most prudent queen, what is that you
say? Does not one time suffice to be rewarded for well-doing without craving further desert? Truly yes.  The first
is well requited with being of everyone honoured for the
received victory.  And what greater reward needs he than
honour, the reward of virtue? The received honour did
suffice for a greater matter than he did.  And he that with all
his wit came well-advised, ought he to be unrecompensed?
</p><p>"And further, he to be of everyone evil-spoken of, having

<pb n="110"/>

nothing less than the first helped the gentlewoman to
escape? Is not the wit to forsee every bodily force? How so?
If this man with all his wit came for the safety of the
gentlewoman, ought he for his desert to be rejected? God
forbid it should be so.  If he knew not the same so soon as
the other, this was not through negligence, for if perhaps
he had known it before the other he would have run to that
which he took discreetly for the last remedy.  Whereof
reward justly ought to follow, the which reward ought to
be the love of the gentlewoman if rightly she see unto him.
And yet you say the contrary."
</p><p>"God defend from your mind," answered the queen,
"that vice come to a good end merit the same reward that
virtue done to the like end, merits.  But rather inasmuch
as vice deserves correction, so no worldly desert can justly
satisfy virtue.  Who shall deny us to believe (although we
cannot manifest the same with apparent reason) but the last
knight as envious of the good turn he saw prepared for
another, was moved to such an enterprise, to the end to
disturb the same and not for the love he bare the
gentlewoman; and yet his device failed him.  He is a fool that
under the colour of an enemy does endeavour himself to
the end to receive recompense to help another.
</p><p>"Infinite are the ways whereby it is possible enough for
us to shew at the first with open friendship the love that
one of us bears toward the other, without shewing ourselves
as enemies and after with coloured words to make shew to
have profited.  The which we have said may now suffice you
for answer, whom old age more than anything else ought to
make discreet.  And we believe that when your mind shall
have duely disgested these things you shall not find our
judgement guileful, but true, and to be followed." And
so she held her peace.</p>

THE ELEVENTH QUESTION, PROPOSED<lb/>
BY A GENTLEWOMAN NAMED GRACE</head>

<p>THERE followed after him a gentlewoman of
cheer very mild, that was named Grace (and
assuredly the name was consonant to her
nature) who with an humble and modest voice
began these words: "It is come unto my turn, O most
virtuous queen, to propound this, my question, the which to
the end the time (that now approaches unto our last feasting
may be sweetened with the new beginning thereof) be only
spent in talk, I shall briefly propound that which willingly
(and if it were lawful for me) I would pass over, yet not to
infringe upon the limits of your obedience neither the order
of the rest, I shall propound this: Whether is it great delight
to the lover to see his love present, or not seeing her to think
amorously on her?"
</p><p>"My gracious Grace," said the queen, "we believe that
much more delight is taken in thinking than in beholding,
because in thinking on the thing loved all the sensitive spirits
do then graciously feel a marvelous joy and as it were do
content their inflamed desires with the delight only of the
thought.  But this happens not in the beholding because that
only the visible spirit feels joy and the others are kindled
with such a desire that they are not able to endure, and so
remain vanquished.  And that visible spirit sometimes takes

<pb n="112"/>

so great pleasure that of force he is constrained to withdraw
himself back, remaining vile and altogether vanquished.
Then do we gather hereof that greater delight is to think
than to behold."
</p><p>"That thing which is loved," answered the gentlewoman,
"how much the more it is seen so much the more it delights.
And therefor I believe that greater delight brings the
beholding than does the thinking, because every beauty at the
first pleases through the sight thereof.  And so after through
the continual sight such pleasure is confirmed in the mind as
thereof is engendered love, and those pleasures that spring
from him.  No beauty is so much loved, neither for any other
occasion, than to please the eyes and to content the same.
Then in seeing they are contented and in thinking to see
the desire increases.  So that more delight feels he that is
contented, than does he that desires to content himself.
</p><p>"We may see and know by Laodamia how much more the
present sight than the absent thought does delight, because
we are to think that her Protesilaus never departed from
her thought, neither yet was she ever seen disposed to other
than to melancholy, refusing to deck and apparel herself
with her costly garments.  The which thing in seeing him
never happened.  For what time she abode in his presence
she was merry, gracious and always joyful and trimly
attired.  What more manifest testimony will we have than this,
that the gladness is greater of the sight than of the thought?
Because that through the exterior doings that may be
comprehended, which in the heart is hidden."
</p><p>The queen then thus made answer: "Those things both
delightful and noisome that approach most near unto mind,
bring more annoy and more joy than do those far off from
the same.  And who doubts but that the thought abides in
the mind and that the mind is not from the eye? Although

<pb n="113"/>

through the particular virtue of the mind they have their
sight, and that it is convenient for them by sundry means to
render their proportions to the animate understanding.
</p><p>"Having then in the mind a sweet thought of the loved,
in that act which the thought brings, in that together with
the thing loved, it seems the lover to be.  Then he sees the
same with those eyes to whom nothing, no not of a long
distance, may be hidden.  Then he speaks with her whom
he loves and peradventure with piteous style tells the
annoys sustained for her sake.  Then is it lawful for him
without fear to embrace her.  Then does he according to his
desire marvelous pleasure himself with her.  Then does he
hold her wholly at his pleasure, the which in beholding
happens not, because that sight only at first takes pleasure
without passing further.
</p><p>"And as we say love is timorous and fearful, and in
beholding does make the heart tremble in such sort as it
leaves neither thought nor spirit in his place.  For many with
the long beholding of their ladies lose those their natural
forces and remain vanquished.  And many, not being able to
move, stand like posts; othersome in tangling and
traversing their legs fall to the ground.  Others thereby lose their
speech.  And by sight we know many other like things to
have happened, the which all should have been very
acceptable to them, to whom (as we have said) they have
happened, if they had not happened at all.  How then
brings that same delight that shall willingly be fled? We
confess that were it possible to behold without fear, it
should be a great delight.  But yet little or nothing
without the thought, the which without the bodily sight pleases
very much.
</p><p>"And that whereof we may have spoken come to pass
through the thought, it is manifest;  yea, that and much

<pb n="114"/>

more.  For we do find that men with thought have passed
the heavens and tasted of the eternal peace.  Then more
delights the thought than the sight.  And if you say that
Laodamia was melancholy with thinking, we do not deny
it, but yet it was rather a dolorous than an amorous thought
that did trouble her.  She (as it were) a diviner to her own
harm, always doubted the death of Protesilaus, and still
was thinking thereon, contrary to those thoughts whereof we
reason, which through that doubt could not enter into her,
but rather sorrowing through this occasion as reason was,
she shewed a troublesome and heavy look."</p>

<head>
THE TWELFTH QUESTION,<lb/>
PROPOSED BY LONGANO</head>

<p>NEXT to Philocopo was placed a courteous young
man and gracious to behold, whose name was
Longano, who thus began:
</p><p>Most excellent queen, so trim has been the previous
question that in my conceit mine shall bring no delight at
all.  Yet to the end not to be severed from so noble a
company, forth it shall; and thus he followed saying:
</p><p>It is not many days past that I, abiding all solitary in my
chamber, wrapt in a heap of troublesome thoughts sprung
from an amorous desire, the which with a fierce battle had
assaulted my heart, by chance heard a piteous plaint
whereunto (because I judged it by estimation near unto me)
intentively I laid my ear, and thereby knew that they were
women.  By occasion whereof I suddenly rose to see who
and where they were; and looking forth at my chamber
window, I heard over against the same in one other
chamber, two young women, the same being sisters, adorned
with an inestimable beauty, there abiding without any other
company.  Whom as I saw making this sorrowful plaint I
withdrew myself into a secret place without being of them
espied, and so beheld them a long while.  Neither was I
able for all that to understand all the words that they
through grief uttered in tears, but that the effect of such

<pb n="116"/>

plaint (according to that I could comprehend) seemed to
me to be for love.  Wherefor I through pity and to sweet
an occasion offered (being thus close as I was) began to shed
my trickling tears.
</p><p>And after that I had in their grief persevered in the
same a good space (forsomuch as I was their very familiar
and also their kinsman) I purposed to understand more
certain the occasion of their sorrow, and so went to them; who
had no sooner espied me but all bashful they withheld them
from tears, endeavouring themselves to do me reverence.
</p><p>To whom I said: "Gentlewomen, trouble not yourselves,
neither let this my coming move you to restrain your
inward grief, for your tears have been now a good space
apparent unto me.  It shall be therefor needless to hide you,
either yet through bashfulness to hide from me the cause
of this your plaint.  For I am come hither to understand
the same.  And be you assured that you shall not receive by
me, either in word or deed, any evil requittal, but rather
help and comfort in what I may."
</p><p>The women greatly excused themselves, saying that they
sorrowed for nothing.  But yet after I had conjured them
and they seeing me desirous to understand the same, the
elder thus began to say:
</p><p>"It is the pleasure of the gods that to you our secrets
be discovered.  You therefor shall understand that we,
above all other women, have always resisted the sharp darts
of Cupid, who of a long season in casting the same was
never yet able to fasten any one of them in our hearts.  But
now lastly being further inflamed, and having determined
to overcome that his childish enterprise, took anew with his
young arm of his best and dearest shafts, and with so great
force wounded the hearts so sore enfeebled through the
sundry blows before received that they made a far greater

<pb n="117"/>

wound than if resistance had not been made (unto the other
former) had like to have been.  And thus for the pleasure
of two most noble young gentlemen we are become subjects
to his deity, following his pleasure with more perfect faith
and fervent will than ever any other women have done.
</p><p>"Now has fortune and the love of them (as I shall
declare unto you) left us both comfortless.  First I, before
my sister here, was in love, and through my endeavour,
believing wisely to end my desire, so wrought as I got the
loved young gentleman at my pleasure, whom I found as
greatly enamoured of me as I of him.  But truly now has
not the amorous flame through such effort ceased, neither
has the desire lessened, but each one more vehemently
increases; and more than ever do I now burn in his fire.
And what time seeing how I might best mitigate and
assuage the kindled flame thereof, holding it inwardly secret,
it after happened that the horned moon was no sooner come
to her perfect roundness but that he at unawares committed
a fault, for the which was adjudged him perpetual exile
from this city.  Whereupon he, dreading death, is departed
hence without hope ever to return.  I, sorrowful woman
above all others more now inflamed than ever am without
him left both doleful and desperate.  By occasion whereof
I sorrow me, and that thing that most increases my sorrow is
that on every side I see the way hard from being able to
follow him.  Think therefor now whether I have cause to make
plaint or no."
</p><p>Then said I: "And this other, who sorrows she?"
</p><p>And she answered: "This my sister likewise (as I) is
enamoured of another, and of him again loved above measure.
And to the end her desires should not pass the amorous
paths without tasting some part of delight, many times
she has endeavoured herself to bring them to effect; but

<pb n="118"/>

contrary to her device, jealousy has always occupied and
broken the way.  And because she could never attain thereunto,
neither saw how to be able so to do, she thus distressed
is through fervent love consumed; as you may well think if
ever you were in love.  Being we were here then all alone,
we began to reason of our misfortunes, and knowing the
same far greater than those of other women, we could not
withhold from tears, but with weeping sorrowed our
luckless lots, as you might well perceive."
</p><p>To hear this of them it grieved me greatly, so that I
encouraged them with such words as seemed me most
profitable for their comfort; and so departed from them.  Many
times after, revolving in mind their griefs and sometimes
bethinking me which of the same should be the greater,
at one time I agreed to that of the one and at another time
I yielded that of the other.  And the sundry reasons
wherewith, as it seemed me, each one has to lament her, will
not suffer me to stay upon any one; whereupon I remain
here in doubt.  May it therefor please you that by you
may be opened this error, in telling me which of these
two unfortunate lovers seemed to sustain the greatest
grief.
</p><p>Answered the queen: "Great was the sorrow of either
of them, but considering adversity to be most grievous to
her that has tasted prosperity, we esteem that she that has
lost her love feels the greatest grief, and if of fortune
greatliest offended.  Fabritius never bewept the chances of
fortune; but that Pompey did is a thing very manifest.  If
sweet things were not tasted the sour should be yet unknown.
Medea never knew (according to her own saying) what
manner of thing prosperity was while she was in love, but
being forsaken of Jason bewailed her adversity.  Who will
ever lament for that he has not had? Not one but will

<pb n="119"/>

rather desire.  It is deemed, therefor, that of the two women
the one wept for grief, the other for desire."
</p><p>"It is very hard for me, gracious lady, to think that
which you affirm," said the young gentleman, "forsomuch
as who that has his desire of any desired thing ought much
more to content his mind than who that desires and cannot
fulfill his desire.  Further, nothing is more light to lose than
what hope promises not hereafter to yield.  There ought to
be unmeasurable grief, whereas the not being able to bring
equal wills to effect does hinder.  From thence lamentations
take place, from these thoughts and troubles do spring,
because if the wills were not equal, of force the dsire should
want.  But whenas lovers see themselves in presence of that
they desire and cannot attain thereunto, then do they kindle
and sorrow them much more than if that they would have
were far from them.  And who, I pray you, torments
Tantalus in hell but only the apples and the water, for that
how much more near they bend and swell unto his mouth,
so much the more (afterwards, in seeing the same) they
increase his hunger.  Truly I believe that who hopes for a
thing possible to be had, and cannot attain thereunto through
contrary resisting impediments, feels more grief than who
that bewails a thing lost and irrecoverable."
</p><p>Then said the queen: "Your answer would have
followed very well where your demand should have been of an
old grief, although unto that also might be said thus: to
be possible, through forgetting the grief, to shorten the
desire in the desired things, whereas continual impediment
is seen not to be able to attain them, as in those lost, wherein
hope does not shew us that we should ever have them
again.
</p><p>"But we do reason which of them sorrowed most, when
you saw them sorrowing.  Wherefor following the

<pb n="120"/>

propounded case, we will give judgment: that she felt greater
grief that had lost her lover without hope to have him
again (putting the case that it be an easy matter to lose a
thing impossible to have again, nevertheless it was to be
said: who loves well forgets never) than to the other, who
if we look well might hope to fulfill that hereafter that
heretofor she was unable to perform.  For a great lessener
of grief is hope.  It had force to keep chaste and to diminish
the sorrows of the lingering life of Penelope."</p>

<head>
THE THIRTEENTH QUESTION,<lb/>
PROPOSED BY MASSALINE</head>

<p>MASSALINE, the which sat on the right hand of
the queen, and next to Longano, performing the
 circle, said in this wise:
</p><p>It is meet that I lastly do propound my question.  And
therefor to the end that I may make the plesant told tales
and the before propounded questions to seem more sweet, I
shall tell you a short tale worth the hearing, wherein there
falls a question very proper to make an end withal.
</p><p>I have heretofor heard say that there was in this our
city a gentleman who was very rich, that had to wife an
exceedingly fair young gentlewoman whom he loved above
all worldly things.  This gentlewoman was entirely beloved
of a knight of the same city, but she loved him not at all,
neither cared for him; by occasion whereof the knight was
never able to get from her either good words or courteous
countenance.
</p><p>And while he thus lived comfortless of such love, it
happened that he was called to the regiment of a city not
far distant from this of ours.  And accordingly he went
thither, having honourably governed the same all the time
of his abode there.  During which it happened that there
came a messenger unto him, who after news thus said:
</p><p>"Sir, you shall understand that the gentlewoman of our

<pb n="122"/>

city whom you so entirely loved above all others, this morning
labouring with great grief to be delivered of child, died,
not being delivered, and was in my presence of her parents
honourably buried."
</p><p>The knight, not without great sorrow, gave ear to this
tale and with a strong heart endured the telling thereof
without shewing any alteration of countenance at all, and
to himself thus said: "Ha, wretched death, curst be your
power! You have deprived me of her whom I loved above
all others and whom I desired more to serve, although I
knew her crueler to me than any other worldly wight.  But
since it is thus come to pass, that which love in her lifetime
would not vouchsafe to grant me, now that she is dead he
cannot deny me.  That assuredly if I should die therefor I
will now kiss the face of her being dead, that living I loved
so well."
</p><p>And so staying upon this determination, he tarried until
it was night, and then took one of his servants whom he best
trusted with him, and travelled the dreadful dark ways till
at last he came to the city.  And being entered the same he
went straight to the sepulchre wherein the gentlewoman was
buried.
</p><p>And after he had comforted his servant that he without
any fear should attend him there, he opened the same and
went thereinto.  Lamenting with a piteous plaint, he kissed
the gentlewoman and took her in his arms; and not satisfied
therewith he began to feel her here and there, and to put
his hand into her frozen breast.  But afterwards (being
much more bold than was meet) to seek out under the rich
attire which she had on, going and feeling with a fearful
hand hither and thither, till at the last with a feeble motion
he felt the weak pulses somewhat to move.
</p><p>He then became very fearful but yet love made him bold,

<pb n="123"/>

and therefor trying further with a more assured heed, he
knew that she was not dead.  And first of all with a sweet
mutation he drew her out of that place, and after wrapping
her in a great mantle (leaving the sepulchre open) he and
his servant carried her secretly to his mother's house,
whereas he conjured his said mother through the power of
the god that she neither this nor anything else should
manifest to any person living.
</p><p>He caused great fires to be made to the end to comfort
the cold members, whereunto the lost forces did not thereby
return in due sort.  By occasion whereof, as one
peradventure discreet in such a case, willed a solemn hothouse to be
prepared, wherein he caused first to be strewed many virtuous
herbs and after placed the gentlewoman therein,
causing her as it was meet for one in that plight, to be tenderly
looked unto.  In the which hothouse, after she had for a
time made her abode there, the blood coagulated about the
heart began through the received heat to disperse by the
cold veins and the spirits half dead to return to their places.
</p><p>Whereupon the gentlewoman (no sooner feeling the
same) began to call to her mother, and after to ask where
she was.  To whom the knight, instead of her mother, made
answer that she was in a very good place, and that she
should comfort herself.  She abiding in this sort, calling
upon the woman Lucina for help, was as it pleased the gods
(above all expectation) delivered of a fair son, and
therewith of great trouble and peril.  Whereof remaining
disburdened and being joyful of her newborned child, there
were out of hand provided nurses, both for the charge
of her as also of her son.
</p><p>The gentlewoman now after all these heavy troubles
returned to her perfect understanding, and the new son was
also born to the world before she saw either the knight

<pb n="124"/>

that thus loved her or his mother, who was pressed to do
her service, neither did she see any one of her parents or
kinsfolks about her for to look unto her.  Whereupon
being come into a cogitable admiration as it were all amazed,
said: "Where am I? What a wonder is this? Who has
brought me hither whereas I was never before?"
</p><p>To whom the knight answered: "Gentlewoman, marvel
not.  Comfort yourself, for that which you see has been the
pleasure of the gods and I shall tell you how." And so
declaring from the beginning to the end all that which was
happened her, concluded that through him she and her son
were alive.  By occasion whereof they were always bounden
to be at his pleasure.
</p><p>The gentlewoman perceiving this to be true, knowing
assuredly that she could not by any other means but only
by this which he shewed her be come to the hands of the
knight, first of all with a devout voice rendered thanks to
the immortal gods, and after to him, offering herself to be
always at his pleasure and service.
</p><p>Then said the knight: "Gentlewoman, since you know
yourself to be beholden unto me, I will that in guerdon of
my well-doing you comfort yourself here in this place until
I return from my office, whereunto it is now so long since
that I was chosen as the date hereof is almost at an end.
Besides you shall promise me faithfully never to betray
yourself without my license, either to your husband or any
other person."
</p><p>To whom the gentlewoman answered, that she was unable
to deny him either this or any other request, and that
assuredly she would comfort herself; and so by oath made
unto him she affirmed never to cause herself to be known
without his pleasure.
</p><p>The knight, seeing the gentlewoman out of all peril to

<pb n="125"/>

receive comfort, after he had abode two days in her service,
recommended her and her child to his mother's charge, and
so departed, returning to the government of his said office;
the which after little while he honourably ended and
returned home to his own house and possessions; whereas of
the gentlewoman he was graciously received.
</p><p>Certain days after his return he caused to be prepared
a great banquet, whereunto he invited the husband of this
gentlewoman whom he loved, her brethren, and many
others of her friends and his.  And the bidden guests being set
down at the table, the gentlewoman according to the
pleasure of the knight came apparelled in those garments and
decked with that crown, ring and other precious ornaments
(as the use was then) wherewith she was buried.  And by
the commandment of the knight, placed herself on the one
side by her husband and on the other side by himself,
whereas she fed that morning without speaking any word
at all.
</p><p>This gentlewoman was oftentimes beheld of her husband
and her attire and ornaments also.  And as it seemed unto
him he knew her to be his wife and those to be the
garments wherein she was buried; he yet for that he thought
he had buried her dead into her sepulchre, and not
believing that she was risen again, durst not once give her a word,
doubting lest she had been some other that did resemble his
wife, imagining that it were more easy to find one woman
in attire and ornaments like to another, than to raise up a
dead body.
</p><p>But yet for all this he turned many times towards the
knight and asked him who she was.  To whom the knight
answered: "Ask of her whom she is, for I cannot tell, out of
so unpleasant a place I have brought her."
</p><p>Then the husband asked the wife who she was, to whom

<pb n="126"/>
<pb n="127"/>
<pb n="128"/>

she answered: "I was brought by this knight by unknown
ways unto this place, to that gracious life that is of
everyone desired."
</p><p>At these words there wanted no admiration in the
husband but rather the same increased, and so they remained
until the banquet was ended.  Then the knight led the
husband of this gentlewoman into a chamber and with him the
gentlewoman, and the others that likewise that banqueted
with them whereas they found the gentlewoman's fair and
gracious son in the nurse's arms, whom the knight delivered
into the father's hands, saying: "This is your son;" and
giving him the right hand of his wife, said: "This is your wife
and mother of this child." Shewing to him and to the rest
how it happened that she was brought thither.
</p><p>They all after great wonder made great joy and chiefly
the husband of his wife, and the wife with her husband of
their son.  And so both two thanking the knight, returned
merrily home to their house, many days after making
marvelous joy.
</p><p>This knight entreated this gentlewoman with that
tenderness and that pure faith, as if she had been his sister, and
therefor it is doubted which of these two was the greater;
either the loyalty of the knight or the joy of the husband
that had now gotten again his lost wife, whom he reputed
as dead.  I pray you to say your opinion and what you would
judge hereof.
</p><p>"Most great (as we believe)," answered the queen, "was
the joy of the again gotten wife and of her child.  And
likewise noble and very great was the loyalty of the knight.
But for that it is a natural thing to be glad of the getting
again of things lost (neither could it otherwise be because it
would any other) and especially in the getting again of a
thing before so greatly loved, with a child, whereof there

<pb n="129"/>

could not be made so great joy as was convenient.  We do not
repute it to be so great a matter as to do that whereunto a
man of his proper virtue is constrained to do, the which in
being loyal comes to pass, because the being and not being
loyal is a thing possible.  We say then, that from whom
proceeds the being loyal in a thing so greatly loved that he does
a most great and noble thing in keeping loyalty, and that
in a far greater quantity loyalty does increase in him than
does joy in the other, and thus we judge."
</p><p>"Truly," said Massaline, "most renowned queen, I
believe it be as you say.  But yet it seems unto me a great
matter to think that with so great joy as was in him that had
gotten again his wife, there could be made comparison of
greatness in another thing, for as much as greater grief is
not supported than whenas through death a thing loved is
lost.  Further, if the knight were faithful, as is already said,
he did therein but his duty, because we are all bounden unto
the working of virtue.  And he that does that whereunto he
is of duty bounden, does but well; but yet it is not to be
reputed for so great a matter.  Therefor, I imagine that there
may be judged greater joy than loyalty."
</p><p>"You with your words do contrary yourself," said the
queen, "because man ought as well to rejoice in the
goodness of God in taking him away as through the working of
virtue.  But if the one could be in the one case as sorrowful
as the other could be in the other case disloyal, it might be
consented to your judgement.  To follow the laws of nature
which cannot be fled is no great matter, but to obey the
positive laws is a virtue of the mind; and the virtues of the
mind both for greatness as for every other respect are to be
preferred before bodily works.  And if virtuous works
(making due recompense) do  surmount in greatness every
other working, it may be said that the having been loyal

<pb n="130"/>

endures always in being.  Joy may be turned into sudden
sorrow, either else in a short space of time become little or
nothing, losing that thing through the which it is become
merry.  And therefor let it be said of him that uprightly
will judge, the knight to have been more loyal than the
other merry."</p>

<head>CONCLUSION</head>

<p>NOT one was there that followed Massaline that had
anything more to say, for that they had all now
propounded their questions.  The sun now in
setting left the place replete with a temperate air.  By reason
whereof Fiammetta most reverend queen of this amorous
people, raised her one foot and thus said:
</p><p>"Gentlemen and gentlewomen, your questions are finished
whereunto (the gods be thanked) we have according to our
small knowledge made answer, following rather pleasant
reasoning than matter of contention.  And we know that
much more might have been answered unto the same, yea,
and in far better sort than we have done.  But yet that which
we have said may suffice to our pastime, and for the rest let
it remain to the philosophers of Athens.  We see Phoebus
now not to behold us with a straight aspect; we feel the air
refreshed and know this feast which we at our coming
hither left through the excessive heat, to be again begone by
our companions.  And therefor it seems us good that we
return to the same."
</p><p>And this being said she took with her delicate hand the
laurel crown from her head, and in the place where she sat
she laid it down, saying: "I leave here the crown of my
honour and yours until that we shall return hither to the
like reasoning."

<pb n="132"/>

</p><p>And having thus said she took Philocopo by the hand,
that now with the rest was risen, and so returned with them
all to their feast.
</p><p>Thence was heard of all sides the pleasant instruments
and the air resounding of amorous sounds; no part of the
garden was without banqueting, wherein they all abode
merrily all that day even to the last hour.  But night being
come upon them and the stars shewing forth their light, it
seemed good to the lady and to them all to depart and to
return to the city, wherein being entered, Philocopo taking
his leave, thus said unto her:
</p><p>"Most noble Fiammetta, if the gods should ever grant
me that I were mine own, as I am another's, without doubt
I should be presently yours.  But because mine own I am not,
I cannot give myself to another.  Howbeit forsomuch as the
miserable heart could receive strange fire, so much the more
it feels through your inestimable worthiness to be kindled,
and shall feel always and incessantly with more effect shall
desire never to be forgetful of your worthiness."
</p><p>She thanked Philocopo greatly of his courtesy at his
departure, adding that it would please the gods quickly to
bring a gracious peace to his desire.
