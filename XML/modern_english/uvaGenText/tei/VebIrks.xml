<div1 type="article" id="d3"> 
<p>    It is one of the commonplaces of the received economic theory 
that work is irksome. Many a discussion proceeds on this axiom 
that, so far as regards economic matters, men desire above all 
things to get the goods produced by labor and to avoid the labor 
by which the goods are produced. In a general way the 
common-sense opinion is well in accord with current theory on 
this head. According to the common-sense-ideal, the economic 
beatitude lies in an unrestrained consumption of goods, without 
work; whereas the perfect economic affliction is unremunerated 
labor. Man instinctively revolts at effort that goes to supply 
the means of life.</p> 
<p>    No one will accept the proposition when stated in this bald 
fashion, but even as it stands it is scarcely an overstatement of 
what is implied in the writings of eminent economists. If such an 
aversion to useful effort is an integral part of human nature, 
then the trail of the Edenic serpent should be plain to all men, 
for this is a unique distinction of the human species. A 
consistent aversion to whatever activity goes to maintain the 
life of the species is assuredly found in no other species of 
animal. Under the selective process through which species are 
held to have emerged and gained their stability there is no 
chance for the survival of a species gifted with such an aversion 
to the furtherance of its own life process. If man alone is an 
exception from the selective norm, then the alien propensity in 
question must have been intruded into his make-up by some 
malevolent <hi rend="italic">deus ex machina</hi>.</p> 
   <p> Yet, for all the apparent absurdity of the thing, there is 
the fact. With more or less sincerity, people currently avow an 
aversion to useful effort. The avowal does not cover all effort, 
but only such as is of some use; it is, more particularly, such 
effort as is vulgarly recognized to be useful labor. Less 
 
<pb n="188"/> 
 
repugnance is expressed as regards effort which brings gain 
without giving a product that is of human use, as, for example, 
the effort that goes into war, politics, or other employments of 
a similar nature. And there is commonly no avowed aversion to 
sports or other similar employments that yield neither a 
pecuniary gain nor a useful product. Still, the fact that a given 
line of effort is useless does not of itself save it from being 
odious, as is shown by the case of menial service; much of this 
work serves no useful end, but it is none the less repugnant to 
all people of sensibility.</p> 
<p>    "The economic man," whose lineaments were traced in outline 
by the classical economists and filled in by their caricaturists, 
is an anomaly in the animal word; and yet, to judge by everyday 
popular expressions of inclination, the portrait is not seriously 
overdrawn. But if this economic man is to serve as a lay figure 
upon which to fit the garment of economic doctrines, it is 
incumbent upon the science to explain what are his limitations 
and how he has achieved his emancipation from the law of natural 
selection. His emancipation from the law is, indeed, more 
apparent than substantial. The difference in this respect between 
man and his sometime competitors in the struggle for survival 
lies not in a slighter but in a fuller adjustment of his 
propensities to the purposes of the life of the species. He 
distanced them all in this respect long ago, and by so wide an 
interval that he is now able, without jeopardy to the life of the 
species, to play fast and loose with the spiritual basis of its 
survival.</p> 
<lb/> 
<p>    Like other animals, man is an agent that acts in response to 
stimuli afforded by the environment in which he lives. Like other 
species, he is a creature of habit and propensity. But in a 
higher degree than other species, man mentally digests the 
content of the habits under whose guidance he acts, and 
appreciates the trend of these habits and propensities. He is in 
an eminent sense an intelligent agent. By selective necessity he 
is endowed with a proclivity for purposeful action. He is 
possessed of a discriminating sense of purpose, by force of which 
 
<pb n="189"/> 
 
all futility of life or of action is distasteful to him. There 
may be a wide divergence between individuals as regards the form 
and the direction in which this impulse expresses itself, but the 
impulse itself is not a matter of idiosyncrasy, it is a generic 
feature of human nature. It is not a trait that occurs 
sporadically in a few individuals. Cases occur in which this 
proclivity for purposeful action is wanting or is present in 
obviously scant measure, but persons endowed in this stepmotherly 
fashion are classed as "defective subjects." Lines of descent 
which carry this defective human nature dwindle and decay even 
under the propitious circumstances of modern life. The history of 
hereditarily dependent or defective families is evidence to this 
effect.</p> 
<p>    Man's great advantage over other species in the struggle for 
survival has been his superior facility in turning the forces of 
the environment to account. It is to his proclivity for turning 
the material means of life to account that he owes his position 
as lord of creation. It is not a proclivity to effort, but to 
achievement-to the compassing of an end. His primacy is in the 
last resort an industrial or economic primacy. In his economic 
life man is an agent, not an absorbent; he is an agent seeking in 
every act the accomplishment of some concrete, objective, 
impersonal end. As this pervading norm of action guides the life 
of men in all the use they make of material things, so it must 
also serve as the point of departure and afford the guiding 
principle for any science that aims to be a theory of the 
economic life process. Within the purview of economic theory, the 
last analysis of any given phenomenon must run back to this 
ubiquitous human impulse to do the next thing.</p> 
<p>    All this seems to contradict what has just been said of the 
conventional aversion to labor. But the contradiction is not so 
sheer in fact as it appears to be at first sight. Its solution 
lies in the fact that the aversion to labor is in great part a 
conventional aversion only. In the intervals of sober reflection, 
when not harassed with the strain of overwork, men's common sense 
speaks unequivocally under the guidance of the instinct of 
workmanship. They like to see others spend their life to some 
purpose, and they like to reflect that their own life is of some 
use. All men  
 
<pb n="190"/> 
 
have this quasi-aesthetic sense of economic or 
industrial merit, and to this sense of economic merit futility 
and inefficiency are distasteful. In its positive expression it 
is an impulse or instinct of workmanship; negatively it expresses 
itself in a deprecation of waste. This sense of merit and demerit 
with respect to the material furtherance or hindrance of life 
approves, the economically effective act and deprecates economic 
futility. It is needless to point out in detail the close 
relation between this norm of economic merit and the ethical norm 
of conduct, on the one hand, and the aesthetic norm of taste, on 
the other. It is very closely related to both of these, both as 
regards its biological ground and as regards the scope and method 
of its award.</p> 
<p>    This instinct of workmanship apparently stands in sheer 
conflict with the conventional antipathy to useful effort. The 
two are found together in full discord in the common run of men; 
but whenever a deliberate judgment is passed on conduct or on 
events, the former asserts its primacy in a pervasive way which 
suggests that it is altogether the more generic, more abiding 
trait of human nature. There can scarcely be a serious question 
of precedence between the two. The former is a human trait 
necessary to the survival of the species; the latter is a habit 
of thought possible only in a species which has distanced all 
competitors, and then it prevails only by sufferance and within 
limits set by the former. The question between them is, Is the 
aversion to labor a derivative of the instinct of workmanship? 
and, How has it arisen and gained consistency in spite of its 
being at variance with that instinct?</p> 
 <p>   Until recently there has been something of a consensus among 
those who have written on early culture, to the effect that man, 
as he first emerged upon the properly human plane, was of a 
contentious disposition, inclined to isolate his own interest and 
purposes from those of his fellows, and with a penchant for feuds 
and brawls. Accordingly, even where the view is met with that men 
are by native proclivity inclined to action, there is still 
evident a presumption that this native proclivity to action is a 
proclivity to action of a destructive kind. It is held that men 
are inclined to fight, not to work -that the end of action in the normal case is damage rather than repair. This view would 
make the proclivity to purposeful  
 
<pb n="191"/> 
 
action an impulse to 
sportsmanship rather than to workmanship. In any attempt to fit 
this view into an evolutionary scheme of culture it would carry 
the implication that in the prehuman or proto-anthropoid phase of 
its life the race was a predaceous species, and that the initial 
phase of human culture, as well as the later cultural 
development, has been substantially of a predatory kind.</p> 
<p>    There is much to be said for this view. If mankind is by 
derivation a race not of workmen but of sportsmen, then there is 
no need of explaining the conventional aversion to work. Work is 
unsportsmanlike and therefore distasteful, and perplexity then 
arises in explaining how men have in any degree become reconciled 
to any but a predaceous life. Apart from the immediate 
convenience of this view, it is also enforced by much evidence. 
Most peoples at a lower stage of culture than our own are of a 
more predatory habit than our people. The history of mankind, as 
conventionally written, has been a narrative of predatory 
exploits, and this history is not commonly felt to be one-sided 
or misinformed. And a sportsmanlike inclination to warfare is 
also to be found in nearly all modern communities. Similarly, the 
sense of honor, so-called, whether it is individual or national 
honor, is also an expression of sportsmanship. The prevalence of 
notions of honor may, therefore, be taken as evidence going in 
the same direction. And as if to further fortify the claim of 
sportsmanship to antiquity and prescriptive standing, the sense 
of honor is also noticeably more vivid in communities of a 
somewhat more archaic culture than our own.</p> 
   <p> Yet there is a considerable body of evidence, both from 
cultural history and from the present-day phenomena of human 
life, which traverses this conventionally accepted view that 
makes man generically a sportsman. Obscurely but persistently, 
throughout the history of human culture, the great body of the 
people have almost everywhere, in their everyday life, been at 
work to turn things to human use. The proximate aim of all 
industrial improvement has been the better performance of some 
workmanlike task. Necessarily this work has, on the one hand, 
 
<pb n="192"/> 
 
proceeded on the basis of an appreciative interest in the work to 
be done; for there is no other ground on which to obtain anything 
better than the aimless performance of a task. And necessarily 
also, on the other hand, the discipline of work has acted to 
develop a workmanlike attitude. It will not do to say that the 
work accomplished is entirely due to compulsion under a predatory 
regime, for the most striking advances in this respect have been 
wrought where the coercive force of a sportsmanlike exploitation 
has been least.</p> 
<p>    The same view is borne out by the expressions of common 
sense. As has already been remarked, whenever they 
dispassionately take thought and pass a judgment on the value of 
human conduct, the common run of mature men approve workmanship 
rather than sportsmanship. At the best, they take an apologetic 
attitude toward the latter. This is well seen in the present ( 
May, 1 898) disturbance of the popular temper. While it may well 
be granted that the warlike raid upon which this community is 
entering is substantially an access of sportsmanlike exaltation, 
it is to be noticed that nearly all those who speak for war are 
at pains to find some colorable motive of another kind. Predatory 
exploit, simply as such, is not felt to carry its own 
legitimation, as it should in the apprehension of any species 
that is primarily of a predaceous character. What meets 
unreserved approval is such conduct as furthers human life on the 
whole, rather than such as furthers the invidious or predatory 
interest of one as against another.</p> 
<p>    The most ancient and most consistent habits of the race will 
best assert themselves when men are not speaking under the stress 
of instant irritation. Under such circumstances the ancient bent 
may even bear down the immediate conventional canons of conduct. 
The archaic turn of mind that inclines men to commend workmanlike 
serviceability is the outcome of long and consistent habituation 
to a course of life of such a character as is reflected by this 
inclination.</p> 
<lb/> 
   <p> Man's life is activity; and as he acts, so he thinks and 
feels. This is necessarily so, since it is the agent man that  
does the  
 
<pb n="193"/> 
 
thinking and feeling. Like other species, man is a 
creature of habits and propensities. He acts under the guidance 
of propensities which have been imposed upon him by the process 
of selection to which he owes his differentiation from other 
species. He is a social animal; and the selective process whereby 
he has acquired the spiritual make-up of a social animal has at 
the same time made him substantially a peaceful animal. The race 
may have wandered far from the ancient position of peacefulness, 
but even now the traces of a peaceful trend in men's everyday 
habits of thought and feeling are plain enough. The sight of 
blood and the presence of death, even of the blood or death of 
the lower animals, commonly strike inexperienced persons with a 
sickening revulsion. In the common run of cases, the habit of 
complacency with slaughter comes only as the result of 
discipline. In this respect man differs from the beasts of prey. 
He differs, of course, most widely in this respect from the 
solitary beasts, but even among the gregarious animals his 
nearest spiritual relatives are not found among the carnivora. In 
his unarmed frame and in the slight degree to which his muscular 
force is specialized for fighting, as well as in his instinctive 
aversion to hostile contact with the ferocious beasts, man is to 
be classed with those animals that owe their survival to an 
aptitude, for avoiding direct conflict with their competitors, 
rather than with those which survive by virtue of overcoming and 
eating their rivals.</p> 
<p>    "Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living 
things," and, according to the Law of the Jungle, it is his part 
to take advice and contrive and turn divers things to account in 
ways that are incomprehensible to the rest. Without tools he is 
not a dangerous animal, as animals go. And he did not become a 
formidable animal until he had made some considerable advance in 
the contrivance of implements for combat. In the days before 
tools had been brought into effective use -that is to say, 
during by far the greater part of the period of human evolution -man could not be primarily an agent of destruction or a disturber 
of the peace. He was of a peaceable and retiring disposition by 
force of circumstances. With the use of tools the possibility of 
 
<pb n="194"/> 
 
his acquiring a different disposition gradually began, but even 
then the circumstances favoring the growth of a contentious 
disposition supervened only gradually and partially. The habits 
of life of the race were still perforce of a peaceful and 
industrial character, rather than contentious and destructive. 
Tools and implements, in the early days, must have served chiefly 
to shape facts and objects for human use, rather than for 
inflicting damage and discomfort. Industry would have to develop 
far before it became possible for one group of men to live at the 
cost of another; and during the protracted evolution of industry 
before this point had been reached the discipline of associated 
life still consistently ran in the direction of industrial 
efficiency, both as regards men's physical and mental traits and 
as regards their spiritual attitude.</p> 
<p>    By selection and by training, the life of man, before a 
predaceous life became possible, would act to develop and to 
conserve in him instinct for workmanship. The adaptation to the 
environment which the situation enforced was of an industrial 
kind; it required men to acquire facility in shaping things and 
situations for human use. This does not mean the shaping of 
things by the individual to his own individual use simply; for 
archaic man was necessarily a member of a group, and during this 
early stage, when industrial efficiency was still inconsiderable, 
no group could have survived except on the basis of a sense of 
solidarity strong enough to throw self-interest into the 
background. Self-interest, as an accepted guide of action, is 
possible only as the concomitant of a predatory life, and a 
predatory life is possible only after the use of tools has 
developed so far as to leave a large surplus of product over what 
is required for the sustenance of the producers. Subsistence by 
predation implies something substantial to prey upon.</p> 
<p>    Early man was a member of a group which depended for its 
survival on the industrial efficiency of its members and on their 
singleness of purpose in making use of the material means at 
hand. Some competition between groups for the possession of the 
fruits of the earth and for advantageous locations there would be 
even at a relatively early stage, but much hostile 
 
 <pb n="195"/> 
 
contact between groups there could not be; not enough to shape the 
dominant habits of thought.</p> 
   <p> What men can do easily is what they do habitually, and this 
decides what they can think and know easily. They feel at home in 
the range of ideas which is familiar through their everyday line 
of action. A habitual line of action constitutes a habitual line 
of thought, and gives the point of view from which facts and 
events are apprehended and reduced to a body of knowledge. What 
is consistent with the habitual course of action is consistent 
with the habitual line of thought, and gives the definitive 
ground of knowledge as well as the conventional standard of 
complacency or approval in any community. Conversely, a processor 
method of life, once understood, assimilated in thought works 
into the scheme of life and becomes a norm of conduct, simply 
because the thinking, knowing agent is also the acting agent. 
What is apprehended with facility and is consistent with the 
process of life and knowledge is thereby apprehended as right and 
good. All this applies with added force where the habituation is 
not simply individual and sporadic, but is enforced upon the 
group or the race by a selective elimination of those individuals 
and lines of descent that do not conform to the required canon of 
knowledge and conduct. Where this takes place, the acquired 
proclivity passes from the status of habit to that of aptitude or 
propensity. It becomes a transmissible trait, and action under 
its guidance becomes right and good, and the longer and more 
consistent the selective adaptation through which the aptitude 
arises, the more firmly is the resulting aptitude settled upon 
the race, and the more unquestioned becomes the sanction of the 
resulting canon of conduct.</p> 
<p>    So far as regards his relation to the material means of life, 
the canon of thought and of conduct which was in this way 
enforced upon early man was what is here called the instinct of 
workmanship. The interest which men took in economic facts on the 
basis of this propensity, in the days before spoliation came into 
vogue, was not primarily of a self-regarding character. The 
necessary dominance of a sense of group solidarity would  
 
<pb n="196"/> 
 
preclude that. The selective process must eliminate lines of descent 
unduly gifted with a self-regarding bias. Still, there was some 
emulation between individuals, even in the most indigent and most 
peaceable groups. From the readiness with which a scheme of 
emulation is entered upon where late circumstances favor its 
development, it seems probable that the proclivity to emulation 
must have been present also in the earlier days in sufficient 
force to assert itself to the extent to which the exigencies of 
the earlier life of the group would permit. But this emulation 
could not run in the direction of an individual, acquisition or 
accumulation of goods, or of a life consistently given to raids 
and tumults. It would be emulation such as is found among the 
peaceable gregarious animals generally; that is to say, it was 
primarily and chiefly sexual emulation, recurring with more or 
less regularity. Beyond this there must also have been some 
wrangling in the distribution of goods on hand, but neither this 
nor the rivalry for subsistence could have been the dominant note 
of life.</p> 
<lb/> 
<p>    Under the canon of conduct imposed by the instinct of 
workmanship, efficiency, serviceability, commends itself, and 
inefficiency or futility is odious. Man contemplates his own 
conduct and that of his neighbors, and passes a judgment of 
complacency or of dispraise. The degree of effectiveness with 
which he lives up to the accepted standard of efficiency in great 
measure determines his contentment with himself and his 
situation. A wide or persistent discrepancy in this respect is a 
source of abounding spiritual discomfort.</p> 
<p>    Judgment may in this way be passed on the intention of the 
agent or on the serviceability of the act. In the former case the 
award of merit or demerit is to be classed as moral; and with 
award of merit of this kind this paper is not concerned. As 
regards serviceability or efficiency, men do not only take 
thought at first hand of the facts of their own conduct; they are 
also sensitive to rebuke or approval from others. Not only is the 
immediate consciousness of the achievement of a purpose 
gratifying and stimulating, but the imputation of  
 
<pb n="197"/> 
 
efficiency by one's fellows is perhaps no less gratifying or stimulating.</p> 
   <p> Sensitiveness to rebuke or approval is a matter of selective 
necessity under the circumstances of associated life. Without it 
no group of men could carry on a collective life in a material 
environment that requires shaping to the ends of man. In this 
respect, again, man shows a spiritual relationship with the 
gregarious animals rather than with the solitarY beasts of prey.</p> 
<p>    Under the guidance of this taste for good work, men are 
compared with one another and with the accepted ideals of 
efficiency, and are rated and graded by the common sense of their 
fellows according to a conventional scheme of merit and demerit. 
The imputation of efficiency necessarily proceeds on evidence of 
efficiency. The visible achievement of one man is, therefore, 
compared with that of another, and the award of esteem comes 
habitually to rest on an invidious comparison of persons instead 
of on the immediate bearing of the given line of conduct upon the 
approved end of action. The ground of esteem in this way shifts 
from a direct appreciation of the expediency of conduct to a 
comparison of the abilities of different agents. Instead of a 
valuation of serviceability, there is a gauging of capability on 
the ground of visible success. And what comes to be compared in 
an invidious comparison of this kind between agents is the force 
which the agent is able to put forth,.rather than the 
serviceability of the agent's conduct. So soon, therefore, and in 
so far, as the esteem awarded to serviceability passes into an 
invidious esteem of one agent as compared with another, the end 
sought in action will tend to change from naive expediency to the 
manifestation of capacity or force. It becomes the proximate end 
of effort to put forth evidence of power, rather than to achieve 
an impersonal end for its own sake, simply as an item of human 
use. So that, while in its more immediate expression the norm of 
economic taste stands out as an impulse to workmanship or a taste 
for serviceability and a distaste for futility, under given 
circumstances of associated life it comes in some degree to take 
on the character of an emulative demonstration of force.</p> 
 
<pb n="198"/> 
 
   <p> Since the imputation of efficiency and of invidious merit 
goes on the evidence afforded by visible success, the appearance 
of evil must be avoided in order to escape dispraise. In the 
early savage culture, while the group is small and while the 
conditions favorable to a predatory life are still wanting, the 
resulting emulation between the members of the group runs chiefly 
to industrial efficiency. It comes to be the appearance of 
industrial incapacity that is to be avoided. It is in this 
direction that force or capacity can be put in evidence most 
consistently and with the best effect for the good name of the 
individual. It is, therefore, in this direction that a standard 
of merit and a canon of meritorious conduct will develop. But 
even for a growth of emulation in the productive use of brain and 
muscle, the small, rude, peaceable group of savages is not 
fertile ground. The situation does not favor a vigorous emulative 
spirit. The conditions favorable to the growth of a habit of 
emulative demonstration of force are (1) the frequent recurrence 
of conjunctures that call for a great and sudden strain, and (2) 
exposure of the individual to a large, and especially to a 
shifting, human environment whose approval is sought. These 
conditions are not effectually met on the lower levels of 
savagery, such as human culture must have been during the early 
days of the use of tools. Accordingly, relatively little of the 
emulative spirit is seen in communities that have retained the 
archaic, peaceable constitution, or that have reverted to it from 
a higher culture. In such communities a low standard of culture 
and comfort goes along with an absence of strenuous application 
to the work in hand, as well as a relative absence of jealousy 
and gradations of rank. Notions of economic rank and 
discrimination between persons, whether in point of possessions 
or in point of comfort, are almost, if not altogether, in 
abeyance.</p> 
<p>    With a further development of the use of tools and of human 
command over the forces of the environment, the habits of life of 
the savage group change. There is likely to be more of 
aggression, both in the way of a pursuit of large game and in the 
way of conflict between groups. As the industrial efficiency of 
the group increases, and as weapons are brought to greater 
perfection,  
 
<pb n="199"/> 
 
the incentives to aggression and the opportunities 
for achievement along this line increase. The conditions 
favorable to emulation are more fully met. With the increasing 
density of population that follows from a heightened industrial 
efficiency, the group passes, by force of circumstances, from the 
archaic condition of poverty-stricken peace to a stage of 
predatory life. This fighting stage -the beginning of barbarism 
-may involve aggressive predation, or the group may simply be 
placed on the defensive. One or the other, or both the lines of 
activity -and commonly both, no doubt -will be forced upon the 
group, on pain of extermination. This has apparently been the 
usual course of early social evolution.</p> 
<p>    When a group emerges into this predatory phase of its 
development, the employments which most occupy men's attention 
are employments that involve exploit. The most serious concern of 
the group, and at the same time the direction in which the most 
spectacular effect may be achieved by the individual, is conflict 
with men and beasts. It becomes easy to make a telling comparison 
between men when their work is a series of exploits carried out 
against these difficult adversaries or against the formidable 
movements of the elements. The assertion of the strong hand, 
successful aggression, usually of a destructive character, 
becomes the accepted basis of repute. The dominant life interest 
of the group throws its strong light upon this creditable 
employment of force and sagacity, and the other, obscurer ways of 
serving the group's life fall into the background. The guiding 
animus of the group becomes a militant one, and men's actions are 
judged from the standpoint of the fighting man. What is 
recognized, without reflection and without misgiving, as 
serviceable and effective in such a group is fighting capacity. 
Exploit becomes the conventional ground of invidious comparison 
between individuals, and repute comes to rest on prowess.</p> 
<p>    As the predatory culture reaches a fuller development, there 
comes a distinction between employments. The tradition of 
prowess, as the virtue par excellence, gains in scope and 
consistency until prowess comes near being recognized as the sole 
virtue. Those employments alone are then worthy and reputable 
 
<pb n="200"/> 
 
which involve the exercise of this virtue. Other employments, in 
which men are occupied with tamely shaping inert materials to 
human use, become unworthy and end with becoming debasing. The 
honorable man must not only show capacity for predatory exploit, 
but he must also avoid entanglement with the occupations that do 
not involve exploit. The tame employments, those that involve no 
obvious destruction of life and no spectacular coercion of 
refractory antagonists, fall into disrepute and are relegated to 
those members of the community who are defective in predatory 
capacity; that is to say, those who are lacking in massiveness, 
agility, or ferocity. Occupation in these employments argues that 
the person so occupied falls short of that decent modicum of 
prowess which would entitle him to be graded as a man in good 
standing. In order to an unsullied reputation, the appearance of 
evil must be avoided. Therefore the able-bodied barbarian of the 
predatory culture, who is at all mindful of his good name, 
severely leaves all uneventful drudgery to the women and minors 
of the group. He puts in his time in the manly arts of war and 
devotes his talents to devising ways and means of disturbing the 
peace. That way lies honor.</p> 
<p>    In the barbarian scheme of life the peaceable, industrial 
employments are women's work. They imply defective force, 
incapacity for aggression or devastation, and are therefore not 
of good report. But whatever is accepted as a conventional mark of a shortcoming or a vice comes presently to be accounted 
intrinsically base. In this way industrial occupations fall under 
a polite odium and are apprehended to be substantially ignoble. 
They are unsportsmanlike. Labor carries a taint, and all 
contamination from vulgar employments must be shunned by 
self-respecting men.</p> 
<p>    Where the predatory culture has developed in full 
consistency, the common-sense apprehension that labor is ignoble 
has developed into the further refinement that labor is wrong -for those who are not already beneath reproach. Hence certain 
well-known features of caste and tabu. In the further cultural 
development, when some wealth has been accumulated and the 
members of the community fall into a servile class on the one 
hand  
 
<pb n="201"/> 
 
and a leisure class on the other, the tradition that labor 
is ignoble gains an added significance. It is not only a mark of 
inferior force, but it is also a perquisite of the poor. This is 
the situation today. Labor is morally impossible by force of the 
ancient tradition that has come down from early barbarism, and it 
is shameful by force of its evil association with poverty. It is 
indecorous.</p> 
   <p> The irksomeness of labor is a spiritual fact; it lies in the 
indignity of the thing. The fact of its irksomeness is, of 
course, none the less real and cogent for its being of a 
spiritual kind. Indeed, it is all the more substantial and 
irremediable on that account. Physical irksomeness and 
distastefulness can be borne, if only the spiritual incentive is 
present. Witness the attractiveness of warfare, both to the 
barbarian and to the civilized youth. The most common-place 
recital of a campaigner's experience carries a sweeping 
suggestion of privation, exposure, fatigue, vermin, squalor, 
sickness, and loathsome death; the incidents and accessories of 
war are said to be unsavory, unsightly, unwholesome beyond the 
power of words; yet warfare is an attractive employment if one 
only is gifted with a suitable habit of mind. Most sports, and 
many other polite employments that are distressing but 
creditable, are evidence to the same effect.</p> 
    <p>Physical irksomeness is an incommodity which men habitually 
make light of if it is not reinforced by the sanction of decorum; 
but it is otherwise with the spiritual irksomeness of such labor 
as is condemned by polite usage. That is a cultural fact. There 
is no remedy for this kind of irksomeness, short of a subversion 
of that cultural structure on which our canons of decency rest. 
Appeal may of course be made to taste and conscience to set aside 
the conventional aversion to labor; such an appeal is made from 
time to time by well-meaning and sanguine persons, and some 
fitful results have been achieved in that way. But the 
commonplace, common-sense man is bound by the deliverances of 
common-sense decorum on this head -the heritage of an unbroken 
cultural line of descent that runs back to the beginning.</p>
