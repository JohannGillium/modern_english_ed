<head>The Creation of the World</head>
<lg type="verse"><l n="1:1"> Of bodies chang'd to various forms, I sing:
</l><l n="1:2"> Ye Gods, from whom these miracles did spring,
</l><l n="1:3"> Inspire my numbers with coelestial heat;
</l><l n="1:4"> 'Till I my long laborious work compleat:
</l><l n="1:5"> And add perpetual tenour to my rhimes,
</l><l n="1:6"> Deduc'd from Nature's birth, to Caesar's times.
</l><l n="1:7"> Before the seas, and this terrestrial ball,
</l><l n="1:8"> And Heav'n's high canopy, that covers all,
</l><l n="1:9"> One was the face of Nature; if a face:
</l><l n="1:10"> Rather a rude and indigested mass:
</l><l n="1:11"> A lifeless lump, unfashion'd, and unfram'd,
</l><l n="1:12"> Of jarring seeds; and justly Chaos nam'd.
</l><l n="1:13"> No sun was lighted up, the world to view;
</l><l n="1:14"> No moon did yet her blunted horns renew:
</l><l n="1:15"> Nor yet was Earth suspended in the sky,
</l><l n="1:16"> Nor pois'd, did on her own foundations lye:
</l><l n="1:17"> Nor seas about the shores their arms had thrown;
</l><l n="1:18"> But earth, and air, and water, were in one.
</l><l n="1:19"> Thus air was void of light, and earth unstable,
</l><l n="1:20"> And water's dark abyss unnavigable.
</l><l n="1:21"> No certain form on any was imprest;
</l><l n="1:22"> All were confus'd, and each disturb'd the rest.
</l><l n="1:23"> For hot and cold were in one body fixt;
</l><l n="1:24"> And soft with hard, and light with heavy mixt.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:25"> But God, or Nature, while they thus contend,
</l><l n="1:26"> To these intestine discords put an end:
</l><l n="1:27"> Then earth from air, and seas from earth were driv'n,
</l><l n="1:28"> And grosser air sunk from aetherial Heav'n.
</l><l n="1:29"> Thus disembroil'd, they take their proper place;
</l><l n="1:30"> The next of kin, contiguously embrace;
</l><l n="1:31"> And foes are sunder'd, by a larger space.
</l><l n="1:32"> The force of fire ascended first on high,
</l><l n="1:33"> And took its dwelling in the vaulted sky:
</l><l n="1:34"> Then air succeeds, in lightness next to fire;
</l><l n="1:35"> Whose atoms from unactive earth retire.
</l><l n="1:36"> Earth sinks beneath, and draws a num'rous throng
</l><l n="1:37"> Of pondrous, thick, unwieldy seeds along.
</l><l n="1:38"> About her coasts, unruly waters roar;
</l><l n="1:39"> And rising, on a ridge, insult the shore.
</l></lg></div2><div2 type="canto" id="d5"><head>The Formation of Man</head>
<lg type="verse"><l n="1:40"> Thus when the God, whatever God was he,
</l><l n="1:41"> Had form'd the whole, and made the parts agree,
</l><l n="1:42"> That no unequal portions might be found,
</l><l n="1:43"> He moulded Earth into a spacious round:
</l><l n="1:44"> Then with a breath, he gave the winds to blow;
</l><l n="1:45"> And bad the congregated waters flow.
</l><l n="1:46"> He adds the running springs, and standing lakes;
</l><l n="1:47"> And bounding banks for winding rivers makes.
</l><l n="1:48"> Some part, in Earth are swallow'd up, the most
</l><l n="1:49"> In ample oceans, disembogu'd, are lost.
</l><l n="1:50"> He shades the woods, the vallies he restrains
</l><l n="1:51"> With rocky mountains, and extends the plains.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:52"> And as five zones th' aetherial regions bind,
</l><l n="1:53"> Five, correspondent, are to Earth assign'd:
</l><l n="1:54"> The sun with rays, directly darting down,
</l><l n="1:55"> Fires all beneath, and fries the middle zone:
</l><l n="1:56"> The two beneath the distant poles, complain
</l><l n="1:57"> Of endless winter, and perpetual rain.
</l><l n="1:58"> Betwixt th' extreams, two happier climates hold
</l><l n="1:59"> The temper that partakes of hot, and cold.
</l><l n="1:60"> The fields of liquid air, inclosing all,
</l><l n="1:61"> Surround the compass of this earthly ball:
</l><l n="1:62"> The lighter parts lye next the fires above;
</l><l n="1:63"> The grosser near the watry surface move:
</l><l n="1:64"> Thick clouds are spread, and storms engender there,
</l><l n="1:65"> And thunder's voice, which wretched mortals fear,
</l><l n="1:66"> And winds that on their wings cold winter bear.
</l><l n="1:67"> Nor were those blustring brethren left at large,
</l><l n="1:68"> On seas, and shores, their fury to discharge:
</l><l n="1:69"> Bound as they are, and circumscrib'd in place,
</l><l n="1:70"> They rend the world, resistless, where they pass;
</l><l n="1:71"> And mighty marks of mischief leave behind;
</l><l n="1:72"> Such is the rage of their tempestuous kind.
</l><l n="1:73"> First Eurus to the rising morn is sent
</l><l n="1:74"> (The regions of the balmy continent);
</l><l n="1:75"> And Eastern realms, where early Persians run,
</l><l n="1:76"> To greet the blest appearance of the sun.
</l><l n="1:77"> Westward, the wanton Zephyr wings his flight;
</l><l n="1:78"> Pleas'd with the remnants of departing light:
</l><l n="1:79"> Fierce Boreas, with his off-spring, issues forth
</l><l n="1:80"> T' invade the frozen waggon of the North.
</l><l n="1:81"> While frowning Auster seeks the Southern sphere;
</l><l n="1:82"> And rots, with endless rain, th' unwholsom year.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:83"> High o'er the clouds, and empty realms of wind,
</l><l n="1:84"> The God a clearer space for Heav'n design'd;
</l><l n="1:85"> Where fields of light, and liquid aether flow;
</l><l n="1:86"> Purg'd from the pondrous dregs of Earth below.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:87"> Scarce had the Pow'r distinguish'd these, when streight
</l><l n="1:88"> The stars, no longer overlaid with weight,
</l><l n="1:89"> Exert their heads, from underneath the mass;
</l><l n="1:90"> And upward shoot, and kindle as they pass,
</l><l n="1:91"> And with diffusive light adorn their heav'nly place.
</l><l n="1:92"> Then, every void of Nature to supply,
</l><l n="1:93"> With forms of Gods he fills the vacant sky:
</l><l n="1:94"> New herds of beasts he sends, the plains to share:
</l><l n="1:95"> New colonies of birds, to people air:
</l><l n="1:96"> And to their oozy beds, the finny fish repair.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:97"> A creature of a more exalted kind
</l><l n="1:98"> Was wanting yet, and then was Man design'd:
</l><l n="1:99"> Conscious of thought, of more capacious breast,
</l><l n="1:100"> For empire form'd, and fit to rule the rest:
</l><l n="1:101"> Whether with particles of heav'nly fire
</l><l n="1:102"> The God of Nature did his soul inspire,
</l><l n="1:103"> Or Earth, but new divided from the sky,
</l><l n="1:104"> And, pliant, still retain'd th' aetherial energy:
</l><l n="1:105"> Which wise Prometheus temper'd into paste,
</l><l n="1:106"> And, mixt with living streams, the godlike image cast.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:107"> Thus, while the mute creation downward bend
</l><l n="1:108"> Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend,
</l><l n="1:109"> Man looks aloft; and with erected eyes
</l><l n="1:110"> Beholds his own hereditary skies.
</l><l n="1:111"> From such rude principles our form began;
</l><l n="1:112"> And earth was metamorphos'd into Man.
</l></lg></div2><div2 type="canto" id="d6"><head>The Golden Age</head>
<lg type="verse"><l n="1:113"> The golden age was first; when Man yet new,
</l><l n="1:114"> No rule but uncorrupted reason knew:
</l><l n="1:115"> And, with a native bent, did good pursue.
</l><l n="1:116"> Unforc'd by punishment, un-aw'd by fear,
</l><l n="1:117"> His words were simple, and his soul sincere;
</l><l n="1:118"> Needless was written law, where none opprest:
</l><l n="1:119"> The law of Man was written in his breast:
</l><l n="1:120"> No suppliant crowds before the judge appear'd,
</l><l n="1:121"> No court erected yet, nor cause was heard:
</l><l n="1:122"> But all was safe, for conscience was their guard.
</l><l n="1:123"> The mountain-trees in distant prospect please,
</l><l n="1:124"> E're yet the pine descended to the seas:
</l><l n="1:125"> E're sails were spread, new oceans to explore:
</l><l n="1:126"> And happy mortals, unconcern'd for more,
</l><l n="1:127"> Confin'd their wishes to their native shore.
</l><l n="1:128"> No walls were yet; nor fence, nor mote, nor mound,
</l><l n="1:129"> Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound:
</l><l n="1:130"> Nor swords were forg'd; but void of care and crime,
</l><l n="1:131"> The soft creation slept away their time.
</l><l n="1:132"> The teeming Earth, yet guiltless of the plough,
</l><l n="1:133"> And unprovok'd, did fruitful stores allow:
</l><l n="1:134"> Content with food, which Nature freely bred,
</l><l n="1:135"> On wildings and on strawberries they fed;
</l><l n="1:136"> Cornels and bramble-berries gave the rest,
</l><l n="1:137"> And falling acorns furnish'd out a feast.
</l><l n="1:138"> The flow'rs unsown, in fields and meadows reign'd:
</l><l n="1:139"> And Western winds immortal spring maintain'd.
</l><l n="1:140"> In following years, the bearded corn ensu'd
</l><l n="1:141"> From Earth unask'd, nor was that Earth renew'd.
</l><l n="1:142"> From veins of vallies, milk and nectar broke;
</l><l n="1:143"> And honey sweating through the pores of oak.
</l></lg></div2><div2 type="canto" id="d7"><head>The Silver Age</head><lg type="verse">
<l n="1:144"> But when good Saturn, banish'd from above,
</l><l n="1:145"> Was driv'n to Hell, the world was under Jove.
</l><l n="1:146"> Succeeding times a silver age behold,
</l><l n="1:147"> Excelling brass, but more excell'd by gold.
</l><l n="1:148"> Then summer, autumn, winter did appear:
</l><l n="1:149"> And spring was but a season of the year.
</l><l n="1:150"> The sun his annual course obliquely made,
</l><l n="1:151"> Good days contracted, and enlarg'd the bad.
</l><l n="1:152"> Then air with sultry heats began to glow;
</l><l n="1:153"> The wings of winds were clogg'd with ice and snow;
</l><l n="1:154"> And shivering mortals, into houses driv'n,
</l><l n="1:155"> Sought shelter from th' inclemency of Heav'n.
</l><l n="1:156"> Those houses, then, were caves, or homely sheds;
</l><l n="1:157"> With twining oziers fenc'd; and moss their beds.
</l><l n="1:158"> Then ploughs, for seed, the fruitful furrows broke,
</l><l n="1:159"> And oxen labour'd first beneath the yoke.
</l></lg></div2><div2 type="canto" id="d8"><head>The Brazen Age</head><lg type="verse">
<l n="1:160"> To this came next in course, the brazen age:
</l><l n="1:161"> A warlike offspring, prompt to bloody rage,
</l><l n="1:162"> Not impious yet...
</l></lg></div2><div2 type="canto" id="d9"><head>The Iron Age</head><lg type="verse">
<l n="1:163"> Hard steel succeeded then:
</l><l n="1:164"> And stubborn as the metal, were the men.
</l><l n="1:165"> Truth, modesty, and shame, the world forsook:
</l><l n="1:166"> Fraud, avarice, and force, their places took.
</l><l n="1:167"> Then sails were spread, to every wind that blew.
</l><l n="1:168"> Raw were the sailors, and the depths were new:
</l><l n="1:169"> Trees, rudely hollow'd, did the waves sustain;
</l><l n="1:170"> E're ships in triumph plough'd the watry plain.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:171"> Then land-marks limited to each his right:
</l><l n="1:172"> For all before was common as the light.
</l><l n="1:173"> Nor was the ground alone requir'd to bear
</l><l n="1:174"> Her annual income to the crooked share,
</l><l n="1:175"> But greedy mortals, rummaging her store,
</l><l n="1:176"> Digg'd from her entrails first the precious oar;
</l><l n="1:177"> Which next to Hell, the prudent Gods had laid;
</l><l n="1:178"> And that alluring ill, to sight display'd.
</l><l n="1:179"> Thus cursed steel, and more accursed gold,
</l><l n="1:180"> Gave mischief birth, and made that mischief bold:
</l><l n="1:181"> And double death did wretched Man invade,
</l><l n="1:182"> By steel assaulted, and by gold betray'd,
</l><l n="1:183"> Now (brandish'd weapons glittering in their hands)
</l><l n="1:184"> Mankind is broken loose from moral bands;
</l><l n="1:185"> No rights of hospitality remain:
</l><l n="1:186"> The guest, by him who harbour'd him, is slain,
</l><l n="1:187"> The son-in-law pursues the father's life;
</l><l n="1:188"> The wife her husband murders, he the wife.
</l><l n="1:189"> The step-dame poyson for the son prepares;
</l><l n="1:190"> The son inquires into his father's years.
</l><l n="1:191"> Faith flies, and piety in exile mourns;
</l><l n="1:192"> And justice, here opprest, to Heav'n returns.
</l></lg></div2><div2 type="canto" id="d10"><head>The Giants' War</head>
<lg type="verse"><l n="1:193"> Nor were the Gods themselves more safe above;
</l><l n="1:194"> Against beleaguer'd Heav'n the giants move.
</l><l n="1:195"> Hills pil'd on hills, on mountains mountains lie,
</l><l n="1:196"> To make their mad approaches to the skie.
</l><l n="1:197"> 'Till Jove, no longer patient, took his time
</l><l n="1:198"> T' avenge with thunder their audacious crime:
</l><l n="1:199"> Red light'ning plaid along the firmament,
</l><l n="1:200"> And their demolish'd works to pieces rent.
</l><l n="1:201"> Sing'd with the flames, and with the bolts transfixt,
</l><l n="1:202"> With native Earth, their blood the monsters mixt;
</l><l n="1:203"> The blood, indu'd with animating heat,
</l><l n="1:204"> Did in th' impregnant Earth new sons beget:
</l><l n="1:205"> They, like the seed from which they sprung, accurst,
</l><l n="1:206"> Against the Gods immortal hatred nurst,
</l><l n="1:207"> An impious, arrogant, and cruel brood;
</l><l n="1:208"> Expressing their original from blood.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:209"> Which when the king of Gods beheld from high
</l><l n="1:210"> (Withal revolving in his memory,
</l><l n="1:211"> What he himself had found on Earth of late,
</l><l n="1:212"> Lycaon's guilt, and his inhumane treat),
</l><l n="1:213"> He sigh'd; nor longer with his pity strove;
</l><l n="1:214"> But kindled to a wrath becoming Jove:
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:215"> Then call'd a general council of the Gods;
</l><l n="1:216"> Who summon'd, issue from their blest abodes,
</l><l n="1:217"> And fill th' assembly with a shining train.
</l><l n="1:218"> A way there is, in Heav'n's expanded plain,
</l><l n="1:219"> Which, when the skies are clear, is seen below,
</l><l n="1:220"> And mortals, by the name of Milky, know.
</l><l n="1:221"> The ground-work is of stars; through which the road
</l><l n="1:222"> Lyes open to the Thunderer's abode:
</l><l n="1:223"> The Gods of greater nations dwell around,
</l><l n="1:224"> And, on the right and left, the palace bound;
</l><l n="1:225"> The commons where they can: the nobler sort
</l><l n="1:226"> With winding-doors wide open, front the court.
</l><l n="1:227"> This place, as far as Earth with Heav'n may vie,
</l><l n="1:228"> I dare to call the Louvre of the skie.
</l><l n="1:229"> When all were plac'd, in seats distinctly known,
</l><l n="1:230"> And he, their father, had assum'd the throne,
</l><l n="1:231"> Upon his iv'ry sceptre first he leant,
</l><l n="1:232"> Then shook his head, that shook the firmament:
</l><l n="1:233"> Air, Earth, and seas, obey'd th' almighty nod;
</l><l n="1:234"> And, with a gen'ral fear, confess'd the God.
</l><l n="1:235"> At length, with indignation, thus he broke
</l><l n="1:236"> His awful silence, and the Pow'rs bespoke.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:237"> I was not more concern'd in that debate
</l><l n="1:238"> Of empire, when our universal state
</l><l n="1:239"> Was put to hazard, and the giant race
</l><l n="1:240"> Our captive skies were ready to imbrace:
</l><l n="1:241"> For tho' the foe was fierce, the seeds of all
</l><l n="1:242"> Rebellion, sprung from one original;
</l><l n="1:243"> Now, wheresoever ambient waters glide,
</l><l n="1:244"> All are corrupt, and all must be destroy'd.
</l><l n="1:245"> Let me this holy protestation make,
</l><l n="1:246"> By Hell, and Hell's inviolable lake,
</l><l n="1:247"> I try'd whatever in the godhead lay:
</l><l n="1:248"> But gangren'd members must be lopt away,
</l><l n="1:249"> Before the nobler parts are tainted to decay.
</l><l n="1:250"> There dwells below, a race of demi-gods,
</l><l n="1:251"> Of nymphs in waters, and of fawns in woods:
</l><l n="1:252"> Who, tho' not worthy yet, in Heav'n to live,
</l><l n="1:253"> Let 'em, at least, enjoy that Earth we give.
</l><l n="1:254"> Can these be thought securely lodg'd below,
</l><l n="1:255"> When I my self, who no superior know,

</l><l n="1:262"> The nations trembled with a pious fear;
</l><l n="1:263"> All anxious for their earthly Thunderer:

</l><l n="1:272"> Yet what his crimes, and what my judgments were,
</l><l n="1:273"> Remains for me thus briefly to declare.
</l><l n="1:274"> The clamours of this vile degenerate age,
</l><l n="1:275"> The cries of orphans, and th' oppressor's rage,
</l><l n="1:276"> Had reach'd the stars: I will descend, said I,
</l><l n="1:277"> In hope to prove this loud complaint a lye.
</l><l n="1:278"> Disguis'd in humane shape, I travell'd round
</l><l n="1:279"> The world, and more than what I heard, I found.
</l><l n="1:280"> O'er Maenalus I took my steepy way,
</l><l n="1:281"> By caverns infamous for beasts of prey:
</l><l n="1:282"> Then cross'd Cyllene, and the piny shade
</l><l n="1:283"> More infamous, by curst Lycaon made:
</l><l n="1:284"> Dark night had cover'd Heaven, and Earth, before
</l><l n="1:285"> I enter'd his unhospitable door.
</l><l n="1:286"> Just at my entrance, I display'd the sign
</l><l n="1:287"> That somewhat was approaching of divine.
</l><l n="1:288"> The prostrate people pray; the tyrant grins;
</l><l n="1:289"> And, adding prophanation to his sins,
</l><l n="1:290"> I'll try, said he, and if a God appear,
</l><l n="1:291"> To prove his deity shall cost him dear.
</l><l n="1:292"> 'Twas late; the graceless wretch my death prepares,
</l><l n="1:293"> When I shou'd soundly sleep, opprest with cares:
</l><l n="1:294"> This dire experiment he chose, to prove
</l><l n="1:295"> If I were mortal, or undoubted Jove:
</l><l n="1:296"> But first he had resolv'd to taste my pow'r;
</l><l n="1:297"> Not long before, but in a luckless hour,
</l><l n="1:298"> Some legates, sent from the Molossian state,
</l><l n="1:299"> Were on a peaceful errand come to treat:
</l><l n="1:300"> Of these he murders one, he boils the flesh;
</l><l n="1:301"> And lays the mangled morsels in a dish:
</l><l n="1:302"> Some part he roasts; then serves it up, so drest,
</l><l n="1:303"> And bids me welcome to this humane feast.
</l><l n="1:304"> Mov'd with disdain, the table I o'er-turn'd;
</l><l n="1:305"> And with avenging flames, the palace burn'd.
</l><l n="1:306"> The tyrant in a fright, for shelter gains
</l><l n="1:307"> The neighb'ring fields, and scours along the plains.
</l><l n="1:308"> Howling he fled, and fain he wou'd have spoke;
</l><l n="1:309"> But humane voice his brutal tongue forsook.
</l><l n="1:310"> About his lips the gather'd foam he churns,
</l><l n="1:311"> And, breathing slaughters, still with rage he burns,
</l><l n="1:312"> But on the bleating flock his fury turns.
</l><l n="1:313"> His mantle, now his hide, with rugged hairs
</l><l n="1:314"> Cleaves to his back; a famish'd face he bears;
</l><l n="1:315"> His arms descend, his shoulders sink away
</l><l n="1:316"> To multiply his legs for chase of prey.
</l><l n="1:317"> He grows a wolf, his hoariness remains,
</l><l n="1:318"> And the same rage in other members reigns.
</l><l n="1:319"> His eyes still sparkle in a narr'wer space:
</l><l n="1:320"> His jaws retain the grin, and violence of his face
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="1:321"> This was a single ruin, but not one

</l><l n="1:325"> All are alike involv'd in ill, and all

</l><l n="1:327"> Thus ended he; the greater Gods assent;
</l><l n="1:328"> By clamours urging his severe intent;
</l><l n="1:329"> The less fill up the cry for punishment.
</l><l n="1:330"> Yet still with pity they remember Man;
</l><l n="1:331"> And mourn as much as heav'nly spirits can.
</l><l n="1:332"> They ask, when those were lost of humane birth,
</l><l n="1:333"> What he wou'd do with all this waste of Earth:
</l><l n="1:334"> If his dispeopl'd world he would resign

</l><l n="1:338"> To whom the Father of the Gods reply'd,

</l><l n="1:1086"> If still you doubt your mother's innocence,
</l><l n="1:1087"> His eastern mansion is not far from hence;
</l><l n="1:1088"> With little pains you to his Leve go,
</l><l n="1:1089"> And from himself your parentage may know.
</l><l n="1:1090"> With joy th' ambitious youth his mother heard,
</l><l n="1:1091"> And eager, for the journey soon prepar'd.
</l><l n="1:1092"> He longs the world beneath him to survey;
</l><l n="1:1093"> To guide the chariot; and to give the day:
</l><l n="1:1094"> From Meroe's burning sands he bends his course,
</l><l n="1:1095"> Nor less in India feels his father's force:
</l><l n="1:1096"> His travel urging, till he came in sight;
</l><l n="1:1097"> And saw the palace by the purple light.

</l><l n="2:4"> And with a milder gleam refresh'd the sight;
</l><l n="2:5"> Of polish'd iv'ry was the cov'ring wrought:

</l><l n="2:9"> A waving sea th' inferiour Earth embrac'd,
</l><l n="2:10"> And Gods and Goddesses the waters grac'd.

</l><l n="2:18"> A sister's likeness was in ev'ry face.
</l><l n="2:19"> On Earth a diff'rent landskip courts the eyes,

</l><l n="2:73"> To mount the burning axle-tree, but I;
</l><l n="2:74"> Not Jove himself, the ruler of the sky,
</l><l n="2:75"> That hurles the three-fork'd thunder from above,
</l><l n="2:76"> Dares try his strength: yet who so strong as Jove?
</l><l n="2:77"> The steeds climb up the first ascent with pain,
</l><l n="2:78"> And when the middle firmament they gain,
</l><l n="2:79"> If downward from the Heav'ns my head I bow,
</l><l n="2:80"> And see the Earth and Ocean hang below,
</l><l n="2:81"> Ev'n I am seiz'd with horror and affright,
</l><l n="2:82"> And my own heart misgives me at the sight.
</l><l n="2:83"> A mighty downfal steeps the ev'ning stage,

</l><l n="2:85"> Tethys herself has fear'd to see me driv'n
</l><l n="2:86"> Down headlong from the precipice of Heav'n.
</l><l n="2:87"> Besides, consider what impetuous force
</l><l n="2:88"> Turns stars and planets in a diff'rent course.
</l><l n="2:89"> I steer against their motions; nor am I
</l><l n="2:90"> Born back by all the current of the sky.
</l><l n="2:91"> But how cou'd you resist the orbs that roul
</l><l n="2:92"> In adverse whirls, and stem the rapid pole?
</l><l n="2:93"> But you perhaps may hope for pleasing woods,
</l><l n="2:94"> And stately dooms, and cities fill'd with Gods;
</l><l n="2:95"> While through a thousand snares your progress lies,
</l><l n="2:96"> Where forms of starry monsters stock the skies:
</l><l n="2:97"> For, shou'd you hit the doubtful way aright,
</l><l n="2:98"> The bull with stooping horns stands opposite;
</l><l n="2:99"> Next him the bright Haemonian bow is strung,

</l><l n="2:104"> The mettled steeds, when from their nostrils flows
</l><l n="2:105"> The scorching fire, that in their entrails glows.
</l><l n="2:106"> Ev'n I their head-strong fury scarce restrain,
</l><l n="2:107"> When they grow warm and restif to the rein.
</l><l n="2:108"> Let not my son a fatal gift require,
</l><l n="2:109"> But, O! in time, recall your rash desire;
</l><l n="2:110"> You ask a gift that may your parent tell,
</l><l n="2:111"> Let these my fears your parentage reveal;

</l><l n="2:1052"> A neighb'ring hill, and drove 'em to the shore;
</l><l n="2:1053"> Where the king's daughter, with a lovely train
</l><l n="2:1054"> Of fellow-nymphs, was sporting on the plain.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="2:1055"> The dignity of empire laid aside,

</l><l n="2:1060"> Frisk'd in a bull, and bellow'd o'er the plain.
</l><l n="2:1061"> Large rowles of fat about his shoulders clung,
</l><l n="2:1062"> And from his neck the double dewlap hung.
</l><l n="2:1063"> His skin was whiter than the snow that lies
</l><l n="2:1064"> Unsully'd by the breath of southern skies;
</l><l n="2:1065"> Small shining horns on his curl'd forehead stand,
</l><l n="2:1066"> As turn'd and polish'd by the work-man's hand;
</l><l n="2:1067"> His eye-balls rowl'd, not formidably bright,

</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="2:1071"> Agenor's royal daughter, as she plaid
</l><l n="2:1072"> Among the fields, the milk-white bull survey'd,

</l><l n="2:1074"> And at a distance kept him in her sight.
</l><l n="2:1075"> At length she pluck'd the rising flow'rs, and fed
</l><l n="2:1076"> The gentle beast, and fondly stroak'd his head.
</l><l n="2:1077"> He stood well-pleas'd to touch the charming fair,
</l><l n="2:1078"> But hardly could confine his pleasure there.
</l><l n="2:1079"> And now he wantons o'er the neighb'ring strand,

</l><l n="2:1085"> In flow'ry wreaths the royal virgin drest
</l><l n="2:1086"> His bending horns, and kindly clapt his breast.
</l><l n="2:1087"> 'Till now grown wanton and devoid of fear,
</l><l n="2:1088"> Not knowing that she prest the Thunderer,
</l><l n="2:1089"> She plac'd her self upon his back, and rode

</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="2:1091"> He gently march'd along, and by degrees

</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:9"> When now Agenor had his daughter lost,
</l><l n="3:10"> He sent his son to search on ev'ry coast;
</l><l n="3:11"> And sternly bid him to his arms restore
</l><l n="3:12"> The darling maid, or see his face no more,
</l><l n="3:13"> But live an exile in a foreign clime;
</l><l n="3:14"> Thus was the father pious to a crime.
</l><l n="3:15"> The restless youth search'd all the world around;
</l><l n="3:16"> But how can Jove in his amours be found?
</l><l n="3:17"> When, tir'd at length with unsuccessful toil,
</l><l n="3:18"> To shun his angry sire and native soil,
</l><l n="3:19"> He goes a suppliant to the Delphick dome;
</l><l n="3:20"> There asks the God what new appointed home
</l><l n="3:21"> Should end his wand'rings, and his toils relieve.
</l><l n="3:22"> The Delphick oracles this answer give.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:23"> "Behold among the fields a lonely cow,
</l><l n="3:24"> Unworn with yokes, unbroken to the plow;
</l><l n="3:25"> Mark well the place where first she lays her down,
</l><l n="3:26"> There measure out thy walls, and build thy town,
</l><l n="3:27"> And from thy guide Boeotia call the land,
</l><l n="3:28"> In which the destin'd walls and town shall stand."
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:29"> No sooner had he left the dark abode,
</l><l n="3:30"> Big with the promise of the Delphick God,
</l><l n="3:31"> When in the fields the fatal cow he view'd,
</l><l n="3:32"> Nor gall'd with yokes, nor worn with servitude:
</l><l n="3:33"> Her gently at a distance he pursu'd;
</l><l n="3:34"> And as he walk'd aloof, in silence pray'd
</l><l n="3:35"> To the great Pow'r whose counsels he obey'd.
</l><l n="3:36"> Her way thro' flow'ry Panope she took,
</l><l n="3:37"> And now, Cephisus, cross'd thy silver brook;
</l><l n="3:38"> When to the Heav'ns her spacious front she rais'd,
</l><l n="3:39"> And bellow'd thrice, then backward turning gaz'd
</l><l n="3:40"> On those behind, 'till on the destin'd place
</l><l n="3:41"> She stoop'd, and couch'd amid the rising grass.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:42"> Cadmus salutes the soil, and gladly hails
</l><l n="3:43"> The new-found mountains, and the nameless vales,
</l><l n="3:44"> And thanks the Gods, and turns about his eye
</l><l n="3:45"> To see his new dominions round him lye;
</l><l n="3:46"> Then sends his servants to a neighb'ring grove
</l><l n="3:47"> For living streams, a sacrifice to Jove.
</l><l n="3:48"> O'er the wide plain there rose a shady wood
</l><l n="3:49"> Of aged trees; in its dark bosom stood
</l><l n="3:50"> A bushy thicket, pathless and unworn,
</l><l n="3:51"> O'er-run with brambles, and perplex'd with thorn:
</l><l n="3:52"> Amidst the brake a hollow den was found,
</l><l n="3:53"> With rocks and shelving arches vaulted round.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:54"> Deep in the dreary den, conceal'd from day,
</l><l n="3:55"> Sacred to Mars, a mighty dragon lay,
</l><l n="3:56"> Bloated with poison to a monstrous size;
</l><l n="3:57"> Fire broke in flashes when he glanc'd his eyes:
</l><l n="3:58"> His tow'ring crest was glorious to behold,
</l><l n="3:59"> His shoulders and his sides were scal'd with gold;
</l><l n="3:60"> Three tongues he brandish'd when he charg'd his foes;
</l><l n="3:61"> His teeth stood jaggy in three dreadful rowes.
</l><l n="3:62"> The Tyrians in the den for water sought,
</l><l n="3:63"> And with their urns explor'd the hollow vault:
</l><l n="3:64"> From side to side their empty urns rebound,
</l><l n="3:65"> And rowse the sleeping serpent with the sound.
</l><l n="3:66"> Strait he bestirs him, and is seen to rise;
</l><l n="3:67"> And now with dreadful hissings fills the skies,
</l><l n="3:68"> And darts his forky tongues, and rowles his glaring eyes.
</l><l n="3:69"> The Tyrians drop their vessels in the fright,
</l><l n="3:70"> All pale and trembling at the hideous sight.
</l><l n="3:71"> Spire above spire uprear'd in air he stood,
</l><l n="3:72"> And gazing round him over-look'd the wood:
</l><l n="3:73"> Then floating on the ground in circles rowl'd;
</l><l n="3:74"> Then leap'd upon them in a mighty fold.
</l><l n="3:75"> Of such a bulk, and such a monstrous size
</l><l n="3:76"> The serpent in the polar circle lyes,
</l><l n="3:77"> That stretches over half the northern skies.
</l><l n="3:78"> In vain the Tyrians on their arms rely,
</l><l n="3:79"> In vain attempt to fight, in vain to fly:
</l><l n="3:80"> All their endeavours and their hopes are vain;
</l><l n="3:81"> Some die entangled in the winding train;
</l><l n="3:82"> Some are devour'd, or feel a loathsom death,
</l><l n="3:83"> Swoln up with blasts of pestilential breath.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:84"> And now the scorching sun was mounted high,
</l><l n="3:85"> In all its lustre, to the noon-day sky;
</l><l n="3:86"> When, anxious for his friends, and fill'd with cares,
</l><l n="3:87"> To search the woods th' impatient chief prepares.
</l><l n="3:88"> A lion's hide around his loins he wore,
</l><l n="3:89"> The well poiz'd javelin to the field he bore,
</l><l n="3:90"> Inur'd to blood; the far-destroying dart;
</l><l n="3:91"> And, the best weapon, an undaunted heart.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:92"> Soon as the youth approach'd the fatal place,
</l><l n="3:93"> He saw his servants breathless on the grass;
</l><l n="3:94"> The scaly foe amid their corps he view'd,
</l><l n="3:95"> Basking at ease, and feasting in their blood.
</l><l n="3:96"> "Such friends," he cries, "deserv'd a longer date;
</l><l n="3:97"> But Cadmus will revenge or share their fate."
</l><l n="3:98"> Then heav'd a stone, and rising to the throw,
</l><l n="3:99"> He sent it in a whirlwind at the foe:
</l><l n="3:100"> A tow'r, assaulted by so rude a stroke,
</l><l n="3:101"> With all its lofty battlements had shook;
</l><l n="3:102"> But nothing here th' unwieldy rock avails,
</l><l n="3:103"> Rebounding harmless from the plaited scales,
</l><l n="3:104"> That, firmly join'd, preserv'd him from a wound,
</l><l n="3:105"> With native armour crusted all around.
</l><l n="3:106"> With more success, the dart unerring flew,
</l><l n="3:107"> Which at his back the raging warriour threw;
</l><l n="3:108"> Amid the plaited scales it took its course,
</l><l n="3:109"> And in the spinal marrow spent its force.
</l><l n="3:110"> The monster hiss'd aloud, and rag'd in vain,
</l><l n="3:111"> And writh'd his body to and fro with pain;
</l><l n="3:112"> He bit the dart, and wrench'd the wood away;
</l><l n="3:113"> The point still buried in the marrow lay.
</l><l n="3:114"> And now his rage, increasing with his pain,
</l><l n="3:115"> Reddens his eyes, and beats in ev'ry vein;
</l><l n="3:116"> Churn'd in his teeth the foamy venom rose,
</l><l n="3:117"> Whilst from his mouth a blast of vapours flows,
</l><l n="3:118"> Such as th' infernal Stygian waters cast.
</l><l n="3:119"> The plants around him wither in the blast.
</l><l n="3:120"> Now in a maze of rings he lies enrowl'd,
</l><l n="3:121"> Now all unravel'd, and without a fold;
</l><l n="3:122"> Now, like a torrent, with a mighty force
</l><l n="3:123"> Bears down the forest in his boist'rous course.
</l><l n="3:124"> Cadmus gave back, and on the lion's spoil
</l><l n="3:125"> Sustain'd the shock, then forc'd him to recoil;
</l><l n="3:126"> The pointed jav'lin warded off his rage:
</l><l n="3:127"> Mad with his pains, and furious to engage,
</l><l n="3:128"> The serpent champs the steel, and bites the spear,
</l><l n="3:129"> 'Till blood and venom all the point besmear.
</l><l n="3:130"> But still the hurt he yet receiv'd was slight;
</l><l n="3:131"> For, whilst the champion with redoubled might
</l><l n="3:132"> Strikes home the jav'lin, his retiring foe
</l><l n="3:133"> Shrinks from the wound, and disappoints the blow.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:134"> The dauntless heroe still pursues his stroke,
</l><l n="3:135"> And presses forward, 'till a knotty oak
</l><l n="3:136"> Retards his foe, and stops him in the rear;
</l><l n="3:137"> Full in his throat he plung'd the fatal spear,
</l><l n="3:138"> That in th' extended neck a passage found,
</l><l n="3:139"> And pierc'd the solid timber through the wound.
</l><l n="3:140"> Fix'd to the reeling trunk, with many a stroke
</l><l n="3:141"> Of his huge tail he lash'd the sturdy oak;
</l><l n="3:142"> 'Till spent with toil, and lab'ring hard for breath,
</l><l n="3:143"> He now lay twisting in the pangs of death.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:144"> Cadmus beheld him wallow in a flood
</l><l n="3:145"> Of swimming poison, intermix'd with blood;
</l><l n="3:146"> When suddenly a speech was heard from high
</l><l n="3:147"> (The speech was heard, nor was the speaker nigh),
</l><l n="3:148"> "Why dost thou thus with secret pleasure see,
</l><l n="3:149"> Insulting man! what thou thy self shalt be?"
</l><l n="3:150"> Astonish'd at the voice, he stood amaz'd,
</l><l n="3:151"> And all around with inward horror gaz'd:
</l><l n="3:152"> When Pallas swift descending from the skies,
</l><l n="3:153"> Pallas, the guardian of the bold and wise,
</l><l n="3:154"> Bids him plow up the field, and scatter round
</l><l n="3:155"> The dragon's teeth o'er all the furrow'd ground;
</l><l n="3:156"> Then tells the youth how to his wond'ring eyes
</l><l n="3:157"> Embattled armies from the field should rise.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:158"> He sows the teeth at Pallas's command,
</l><l n="3:159"> And flings the future people from his hand.
</l><l n="3:160"> The clods grow warm, and crumble where he sows;
</l><l n="3:161"> And now the pointed spears advance in rows;
</l><l n="3:162"> Now nodding plumes appear, and shining crests,
</l><l n="3:163"> Now the broad shoulders and the rising breasts;
</l><l n="3:164"> O'er all the field the breathing harvest swarms,
</l><l n="3:165"> A growing host, a crop of men and arms.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:166"> So through the parting stage a figure rears
</l><l n="3:167"> Its body up, and limb by limb appears
</l><l n="3:168"> By just degrees; 'till all the man arise,
</l><l n="3:169"> And in his full proportion strikes the eyes.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:170"> Cadmus surpriz'd, and startled at the sight
</l><l n="3:171"> Of his new foes, prepar'd himself for fight:
</l><l n="3:172"> When one cry'd out, "Forbear, fond man, forbear
</l><l n="3:173"> To mingle in a blind promiscuous war."
</l><l n="3:174"> This said, he struck his brother to the ground,
</l><l n="3:175"> Himself expiring by another's wound;
</l><l n="3:176"> Nor did the third his conquest long survive,
</l><l n="3:177"> Dying ere scarce he had begun to live.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:178"> The dire example ran through all the field,
</l><l n="3:179"> 'Till heaps of brothers were by brothers kill'd;
</l><l n="3:180"> The furrows swam in blood: and only five
</l><l n="3:181"> Of all the vast increase were left alive.
</l><l n="3:182"> Echion one, at Pallas's command,
</l><l n="3:183"> Let fall the guiltless weapon from his hand,
</l><l n="3:184"> And with the rest a peaceful treaty makes,
</l><l n="3:185"> Whom Cadmus as his friends and partners takes;
</l><l n="3:186"> So founds a city on the promis'd earth,
</l><l n="3:187"> And gives his new Boeotian empire birth.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:188"> Here Cadmus reign'd; and now one would have guess'd
</l><l n="3:189"> The royal founder in his exile blest:
</l><l n="3:190"> Long did he live within his new abodes,
</l><l n="3:191"> Ally'd by marriage to the deathless Gods;
</l><l n="3:192"> And, in a fruitful wife's embraces old,
</l><l n="3:193"> A long increase of children's children told:
</l><l n="3:194"> But no frail man, however great or high,
</l><l n="3:195"> Can be concluded blest before he die.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="3:196"> Actaeon was the first of all his race,
</l><l n="3:197"> Who griev'd his grandsire in his borrow'd face;
</l><l n="3:198"> Condemn'd by stern Diana to bemoan
</l><l n="3:199"> The branching horns, and visage not his own;
</l><l n="3:200"> To shun his once lov'd dogs, to bound away,
</l><l n="3:201"> And from their huntsman to become their prey,
</l><l n="3:202"> And yet consider why the change was wrought,
</l><l n="3:203"> You'll find it his misfortune, not his fault;

<l n="3:206"> In a fair chace a shady mountain stood,

</l><l n="3:231"> Here the bright Goddess, toil'd and chaf'd with heat,

</l><l n="3:653"> Can hollow timbrels, can a drunken shout,

</l><l n="3:656"> Of women's yells those stubborn souls disarm,
</l><l n="3:657"> Whom nor the sword nor trumpet e'er could fright,

</l><l n="3:669"> He fought the strong; do you his courage show,

</l><l n="3:671"> If Thebes must fall, oh might the fates afford
</l><l n="3:672"> A nobler doom from famine, fire, or sword.

<l n="4:1"> Yet still Alcithoe perverse remains,
</l><l n="4:2"> And Bacchus still, and all his rites, disdains.
</l><l n="4:3"> Too rash, and madly bold, she bids him prove
</l><l n="4:4"> Himself a God, nor owns the son of Jove.
</l><l n="4:5"> Her sisters too unanimous agree,
</l><l n="4:6"> Faithful associates in impiety.
</l><l n="4:7"> Be this a solemn feast, the priest had said;
</l><l n="4:8"> Be, with each mistress, unemploy'd each maid.
</l><l n="4:9"> With skins of beasts your tender limbs enclose,
</l><l n="4:10"> And with an ivy-crown adorn your brows,
</l><l n="4:11"> The leafy Thyrsus high in triumph bear,
</l><l n="4:12"> And give your locks to wanton in the air.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:13"> These rites profan'd, the holy seer foreshow'd
</l><l n="4:14"> A mourning people, and a vengeful God.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:15"> Matrons and pious wives obedience show,
</l><l n="4:16"> Distaffs, and wooll, half spun, away they throw:
</l><l n="4:17"> Then incense burn, and, Bacchus, thee adore,
</l><l n="4:18"> Or lov'st thou Nyseus, or Lyaeus more?
</l><l n="4:19"> O! doubly got, O! doubly born, they sung,
</l><l n="4:20"> Thou mighty Bromius, hail, from light'ning sprung!
</l><l n="4:21"> Hail, Thyon, Eleleus! each name is thine:
</l><l n="4:22"> Or, listen parent of the genial vine!
</l><l n="4:23"> Iachus! Evan! loudly they repeat,
</l><l n="4:24"> And not one Grecian attribute forget,
</l><l n="4:25"> Which to thy praise, great Deity, belong,
</l><l n="4:26"> Stil'd justly Liber in the Roman song.
</l><l n="4:27"> Eternity of youth is thine! enjoy
</l><l n="4:28"> Years roul'd on years, yet still a blooming boy.
</l><l n="4:29"> In Heav'n thou shin'st with a superior grace;
</l><l n="4:30"> Conceal thy horns, and 'tis a virgin's face.
</l><l n="4:31"> Thou taught'st the tawny Indian to obey,
</l><l n="4:32"> And Ganges, smoothly flowing, own'd thy sway.
</l><l n="4:33"> Lycurgus, Pentheus, equally profane,
</l><l n="4:34"> By thy just vengeance equally were slain.
</l><l n="4:35"> By thee the Tuscans, who conspir'd to keep
</l><l n="4:36"> Thee captive, plung'd, and cut with finns the deep.
</l><l n="4:37"> With painted reins, all-glitt'ring from afar,
</l><l n="4:38"> The spotted lynxes proudly draw thy car.
</l><l n="4:39"> Around, the Bacchae, and the satyrs throng;
</l><l n="4:40"> Behind, Silenus, drunk, lags slow along:
</l><l n="4:41"> On his dull ass he nods from side to side,
</l><l n="4:42"> Forbears to fall, yet half forgets to ride.
</l><l n="4:43"> Still at thy near approach, applauses loud
</l><l n="4:44"> Are heard, with yellings of the female crowd.
</l><l n="4:45"> Timbrels, and boxen pipes, with mingled cries,
</l><l n="4:46"> Swell up in sounds confus'd, and rend the skies.
</l><l n="4:47"> Come, Bacchus, come propitious, all implore,
</l><l n="4:48"> And act thy sacred orgies o'er and o'er.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:49"> But Mineus' daughters, while these rites were pay'd,
</l><l n="4:50"> At home, impertinently busie, stay'd.
</l><l n="4:51"> Their wicked tasks they ply with various art,
</l><l n="4:52"> And thro' the loom the sliding shuttle dart;
</l><l n="4:53"> Or at the fire to comb the wooll they stand,
</l><l n="4:54"> Or twirl the spindle with a dext'rous hand.
</l><l n="4:55"> Guilty themselves, they force the guiltless in;
</l><l n="4:56"> Their maids, who share the labour, share the sin.
</l><l n="4:57"> At last one sister cries, who nimbly knew
</l><l n="4:58"> To draw nice threads, and winde the finest clue,
</l><l n="4:59"> While others idly rove, and Gods revere,
</l><l n="4:60"> Their fancy'd Gods! they know not who, or where;
</l><l n="4:61"> Let us, whom Pallas taught her better arts,
</l><l n="4:62"> Still working, cheer with mirthful chat our hearts,
</l><l n="4:63"> And to deceive the time, let me prevail
</l><l n="4:64"> With each by turns to tell some antique tale.
</l><l n="4:65"> She said: her sisters lik'd the humour well,
</l><l n="4:66"> And smiling, bad her the first story tell.
</l><l n="4:67"> But she a-while profoundly seem'd to muse,
</l><l n="4:68"> Perplex'd amid variety to chuse:
</l><l n="4:69"> And knew not, whether she should first relate
</l><l n="4:70"> The poor Dircetis, and her wond'rous fate.
</l><l n="4:71"> The Palestines believe it to a man,
</l><l n="4:72"> And show the lake, in which her scales began.
</l><l n="4:73"> Or if she rather should the daughter sing,
</l><l n="4:74"> Who in the hoary verge of life took wing;
</l><l n="4:75"> Who soar'd from Earth, and dwelt in tow'rs on high,
</l><l n="4:76"> And now a dove she flits along the sky.
</l><l n="4:77"> Or how lewd Nais, when her lust was cloy'd,
</l><l n="4:78"> To fishes turn'd the youths, she had enjoy'd,
</l><l n="4:79"> By pow'rful verse, and herbs; effect most strange!
</l><l n="4:80"> At last the changer shar'd herself the change.
</l><l n="4:81"> Or how the tree, which once white berries bore,
</l><l n="4:82"> Still crimson bears, since stain'd with crimson gore.
</l><l n="4:83"> The tree was new; she likes it, and begins
</l><l n="4:84"> To tell the tale, and as she tells, she spins.

<l n="4:85"> In Babylon, where first her queen, for state
</l><l n="4:86"> Rais'd walls of brick magnificently great,
</l><l n="4:87"> Liv'd Pyramus, and Thisbe, lovely pair!
</l><l n="4:88"> He found no eastern youth his equal there,
</l><l n="4:89"> And she beyond the fairest nymph was fair.
</l><l n="4:90"> A closer neighbourhood was never known,
</l><l n="4:91"> Tho' two the houses, yet the roof was one.
</l><l n="4:92"> Acquaintance grew, th' acquaintance they improve
</l><l n="4:93"> To friendship, friendship ripen'd into love:
</l><l n="4:94"> Love had been crown'd, but impotently mad,
</l><l n="4:95"> What parents could not hinder, they forbad.
</l><l n="4:96"> For with fierce flames young Pyramus still burn'd,
</l><l n="4:97"> And grateful Thisbe flames as fierce return'd.
</l><l n="4:98"> Aloud in words their thoughts they dare not break,
</l><l n="4:99"> But silent stand; and silent looks can speak.
</l><l n="4:100"> The fire of love the more it is supprest,
</l><l n="4:101"> The more it glows, and rages in the breast.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:102"> When the division-wall was built, a chink
</l><l n="4:103"> Was left, the cement unobserv'd to shrink.
</l><l n="4:104"> So slight the cranny, that it still had been
</l><l n="4:105"> For centuries unclos'd, because unseen.
</l><l n="4:106"> But oh! what thing so small, so secret lies,
</l><l n="4:107"> Which scapes, if form'd for love, a lover's eyes?
</l><l n="4:108"> Ev'n in this narrow chink they quickly found
</l><l n="4:109"> A friendly passage for a trackless sound.
</l><l n="4:110"> Safely they told their sorrows, and their joys,
</l><l n="4:111"> In whisper'd murmurs, and a dying noise,
</l><l n="4:112"> By turns to catch each other's breath they strove,
</l><l n="4:113"> And suck'd in all the balmy breeze of love.
</l><l n="4:114"> Oft as on diff'rent sides they stood, they cry'd,
</l><l n="4:115"> Malicious wall, thus lovers to divide!
</l><l n="4:116"> Suppose, thou should'st a-while to us give place
</l><l n="4:117"> To lock, and fasten in a close embrace:
</l><l n="4:118"> But if too much to grant so sweet a bliss,
</l><l n="4:119"> Indulge at least the pleasure of a kiss.
</l><l n="4:120"> We scorn ingratitude: to thee, we know,
</l><l n="4:121"> This safe conveyance of our minds we owe.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:122"> Thus they their vain petition did renew
</l><l n="4:123"> 'Till night, and then they softly sigh'd adieu.
</l><l n="4:124"> But first they strove to kiss, and that was all;
</l><l n="4:125"> Their kisses dy'd untasted on the wall.
</l><l n="4:126"> Soon as the morn had o'er the stars prevail'd,
</l><l n="4:127"> And warm'd by Phoebus, flow'rs their dews exhal'd,
</l><l n="4:128"> The lovers to their well-known place return,
</l><l n="4:129"> Alike they suffer, and alike they mourn.
</l><l n="4:130"> At last their parents they resolve to cheat
</l><l n="4:131"> (If to deceive in love be call'd deceit),
</l><l n="4:132"> To steal by night from home, and thence unknown
</l><l n="4:133"> To seek the fields, and quit th' unfaithful town.
</l><l n="4:134"> But, to prevent their wand'ring in the dark,
</l><l n="4:135"> They both agree to fix upon a mark;
</l><l n="4:136"> A mark, that could not their designs expose:
</l><l n="4:137"> The tomb of Ninus was the mark they chose.
</l><l n="4:138"> There they might rest secure beneath the shade,
</l><l n="4:139"> Which boughs, with snowy fruit encumber'd, made:
</l><l n="4:140"> A wide-spread mulberry its rise had took
</l><l n="4:141"> Just on the margin of a gurgling brook.
</l><l n="4:142"> Impatient for the friendly dusk they stay;
</l><l n="4:143"> And chide the slowness of departing day;
</l><l n="4:144"> In western seas down sunk at last the light,
</l><l n="4:145"> From western seas up-rose the shades of night.
</l><l n="4:146"> The loving Thisbe ev'n prevents the hour,
</l><l n="4:147"> With cautious silence she unlocks the door,
</l><l n="4:148"> And veils her face, and marching thro' the gloom
</l><l n="4:149"> Swiftly arrives at th' assignation-tomb.
</l><l n="4:150"> For still the fearful sex can fearless prove;
</l><l n="4:151"> Boldly they act, if spirited by love.
</l><l n="4:152"> When lo! a lioness rush'd o'er the plain,
</l><l n="4:153"> Grimly besmear'd with blood of oxen slain:
</l><l n="4:154"> And what to the dire sight new horrors brought,
</l><l n="4:155"> To slake her thirst the neighb'ring spring she sought.
</l><l n="4:156"> Which, by the moon, when trembling Thisbe spies,
</l><l n="4:157"> Wing'd with her fear, swift, as the wind, she flies;
</l><l n="4:158"> And in a cave recovers from her fright,
</l><l n="4:159"> But drop'd her veil, confounded in her flight.
</l><l n="4:160"> When sated with repeated draughts, again
</l><l n="4:161"> The queen of beasts scour'd back along the plain,
</l><l n="4:162"> She found the veil, and mouthing it all o'er,
</l><l n="4:163"> With bloody jaws the lifeless prey she tore.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:164"> The youth, who could not cheat his guards so soon,
</l><l n="4:165"> Late came, and noted by the glimm'ring moon
</l><l n="4:166"> Some savage feet, new printed on the ground,
</l><l n="4:167"> His cheeks turn'd pale, his limbs no vigour found;
</l><l n="4:168"> But when, advancing on, the veil he spied
</l><l n="4:169"> Distain'd with blood, and ghastly torn, he cried,
</l><l n="4:170"> One night shall death to two young lovers give,
</l><l n="4:171"> But she deserv'd unnumber'd years to live!
</l><l n="4:172"> 'Tis I am guilty, I have thee betray'd,
</l><l n="4:173"> Who came not early, as my charming maid.
</l><l n="4:174"> Whatever slew thee, I the cause remain,
</l><l n="4:175"> I nam'd, and fix'd the place where thou wast slain.
</l><l n="4:176"> Ye lions from your neighb'ring dens repair,
</l><l n="4:177"> Pity the wretch, this impious body tear!
</l><l n="4:178"> But cowards thus for death can idly cry;
</l><l n="4:179"> The brave still have it in their pow'r to die.
</l><l n="4:180"> Then to th' appointed tree he hastes away,
</l><l n="4:181"> The veil first gather'd, tho' all rent it lay:
</l><l n="4:182"> The veil all rent yet still it self endears,
</l><l n="4:183"> He kist, and kissing, wash'd it with his tears.
</l><l n="4:184"> Tho' rich (he cry'd) with many a precious stain,
</l><l n="4:185"> Still from my blood a deeper tincture gain.
</l><l n="4:186"> Then in his breast his shining sword he drown'd,
</l><l n="4:187"> And fell supine, extended on the ground.
</l><l n="4:188"> As out again the blade lie dying drew,
</l><l n="4:189"> Out spun the blood, and streaming upwards flew.
</l><l n="4:190"> So if a conduit-pipe e'er burst you saw,
</l><l n="4:191"> Swift spring the gushing waters thro' the flaw:
</l><l n="4:192"> Then spouting in a bow, they rise on high,
</l><l n="4:193"> And a new fountain plays amid the sky.
</l><l n="4:194"> The berries, stain'd with blood, began to show
</l><l n="4:195"> A dark complexion, and forgot their snow;
</l><l n="4:196"> While fatten'd with the flowing gore, the root
</l><l n="4:197"> Was doom'd for ever to a purple fruit.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:198"> Mean-time poor Thisbe fear'd, so long she stay'd,
</l><l n="4:199"> Her lover might suspect a perjur'd maid.
</l><l n="4:200"> Her fright scarce o'er, she strove the youth to find
</l><l n="4:201"> With ardent eyes, which spoke an ardent mind.
</l><l n="4:202"> Already in his arms, she hears him sigh
</l><l n="4:203"> At her destruction, which was once so nigh.
</l><l n="4:204"> The tomb, the tree, but not the fruit she knew,
</l><l n="4:205"> The fruit she doubted for its alter'd hue.
</l><l n="4:206"> Still as she doubts, her eyes a body found
</l><l n="4:207"> Quiv'ring in death, and gasping on the ground.
</l><l n="4:208"> She started back, the red her cheeks forsook,
</l><l n="4:209"> And ev'ry nerve with thrilling horrors shook.
</l><l n="4:210"> So trembles the smooth surface of the seas,
</l><l n="4:211"> If brush'd o'er gently with a rising breeze.
</l><l n="4:212"> But when her view her bleeding love confest,
</l><l n="4:213"> She shriek'd, she tore her hair, she beat her breast.
</l><l n="4:214"> She rais'd the body, and embrac'd it round,
</l><l n="4:215"> And bath'd with tears unfeign'd the gaping wound.
</l><l n="4:216"> Then her warm lips to the cold face apply'd,
</l><l n="4:217"> And is it thus, ah! thus we meet, she cry'd!
</l><l n="4:218"> My Pyramus! whence sprung thy cruel fate?
</l><l n="4:219"> My Pyramus!-ah! speak, ere 'tis too late.
</l><l n="4:220"> I, thy own Thisbe, but one word implore,
</l><l n="4:221"> One word thy Thisbe never ask'd before.
</l><l n="4:222"> At Thisbe's name, awak'd, he open'd wide
</l><l n="4:223"> His dying eyes; with dying eyes he try'd
</l><l n="4:224"> On her to dwell, but clos'd them slow, and dy'd.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:225"> The fatal cause was now at last explor'd,
</l><l n="4:226"> Her veil she knew, and saw his sheathless sword:
</l><l n="4:227"> From thy own hand thy ruin thou hast found,
</l><l n="4:228"> She said, but love first taught that hand to wound,
</l><l n="4:229"> Ev'n I for thee as bold a hand can show,
</l><l n="4:230"> And love, which shall as true direct the blow.
</l><l n="4:231"> I will against the woman's weakness strive,
</l><l n="4:232"> And never thee, lamented youth, survive.
</l><l n="4:233"> The world may say, I caus'd, alas! thy death,
</l><l n="4:234"> But saw thee breathless, and resign'd my breath.
</l><l n="4:235"> Fate, tho' it conquers, shall no triumph gain,
</l><l n="4:236"> Fate, that divides us, still divides in vain.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:237"> Now, both our cruel parents, hear my pray'r;
</l><l n="4:238"> My pray'r to offer for us both I dare;
</l><l n="4:239"> Oh! see our ashes in one urn confin'd,
</l><l n="4:240"> Whom love at first, and fate at last has join'd.
</l><l n="4:241"> The bliss, you envy'd, is not our request;
</l><l n="4:242"> Lovers, when dead, may sure together rest.
</l><l n="4:243"> Thou, tree, where now one lifeless lump is laid,
</l><l n="4:244"> Ere-long o'er two shalt cast a friendly shade.
</l><l n="4:245"> Still let our loves from thee be understood,
</l><l n="4:246"> Still witness in thy purple fruit our blood.
</l><l n="4:247"> She spoke, and in her bosom plung'd the sword,
</l><l n="4:248"> All warm and reeking from its slaughter'd lord.
</l><l n="4:249"> The pray'r, which dying Thisbe had preferr'd,
</l><l n="4:250"> Both Gods, and parents, with compassion heard.
</l><l n="4:251"> The whiteness of the mulberry soon fled,
</l><l n="4:252"> And rip'ning, sadden'd in a dusky red:
</l><l n="4:253"> While both their parents their lost children mourn,
</l><l n="4:254"> And mix their ashes in one golden urn.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:255"> Thus did the melancholy tale conclude,
</l><l n="4:256"> And a short, silent interval ensu'd.
</l><l n="4:257"> The next in birth unloos'd her artful tongue,
</l><l n="4:258"> And drew attentive all the sister-throng.

</l><l n="4:944"> In vain the heroe for one night entreats,
</l><l n="4:945"> Threat'ning he storms, and next adds force to threats.
</l><l n="4:946"> By strength not Perseus could himself defend,
</l><l n="4:947"> For who in strength with Atlas could contend?
</l><l n="4:948"> But since short rest to me thou wilt not give,
</l><l n="4:949"> A gift of endless rest from me receive,
</l><l n="4:950"> He said, and backward turn'd, no more conceal'd
</l><l n="4:951"> The present, and Medusa's head reveal'd.
</l><l n="4:952"> Soon the high Atlas a high mountain stood,
</l><l n="4:953"> His locks, and beard became a leafy wood.
</l><l n="4:954"> His hands, and shoulders, into ridges went,
</l><l n="4:955"> The summit-head still crown'd the steep ascent.
</l><l n="4:956"> His bones a solid, rocky hardness gain'd:
</l><l n="4:957"> He, thus immensely grown (as fate ordain'd),
</l><l n="4:958"> The stars, the Heav'ns, and all the Gods sustain'd.

</l><l n="4:961"> The rising Phospher with a purple light
</l><l n="4:962"> Did sluggish mortals to new toils invite.
</l><l n="4:963"> His feet again the valiant Perseus plumes,
</l><l n="4:964"> And his keen sabre in his hand resumes:
</l><l n="4:965"> Then nobly spurns the ground, and upwards springs,
</l><l n="4:966"> And cuts the liquid air with sounding wings.
</l><l n="4:967"> O'er various seas, and various lands he past,
</l><l n="4:968"> 'Till Aethiopia's shore appear'd at last.
</l><l n="4:969"> Andromeda was there, doom'd to attone
</l><l n="4:970"> By her own ruin follies not her own:
</l><l n="4:971"> And if injustice in a God can be,
</l><l n="4:972"> Such was the Libyan God's unjust decree.
</l><l n="4:973"> Chain'd to a rock she stood; young Perseus stay'd
</l><l n="4:974"> His rapid flight, to view the beauteous maid.
</l><l n="4:975"> So sweet her frame, so exquisitely fine,
</l><l n="4:976"> She seem'd a statue by a hand divine,
</l><l n="4:977"> Had not the wind her waving tresses show'd,
</l><l n="4:978"> And down her cheeks the melting sorrows flow'd.
</l><l n="4:979"> Her faultless form the heroe's bosom fires;
</l><l n="4:980"> The more he looks, the more he still admires.
</l><l n="4:981"> Th' admirer almost had forgot to fly,
</l><l n="4:982"> And swift descended, flutt'ring from on high.
</l><l n="4:983"> O! Virgin, worthy no such chains to prove,
</l><l n="4:984"> But pleasing chains in the soft folds of love;
</l><l n="4:985"> Thy country, and thy name (he said) disclose,
</l><l n="4:986"> And give a true rehearsal of thy woes.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:987"> A quick reply her bashfulness refus'd,
</l><l n="4:988"> To the free converse of a man unus'd.
</l><l n="4:989"> Her rising blushes had concealment found
</l><l n="4:990"> From her spread hands, but that her hands were bound.
</l><l n="4:991"> She acted to her full extent of pow'r,
</l><l n="4:992"> And bath'd her face with a fresh, silent show'r.
</l><l n="4:993"> But by degrees in innocence grown bold,
</l><l n="4:994"> Her name, her country, and her birth she told:
</l><l n="4:995"> And how she suffer'd for her mother's pride,
</l><l n="4:996"> Who with the Nereids once in beauty vy'd.
</l><l n="4:997"> Part yet untold, the seas began to roar,
</l><l n="4:998"> And mounting billows tumbled to the shore.
</l><l n="4:999"> Above the waves a monster rais'd his head,
</l><l n="4:1000"> His body o'er the deep was widely spread:
</l><l n="4:1001"> Onward he flounc'd; aloud the virgin cries;
</l><l n="4:1002"> Each parent to her shrieks in shrieks replies:
</l><l n="4:1003"> But she had deepest cause to rend the skies.
</l><l n="4:1004"> Weeping, to her they cling; no sign appears
</l><l n="4:1005"> Of help, they only lend their helpless tears.
</l><l n="4:1006"> Too long you vent your sorrows, Perseus said,
</l><l n="4:1007"> Short is the hour, and swift the time of aid,
</l><l n="4:1008"> In me the son of thund'ring Jove behold,
</l><l n="4:1009"> Got in a kindly show'r of fruitful gold.
</l><l n="4:1010"> Medusa's snaky head is now my prey,
</l><l n="4:1011"> And thro' the clouds I boldly wing my way.
</l><l n="4:1012"> If such desert be worthy of esteem,
</l><l n="4:1013"> And, if your daughter I from death redeem,
</l><l n="4:1014"> Shall she be mine? Shall it not then be thought,
</l><l n="4:1015"> A bride, so lovely, was too cheaply bought?
</l><l n="4:1016"> For her my arms I willingly employ,
</l><l n="4:1017"> If I may beauties, which I save, enjoy.
</l><l n="4:1018"> The parents eagerly the terms embrace:
</l><l n="4:1019"> For who would slight such terms in such a case?
</l><l n="4:1020"> Nor her alone they promise, but beside,
</l><l n="4:1021"> The dowry of a kingdom with the bride.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:1022"> As well-rigg'd gallies, which slaves, sweating, row,
</l><l n="4:1023"> With their sharp beaks the whiten'd ocean plough;
</l><l n="4:1024"> So when the monster mov'd, still at his back
</l><l n="4:1025"> The furrow'd waters left a foamy track.
</l><l n="4:1026"> Now to the rock he was advanc'd so nigh,
</l><l n="4:1027"> Whirl'd from a sling a stone the space would fly.
</l><l n="4:1028"> Then bounding, upwards the brave Perseus sprung,
</l><l n="4:1029"> And in mid air on hov'ring pinions hung.
</l><l n="4:1030"> His shadow quickly floated on the main;
</l><l n="4:1031"> The monster could not his wild rage restrain,
</l><l n="4:1032"> But at the floating shadow leap'd in vain.
</l><l n="4:1033"> As when Jove's bird, a speckl'd serpent spies,
</l><l n="4:1034"> Which in the shine of Phoebus basking lies,
</l><l n="4:1035"> Unseen, he souses down, and bears away,
</l><l n="4:1036"> Truss'd from behind, the vainly-hissing prey.
</l><l n="4:1037"> To writh his neck the labour nought avails,
</l><l n="4:1038"> Too deep th' imperial talons pierce his scales.
</l><l n="4:1039"> Thus the wing'd heroe now descends, now soars,
</l><l n="4:1040"> And at his pleasure the vast monster gores.
</l><l n="4:1041"> Full in his back, swift stooping from above,
</l><l n="4:1042"> The crooked sabre to its hilt he drove.
</l><l n="4:1043"> The monster rag'd, impatient of the pain,
</l><l n="4:1044"> First bounded high, and then sunk low again.
</l><l n="4:1045"> Now, like a savage boar, when chaf'd with wounds,
</l><l n="4:1046"> And bay'd with opening mouths of hungry hounds,
</l><l n="4:1047"> He on the foe turns with collected might,
</l><l n="4:1048"> Who still eludes him with an airy flight;
</l><l n="4:1049"> And wheeling round, the scaly armour tries
</l><l n="4:1050"> Of his thick sides; his thinner tall now plies:
</l><l n="4:1051"> 'Till from repeated strokes out gush'd a flood,
</l><l n="4:1052"> And the waves redden'd with the streaming blood.
</l><l n="4:1053"> At last the dropping wings, befoam'd all o'er,
</l><l n="4:1054"> With flaggy heaviness their master bore:
</l><l n="4:1055"> A rock he spy'd, whose humble head was low,
</l><l n="4:1056"> Bare at an ebb, but cover'd at a flow.
</l><l n="4:1057"> A ridgy hold, he, thither flying, gain'd,
</l><l n="4:1058"> And with one hand his bending weight sustain'd;
</l><l n="4:1059"> With th' other, vig'rous blows he dealt around,
</l><l n="4:1060"> And the home-thrusts the expiring monster own'd.
</l><l n="4:1061"> In deaf'ning shouts the glad applauses rise,
</l><l n="4:1062"> And peal on peal runs ratling thro' the skies.
</l><l n="4:1063"> The saviour-youth the royal pair confess,
</l><l n="4:1064"> And with heav'd hands their daughter's bridegroom bless.
</l><l n="4:1065"> The beauteous bride moves on, now loos'd from chains,
</l><l n="4:1066"> The cause, and sweet reward of all the heroe's pains,
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:1067"> Mean-time, on shore triumphant Perseus stood,
</l><l n="4:1068"> And purg'd his hands, smear'd with the monster's blood:
</l><l n="4:1069"> Then in the windings of a sandy bed
</l><l n="4:1070"> Compos'd Medusa's execrable head.
</l><l n="4:1071"> But to prevent the roughness, leafs he threw,
</l><l n="4:1072"> And young, green twigs, which soft in waters grew,
</l><l n="4:1073"> There soft, and full of sap; but here, when lay'd,
</l><l n="4:1074"> Touch'd by the head, that softness soon decay'd.
</l><l n="4:1075"> The wonted flexibility quite gone,
</l><l n="4:1076"> The tender scyons harden'd into stone.
</l><l n="4:1077"> Fresh, juicy twigs, surpriz'd, the Nereids brought,
</l><l n="4:1078"> Fresh, juicy twigs the same contagion caught.
</l><l n="4:1079"> The nymphs the petrifying seeds still keep,
</l><l n="4:1080"> And propagate the wonder thro' the deep.
</l><l n="4:1081"> The pliant sprays of coral yet declare
</l><l n="4:1082"> Their stiff'ning Nature, when expos'd to air.
</l><l n="4:1083"> Those sprays, which did, like bending osiers, move,
</l><l n="4:1084"> Snatch'd from their element, obdurate prove,
</l><l n="4:1085"> And shrubs beneath the waves, grow stones above.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:1086"> The great immortals grateful Perseus prais'd,
</l><l n="4:1087"> And to three Pow'rs three turfy altars rais'd.

</l><l n="4:1090"> He hastes for Pallas a white cow to cull,
</l><l n="4:1091"> A calf for Hermes, but for Jove a bull.
</l><l n="4:1092"> Then seiz'd the prize of his victorious fight,
</l><l n="4:1093"> Andromeda, and claim'd the nuptial rite.
</l><l n="4:1094"> Andromeda alone he greatly sought,
</l><l n="4:1095"> The dowry kingdom was not worth his thought.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="4:1096"> Pleas'd Hymen now his golden torch displays;
</l><l n="4:1097"> With rich oblations fragrant altars blaze,

</l><l n="4:1099"> And cloudless pleasure smiles in ev'ry eye.
</l><l n="4:1100"> The melting musick melting thoughts inspires,
</l><l n="4:1101"> And warbling songsters aid the warbling lyres.
</l><l n="4:1102"> The palace opens wide in pompous state,
</l><l n="4:1103"> And by his peers surrounded, Cepheus sate.
</l><l n="4:1104"> A feast was serv'd, fit for a king to give,
</l><l n="4:1105"> And fit for God-like heroes to receive.
</l><l n="4:1106"> The banquet ended, the gay, chearful bowl
</l><l n="4:1107"> Mov'd round, and brighten'd, and enlarg'd each soul.
</l><l n="4:1108"> Then Perseus ask'd, what customs there obtain'd,

<l n="4:1113"> The heroe with his just request complies,

</l><l n="4:1116"> He the two daughters of old Phorcus found.
</l><l n="4:1117"> Fate had one common eye to both assign'd,

</l><l n="4:1119"> But while one strove to lend her sister sight,
</l><l n="4:1120"> He stretch'd his hand, and stole their mutual light,

<lg type="verse">
<l n="5:1"> While Perseus entertain'd with this report
</l><l n="5:2"> His father Cepheus, and the list'ning court,
</l><l n="5:3"> Within the palace walls was heard aloud
</l><l n="5:4"> The roaring noise of some unruly crowd;
</l><l n="5:5"> Not like the songs which chearful friends prepare
</l><l n="5:6"> For nuptial days, but sounds that threaten'd war;
</l><l n="5:7"> And all the pleasures of this happy feast,
</l><l n="5:8"> To tumult turn'd, in wild disorder ceas'd:
</l><l n="5:9"> So, when the sea is calm, we often find
</l><l n="5:10"> A storm rais'd sudden by some furious wind.
</l><l n="5:11"> Chief in the riot Phineus first appear'd,
</l><l n="5:12"> The rash ringleader of this boist'rous herd,
</l><l n="5:13"> And brandishing his brazen-pointed lance,
</l><l n="5:14"> Behold, he said, an injur'd man advance,
</l><l n="5:15"> Stung with resentment for his ravish'd wife,
</l><l n="5:16"> Nor shall thy wings, o Perseus, save thy life;
</l><l n="5:17"> Nor Jove himself; tho' we've been often told
</l><l n="5:18"> Who got thee in the form of tempting gold.
</l><l n="5:19"> His lance was aim'd, when Cepheus ran, and said,
</l><l n="5:20"> Hold, brother, hold; what brutal rage has made
</l><l n="5:21"> Your frantick mind so black a crime conceive?
</l><l n="5:22"> Are these the thanks that you to Perseus give?
</l><l n="5:23"> This the reward that to his worth you pay,
</l><l n="5:24"> Whose timely valour sav'd Andromeda?
</l><l n="5:25"> Nor was it he, if you would reason right,
</l><l n="5:26"> That forc'd her from you, but the jealous spight
</l><l n="5:27"> Of envious Nereids, and Jove's high decree;
</l><l n="5:28"> And that devouring monster of the sea,
</l><l n="5:29"> That ready with his jaws wide gaping stood
</l><l n="5:30"> To eat my child, the fairest of my blood.
</l><l n="5:31"> You lost her then, when she seem'd past relief,
</l><l n="5:32"> And wish'd perhaps her death, to ease your grief
</l><l n="5:33"> With my afflictions: not content to view
</l><l n="5:34"> Andromeda in chains, unhelp'd by you,
</l><l n="5:35"> Her spouse, and uncle; will you grieve that he
</l><l n="5:36"> Expos'd his life the dying maid to free?
</l><l n="5:37"> And shall you claim his merit? Had you thought
</l><l n="5:38"> Her charms so great, you shou'd have bravely sought
</l><l n="5:39"> That blessing on the rocks, where fix'd she lay:
</l><l n="5:40"> But now let Perseus bear his prize away,
</l><l n="5:41"> By service gain'd, by promis'd faith possess'd;
</l><l n="5:42"> To him I owe it, that my age is bless'd
</l><l n="5:43"> Still with a child: Nor think that I prefer
</l><l n="5:44"> Perseus to thee, but to the loss of her.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="5:45"> Phineus on him, and Perseus, roul'd about
</l><l n="5:46"> His eyes in silent rage, and seem'd to doubt
</l><l n="5:47"> Which to destroy; 'till, resolute at length,
</l><l n="5:48"> He threw his spear with the redoubled strength
</l><l n="5:49"> His fury gave him, and at Perseus struck;
</l><l n="5:50"> But missing Perseus, in his seat it stuck.
</l><l n="5:51"> Who, springing nimbly up, return'd the dart,
</l><l n="5:52"> And almost plung'd it in his rival's heart;
</l><l n="5:53"> But he for safety to the altar ran,
</l><l n="5:54"> Unfit protection for so vile a man;
</l><l n="5:55"> Yet was the stroke not vain, as Rhaetus found,
</l><l n="5:56"> Who in his brow receiv'd a mortal wound;
</l><l n="5:57"> Headlong he tumbled, when his skull was broke,
</l><l n="5:58"> From which his friends the fatal weapon took,
</l><l n="5:59"> While he lay trembling, and his gushing blood
</l><l n="5:60"> In crimson streams around the table flow'd.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="5:61"> But this provok'd th' unruly rabble worse,
</l><l n="5:62"> They flung their darts, and some in loud discourse
</l><l n="5:63"> To death young Perseus, and the monarch doom;
</l><l n="5:64"> But Cepheus left before the guilty room,
</l><l n="5:65"> With grief appealing to the Gods above,
</l><l n="5:66"> Who laws of hospitality approve,
</l><l n="5:67"> Who faith protect, and succour injur'd right,
</l><l n="5:68"> That he was guiltless of this barb'rous fight.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="5:69"> Pallas her brother Perseus close attends,
</l><l n="5:70"> And with her ample shield from harm defends,
</l><l n="5:71"> Raising a sprightly courage in his heart:
</l><l n="5:72"> But Indian Athis took the weaker part,
</l><l n="5:73"> Born in the chrystal grottoes of the sea,
</l><l n="5:74"> Limnate's son, a fenny nymph, and she
</l><l n="5:75"> Daughter of Ganges; graceful was his mein,
</l><l n="5:76"> His person lovely, and his age sixteen.
</l><l n="5:77"> His habit made his native beauty more;
</l><l n="5:78"> A purple mantle fring'd with gold he wore;
</l><l n="5:79"> His neck well-turn'd with golden chains was grac'd,
</l><l n="5:80"> His hair with myrrh perfum'd, was nicely dress'd.
</l><l n="5:81"> Tho' with just aim he cou'd the javelin throw,
</l><l n="5:82"> Yet with more skill he drew the bending bow;
</l><l n="5:83"> And now was drawing it with artful hand,
</l><l n="5:84"> When Perseus snatching up a flaming brand,
</l><l n="5:85"> Whirl'd sudden at his face the burning wood,
</l><l n="5:86"> Crush'd his eyes in, and quench'd the fire with blood;
</l><l n="5:87"> Thro' the soft skin the splinter'd bones appear,
</l><l n="5:88"> And spoil'd the face that lately was so fair.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="5:89"> When Lycabas his Athis thus beheld,
</l><l n="5:90"> How was his heart with friendly horror fill'd!
</l><l n="5:91"> A youth so noble, to his soul so dear,

</l><l n="5:97"> Nor think so mean an act a victory.
</l><l n="5:98"> While yet he spoke he flung the whizzing dart,
</l><l n="5:99"> Which pierc'd the plaited robe, but miss'd his heart:
</l><l n="5:100"> Perseus defy'd, upon him fiercely press'd
</l><l n="5:101"> With sword, unsheath'd, and plung'd it in his breast;
</l><l n="5:102"> His eyes o'erwhelm'd with night, he stumbling falls,

</l><l n="5:111"> Prevents their rise, and where they fall, they lye:
</l><l n="5:112"> Full in his ribs Amphimedon he smote,
</l><l n="5:113"> And then stuck fiery Phorbas in the throat.
</l><l n="5:114"> Eurythus lifting up his ax, the blow
</l><l n="5:115"> Was thus prevented by his nimble foe;
</l><l n="5:116"> A golden cup he seizes, high embost,
</l><l n="5:117"> And at his head the massy goblet tost:
</l><l n="5:118"> It hits, and from his forehead bruis'd rebounds,

</l><l n="5:120"> With his slain fellows on the floor he lies,
</l><l n="5:121"> And death for ever shuts his swimming eyes.

</l><l n="6:3"> And thus reflects: While tamely I commend
</l><l n="6:4"> Those who their injur'd deities defend,
</l><l n="6:5"> My own divinity affronted stands,
</l><l n="6:6"> And calls aloud for justice at my hands;
</l><l n="6:7"> Then takes the hint, asham'd to lag behind,
</l><l n="6:8"> And on Arachne' bends her vengeful mind;
</l><l n="6:9"> One at the loom so excellently skill'd,
</l><l n="6:10"> That to the Goddess she refus'd to yield.
</l><l n="6:11"> Low was her birth, and small her native town,
</l><l n="6:12"> She from her art alone obtain'd renown.
</l><l n="6:13"> Idmon, her father, made it his employ,
</l><l n="6:14"> To give the spungy fleece a purple dye:
</l><l n="6:15"> Of vulgar strain her mother, lately dead,
</l><l n="6:16"> With her own rank had been content to wed;
</l><l n="6:17"> Yet she their daughter, tho' her time was spent
</l><l n="6:18"> In a small hamlet, and of mean descent,
</l><l n="6:19"> Thro' the great towns of Lydia gain'd a name,
</l><l n="6:20"> And fill'd the neighb'ring countries with her fame.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:21"> Oft, to admire the niceness of her skill,
</l><l n="6:22"> The Nymphs would quit their fountain, shade, or hill:
</l><l n="6:23"> Thither, from green Tymolus, they repair,
</l><l n="6:24"> And leave the vineyards, their peculiar care;
</l><l n="6:25"> Thither, from fam'd Pactolus' golden stream,
</l><l n="6:26"> Drawn by her art, the curious Naiads came.
</l><l n="6:27"> Nor would the work, when finish'd, please so much,
</l><l n="6:28"> As, while she wrought, to view each graceful touch;
</l><l n="6:29"> Whether the shapeless wool in balls she wound,
</l><l n="6:30"> Or with quick motion turn'd the spindle round,
</l><l n="6:31"> Or with her pencil drew the neat design,
</l><l n="6:32"> Pallas her mistress shone in every line.
</l><l n="6:33"> This the proud maid with scornful air denies,

</l><l n="6:35"> Disowns her heav'nly mistress ev'ry hour,
</l><l n="6:36"> Nor asks her aid, nor deprecates her pow'r.
</l><l n="6:37"> Let us, she cries, but to a tryal come,
</l><l n="6:38"> And, if she conquers, let her fix my doom.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:39"> The Goddess then a beldame's form put on,
</l><l n="6:40"> With silver hairs her hoary temples shone;
</l><l n="6:41"> Prop'd by a staff, she hobbles in her walk,
</l><l n="6:42"> And tott'ring thus begins her old wives' talk.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:43"> Young maid attend, nor stubbornly despise

</l><l n="6:45"> For age, tho' scorn'd, a ripe experience bears,
</l><l n="6:46"> That golden fruit, unknown to blooming years:

</l><l n="6:48"> And mortals your superior genius own;
</l><l n="6:49"> But to the Goddess yield, and humbly meek
</l><l n="6:50"> A pardon for your bold presumption seek;
</l><l n="6:51"> The Goddess will forgive. At this the maid,

</l><l n="6:53"> And, darting vengeance with an angry look,
</l><l n="6:54"> To Pallas in disguise thus fiercely spoke.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:55"> Thou doating thing, whose idle babling tongue
</l><l n="6:56"> But too well shews the plague of living long;
</l><l n="6:57"> Hence, and reprove, with this your sage advice,
</l><l n="6:58"> Your giddy daughter, or your aukward neice;
</l><l n="6:59"> Know, I despise your counsel, and am still
</l><l n="6:60"> A woman, ever wedded to my will;
</l><l n="6:61"> And, if your skilful Goddess better knows,
</l><l n="6:62"> Let her accept the tryal I propose.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:63"> She does, impatient Pallas strait replies,
</l><l n="6:64"> And, cloath'd with heavenly light, sprung from her odd disguise.
</l><l n="6:65"> The Nymphs, and virgins of the plain adore
</l><l n="6:66"> The awful Goddess, and confess her pow'r;
</l><l n="6:67"> The maid alone stood unappall'd; yet show'd
</l><l n="6:68"> A transient blush, that for a moment glow'd,
</l><l n="6:69"> Then disappear'd; as purple streaks adorn
</l><l n="6:70"> The opening beauties of the rosy morn;
</l><l n="6:71"> Till Phoebus rising prevalently bright,

</l><l n="6:73"> Yet she persists, and obstinately great,
</l><l n="6:74"> In hopes of conquest hurries on her fate.
</l><l n="6:75"> The Goddess now the challenge waves no more,
</l><l n="6:76"> Nor, kindly good, advises as before.
</l><l n="6:77"> Strait to their posts appointed both repair,
</l><l n="6:78"> And fix their threaded looms with equal care:
</l><l n="6:79"> Around the solid beam the web is ty'd,
</l><l n="6:80"> While hollow canes the parting warp divide;
</l><l n="6:81"> Thro' which with nimble flight the shuttles play,
</l><l n="6:82"> And for the woof prepare a ready way;
</l><l n="6:83"> The woof and warp unite, press'd by the toothy slay.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:84"> Thus both, their mantles button'd to their breast,
</l><l n="6:85"> Their skilful fingers ply with willing haste,
</l><l n="6:86"> And work with pleasure; while they chear the eye
</l><l n="6:87"> With glowing purple of the Tyrian dye:
</l><l n="6:88"> Or, justly intermixing shades with light,
</l><l n="6:89"> Their colourings insensibly unite.
</l><l n="6:90"> As when a show'r transpierc'd with sunny rays,
</l><l n="6:91"> Its mighty arch along the heav'n displays;
</l><l n="6:92"> From whence a thousand diff'rent colours rise,
</l><l n="6:93"> Whose fine transition cheats the clearest eyes;
</l><l n="6:94"> So like the intermingled shading seems,
</l><l n="6:95"> And only differs in the last extreams.
</l><l n="6:96"> Then threads of gold both artfully dispose,
</l><l n="6:97"> And, as each part in just proportion rose,
</l><l n="6:98"> Some antique fable in their work disclose.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:99"> Pallas in figures wrought the heav'nly Pow'rs,

</l><l n="6:104"> From whom the city shou'd receive its name.
</l><l n="6:105"> Each God by proper features was exprest,

</l><l n="6:107"> His three-fork'd mace the dewy sea-God shook,
</l><l n="6:108"> And, looking sternly, smote the ragged rock;
</l><l n="6:109"> When from the stone leapt forth a spritely steed,

</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:111"> Herself she blazons, with a glitt'ring spear,

</l><l n="6:114"> Struck with her pointed launce, the teeming Earth
</l><l n="6:115"> Seem'd to produce a new surprizing birth;
</l><l n="6:116"> When, from the glebe, the pledge of conquest sprung,
</l><l n="6:117"> A tree pale-green with fairest olives hung.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:118"> And then, to let her giddy rival learn
</l><l n="6:119"> What just rewards such boldness was to earn,
</l><l n="6:120"> Four tryals at each corner had their part,
</l><l n="6:121"> Design'd in miniature, and touch'd with art.
</l><l n="6:122"> Haemus in one, and Rodope of Thrace
</l><l n="6:123"> Transform'd to mountains, fill'd the foremost place;
</l><l n="6:124"> Who claim'd the titles of the Gods above,
</l><l n="6:125"> And vainly us'd the epithets of Jove.
</l><l n="6:126"> Another shew'd, where the Pigmaean dame,
</l><l n="6:127"> Profaning Juno's venerable name,
</l><l n="6:128"> Turn'd to an airy crane, descends from far,
</l><l n="6:129"> And with her Pigmy subjects wages war.
</l><l n="6:130"> In a third part, the rage of Heav'n's great queen,
</l><l n="6:131"> Display'd on proud Antigone, was seen:
</l><l n="6:132"> Who with presumptuous boldness dar'd to vye,
</l><l n="6:133"> For beauty with the empress of the sky.
</l><l n="6:134"> Ah! what avails her ancient princely race,
</l><l n="6:135"> Her sire a king, and Troy her native place:
</l><l n="6:136"> Now, to a noisy stork transform'd, she flies,
</l><l n="6:137"> And with her whiten'd pinions cleaves the skies.
</l><l n="6:138"> And in the last remaining part was drawn
</l><l n="6:139"> Poor Cinyras that seem'd to weep in stone;
</l><l n="6:140"> Clasping the temple steps, he sadly mourn'd
</l><l n="6:141"> His lovely daughters, now to marble turn'd.
</l><l n="6:142"> With her own tree the finish'd piece is crown'd,
</l><l n="6:143"> And wreaths of peaceful olive all the work surround.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:144"> Arachne drew the fam'd intrigues of Jove,
</l><l n="6:145"> Chang'd to a bull to gratify his love;
</l><l n="6:146"> How thro' the briny tide all foaming hoar,
</l><l n="6:147"> Lovely Europa on his back he bore.
</l><l n="6:148"> The sea seem'd waving, and the trembling maid
</l><l n="6:149"> Shrunk up her tender feet, as if afraid;
</l><l n="6:150"> And, looking back on the forsaken strand,
</l><l n="6:151"> To her companions wafts her distant hand.
</l><l n="6:152"> Next she design'd Asteria's fabled rape,
</l><l n="6:153"> When Jove assum'd a soaring eagle's shape:
</l><l n="6:154"> And shew'd how Leda lay supinely press'd,
</l><l n="6:155"> Whilst the soft snowy swan sate hov'ring o'er her breast,
</l><l n="6:156"> How in a satyr's form the God beguil'd,
</l><l n="6:157"> When fair Antiope with twins he fill'd.
</l><l n="6:158"> Then, like Amphytrion, but a real Jove,
</l><l n="6:159"> In fair Alcmena's arms he cool'd his love.
</l><l n="6:160"> In fluid gold to Danae's heart he came,
</l><l n="6:161"> Aegina felt him in a lambent flame.
</l><l n="6:162"> He took Mnemosyne in shepherd's make,
</l><l n="6:163"> And for Deois was a speckled snake.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:164"> She made thee, Neptune, like a wanton steer,
</l><l n="6:165"> Pacing the meads for love of Arne dear;
</l><l n="6:166"> Next like a stream, thy burning flame to slake,
</l><l n="6:167"> And like a ram, for fair Bisaltis' sake.
</l><l n="6:168"> Then Ceres in a steed your vigour try'd,
</l><l n="6:169"> Nor cou'd the mare the yellow Goddess hide.
</l><l n="6:170"> Next, to a fowl transform'd, you won by force
</l><l n="6:171"> The snake-hair'd mother of the winged horse;
</l><l n="6:172"> And, in a dolphin's fishy form, subdu'd
</l><l n="6:173"> Melantho sweet beneath the oozy flood.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:174"> All these the maid with lively features drew,
</l><l n="6:175"> And open'd proper landskips to the view.
</l><l n="6:176"> There Phoebus, roving like a country swain,
</l><l n="6:177"> Attunes his jolly pipe along the plain;
</l><l n="6:178"> For lovely Isse's sake in shepherd's weeds,
</l><l n="6:179"> O'er pastures green his bleating flock he feeds,
</l><l n="6:180"> There Bacchus, imag'd like the clust'ring grape,
</l><l n="6:181"> Melting bedrops Erigone's fair lap;
</l><l n="6:182"> And there old Saturn, stung with youthful heat,
</l><l n="6:183"> Form'd like a stallion, rushes to the feat.
</l><l n="6:184"> Fresh flow'rs, which twists of ivy intertwine,
</l><l n="6:185"> Mingling a running foliage, close the neat design.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:186"> This the bright Goddess passionately mov'd,
</l><l n="6:187"> With envy saw, yet inwardly approv'd.
</l><l n="6:188"> The scene of heav'nly guilt with haste she tore,
</l><l n="6:189"> Nor longer the affront with patience bore;
</l><l n="6:190"> A boxen shuttle in her hand she took,
</l><l n="6:191"> And more than once Arachne's forehead struck.
</l><l n="6:192"> Th' unhappy maid, impatient of the wrong,
</l><l n="6:193"> Down from a beam her injur'd person hung;
</l><l n="6:194"> When Pallas, pitying her wretched state,
</l><l n="6:195"> At once prevented, and pronounc'd her fate:
</l><l n="6:196"> Live; but depend, vile wretch, the Goddess cry'd,
</l><l n="6:197"> Doom'd in suspence for ever to be ty'd;
</l><l n="6:198"> That all your race, to utmost date of time,
</l><l n="6:199"> May feel the vengeance, and detest the crime.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:200"> Then, going off, she sprinkled her with juice,
</l><l n="6:201"> Which leaves of baneful aconite produce.
</l><l n="6:202"> Touch'd with the pois'nous drug, her flowing hair
</l><l n="6:203"> Fell to the ground, and left her temples bare;
</l><l n="6:204"> Her usual features vanish'd from their place,
</l><l n="6:205"> Her body lessen'd all, but most her face.
</l><l n="6:206"> Her slender fingers, hanging on each side
</l><l n="6:207"> With many joynts, the use of legs supply'd:
</l><l n="6:208"> A spider's bag the rest, from which she gives
</l><l n="6:209"> A thread, and still by constant weaving lives.

</l><l n="6:637"> When gentle Procne thus her lord address'd,
</l><l n="6:638"> And spoke the secret wishes of her breast:
</l><l n="6:639"> If I, she said, have ever favour found,
</l><l n="6:640"> Let my petition with success be crown'd:
</l><l n="6:641"> Let me at Athens my dear sister see,
</l><l n="6:642"> Or let her come to Thrace, and visit me.
</l><l n="6:643"> And, lest my father should her absence mourn,
</l><l n="6:644"> Promise that she shall make a quick return.
</l><l n="6:645"> With thanks I'd own the obligation due
</l><l n="6:646"> Only, o Tereus, to the Gods, and you.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:647"> Now, ply'd with oar, and sail at his command,
</l><l n="6:648"> The nimble gallies reach'd th' Athenian land,
</l><l n="6:649"> And anchor'd in the fam'd Piraean bay,
</l><l n="6:650"> While Tereus to the palace takes his way;
</l><l n="6:651"> The king salutes, and ceremonies past,
</l><l n="6:652"> Begins the fatal embassy at last;
</l><l n="6:653"> The occasion of his voyage he declares,
</l><l n="6:654"> And, with his own, his wife's request prefers:
</l><l n="6:655"> Asks leave that, only for a little space,
</l><l n="6:656"> Their lovely sister might embark for Thrace.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:657"> Thus while he spoke, appear'd the royal maid,
</l><l n="6:658"> Bright Philomela, splendidly array'd;
</l><l n="6:659"> But most attractive in her charming face,
</l><l n="6:660"> And comely person, turn'd with ev'ry grace:
</l><l n="6:661"> Like those fair Nymphs, that are describ'd to rove
</l><l n="6:662"> Across the glades, and op'nings of the grove;
</l><l n="6:663"> Only that these are dress'd for silvan sports,
</l><l n="6:664"> And less become the finery of courts.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:665"> Tereus beheld the virgin, and admir'd,
</l><l n="6:666"> And with the coals of burning lust was fir'd:
</l><l n="6:667"> Like crackling stubble, or the summer hay,
</l><l n="6:668"> When forked lightnings o'er the meadows play.
</l><l n="6:669"> Such charms in any breast might kindle love,
</l><l n="6:670"> But him the heats of inbred lewdness move;
</l><l n="6:671"> To which, tho' Thrace is naturally prone,
</l><l n="6:672"> Yet his is still superior, and his own.
</l><l n="6:673"> Strait her attendants he designs to buy,
</l><l n="6:674"> And with large bribes her governess would try:
</l><l n="6:675"> Herself with ample gifts resolves to bend,
</l><l n="6:676"> And his whole kingdom in th' attempt expend:
</l><l n="6:677"> Or, snatch'd away by force of arms, to bear,
</l><l n="6:678"> And justify the rape with open war.
</l><l n="6:679"> The boundless passion boils within his breast,
</l><l n="6:680"> And his projecting soul admits no rest.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:681"> And now, impatient of the least delay,
</l><l n="6:682"> By pleading Procne's cause, he speeds his way:
</l><l n="6:683"> The eloquence of love his tongue inspires,
</l><l n="6:684"> And, in his wife's, he speaks his own desires;
</l><l n="6:685"> Hence all his importunities arise,
</l><l n="6:686"> And tears unmanly trickle from his eyes.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:687"> Ye Gods! what thick involving darkness blinds
</l><l n="6:688"> The stupid faculties of mortal minds!
</l><l n="6:689"> Tereus the credit of good-nature gains
</l><l n="6:690"> From these his crimes; so well the villain feigns.
</l><l n="6:691"> And, unsuspecting of his base designs,
</l><l n="6:692"> In the request fair Philomela joyns;
</l><l n="6:693"> Her snowy arms her aged sire embrace,
</l><l n="6:694"> And clasp his neck with an endearing grace:
</l><l n="6:695"> Only to see her sister she entreats,
</l><l n="6:696"> A seeming blessing, which a curse compleats.
</l><l n="6:697"> Tereus surveys her with a luscious eye,
</l><l n="6:698"> And in his mind forestalls the blissful joy:
</l><l n="6:699"> Her circling arms a scene of lust inspire,
</l><l n="6:700"> And ev'ry kiss foments the raging fire.
</l><l n="6:701"> Fondly he wishes for the father's place,
</l><l n="6:702"> To feel, and to return the warm embrace;
</l><l n="6:703"> Since not the nearest ties of filial blood
</l><l n="6:704"> Would damp his flame, and force him to be good.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:705"> At length, for both their sakes, the king agrees;
</l><l n="6:706"> And Philomela, on her bended knees,
</l><l n="6:707"> Thanks him for what her fancy calls success,
</l><l n="6:708"> When cruel fate intends her nothing less.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:709"> Now Phoebus, hastning to ambrosial rest,
</l><l n="6:710"> His fiery steeds drove sloping down the west:
</l><l n="6:711"> The sculptur'd gold with sparkling wines was fill'd,
</l><l n="6:712"> And, with rich meats, each chearful table smil'd.
</l><l n="6:713"> Plenty, and mirth the royal banquet close,
</l><l n="6:714"> Then all retire to sleep, and sweet repose.
</l><l n="6:715"> But the lewd monarch, tho' withdrawn apart,
</l><l n="6:716"> Still feels love's poison rankling in his heart:
</l><l n="6:717"> Her face divine is stamp'd within his breast,
</l><l n="6:718"> Fancy imagines, and improves the rest:
</l><l n="6:719"> And thus, kept waking by intense desire,
</l><l n="6:720"> He nourishes his own prevailing fire.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:721"> Next day the good old king for Tereus sends,
</l><l n="6:722"> And to his charge the virgin recommends;
</l><l n="6:723"> His hand with tears th' indulgent father press'd,
</l><l n="6:724"> Then spoke, and thus with tenderness address'd.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:725"> Since the kind instances of pious love,
</l><l n="6:726"> Do all pretence of obstacle remove;
</l><l n="6:727"> Since Procne's, and her own, with your request,
</l><l n="6:728"> O'er-rule the fears of a paternal breast;
</l><l n="6:729"> With you, dear son, my daughter I entrust,
</l><l n="6:730"> And by the Gods adjure you to be just;
</l><l n="6:731"> By truth, and ev'ry consanguineal tye,
</l><l n="6:732"> To watch, and guard her with a father's eye.
</l><l n="6:733"> And, since the least delay will tedious prove,
</l><l n="6:734"> In keeping from my sight the child I love,
</l><l n="6:735"> With speed return her, kindly to asswage
</l><l n="6:736"> The tedious troubles of my lingring age.
</l><l n="6:737"> And you, my Philomel, let it suffice,
</l><l n="6:738"> To know your sister's banish'd from my eyes;
</l><l n="6:739"> If any sense of duty sways your mind,
</l><l n="6:740"> Let me from you the shortest absence find.
</l><l n="6:741"> He wept; then kiss'd his child; and while he speaks,
</l><l n="6:742"> The tears fall gently down his aged cheeks.
</l><l n="6:743"> Next, as a pledge of fealty, he demands,
</l><l n="6:744"> And, with a solemn charge, conjoyns their hands;
</l><l n="6:745"> Then to his daughter, and his grandson sends,
</l><l n="6:746"> And by their mouth a blessing recommends;
</l><l n="6:747"> While, in a voice with dire forebodings broke,
</l><l n="6:748"> Sobbing, and faint, the last farewel was spoke.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:749"> Now Philomela, scarce receiv'd on board,
</l><l n="6:750"> And in the royal gilded bark secur'd,
</l><l n="6:751"> Beheld the dashes of the bending oar,

</l><l n="6:753"> When strait (his joy impatient of disguise)
</l><l n="6:754"> We've gain'd our point, the rough Barbarian cries;
</l><l n="6:755"> Now I possess the dear, the blissful hour,
</l><l n="6:756"> And ev'ry wish subjected to my pow'r.
</l><l n="6:757"> Transports of lust his vicious thoughts employ,
</l><l n="6:758"> And he forbears, with pain, th' expected joy.
</l><l n="6:759"> His gloting eyes incessantly survey'd
</l><l n="6:760"> The virgin beauties of the lovely maid:
</l><l n="6:761"> As when the bold rapacious bird of Jove,
</l><l n="6:762"> With crooked talons stooping from above,
</l><l n="6:763"> Has snatcht, and carry'd to his lofty nest
</l><l n="6:764"> A captive hare, with cruel gripes opprest;
</l><l n="6:765"> Secure, with fix'd, and unrelenting eyes,
</l><l n="6:766"> He sits, and views the helpless, trembling prize.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:767"> Their vessels now had made th' intended land,
</l><l n="6:768"> And all with joy descend upon the strand;
</l><l n="6:769"> When the false tyrant seiz'd the princely maid,
</l><l n="6:770"> And to a lodge in distant woods convey'd;
</l><l n="6:771"> Pale, sinking, and distress'd with jealous fears,
</l><l n="6:772"> And asking for her sister all in tears.
</l><l n="6:773"> The letcher, for enjoyment fully bent,
</l><l n="6:774"> No longer now conceal'd his base intent;
</l><l n="6:775"> But with rude haste the bloomy girl deflow'r'd,
</l><l n="6:776"> Tender, defenceless, and with ease o'erpower'd.
</l><l n="6:777"> Her piercing accents to her sire complain,
</l><l n="6:778"> And to her absent sister, but in vain:
</l><l n="6:779"> In vain she importunes, with doleful cries,
</l><l n="6:780"> Each unattentive godhead of the skies.
</l><l n="6:781"> She pants and trembles, like the bleating prey,
</l><l n="6:782"> From some close-hunted wolf just snatch'd away;
</l><l n="6:783"> That still, with fearful horror, looks around,
</l><l n="6:784"> And on its flank regards the bleeding wound.
</l><l n="6:785"> Or, as the tim'rous dove, the danger o'er,
</l><l n="6:786"> Beholds her shining plumes besmear'd with gore,
</l><l n="6:787"> And, tho' deliver'd from the faulcon's claw,
</l><l n="6:788"> Yet shivers, and retains a secret awe.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:789"> But when her mind a calm reflection shar'd,
</l><l n="6:790"> And all her scatter'd spirits were repair'd:
</l><l n="6:791"> Torn, and disorder'd while her tresses hung,
</l><l n="6:792"> Her livid hands, like one that mourn'd, she wrung;
</l><l n="6:793"> Then thus, with grief o'erwhelm'd her languid eyes,
</l><l n="6:794"> Savage, inhumane, cruel wretch! she cries;
</l><l n="6:795"> Whom not a parent's strict commands could move,
</l><l n="6:796"> Tho' charg'd, and utter'd with the tears of love;
</l><l n="6:797"> Nor virgin innocence, nor all that's due
</l><l n="6:798"> To the strong contract of the nuptial vow:
</l><l n="6:799"> Virtue, by this, in wild confusion's laid,
</l><l n="6:800"> And I compell'd to wrong my sister's bed;
</l><l n="6:801"> Whilst you, regardless of your marriage oath,
</l><l n="6:802"> With stains of incest have defil'd us both.
</l><l n="6:803"> Tho' I deserv'd some punishment to find,
</l><l n="6:804"> This was, ye Gods! too cruel, and unkind.
</l><l n="6:805"> Yet, villain, to compleat your horrid guilt,
</l><l n="6:806"> Stab here, and let my tainted blood be spilt.
</l><l n="6:807"> Oh happy! had it come, before I knew
</l><l n="6:808"> The curs'd embrace of vile perfidious you;
</l><l n="6:809"> Then my pale ghost, pure from incestuous love,
</l><l n="6:810"> Had wander'd spotless thro' th' Elysian grove.
</l><l n="6:811"> But, if the Gods above have pow'r to know,
</l><l n="6:812"> And judge those actions that are done below;
</l><l n="6:813"> Unless the dreaded thunders of the sky,
</l><l n="6:814"> Like me, subdu'd, and violated lye;
</l><l n="6:815"> Still my revenge shall take its proper time,
</l><l n="6:816"> And suit the baseness of your hellish crime.
</l><l n="6:817"> My self, abandon'd, and devoid of shame,
</l><l n="6:818"> Thro' the wide world your actions will proclaim;
</l><l n="6:819"> Or tho' I'm prison'd in this lonely den,
</l><l n="6:820"> Obscur'd, and bury'd from the sight of men,
</l><l n="6:821"> My mournful voice the pitying rocks shall move,
</l><l n="6:822"> And my complainings eccho thro' the grove.
</l><l n="6:823"> Hear me, o Heav'n! and, if a God be there,
</l><l n="6:824"> Let him regard me, and accept my pray'r.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:825"> Struck with these words, the tyrant's guilty breast
</l><l n="6:826"> With fear, and anger, was, by turns, possest;
</l><l n="6:827"> Now, with remorse his conscience deeply stung,
</l><l n="6:828"> He drew the faulchion that beside her hung,
</l><l n="6:829"> And first her tender arms behind her bound,
</l><l n="6:830"> Then drag'd her by the hair along the ground.
</l><l n="6:831"> The princess willingly her throat reclin'd,
</l><l n="6:832"> And view'd the steel with a contented mind;
</l><l n="6:833"> But soon her tongue the girding pinchers strain,
</l><l n="6:834"> With anguish, soon she feels the piercing pain:
</l><l n="6:835"> Oh father! father! would fain have spoke,
</l><l n="6:836"> But the sharp torture her intention broke;
</l><l n="6:837"> In vain she tries, for now the blade has cut
</l><l n="6:838"> Her tongue sheer off, close to the trembling root.
</l><l n="6:839"> The mangled part still quiver'd on the ground,
</l><l n="6:840"> Murmuring with a faint imperfect sound:
</l><l n="6:841"> And, as a serpent writhes his wounded train,
</l><l n="6:842"> Uneasy, panting, and possess'd with pain;
</l><l n="6:843"> The piece, while life remain'd, still trembled fast,
</l><l n="6:844"> And to its mistress pointed to the last.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:845"> Yet, after this so damn'd, and black a deed,
</l><l n="6:846"> Fame (which I scarce can credit) has agreed,
</l><l n="6:847"> That on her rifled charms, still void of shame,
</l><l n="6:848"> He frequently indulg'd his lustful flame,
</l><l n="6:849"> At last he ventures to his Procne's sight,
</l><l n="6:850"> Loaded with guilt, and cloy'd with long delight;
</l><l n="6:851"> There, with feign'd grief, and false, dissembled sighs,
</l><l n="6:852"> Begins a formal narrative of lies;
</l><l n="6:853"> Her sister's death he artfully declares,
</l><l n="6:854"> Then weeps, and raises credit from his tears.
</l><l n="6:855"> Her vest, with flow'rs of gold embroider'd o'er,
</l><l n="6:856"> With grief distress'd, the mournful matron tore,
</l><l n="6:857"> And a beseeming suit of gloomy sable wore.
</l><l n="6:858"> With cost, an honorary tomb she rais'd,
</l><l n="6:859"> And thus th' imaginary ghost appeas'd.
</l><l n="6:860"> Deluded queen! the fate of her you love,
</l><l n="6:861"> Nor grief, nor pity, but revenge should move.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:862"> Thro' the twelve signs had pass'd the circling sun,

</l><l n="6:869"> And art makes up, what fortune has deny'd:
</l><l n="6:870"> With skill exact a Phrygian web she strung,
</l><l n="6:871"> Fix'd to a loom that in her chamber hung,
</l><l n="6:872"> Where in-wrought letters, upon white display'd,
</l><l n="6:873"> In purple notes, her wretched case betray'd:
</l><l n="6:874"> The piece, when finish'd, secretly she gave
</l><l n="6:875"> Into the charge of one poor menial slave;
</l><l n="6:876"> And then, with gestures, made him understand,
</l><l n="6:877"> It must be safe convey'd to Procne's hand.
</l><l n="6:878"> The slave, with speed, the queen's apartment sought,
</l><l n="6:879"> And render'd up his charge, unknowing what he brought.
</l><l n="6:880"> But when the cyphers, figur'd in each fold,
</l><l n="6:881"> Her sister's melancholy story told
</l><l n="6:882"> (Strange that she could!) with silence, she survey'd
</l><l n="6:883"> The tragick piece, and without weeping read:
</l><l n="6:884"> In such tumultuous haste her passions sprung,
</l><l n="6:885"> They choak'd her voice, and quite disarm'd her tongue.
</l><l n="6:886"> No room for female tears; the Furies rise,
</l><l n="6:887"> Darting vindictive glances from her eyes;
</l><l n="6:888"> And, stung with rage, she bounds from place to place,
</l><l n="6:889"> While stern revenge sits low'ring in her face.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:890"> Now the triennial celebration came,

</l><l n="6:894"> By night, the tinkling cymbals ring around,
</l><l n="6:895"> While the shrill notes from Rhodope resound;
</l><l n="6:896"> By night, the queen, disguis'd, forsakes the court,
</l><l n="6:897"> To mingle in the festival resort.
</l><l n="6:898"> Leaves of the curling vine her temples shade,
</l><l n="6:899"> And, with a circling wreath, adorn her head:
</l><l n="6:900"> Adown her back the stag's rough spoils appear,
</l><l n="6:901"> Light on her shoulder leans a cornel spear.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:902"> Thus, in the fury of the God conceal'd,

</l><l n="6:907"> And, thro' the bolted doors, an entrance breaks;
</l><l n="6:908"> From thence, her sister snatching by the hand,
</l><l n="6:909"> Mask'd like the ranting Bacchanalian band,
</l><l n="6:910"> Within the limits of the court she drew,
</l><l n="6:911"> Shading, with ivy green, her outward hue.
</l><l n="6:912"> But Philomela, conscious of the place,
</l><l n="6:913"> Felt new reviving pangs of her disgrace;
</l><l n="6:914"> A shiv'ring cold prevail'd in ev'ry part,
</l><l n="6:915"> And the chill'd blood ran trembling to her heart.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:916"> Soon as the queen a fit retirement found,
</l><l n="6:917"> Stript of the garlands that her temples crown'd,
</l><l n="6:918"> She strait unveil'd her blushing sister's face,
</l><l n="6:919"> And fondly clasp'd her with a close embrace:
</l><l n="6:920"> But, in confusion lost, th' unhappy maid,
</l><l n="6:921"> With shame dejected, hung her drooping head,
</l><l n="6:922"> As guilty of a crime that stain'd her sister's bed.
</l><l n="6:923"> That speech, that should her injur'd virtue clear,
</l><l n="6:924"> And make her spotless innocence appear,
</l><l n="6:925"> Is now no more; only her hands, and eyes
</l><l n="6:926"> Appeal, in signals, to the conscious skies.
</l><l n="6:927"> In Procne's breast the rising passions boil,
</l><l n="6:928"> And burst in anger with a mad recoil;

</l><l n="6:935"> O sister! I've prepar'd my stubborn heart,
</l><l n="6:936"> To act some hellish, and unheard-of part;
</l><l n="6:937"> Either the palace to surround with fire,
</l><l n="6:938"> And see the villain in the flames expire;
</l><l n="6:939"> Or, with a knife, dig out his cursed eyes,
</l><l n="6:940"> Or, his false tongue with racking engines seize;

</l><l n="6:942"> And, thro' a thousand wounds, his guilty soul pursue.
</l><l n="6:943"> Tortures enough my passion has design'd,
</l><l n="6:944"> But the variety distracts my mind.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:945"> A-while, thus wav'ring, stood the furious dame,

</l><l n="6:950"> Forming the direful purpose in her head.
</l><l n="6:951"> At this a sullen grief her voice supprest,
</l><l n="6:952"> While silent passions struggle in her breast.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:953"> Now, at her lap arriv'd, the flatt'ring boy

</l><l n="6:955"> About her neck his little arms are thrown,
</l><l n="6:956"> And he accosts her in a pratling tone.
</l><l n="6:957"> Then her tempestuous anger was allay'd,
</l><l n="6:958"> And in its full career her vengeance stay'd;
</l><l n="6:959"> While tender thoughts, in spite of passion, rise,
</l><l n="6:960"> And melting tears disarm her threat'ning eyes.
</l><l n="6:961"> But when she found the mother's easy heart,
</l><l n="6:962"> Too fondly swerving from th' intended part;
</l><l n="6:963"> Her injur'd sister's face again she view'd:
</l><l n="6:964"> And, as by turns surveying both she stood,
</l><l n="6:965"> While this fond boy (she said) can thus express
</l><l n="6:966"> The moving accents of his fond address;
</l><l n="6:967"> Why stands my sister of her tongue bereft,
</l><l n="6:968"> Forlorn, and sad, in speechless silence left?
</l><l n="6:969"> O Procne, see the fortune of your house!
</l><l n="6:970"> Such is your fate, when match'd to such a spouse!
</l><l n="6:971"> Conjugal duty, if observ'd to him,
</l><l n="6:972"> Would change from virtue, and become a crime;
</l><l n="6:973"> For all respect to Tereus must debase
</l><l n="6:974"> The noble blood of great Pandion's race.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:975"> Strait at these words, with big resentment fill'd,
</l><l n="6:976"> Furious her look, she flew, and seiz'd her child;
</l><l n="6:977"> Like a fell tigress of the savage kind,
</l><l n="6:978"> That drags the tender suckling of the hind
</l><l n="6:979"> Thro' India's gloomy groves, where Ganges laves
</l><l n="6:980"> The shady scene, and rouls his streamy waves.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:981"> Now to a close apartment they were come,
</l><l n="6:982"> Far off retir'd within the spacious dome;
</l><l n="6:983"> When Procne, on revengeful mischief bent,
</l><l n="6:984"> Home to his heart a piercing ponyard sent.
</l><l n="6:985"> Itys, with rueful cries, but all too late,
</l><l n="6:986"> Holds out his hands, and deprecates his fate;
</l><l n="6:987"> Still at his mother's neck he fondly aims,
</l><l n="6:988"> And strives to melt her with endearing names;
</l><l n="6:989"> Yet still the cruel mother perseveres,
</l><l n="6:990"> Nor with concern his bitter anguish hears.
</l><l n="6:991"> This might suffice; but Philomela too
</l><l n="6:992"> Across his throat a shining curtlass drew.
</l><l n="6:993"> Then both, with knives, dissect each quiv'ring part,
</l><l n="6:994"> And carve the butcher'd limbs with cruel art;
</l><l n="6:995"> Which, whelm'd in boiling cauldrons o'er the fire,
</l><l n="6:996"> Or turn'd on spits, in steamy smoak aspire:
</l><l n="6:997"> While the long entries, with their slipp'ry floor,
</l><l n="6:998"> Run down in purple streams of clotted gore.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:999"> Ask'd by his wife to this inhuman feast,
</l><l n="6:1000"> Tereus unknowingly is made a guest:
</l><l n="6:1001"> Whilst she her plot the better to disguise,
</l><l n="6:1002"> Styles it some unknown mystick sacrifice;
</l><l n="6:1003"> And such the nature of the hallow'd rite,
</l><l n="6:1004"> The wife her husband only could invite,
</l><l n="6:1005"> The slaves must all withdraw, and be debarr'd the sight.
</l><l n="6:1006"> Tereus, upon a throne of antique state,
</l><l n="6:1007"> Loftily rais'd, before the banquet sate;
</l><l n="6:1008"> And glutton like, luxuriously pleas'd,
</l><l n="6:1009"> With his own flesh his hungry maw appeas'd.
</l><l n="6:1010"> Nay, such a blindness o'er his senses falls,
</l><l n="6:1011"> That he for Itys to the table calls.
</l><l n="6:1012"> When Procne, now impatient to disclose
</l><l n="6:1013"> The joy that from her full revenge arose,
</l><l n="6:1014"> Cries out, in transports of a cruel mind,
</l><l n="6:1015"> Within your self your Itys you may find.
</l><l n="6:1016"> Still, at this puzzling answer, with surprise,
</l><l n="6:1017"> Around the room he sends his curious eyes;
</l><l n="6:1018"> And, as he still inquir'd, and call'd aloud,
</l><l n="6:1019"> Fierce Philomela, all besmear'd with blood,
</l><l n="6:1020"> Her hands with murder stain'd, her spreading hair
</l><l n="6:1021"> Hanging dishevel'd with a ghastly air,
</l><l n="6:1022"> Stept forth, and flung full in the tyrant's face
</l><l n="6:1023"> The head of Itys, goary as it was:
</l><l n="6:1024"> Nor ever so much to use her tongue,
</l><l n="6:1025"> And with a just reproach to vindicate her wrong.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="6:1026"> The Thracian monarch from the table flings,

</l><l n="6:1030"> One while he labours to disgorge his breast,
</l><l n="6:1031"> And free his stomach from the cursed feast;
</l><l n="6:1032"> Then, weeping o'er his lamentable doom,
</l><l n="6:1033"> He styles himself his son's sepulchral tomb.
</l><l n="6:1034"> Now, with drawn sabre, and impetuous speed,
</l><l n="6:1035"> In close pursuit he drives Pandion's breed;
</l><l n="6:1036"> Whose nimble feet spring with so swift a force
</l><l n="6:1037"> Across the fields, they seem to wing their course.
</l><l n="6:1038"> And now, on real wings themselves they raise,
</l><l n="6:1039"> And steer their airy flight by diff'rent ways;
</l><l n="6:1040"> One to the woodland's shady covert hies,
</l><l n="6:1041"> Around the smoaky roof the other flies;
</l><l n="6:1042"> Whose feathers yet the marks of murder stain,
</l><l n="6:1043"> Where stampt upon her breast, the crimson spots remain.
</l><l n="6:1044"> Tereus, through grief, and haste to be reveng'd,
</l><l n="6:1045"> Shares the like fate, and to a bird is chang'd:
</l><l n="6:1046"> Fix'd on his head, the crested plumes appear,
</l><l n="6:1047"> Long is his beak, and sharpen'd like a spear;
</l><l n="6:1048"> Thus arm'd, his looks his inward mind display,
</l><l n="6:1049"> And, to a lapwing turn'd, he fans his way.
</l><l n="6:1050"> Exceeding trouble, for his children's fate,

<head>The Story of Medea and Jason</head><lg type="verse">
<l n="7:1"> The Argonauts now stemm'd the foaming tide,
</l><l n="7:2"> And to Arcadia's shore their course apply'd;
</l><l n="7:3"> Where sightless Phineus spent his age in grief,
</l><l n="7:4"> But Boreas' sons engage in his relief;
</l><l n="7:5"> And those unwelcome guests, the odious race
</l><l n="7:6"> Of Harpyes, from the monarch's table chase.
</l><l n="7:7"> With Jason then they greater toils sustain,
</l><l n="7:8"> And Phasis' slimy banks at last they gain,
</l><l n="7:9"> Here boldly they demand the golden prize
</l><l n="7:10"> Of Scythia's king, who sternly thus replies:
</l><l n="7:11"> That mighty labours they must first o'ercome,
</l><l n="7:12"> Or sail their Argo thence unfreighted home.
</l><l n="7:13"> Meanwhile Medea, seiz'd with fierce desire,
</l><l n="7:14"> By reason strives to quench the raging fire;
</l><l n="7:15"> But strives in vain!-Some God (she said) withstands,
</l><l n="7:16"> And reason's baffl'd council countermands.
</l><l n="7:17"> What unseen Pow'r does this disorder move?
</l><l n="7:18"> 'Tis love,-at least 'tis like, what men call love.
</l><l n="7:19"> Else wherefore shou'd the king's commands appear
</l><l n="7:20"> To me too hard?-But so indeed they are.
</l><l n="7:21"> Why shou'd I for a stranger fear, lest he
</l><l n="7:22"> Shou'd perish, whom I did but lately see?
</l><l n="7:23"> His death, or safety, what are they to me?
</l><l n="7:24"> Wretch, from thy virgin-breast this flame expel,
</l><l n="7:25"> And soon-Oh cou'd I, all wou'd then be well!
</l><l n="7:26"> But love, resistless love, my soul invades;
</l><l n="7:27"> Discretion this, affection that perswades.
</l><l n="7:28"> I see the right, and I approve it too,
</l><l n="7:29"> Condemn the wrong-and yet the wrong pursue.
</l><l n="7:30"> Why, royal maid, shou'dst thou desire to wed
</l><l n="7:31"> A wanderer, and court a foreign bed?
</l><l n="7:32"> Thy native land, tho' barb'rous, can present
</l><l n="7:33"> A bridegroom worth a royal bride's content:
</l><l n="7:34"> And whether this advent'rer lives, or dies,
</l><l n="7:35"> In Fate, and Fortune's fickle pleasure lies.
</l><l n="7:36"> Yet may be live! for to the Pow'rs above,
</l><l n="7:37"> A virgin, led by no impulse of love,
</l><l n="7:38"> So just a suit may, for the guiltless, move.
</l><l n="7:39"> Whom wou'd not Jason's valour, youth and blood
</l><l n="7:40"> Invite? or cou'd these merits be withstood,
</l><l n="7:41"> At least his charming person must encline
</l><l n="7:42"> The hardest heart-I'm sure 'tis so with mine!
</l><l n="7:43"> Yet, if I help him not, the flaming breath
</l><l n="7:44"> Of bulls, and earth-born foes, must be his death.
</l><l n="7:45"> Or, should he through these dangers force his way,
</l><l n="7:46"> At last he must be made the dragon's prey.
</l><l n="7:47"> If no remorse for such distress I feel,
</l><l n="7:48"> I am a tigress, and my breast is steel.
</l><l n="7:49"> Why do I scruple then to see him slain,
</l><l n="7:50"> And with the tragick scene my eyes prophane?
</l><l n="7:51"> My magick's art employ, not to asswage
</l><l n="7:52"> The Salvages, but to enflame their rage?
</l><l n="7:53"> His earth-born foes to fiercer fury move,
</l><l n="7:54"> And accessary to his murder prove?
</l><l n="7:55"> The Gods forbid-But pray'rs are idle breath,
</l><l n="7:56"> When action only can prevent his death.
</l><l n="7:57"> Shall I betray my father, and the state,
</l><l n="7:58"> To intercept a rambling hero's fate;
</l><l n="7:59"> Who may sail off next hour, and sav'd from harms
</l><l n="7:60"> By my assistance, bless another's arms?
</l><l n="7:61"> Whilst I, not only of my hopes bereft,
</l><l n="7:62"> But to unpity'd punishment am left.
</l><l n="7:63"> If he is false, let the ingrateful bleed!
</l><l n="7:64"> But no such symptom in his looks I read.
</l><l n="7:65"> Nature wou'd ne'er have lavish'd so much grace
</l><l n="7:66"> Upon his person, if his soul were base.
</l><l n="7:67"> Besides, he first shall plight his faith, and swear
</l><l n="7:68"> By all the Gods; what therefore can'st thou fear?
</l><l n="7:69"> Medea haste, from danger set him free,
</l><l n="7:70"> Jason shall thy eternal debtor be.
</l><l n="7:71"> And thou, his queen, with sov'raign state enstall'd,
</l><l n="7:72"> By Graecian dames the Kind Preserver call'd.
</l><l n="7:73"> Hence idle dreams, by love-sick fancy bred!
</l><l n="7:74"> Wilt thou, Medea, by vain wishes led,
</l><l n="7:75"> To sister, brother, father bid adieu?
</l><l n="7:76"> Forsake thy country's Gods, and country too?
</l><l n="7:77"> My father's harsh, my brother but a child,
</l><l n="7:78"> My sister rivals me, my country's wild;
</l><l n="7:79"> And for its Gods, the greatest of 'em all
</l><l n="7:80"> Inspires my breast, and I obey his call.
</l><l n="7:81"> That great endearments I forsake, is true,
</l><l n="7:82"> But greater far the hopes that I pursue:
</l><l n="7:83"> The pride of having sav'd the youths of Greece
</l><l n="7:84"> (Each life more precious than our golden fleece);
</l><l n="7:85"> A nobler soil by me shall be possest,
</l><l n="7:86"> I shall see towns with arts and manners blest;
</l><l n="7:87"> And, what I prize above the world beside,
</l><l n="7:88"> Enjoy my Jason-and when once his bride,
</l><l n="7:89"> Be more than mortal, and to Gods ally'd.
</l><l n="7:90"> They talk of hazards I must first sustain,
</l><l n="7:91"> Of floating islands justling in the main;
</l><l n="7:92"> Our tender barque expos'd to dreadful shocks
</l><l n="7:93"> Of fierce Charybdis' gulf, and Scylla's rocks,
</l><l n="7:94"> Where breaking waves in whirling eddies rowl,
</l><l n="7:95"> And rav'nous dogs that in deep caverns howl:
</l><l n="7:96"> Amidst these terrors, while I lye possest
</l><l n="7:97"> Of him I love, and lean on Jason's breast,
</l><l n="7:98"> In tempests unconcern'd I will appear,
</l><l n="7:99"> Or, only for my husband's safety fear.
</l><l n="7:100"> Didst thou say husband?-canst thou so deceive
</l><l n="7:101"> Thy self, fond maid, and thy own cheat believe?
</l><l n="7:102"> In vain thou striv'st to varnish o'er thy shame,
</l><l n="7:103"> And grace thy guilt with wedlock's sacred name.
</l><l n="7:104"> Pull off the coz'ning masque, and oh! in time
</l><l n="7:105"> Discover and avoid the fatal crime.
</l><l n="7:106"> She ceas'd-the Graces now, with kind surprize,
</l><l n="7:107"> And virtue's lovely train, before her eyes
</l><l n="7:108"> Present themselves, and vanquish'd Cupid flies.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="7:109"> She then retires to Hecate's shrine, that stood
</l><l n="7:110"> Far in the covert of a shady wood:
</l><l n="7:111"> She finds the fury of her flames asswag'd,
</l><l n="7:112"> But, seeing Jason there, again they rag'd.
</l><l n="7:113"> Blushes, and paleness did by turns invade
</l><l n="7:114"> Her tender cheeks, and secret grief betray'd.
</l><l n="7:115"> As fire, that sleeping under ashes lyes,
</l><l n="7:116"> Fresh-blown, and rous'd, does up in blazes rise,
</l><l n="7:118"> New kindled by her lover's sparkling eyes.
</l><l n="7:119"> For chance, that day, had with uncommon grace
</l><l n="7:120"> Adorn'd the lovely youth, and through his face
</l><l n="7:121"> Display'd an air so pleasing as might charm
</l><l n="7:122"> A Goddess, and a Vestal's bosom warm.
</l><l n="7:123"> Her ravish'd eyes survey him o'er and o'er,
</l><l n="7:124"> As some gay wonder never seen before;
</l><l n="7:125"> Transported to the skies she seems to be,
</l><l n="7:126"> And thinks she gazes on a deity.
</l><l n="7:127"> But when he spoke, and prest her trembling hand,
</l><l n="7:128"> And did with tender words her aid demand,
</l><l n="7:129"> With vows, and oaths to make her soon his bride,
</l><l n="7:130"> She wept a flood of tears, and thus reply'd:
</l><l n="7:131"> I see my error, yet to ruin move,
</l><l n="7:132"> Nor owe my fate to ignorance, but love:
</l><l n="7:133"> Your life I'll guard, and only crave of you
</l><l n="7:134"> To swear once more-and to your oath be true.
</l><l n="7:135"> He swears by Hecate he would all fulfil,
</l><l n="7:136"> And by her grandfather's prophetick skill,
</l><l n="7:137"> By ev'ry thing that doubting love cou'd press,
</l><l n="7:138"> His present danger, and desir'd success.

</l><l n="7:1093"> That minute where he was, we cou'd not find,
</l><l n="7:1094"> And only saw the dust he left behind.
</l><l n="7:1095"> I climb'd a neighb'ring hill to view the chase,
</l><l n="7:1096"> While in the plain they held an equal race;
</l><l n="7:1097"> The savage now seems caught, and now by force
</l><l n="7:1098"> To quit himself, nor holds the same strait course;
</l><l n="7:1099"> But running counter, from the foe withdraws,
</l><l n="7:1100"> And with short turning cheats his gaping jaws:
</l><l n="7:1101"> Which he retrieves, and still so closely prest,
</l><l n="7:1102"> You'd fear at ev'ry stretch he were possess'd;
</l><l n="7:1103"> Yet for the gripe his fangs in vain prepare;
</l><l n="7:1104"> The game shoots from him, and he chops the air.
</l><l n="7:1105"> To cast my jav'lin then I took my stand;
</l><l n="7:1106"> But as the thongs were fitting to my hand,
</l><l n="7:1107"> While to the valley I o'er-look'd the wood,
</l><l n="7:1108"> Before my eyes two marble statues stood;
</l><l n="7:1109"> That, as pursu'd appearing at full stretch,
</l><l n="7:1110"> This barking after, and at point to catch:
</l><l n="7:1111"> Some God their course did with this wonder grace,
</l><l n="7:1112"> That neither might be conquer'd in the chase.
</l><l n="7:1113"> A sudden silence here his tongue supprest,
</l><l n="7:1114"> He here stops short, and fain wou'd wave the rest.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="7:1115"> The eager prince then urg'd him to impart,
</l><l n="7:1116"> The Fortune that attended on the dart.
</l><l n="7:1117"> First then (said he) past joys let me relate,
</l><l n="7:1118"> For bliss was the foundation of my fate.
</l><l n="7:1119"> No language can those happy hours express,
</l><l n="7:1120"> Did from our nuptials me, and Procris bless:
</l><l n="7:1121"> The kindest pair! What more cou'd Heav'n confer?
</l><l n="7:1122"> For she was all to me, and I to her.
</l><l n="7:1123"> Had Jove made love, great Jove had been despis'd;
</l><l n="7:1124"> And I my Procris more than Venus priz'd:
</l><l n="7:1125"> Thus while no other joy we did aspire,
</l><l n="7:1126"> We grew at last one soul, and one desire.
</l><l n="7:1127"> Forth to the woods I went at break of day
</l><l n="7:1128"> (The constant practice of my youth) for prey:
</l><l n="7:1129"> Nor yet for servant, horse, or dog did call,
</l><l n="7:1130"> I found this single dart to serve for all.
</l><l n="7:1131"> With slaughter tir'd, I sought the cooler shade,
</l><l n="7:1132"> And winds that from the mountains pierc'd the glade:
</l><l n="7:1133"> Come, gentle air (so was I wont to say)
</l><l n="7:1134"> Come, gentle air, sweet Aura come away.
</l><l n="7:1135"> This always was the burden of my song,
</l><l n="7:1136"> Come 'swage my flames, sweet Aura come along.
</l><l n="7:1137"> Thou always art most welcome to my breast;
</l><l n="7:1138"> I faint; approach, thou dearest, kindest guest!
</l><l n="7:1139"> These blandishments, and more than these, I said
</l><l n="7:1140"> (By Fate to unsuspected ruin led),
</l><l n="7:1141"> Thou art my joy, for thy dear sake I love
</l><l n="7:1142"> Each desart hill, and solitary grove;
</l><l n="7:1143"> When (faint with labour) I refreshment need,
</l><l n="7:1144"> For cordials on thy fragrant breath I feed.
</l><l n="7:1145"> At last a wand'ring swain in hearing came,
</l><l n="7:1146"> And cheated with the sound of Aura's name,
</l><l n="7:1147"> He thought I some assignation made;
</l><l n="7:1148"> And to my Procris' ear the news convey'd.
</l><l n="7:1149"> Great love is soonest with suspicion fir'd:
</l><l n="7:1150"> She swoon'd, and with the tale almost expir'd.
</l><l n="7:1151"> Ah! wretched heart! (she cry'd) ah! faithless man.
</l><l n="7:1152"> And then to curse th' imagin'd nymph began:
</l><l n="7:1153"> Yet oft she doubts, oft hopes she is deceiv'd,
</l><l n="7:1154"> And chides herself, that ever she believ'd
</l><l n="7:1155"> Her lord to such injustice cou'd proceed,
</l><l n="7:1156"> 'Till she her self were witness of the deed.
</l><l n="7:1157"> Next morn I to the woods again repair,
</l><l n="7:1158"> And, weary with the chase, invoke the air:
</l><l n="7:1159"> Approach, dear Aura, and my bosom chear:
</l><l n="7:1160"> At which a mournful sound did strike my ear;
</l><l n="7:1161"> Yet I proceeded, 'till the thicket by,
</l><l n="7:1162"> With rustling noise and motion, drew my eye:
</l><l n="7:1163"> I thought some beast of prey was shelter'd there,
</l><l n="7:1164"> And to the covert threw my certain spear;
</l><l n="7:1165"> From whence a tender sigh my soul did wound,
</l><l n="7:1166"> Ah me! it cry'd, and did like Procris sound.
</l><l n="7:1167"> Procris was there, too well the voice I knew,
</l><l n="7:1168"> And to the place with headlong horror flew;
</l><l n="7:1169"> Where I beheld her gasping on the ground,
</l><l n="7:1170"> In vain attempting from the deadly wound
</l><l n="7:1171"> To draw the dart, her love's dear fatal gift!
</l><l n="7:1172"> My guilty arms had scarce the strength to lift
</l><l n="7:1173"> The beauteous load; my silks, and hair I tore
</l><l n="7:1174"> (If possible) to stanch the pressing gore;
</l><l n="7:1175"> For pity beg'd her keep her flitting breath,
</l><l n="7:1176"> And not to leave me guilty of her death.
</l><l n="7:1177"> While I intreat she fainted fast away,
</l><l n="7:1178"> And these few words had only strength to say:
</l><l n="7:1179"> By all the sacred bonds of plighted love,
</l><l n="7:1180"> By all your rev'rence to the Pow'rs above,
</l><l n="7:1181"> By all the truth for which you held me dear,
</l><l n="7:1182"> And last by love, the cause through which I bleed,
</l><l n="7:1183"> Let Aura never to my bed succeed.
</l><l n="7:1184"> I then perceiv'd the error of our fate,
</l><l n="7:1185"> And told it her, but found and told too late!
</l><l n="7:1186"> I felt her lower to my bosom fall,
</l><l n="7:1187"> And while her eyes had any sight at all,
</l><l n="7:1188"> On mine she fix'd them; in her pangs still prest
</l><l n="7:1189"> My hand, and sigh'd her soul into my breast;
</l><l n="7:1190"> Yet, being undeceiv'd, resign'd her breath
</l><l n="7:1191"> Methought more chearfully, and smil'd in death.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="7:1192"> With such concern the weeping heroe told
</l><l n="7:1193"> This tale, that none who heard him cou'd with-hold

<head>The Story of Nisus and Scylla</head><lg type="verse">
<l n="8:1"> Now shone the morning star in bright array,
</l><l n="8:2"> To vanquish night, and usher in the day:
</l><l n="8:3"> The wind veers southward, and moist clouds arise,
</l><l n="8:4"> That blot with shades the blue meridian skies.
</l><l n="8:5"> Cephalus feels with joy the kindly gales,
</l><l n="8:6"> His new allies unfurl the swelling sails;
</l><l n="8:7"> Steady their course, they cleave the yielding main,
</l><l n="8:8"> And, with a wish, th' intended harbour gain.
</l><l n="8:9"> Mean-while King Minos, on the Attick strand,
</l><l n="8:10"> Displays his martial skill, and wastes the land.
</l><l n="8:11"> His army lies encampt upon the plains,
</l><l n="8:12"> Before Alcathoe's walls, where Nisus reigns;
</l><l n="8:13"> On whose grey head a lock of purple hue,
</l><l n="8:14"> The strength, and fortune of his kingdom, grew.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="8:15"> Six moons were gone, and past, when still from far
</l><l n="8:16"> Victoria hover'd o'er the doubtful war.
</l><l n="8:17"> So long, to both inclin'd, th' impartial maid
</l><l n="8:18"> Between 'em both her equal wings display'd.
</l><l n="8:19"> High on the walls, by Phoebus vocal made,
</l><l n="8:20"> A turret of the palace rais'd its head;
</l><l n="8:21"> And where the God his tuneful harp resign'd.
</l><l n="8:22"> The sound within the stones still lay enshrin'd:
</l><l n="8:23"> Hither the daughter of the purple king
</l><l n="8:24"> Ascended oft, to hear its musick ring;
</l><l n="8:25"> And, striking with a pebble, wou'd release
</l><l n="8:26"> Th' enchanted notes, in times of happy peace.
</l><l n="8:27"> But now, from thence, the curious maid beheld
</l><l n="8:28"> Rough feats of arms, and combats of the field:
</l><l n="8:29"> And, since the siege was long, had learnt the name
</l><l n="8:30"> Of ev'ry chief, his character, and fame;
</l><l n="8:31"> Their arms, their horse, and quiver she descry'd,
</l><l n="8:32"> Nor cou'd the dress of war the warriour hide.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="8:33"> Europa's son she knew above the rest,
</l><l n="8:34"> And more, than well became a virgin breast:
</l><l n="8:35"> In vain the crested morion veils his face,
</l><l n="8:36"> She thinks it adds a more peculiar grace:
</l><l n="8:37"> His ample shield, embost with burnish'd gold,
</l><l n="8:38"> Still makes the bearer lovelier to behold:
</l><l n="8:39"> When the tough jav'lin, with a whirl, he sends,
</l><l n="8:40"> His strength and skill the sighing maid commends;
</l><l n="8:41"> Or, when he strains to draw the circling bow,
</l><l n="8:42"> And his fine limbs a manly posture show,
</l><l n="8:43"> Compar'd with Phoebus, he performs so well,
</l><l n="8:44"> Let her be judge, and Minos shall excell.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="8:45"> But when the helm put off, display'd to sight,
</l><l n="8:46"> And set his features in an open light;
</l><l n="8:47"> When, vaulting to his seat, his steed he prest,
</l><l n="8:48"> Caparison'd in gold, and richly drest;
</l><l n="8:49"> Himself in scarlet sumptuously array'd,
</l><l n="8:50"> New passions rise, and fire the frantick maid.
</l><l n="8:51"> O happy spear! she cries, that feels his touch;
</l><l n="8:52"> Nay, ev'n the reins he holds are blest too much.
</l><l n="8:53"> Oh! were it lawful, she cou'd wing her way
</l><l n="8:54"> Thro' the stern hostile troops without dismay;
</l><l n="8:55"> Or throw her body to the distant ground,
</l><l n="8:56"> And in the Cretans happy camp be found.
</l><l n="8:57"> Wou'd Minos but desire it! she'd expose
</l><l n="8:58"> Her native country to her country's foes;
</l><l n="8:59"> Unbar the gates, the town with flames infest,
</l><l n="8:60"> Or any thing that Minos shou'd request.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="8:61"> And as she sate, and pleas'd her longing sight,
</l><l n="8:62"> Viewing the king's pavilion veil'd with white,
</l><l n="8:63"> Shou'd joy, or grief, she said, possess my breast,
</l><l n="8:64"> To see my country by a war opprest?
</l><l n="8:65"> I'm in suspense! For, tho' 'tis grief to know
</l><l n="8:66"> I love a man that is declar'd my foe;
</l><l n="8:67"> Yet, in my own despite, I must approve
</l><l n="8:68"> That lucky war, which brought the man I love.
</l><l n="8:69"> Yet, were I tender'd as a pledge of peace,
</l><l n="8:70"> The cruelties of war might quickly cease.
</l><l n="8:71"> Oh! with what joy I'd wear the chains he gave!
</l><l n="8:72"> A patient hostage, and a willing slave.
</l><l n="8:73"> Thou lovely object! if the nymph that bare
</l><l n="8:74"> Thy charming person, were but half so fair;
</l><l n="8:75"> Well might a God her virgin bloom desire,
</l><l n="8:76"> And with a rape indulge his amorous fire.
</l><l n="8:77"> Oh! had I wings to glide along the air,
</l><l n="8:78"> To his dear tent I'd fly, and settle there:
</l><l n="8:79"> There tell my quality, confess my flame,
</l><l n="8:80"> And grant him any dowry that he'd name.
</l><l n="8:81"> All, all I'd give; only my native land,
</l><l n="8:82"> My dearest country, shou'd excepted stand,
</l><l n="8:83"> For, perish love, and all expected joys,
</l><l n="8:84"> E're, with so base a thought, my soul complies.
</l><l n="8:85"> Yet, oft the vanquish'd some advantage find,
</l><l n="8:86"> When conquer'd by a noble, gen'rous mind.
</l><l n="8:87"> Brave Minos justly has the war begun,
</l><l n="8:88"> Fir'd with resentment for his murder'd son:
</l><l n="8:89"> The righteous Gods a righteous cause regard,
</l><l n="8:90"> And will, with victory, his arms reward:
</l><l n="8:91"> We must be conquer'd; and the captive's fate
</l><l n="8:92"> Will surely seize us, tho' it seize us late.
</l><l n="8:93"> Why then shou'd love be idle, and neglect
</l><l n="8:94"> What Mars, by arms and perils, will effect?
</l><l n="8:95"> Oh! Prince, I dye, with anxious fear opprest,
</l><l n="8:96"> Lest some rash hand shou'd wound my charmer's breast:
</l><l n="8:97"> For, if they saw, no barb'rous mind cou'd dare
</l><l n="8:98"> Against that lovely form to raise a spear.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="8:99"> But I'm resolv'd, and fix'd in this decree,
</l><l n="8:100"> My father's country shall my dowry be.
</l><l n="8:101"> Thus I prevent the loss of life and blood,
</l><l n="8:102"> And, in effect, the action must be good.
</l><l n="8:103"> Vain resolution! for, at ev'ry gate
</l><l n="8:104"> The trusty centinels, successive, wait:
</l><l n="8:105"> The keys my father keeps; ah! there's my grief;
</l><l n="8:106"> 'Tis he obstructs all hopes of my relief.
</l><l n="8:107"> Gods! that this hated light I'd never seen!
</l><l n="8:108"> Or, all my life, without a father been!
</l><l n="8:109"> But Gods we all may be; for those that dare,
</l><l n="8:110"> Are Gods, and Fortune's chiefest favours share.
</l><l n="8:111"> The ruling Pow'rs a lazy pray'r detest,
</l><l n="8:112"> The bold adventurer succeeds the best.
</l><l n="8:113"> What other maid, inspir'd with such a flame,
</l><l n="8:114"> But wou'd take courage, and abandon shame?
</l><l n="8:115"> But wou'd, tho' ruin shou'd ensue, remove
</l><l n="8:116"> Whate'er oppos'd, and clear the way to love?
</l><l n="8:117"> This, shall another's feeble passion dare?
</l><l n="8:118"> While I sit tame, and languish in despair:
</l><l n="8:119"> No; for tho' fire and sword before me lay,
</l><l n="8:120"> Impatient love thro' both shou'd force its way.
</l><l n="8:121"> Yet I have no such enemies to fear,
</l><l n="8:122"> My sole obstruction is my father's hair;
</l><l n="8:123"> His purple lock my sanguine hope destroys,
</l><l n="8:124"> And clouds the prospect of my rising joys.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="8:125"> Whilst thus she spoke, amid the thick'ning air
</l><l n="8:126"> Night supervenes, the greatest nurse of care:
</l><l n="8:127"> And, as the Goddess spreads her sable wings,
</l><l n="8:128"> The virgin's fears decay, and courage springs.
</l><l n="8:129"> The hour was come, when Man's o'er-labour'd breast
</l><l n="8:130"> Surceas'd its care, by downy sleep possest:
</l><l n="8:131"> All things now hush'd, Scylla with silent tread
</l><l n="8:132"> Urg'd her approach to Nisus' royal bed:
</l><l n="8:133"> There, of the fatal lock (accursed theft!)
</l><l n="8:134"> She her unwitting father's head bereft.
</l><l n="8:135"> In safe possession of her impious prey,
</l><l n="8:136"> Out at a postern gate she takes her way.
</l><l n="8:137"> Embolden'd, by the merit of the deed
</l><l n="8:138"> She traverses the adverse camp with speed,
</l><l n="8:139"> 'Till Minos' tent she reach'd: the righteous king
</l><l n="8:140"> She thus bespoke, who shiver'd at the thing.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="8:141"> Behold th' effect of love's resistless sway!
</l><l n="8:142"> I, Nisus' royal seed, to thee betray
</l><l n="8:143"> My country, and my Gods. For this strange task,
</l><l n="8:144"> Minos, no other boon but thee I ask.
</l><l n="8:145"> This purple lock, a pledge of love, receive;
</l><l n="8:146"> No worthless present, since in it I give
</l><l n="8:147"> My father's head.-Mov'd at a crime so new,
</l><l n="8:148"> And with abhorrence fill'd, back Minos drew,
</l><l n="8:149"> Nor touch'd th' unhallow'd gift; but thus exclaim'd
</l><l n="8:150"> (With mein indignant, and with eyes inflam'd),
</l><l n="8:151"> Perdition seize thee, thou, thy kind's disgrace!
</l><l n="8:152"> May thy devoted carcass find no place
</l><l n="8:153"> In earth, or air, or sea, by all out-cast!
</l><l n="8:154"> Shall Minos, with so foul a monster, blast
</l><l n="8:155"> His Cretan world, where cradled Jove was nurst?
</l><l n="8:156"> Forbid it Heav'n!-away, thou most accurst!
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="8:157"> And now Alcathoe, its lord exchang'd,
</l><l n="8:158"> Was under Minos' domination rang'd.
</l><l n="8:159"> While the most equal king his care applies
</l><l n="8:160"> To curb the conquer'd, and new laws devise,
</l><l n="8:161"> The fleet, by his command, with hoisted sails,
</l><l n="8:162"> And ready oars, invites the murm'ring gales.
</l><l n="8:163"> At length the Cretan hero anchor weigh'd,
</l><l n="8:164"> Repaying, with neglect, th' abandon'd maid.
</l><l n="8:165"> Deaf to her cries, he furrows up the main:
</l><l n="8:166"> In vain she prays, sollicits him in vain.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="8:167"> And now she furious grows in wild despair,

</l><l n="8:179"> Where shall I seek for comfort? whither fly?
</l><l n="8:180"> My native country does in ashes lye:

</l><l n="9:733"> To my sweet partner in eternal joy:
</l><l n="9:734"> Here a long pause her secret guilt confess'd,
</l><l n="9:735"> And when at length she would have spoke the rest,
</l><l n="9:736"> Half the dear name lay bury'd in her breast.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="9:737"> Thus as he listned to her vain command,
</l><l n="9:738"> Down fell the letter from her trembling hand.
</l><l n="9:739"> The omen shock'd her soul. Yet go, she cry'd;
</l><l n="9:740"> Can a request from Byblis be deny'd?
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="9:741"> To the Maeandrian youth this message's born,
</l><l n="9:742"> The half-read lines by his fierce rage were torn;

</l><l n="9:744"> Bear hence the triumph of thy impious trust:
</l><l n="9:745"> Thy instant death will but divulge her shame,
</l><l n="9:746"> Or thy life's blood shou'd quench the guilty flame.
</l><l n="9:747"> Frighted, from threatning Caunus he withdrew,

</l><l n="9:749"> The sad repulse so struck the wounded fair,
</l><l n="9:750"> Her sense was bury'd in her wild despair;
</l><l n="9:751"> Pale was her visage, as the ghastly dead;

</l><l n="9:754"> And faintly thus her cruel fate she mourns:
</l><l n="9:755"> 'Tis just, ye Gods! was my false reason blind?
</l><l n="9:756"> To write a secret of this tender kind?
</l><l n="9:757"> With female craft I shou'd at first have strove,

</l><l n="9:762"> Ere I had trusted the unfaithful skies.
</l><l n="9:763"> Now on the rouling billows I am tost,
</l><l n="9:764"> And with extended sails, on the blind shelves am lost.
</l><l n="9:765"> Did not indulgent Heav'n my doom foretell,
</l><l n="9:766"> When from my hand the fatal letter fell?
</l><l n="9:767"> What madness seiz'd my soul? and urg'd me on
</l><l n="9:768"> To take the only course to be undone?
</l><l n="9:769"> I cou'd my self have told the moving tale

</l><l n="9:776"> Yet all united would have shock'd his mind.
</l><l n="9:777"> Perhaps, my careless page might be in fault,

</l><l n="9:781"> He cou'd not else have treated me with scorn,
</l><l n="9:782"> For Caunus was not of a tygress born;
</l><l n="9:783"> Nor steel, nor adamant has fenc'd his heart;
</l><l n="9:784"> Like mine, 'tis naked to the burning dart.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="9:785"> Away false fears! he must, he shall be mine;

</l><l n="9:788"> And for my guilt much vainer to atone.
</l><l n="9:789"> Repuls'd and baffled, fiercer still she burns,
</l><l n="9:790"> And Caunus with disdain her impious love returns.
</l><l n="9:791"> He saw no end of her injurious flame,
</l><l n="9:792"> And fled his country to avoid the shame.
</l><l n="9:793"> Forsaken Byblis, who had hopes no more;
</l><l n="9:794"> Burst out in rage, and her loose robes she tore;
</l><l n="9:795"> With her fair hands she smote her tender breast,
</l><l n="9:796"> And to the wond'ring world her love confess'd;
</l><l n="9:797"> O'er hills and dales, o'er rocks and streams she flew,
</l><l n="9:798"> But still in vain did her wild lust pursue:
</l><l n="9:799"> Wearied at length, on the cold earth she fell,
</l><l n="9:800"> And now in tears alone could her sad story tell.
</l><l n="9:801"> Relenting Gods in pity fix'd her there,

</l><l n="9:885"> The maid accus'd the lingring day alone:
</l><l n="9:886"> For whom she thought a man, she thought her own.
</l><l n="9:887"> But Iphis bends beneath a greater grief;

</l><l n="10:328"> Nor more, she'd say, such wretches wou'd we grace,
</l><l n="10:329"> Than those whose crooked horns deform'd their face,
</l><l n="10:330"> From thence Cerastae call'd, an impious race:
</l><l n="10:331"> Before whose gates a rev'rend altar stood,
</l><l n="10:332"> To Jove inscrib'd, the hospitable God:
</l><l n="10:333"> This had some stranger seen with gore besmear'd,
</l><l n="10:334"> The blood of lambs, and bulls it had appear'd:

</l><l n="10:344"> If death, or exile too severe be thought,

<l n="10:356"> Pygmalion loathing their lascivious life,
</l><l n="10:357"> Abhorr'd all womankind, but most a wife:
</l><l n="10:358"> So single chose to live, and shunn'd to wed,
</l><l n="10:359"> Well pleas'd to want a consort of his bed.
</l><l n="10:360"> Yet fearing idleness, the nurse of ill,
</l><l n="10:361"> In sculpture exercis'd his happy skill;
</l><l n="10:362"> And carv'd in iv'ry such a maid, so fair,
</l><l n="10:363"> As Nature could not with his art compare,
</l><l n="10:364"> Were she to work; but in her own defence
</l><l n="10:365"> Must take her pattern here, and copy hence.
</l><l n="10:366"> Pleas'd with his idol, he commends, admires,
</l><l n="10:367"> Adores; and last, the thing ador'd, desires.
</l><l n="10:368"> A very virgin in her face was seen,
</l><l n="10:369"> And had she mov'd, a living maid had been:
</l><l n="10:370"> One wou'd have thought she cou'd have stirr'd, but strove
</l><l n="10:371"> With modesty, and was asham'd to move.
</l><l n="10:372"> Art hid with art, so well perform'd the cheat,
</l><l n="10:373"> It caught the carver with his own deceit:
</l><l n="10:374"> He knows 'tis madness, yet he must adore,
</l><l n="10:375"> And still the more he knows it, loves the more:
</l><l n="10:376"> The flesh, or what so seems, he touches oft,
</l><l n="10:377"> Which feels so smooth, that he believes it soft.
</l><l n="10:378"> Fir'd with this thought, at once he strain'd the breast,
</l><l n="10:379"> And on the lips a burning kiss impress'd.
</l><l n="10:380"> 'Tis true, the harden'd breast resists the gripe,
</l><l n="10:381"> And the cold lips return a kiss unripe:
</l><l n="10:382"> But when, retiring back, he look'd again,
</l><l n="10:383"> To think it iv'ry, was a thought too mean:
</l><l n="10:384"> So wou'd believe she kiss'd, and courting more,
</l><l n="10:385"> Again embrac'd her naked body o'er;
</l><l n="10:386"> And straining hard the statue, was afraid
</l><l n="10:387"> His hands had made a dint, and hurt his maid:
</l><l n="10:388"> Explor'd her limb by limb, and fear'd to find
</l><l n="10:389"> So rude a gripe had left a livid mark behind:
</l><l n="10:390"> With flatt'ry now he seeks her mind to move,
</l><l n="10:391"> And now with gifts (the pow'rful bribes of love),
</l><l n="10:392"> He furnishes her closet first; and fills
</l><l n="10:393"> The crowded shelves with rarities of shells;
</l><l n="10:394"> Adds orient pearls, which from the conchs he drew,
</l><l n="10:395"> And all the sparkling stones of various hue:
</l><l n="10:396"> And parrots, imitating human tongue,
</l><l n="10:397"> And singing-birds in silver cages hung:
</l><l n="10:398"> And ev'ry fragrant flow'r, and od'rous green,
</l><l n="10:399"> Were sorted well, with lumps of amber laid between:
</l><l n="10:400"> Rich fashionable robes her person deck,
</l><l n="10:401"> Pendants her ears, and pearls adorn her neck:
</l><l n="10:402"> Her taper'd fingers too with rings are grac'd,
</l><l n="10:403"> And an embroider'd zone surrounds her slender waste.
</l><l n="10:404"> Thus like a queen array'd, so richly dress'd,
</l><l n="10:405"> Beauteous she shew'd, but naked shew'd the best.
</l><l n="10:406"> Then, from the floor, he rais'd a royal bed,
</l><l n="10:407"> With cov'rings of Sydonian purple spread:
</l><l n="10:408"> The solemn rites perform'd, he calls her bride,
</l><l n="10:409"> With blandishments invites her to his side;
</l><l n="10:410"> And as she were with vital sense possess'd,
</l><l n="10:411"> Her head did on a plumy pillow rest.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:412"> The feast of Venus came, a solemn day,

</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:416"> Pygmalion off'ring, first approach'd the shrine,

</l><l n="10:420"> Make this fair statue mine, he wou'd have said,
</l><l n="10:421"> But chang'd his words for shame; and only pray'd,
</l><l n="10:422"> Give me the likeness of my iv'ry maid.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:423"> The golden Goddess, present at the pray'r,
</l><l n="10:424"> Well knew he meant th' inanimated fair,
</l><l n="10:425"> And gave the sign of granting his desire;
</l><l n="10:426"> For thrice in chearful flames ascends the fire.
</l><l n="10:427"> The youth, returning to his mistress, hies,
</l><l n="10:428"> And impudent in hope, with ardent eyes,
</l><l n="10:429"> And beating breast, by the dear statue lies.
</l><l n="10:430"> He kisses her white lips, renews the bliss,
</l><l n="10:431"> And looks, and thinks they redden at the kiss;
</l><l n="10:432"> He thought them warm before: nor longer stays,
</l><l n="10:433"> But next his hand on her hard bosom lays:
</l><l n="10:434"> Hard as it was, beginning to relent,
</l><l n="10:435"> It seem'd, the breast beneath his fingers bent;
</l><l n="10:436"> He felt again, his fingers made a print;
</l><l n="10:437"> 'Twas flesh, but flesh so firm, it rose against the dint:
</l><l n="10:438"> The pleasing task he fails not to renew;
</l><l n="10:439"> Soft, and more soft at ev'ry touch it grew;
</l><l n="10:440"> Like pliant wax, when chasing hands reduce
</l><l n="10:441"> The former mass to form, and frame for use.
</l><l n="10:442"> He would believe, but yet is still in pain,
</l><l n="10:443"> And tries his argument of sense again,
</l><l n="10:444"> Presses the pulse, and feels the leaping vein.
</l><l n="10:445"> Convinc'd, o'erjoy'd, his studied thanks, and praise,
</l><l n="10:446"> To her, who made the miracle, he pays:
</l><l n="10:447"> Then lips to lips he join'd; now freed from fear,
</l><l n="10:448"> He found the savour of the kiss sincere:
</l><l n="10:449"> At this the waken'd image op'd her eyes,
</l><l n="10:450"> And view'd at once the light, and lover with surprize.
</l><l n="10:451"> The Goddess, present at the match she made,
</l><l n="10:452"> So bless'd the bed, such fruitfulness convey'd,
</l><l n="10:453"> That ere ten months had sharpen'd either horn,
</l><l n="10:454"> To crown their bliss, a lovely boy was born;

</l><l n="10:459"> A happy prince, had he not been a sire.
</l><l n="10:460"> Daughters, and fathers, from my song retire;
</l><l n="10:461"> I sing of horror; and could I prevail,
</l><l n="10:462"> You shou'd not hear, or not believe my tale.
</l><l n="10:463"> Yet if the pleasure of my song be such,
</l><l n="10:464"> That you will hear, and credit me too much,
</l><l n="10:465"> Attentive listen to the last event,
</l><l n="10:466"> And, with the sin, believe the punishment:
</l><l n="10:467"> Since Nature cou'd behold so dire a crime,
</l><l n="10:468"> I gratulate at least my native clime,
</l><l n="10:469"> That such a land, which such a monster bore,
</l><l n="10:470"> So far is distant from our Thracian shore.
</l><l n="10:471"> Let Araby extol her happy coast,
</l><l n="10:472"> Her cinamon, and sweet Amomum boast,
</l><l n="10:473"> Her fragrant flow'rs, her trees with precious tears,
</l><l n="10:474"> Her second harvests, and her double years;
</l><l n="10:475"> How can the land be call'd so bless'd, that Myrrha bears?
</l><l n="10:476"> Nor all her od'rous tears can cleanse her crime;
</l><l n="10:477"> Her Plant alone deforms the happy clime:
</l><l n="10:478"> Cupid denies to have inflam'd thy heart,
</l><l n="10:479"> Disowns thy love, and vindicates his dart:
</l><l n="10:480"> Some Fury gave thee those infernal pains,
</l><l n="10:481"> And shot her venom'd vipers in thy veins.
</l><l n="10:482"> To hate thy sire, had merited a curse;
</l><l n="10:483"> But such an impious love deserv'd a worse.
</l><l n="10:484"> The neighb'ring monarchs, by thy beauty led,
</l><l n="10:485"> Contend in crowds, ambitious of thy bed:
</l><l n="10:486"> The world is at thy choice; except but one,

</l><l n="10:488"> She knew it too, the miserable maid,

</l><l n="10:492"> Ye Gods, ye sacred laws, my soul defend
</l><l n="10:493"> From such a crime as all mankind detest,

</l><l n="10:495"> But is it sin? Or makes my mind alone
</l><l n="10:496"> Th' imagin'd sin? For Nature makes it none.
</l><l n="10:497"> What tyrant then these envious laws began,
</l><l n="10:498"> Made not for any other beast, but Man!
</l><l n="10:499"> The father-bull his daughter may bestride,

</l><l n="10:502"> Or more salacious goat, to rut their dam?
</l><l n="10:503"> The hen is free to wed the chick she bore,
</l><l n="10:504"> And make a husband, whom she hatch'd before.

</l><l n="10:506"> Whom nor ill-natur'd laws from pleasure bind,
</l><l n="10:507"> Nor thoughts of sin disturb their peace of mind.
</l><l n="10:508"> But Man a slave of his own making lives;
</l><l n="10:509"> The fool denies himself what Nature gives:
</l><l n="10:510"> Too-busie senates, with an over-care,
</l><l n="10:511"> To make us better than our kind can bear,
</l><l n="10:512"> Have dash'd a spice of envy in the laws,
</l><l n="10:513"> And straining up too high, have spoil'd the cause.
</l><l n="10:514"> Yet some wise nations break their cruel chains,
</l><l n="10:515"> And own no laws, but those which love ordains;
</l><l n="10:516"> Where happy daughters with their sires are join'd,
</l><l n="10:517"> And piety is doubly paid in kind.
</l><l n="10:518"> O that I had been born in such a clime,
</l><l n="10:519"> Not here, where 'tis the country makes the crime!
</l><l n="10:520"> But whither wou'd my impious fancy stray?
</l><l n="10:521"> Hence hopes, and ye forbidden thoughts away!
</l><l n="10:522"> His worth deserves to kindle my desires,
</l><l n="10:523"> But with the love, that daughters bear to sires.
</l><l n="10:524"> Then had not Cinyras my father been,
</l><l n="10:525"> What hinder'd Myrrha's hopes to be his queen?
</l><l n="10:526"> But the perverseness of my fate is such,

</l><l n="10:528"> Our kindred-blood debars a better tie;
</l><l n="10:529"> He might be nearer, were he not so nigh.
</l><l n="10:530"> Eyes, and their objects, never must unite;
</l><l n="10:531"> Some distance is requir'd to help the sight:
</l><l n="10:532"> Fain wou'd I travel to some foreign shore,
</l><l n="10:533"> Never to see my native country more,
</l><l n="10:534"> So might I to my self my self restore;
</l><l n="10:535"> So might my mind these impious thoughts remove,
</l><l n="10:536"> And ceasing to behold, might cease to love.
</l><l n="10:537"> But stay I must, to feed my famish'd sight,
</l><l n="10:538"> To talk, to kiss, and more, if more I might:
</l><l n="10:539"> More, impious maid! What more canst thou design?
</l><l n="10:540"> To make a monstrous mixture in thy line,
</l><l n="10:541"> And break all statutes human and divine!
</l><l n="10:542"> Can'st thou be call'd (to save thy wretched life)
</l><l n="10:543"> Thy mother's rival, and thy father's wife?
</l><l n="10:544"> Confound so many sacred names in one,

</l><l n="10:546"> And fear'st thou not to see th' infernal bands,

</l><l n="10:567"> Round tears to shed, that scalded as they ran.
</l><l n="10:568"> The tender sire, who saw her blush, and cry,
</l><l n="10:569"> Ascrib'd it all to maiden modesty,
</l><l n="10:570"> And dry'd the falling drops, and yet more kind,

</l><l n="10:572"> She felt a secret venom fire her blood,

</l><l n="10:575"> She lik'd the best, she answer'd, One like you.
</l><l n="10:576"> Mistaking what she meant, her pious will
</l><l n="10:577"> He prais'd, and bid her so continue still:
</l><l n="10:578"> The word of pious heard, she blush'd with shame
</l><l n="10:579"> Of secret guilt, and cou'd not bear the name.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:580"> 'Twas now the mid of night, when slumbers close

</l><l n="10:640"> The virgin started at her father's name,

</l><l n="10:643"> But yet surmis'd that love disturb'd her mind:
</l><l n="10:644"> Thus thinking, she pursu'd her point, and laid,
</l><l n="10:645"> And lull'd within her lap the mourning maid;
</l><l n="10:646"> Then softly sooth'd her thus; I guess your grief:
</l><l n="10:647"> You love, my child; your love shall find relief.
</l><l n="10:648"> My long-experienc'd age shall be your guide;
</l><l n="10:649"> Rely on that, and lay distrust aside.

</l><l n="10:652"> Struck once again, as with a thunder-clap,
</l><l n="10:653"> The guilty virgin bounded from her lap,
</l><l n="10:654"> And threw her body prostrate on the bed.
</l><l n="10:655"> And, to conceal her blushes, hid her head;
</l><l n="10:656"> There silent lay, and warn'd her with her hand
</l><l n="10:657"> To go: but she receiv'd not the command;
</l><l n="10:658"> Remaining still importunate to know:
</l><l n="10:659"> Then Myrrha thus: Or ask no more, or go;
</l><l n="10:660"> I pr'ythee go, or staying spare my shame;
</l><l n="10:661"> What thou would'st hear, is impious ev'n to name.
</l><l n="10:662"> At this, on high the beldame holds her hands,
</l><l n="10:663"> And trembling both with age, and terror stands;

</l><l n="10:667"> What part of it she knew, if she no farther knows.
</l><l n="10:668"> And last, if conscious to her counsel made,
</l><l n="10:669"> Confirms anew the promise of her aid.
</l><l n="10:670"> Now Myrrha rais'd her head; but soon oppress'd
</l><l n="10:671"> With shame, reclin'd it on her nurse's breast;
</l><l n="10:672"> Bath'd it with tears, and strove to have confess'd:
</l><l n="10:673"> Twice she began, and stopp'd; again she try'd;
</l><l n="10:674"> The falt'ring tongue its office still deny'd.
</l><l n="10:675"> At last her veil before her face she spread,
</l><l n="10:676"> And drew a long preluding sigh, and said,
</l><l n="10:677"> O happy mother, in thy marriage-bed!
</l><l n="10:678"> Then groan'd, and ceas'd. The good old woman shook,

</l><l n="10:682"> Much she reproach'd, and many things she said,
</l><l n="10:683"> To cure the madness of th' unhappy maid,
</l><l n="10:684"> In vain: for Myrrha stood convict of ill;
</l><l n="10:685"> Her reason vanquish'd, but unchang'd her will:
</l><l n="10:686"> Perverse of mind, unable to reply;
</l><l n="10:687"> She stood resolv'd, or to possess, or die.
</l><l n="10:688"> At length the fondness of a nurse prevail'd
</l><l n="10:689"> Against her better sense, and virtue fail'd:
</l><l n="10:690"> Enjoy, my child, since such is thy desire,
</l><l n="10:691"> Thy love, she said; she durst not say, thy sire:
</l><l n="10:692"> Live, though unhappy, live on any terms;

</l><l n="10:934"> But when he saw the wonders of her face,
</l><l n="10:935"> And her limbs naked, springing to the race,
</l><l n="10:936"> Her limbs, as exquisitely turn'd, as mine,
</l><l n="10:937"> Or if a woman thou, might vie with thine,
</l><l n="10:938"> With lifted hands, he cry'd, forgive the tongue
</l><l n="10:939"> Which durst, ye youths, your well-tim'd courage wrong.
</l><l n="10:940"> I knew not that the nymph, for whom you strove,
</l><l n="10:941"> Deserv'd th' unbounded transports of your love.
</l><l n="10:942"> He saw, admir'd, and thus her spotless frame
</l><l n="10:943"> He prais'd, and praising, kindled his own flame.
</l><l n="10:944"> A rival now to all the youths who run,
</l><l n="10:945"> Envious, he fears they should not be undone.
</l><l n="10:946"> But why (reflects he) idly thus is shown
</l><l n="10:947"> The fate of others, yet untry'd my own?
</l><l n="10:948"> The coward must not on love's aid depend;
</l><l n="10:949"> The God was ever to the bold a friend.
</l><l n="10:950"> Mean-time the virgin flies, or seems to fly,
</l><l n="10:951"> Swift as a Scythian arrow cleaves the sky:
</l><l n="10:952"> Still more and more the youth her charms admires.
</l><l n="10:953"> The race itself t' exalt her charms conspires.
</l><l n="10:954"> The golden pinions, which her feet adorn,
</l><l n="10:955"> In wanton flutt'rings by the winds are born.
</l><l n="10:956"> Down from her head, the long, fair tresses flow,
</l><l n="10:957"> And sport with lovely negligence below.
</l><l n="10:958"> The waving ribbands, which her buskins tie,
</l><l n="10:959"> Her snowy skin with waving purple die;
</l><l n="10:960"> As crimson veils in palaces display'd,
</l><l n="10:961"> To the white marble lend a blushing shade.
</l><l n="10:962"> Nor long he gaz'd, yet while he gaz'd, she gain'd
</l><l n="10:963"> The goal, and the victorious wreath obtain'd.
</l><l n="10:964"> The vanquish'd sigh, and, as the law decreed,
</l><l n="10:965"> Pay the dire forfeit, and prepare to bleed.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:966"> Then rose Hippomenes, not yet afraid,
</l><l n="10:967"> And fix'd his eyes full on the beauteous maid.
</l><l n="10:968"> Where is (he cry'd) the mighty conquest won,
</l><l n="10:969"> To distance those, who want the nerves to run?
</l><l n="10:970"> Here prove superior strength, nor shall it be
</l><l n="10:971"> Thy loss of glory, if excell'd by me.
</l><l n="10:972"> High my descent, near Neptune I aspire,
</l><l n="10:973"> For Neptune was grand-parent to my sire.
</l><l n="10:974"> From that great God the fourth my self I trace,
</l><l n="10:975"> Nor sink my virtues yet beneath my race.
</l><l n="10:976"> Thou from Hippomenes, o'ercome, may'st claim
</l><l n="10:977"> An envy'd triumph, and a deathless fame.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:978"> While thus the youth the virgin pow'r defies,
</l><l n="10:979"> Silent she views him still with softer eyes.
</l><l n="10:980"> Thoughts in her breast a doubtful strife begin,
</l><l n="10:981"> If 'tis not happier now to lose, than win.
</l><l n="10:982"> What God, a foe to beauty, would destroy
</l><l n="10:983"> The promis'd ripeness of this blooming boy?
</l><l n="10:984"> With his life's danger does he seek my bed?
</l><l n="10:985"> Scarce am I half so greatly worth, she said.
</l><l n="10:986"> Nor has his beauty mov'd my breast to love,
</l><l n="10:987"> And yet, I own, such beauty well might move:
</l><l n="10:988"> 'Tis not his charms, 'tis pity would engage
</l><l n="10:989"> My soul to spare the greenness of his age.
</l><l n="10:990"> What, that heroick conrage fires his breast,
</l><l n="10:991"> And shines thro' brave disdain of Fate confest?
</l><l n="10:992"> What, that his patronage by close degrees
</l><l n="10:993"> Springs from th' imperial ruler of the seas?
</l><l n="10:994"> Then add the love, which bids him undertake
</l><l n="10:995"> The race, and dare to perish for my sake.
</l><l n="10:996"> Of bloody nuptials, heedless youth, beware!
</l><l n="10:997"> Fly, timely fly from a too barb'rous fair.
</l><l n="10:998"> At pleasure chuse; thy love will be repaid
</l><l n="10:999"> By a less foolish, and more beauteous maid.
</l><l n="10:1000"> But why this tenderness, before unknown?
</l><l n="10:1001"> Why beats, and pants my breast for him alone?
</l><l n="10:1002"> His eyes have seen his num'rous rivals yield;
</l><l n="10:1003"> Let him too share the rigour of the field,
</l><l n="10:1004"> Since, by their fates untaught, his own he courts,
</l><l n="10:1005"> And thus with ruin insolently sports.
</l><l n="10:1006"> Yet for what crime shall he his death receive?
</l><l n="10:1007"> Is it a crime with me to wish to live?
</l><l n="10:1008"> Shall his kind passion his destruction prove?
</l><l n="10:1009"> Is this the fatal recompence of love?
</l><l n="10:1010"> So fair a youth, destroy'd, would conquest shame,
</l><l n="10:1011"> Aud nymphs eternally detest my fame.
</l><l n="10:1012"> Still why should nymphs my guiltless fame upbraid?
</l><l n="10:1013"> Did I the fond adventurer persuade?
</l><l n="10:1014"> Alas! I wish thou would'st the course decline,
</l><l n="10:1015"> Or that my swiftness was excell'd by thine.
</l><l n="10:1016"> See! what a virgin's bloom adorns the boy!
</l><l n="10:1017"> Why wilt thou run, and why thy self destroy?
</l><l n="10:1018"> Hippomenes! O that I ne'er had been
</l><l n="10:1019"> By those bright eyes unfortunately seen!
</l><l n="10:1020"> Ah! tempt not thus a swift, untimely Fate;
</l><l n="10:1021"> Thy life is worthy of the longest date.
</l><l n="10:1022"> Were I less wretched, did the galling chain
</l><l n="10:1023"> Of rigid Gods not my free choice restrain,
</l><l n="10:1024"> By thee alone I could with joy be led
</l><l n="10:1025"> To taste the raptures of a nuptial bed.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:1026"> Thus she disclos'd the woman's secret heart,
</l><l n="10:1027"> Young, innocent, and new to Cupid's dart.
</l><l n="10:1028"> Her thoughts, her words, her actions wildly rove,
</l><l n="10:1029"> With love she burns, yet knows not that 'tis love.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:1030"> Her royal sire now with the murm'ring crowd
</l><l n="10:1031"> Demands the race impatiently aloud.
</l><l n="10:1032"> Hippomenes then with true fervour pray'd,
</l><l n="10:1033"> My bold attempt let Venus kindly aid.
</l><l n="10:1034"> By her sweet pow'r I felt this am'rous fire,
</l><l n="10:1035"> Still may she succour, whom she did inspire.
</l><l n="10:1036"> A soft, unenvious wind, with speedy care,
</l><l n="10:1037"> Wafted to Heav'n the lover's tender pray'r.
</l><l n="10:1038"> Pity, I own, soon gain'd the wish'd consent,
</l><l n="10:1039"> And all th' assistance he implor'd I lent.
</l><l n="10:1040"> The Cyprian lands, tho' rich, in richness yield
</l><l n="10:1041"> To that, surnam'd the Tamasenian field.
</l><l n="10:1042"> That field of old was added to my shrine,
</l><l n="10:1043"> And its choice products consecrated mine.
</l><l n="10:1044"> A tree there stands, full glorious to behold,
</l><l n="10:1045"> Gold are the leafs, the crackling branches gold.
</l><l n="10:1046"> It chanc'd, three apples in my hand I bore,
</l><l n="10:1047"> Which newly from the tree I sportive tore;
</l><l n="10:1048"> Seen by the youth alone, to him I brought
</l><l n="10:1049"> The fruit, and when, and how to use it, taught.
</l><l n="10:1050"> The signal sounding by the king's command,
</l><l n="10:1051"> Both start at once, and sweep th' imprinted sand.
</l><l n="10:1052"> So swiftly mov'd their feet, they might with ease,
</l><l n="10:1053"> Scarce moisten'd, skim along the glassy seas;
</l><l n="10:1054"> Or with a wondrous levity be born
</l><l n="10:1055"> O'er yellow harvests of unbending corn.
</l><l n="10:1056"> Now fav'ring peals resound from ev'ry part,
</l><l n="10:1057"> Spirit the youth, and fire his fainting heart.
</l><l n="10:1058"> Hippomenes! (they cry'd) thy life preserve,
</l><l n="10:1059"> Intensely labour, and stretch ev'ry nerve.
</l><l n="10:1060"> Base fear alone can baffle thy design,
</l><l n="10:1061"> Shoot boldly onward, and the goal is thine.
</l><l n="10:1062"> 'Tis doubtful whether shouts, like these, convey'd
</l><l n="10:1063"> More pleasures to the youth, or to the maid.
</l><l n="10:1064"> When a long distance oft she could have gain'd,
</l><l n="10:1065"> She check'd her swiftness, and her feet restrain'd:
</l><l n="10:1066"> She sigh'd, and dwelt, and languish'd on his face,
</l><l n="10:1067"> Then with unwilling speed pursu'd the race.
</l><l n="10:1068"> O'er-spent with heat, his breath he faintly drew,
</l><l n="10:1069"> Parch'd was his mouth, nor yet the goal in view,
</l><l n="10:1070"> And the first apple on the plain he threw.
</l><l n="10:1071"> The nymph stop'd sudden at th' unusual sight,
</l><l n="10:1072"> Struck with the fruit so beautifully bright.
</l><l n="10:1073"> Aside she starts, the wonder to behold,
</l><l n="10:1074"> And eager stoops to catch the rouling gold.
</l><l n="10:1075"> Th' observant youth past by, and scour'd along,
</l><l n="10:1076"> While peals of joy rung from th' applauding throng.
</l><l n="10:1077"> Unkindly she corrects the short delay,
</l><l n="10:1078"> And to redeem the time fleets swift away,
</l><l n="10:1079"> Swift, as the lightning, or the northern wind,
</l><l n="10:1080"> And far she leaves the panting youth behind.
</l><l n="10:1081"> Again he strives the flying nymph to hold
</l><l n="10:1082"> With the temptation of the second gold:
</l><l n="10:1083"> The bright temptation fruitlessly was tost,
</l><l n="10:1084"> So soon, alas! she won the distance lost.
</l><l n="10:1085"> Now but a little interval of space
</l><l n="10:1086"> Remain'd for the decision of the race.
</l><l n="10:1087"> Fair author of the precious gift, he said,
</l><l n="10:1088"> Be thou, O Goddess, author of my aid!
</l><l n="10:1089"> Then of the shining fruit the last he drew,
</l><l n="10:1090"> And with his full-collected vigour threw:
</l><l n="10:1091"> The virgin still the longer to detain,
</l><l n="10:1092"> Threw not directly, but a-cross the plain.
</l><l n="10:1093"> She seem'd a-while perplex'd in dubious thought,
</l><l n="10:1094"> If the far-distant apple should be sought:
</l><l n="10:1095"> I lur'd her backward mind to seize the bait,
</l><l n="10:1096"> And to the massie gold gave double weight.
</l><l n="10:1097"> My favour to my votary was show'd,
</l><l n="10:1098"> Her speed I lessen'd, and encreas'd her load.
</l><l n="10:1099"> But lest, tho' long, the rapid race be run,
</l><l n="10:1100"> Before my longer, tedious tale is done,
</l><l n="10:1101"> The youth the goal, and so the virgin won.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:1102"> Might I, Adonis, now not hope to see
</l><l n="10:1103"> His grateful thanks pour'd out for victory?
</l><l n="10:1104"> His pious incense on my altars laid?
</l><l n="10:1105"> But he nor grateful thanks, nor incense paid.
</l><l n="10:1106"> Enrag'd I vow'd, that with the youth the fair,
</l><l n="10:1107"> For his contempt, should my keen vengeance share;
</l><l n="10:1108"> That future lovers might my pow'r revere,
</l><l n="10:1109"> And, from their sad examples, learn to fear.
</l><l n="10:1110"> The silent fanes, the sanctify'd abodes,
</l><l n="10:1111"> Of Cybele, great mother of the Gods,
</l><l n="10:1112"> Rais'd by Echion in a lonely wood,
</l><l n="10:1113"> And full of brown, religious horror stood.
</l><l n="10:1114"> By a long painful journey faint, they chose!
</l><l n="10:1115"> Their weary limbs here secret to repose.
</l><l n="10:1116"> But soon my pow'r inflam'd the lustful boy,
</l><l n="10:1117"> Careless of rest he sought untimely joy.
</l><l n="10:1118"> A hallow'd gloomy cave, with moss o'er-grown,
</l><l n="10:1119"> The temple join'd, of native pumice-stone,
</l><l n="10:1120"> Where antique images by priests were kept.
</l><l n="10:1121"> And wooden deities securely slept.
</l><l n="10:1122"> Thither the rash Hippomenes retires,
</l><l n="10:1123"> And gives a loose to all his wild desires,
</l><l n="10:1124"> And the chaste cell pollutes with wanton fires.
</l><l n="10:1125"> The sacred statues trembled with surprize,
</l><l n="10:1126"> The tow'ry Goddess, blushing, veil'd her eyes;
</l><l n="10:1127"> And the lewd pair to Stygian sounds had sent,
</l><l n="10:1128"> But unrevengeful seem'd that punishment,
</l><l n="10:1129"> A heavier doom such black prophaneness draws,
</l><l n="10:1130"> Their taper figures turn to crooked paws.
</l><l n="10:1131"> No more their necks the smoothness can retain,
</l><l n="10:1132"> Now cover'd sudden with a yellow mane.
</l><l n="10:1133"> Arms change to legs: each finds the hard'ning breast
</l><l n="10:1134"> Of rage unknown, and wond'rous strength possest.
</l><l n="10:1135"> Their alter'd looks with fury grim appear,
</l><l n="10:1136"> And on the ground their brushing tails they hear.
</l><l n="10:1137"> They haunt the woods: their voices, which before
</l><l n="10:1138"> Were musically sweet, now hoarsly roar.
</l><l n="10:1139"> Hence lions, dreadful to the lab'ring swains,
</l><l n="10:1140"> Are tam'd by Cybele, and curb'd with reins,
</l><l n="10:1141"> And humbly draw her car along the plains.
</l><l n="10:1142"> But thou, Adonis, my delightful care,
</l><l n="10:1143"> Of these, and beasts, as fierce as these, beware!
</l><l n="10:1144"> The savage, which not shuns thee, timely shun,
</l><l n="10:1145"> For by rash prowess should'st thou be undone,
</l><l n="10:1146"> A double ruin is contain'd in one.
</l><l n="10:1147"> Thus cautious Venus school'd her fav'rite boy;
</l><l n="10:1148"> But youthful heat all cautions will destroy.
</l><l n="10:1149"> His sprightly soul beyond grave counsels flies,
</l><l n="10:1150"> While with yok'd swans the Goddess cuts the skies.
</l><l n="10:1151"> His faithful hounds, led by the tainted wind,
</l><l n="10:1152"> Lodg'd in thick coverts chanc'd a boar to find.
</l><l n="10:1153"> The callow hero show'd a manly heart,
</l><l n="10:1154"> And pierc'd the savage with a side-long dart.
</l><l n="10:1155"> The flying savage, wounded, turn'd again,
</l><l n="10:1156"> Wrench'd out the gory dart, and foam'd with pain.
</l><l n="10:1157"> The trembling boy by flight his safety sought,
</l><l n="10:1158"> And now recall'd the lore, which Venus taught;
</l><l n="10:1159"> But now too late to fly the boar he strove,
</l><l n="10:1160"> Who in the groin his tusks impetuous drove,
</l><l n="10:1161"> On the discolour'd grass Adonis lay,
</l><l n="10:1162"> The monster trampling o'er his beauteous prey.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="10:1163"> Fair Cytherea, Cyprus scarce in view,
</l><l n="10:1164"> Heard from afar his groans, and own'd them true,
</l><l n="10:1165"> And turn'd her snowy swans, and backward flew.
</l><l n="10:1166"> But as she saw him gasp his latest breath,
</l><l n="10:1167"> And quiv'ring agonize in pangs of death,
</l><l n="10:1168"> Down with swift flight she plung'd, nor rage forbore,
</l><l n="10:1169"> At once her garments, and her hair she tore.
</l><l n="10:1170"> With cruel blows she beat her guiltless breast,
</l><l n="10:1171"> The Fates upbraided, and her love confest.
</l><l n="10:1172"> Nor shall they yet (she cry'd) the whole devour
</l><l n="10:1173"> With uncontroul'd, inexorable pow'r:
</l><l n="10:1174"> For thee, lost youth, my tears, and restless pain
</l><l n="10:1175"> Shall in immortal monuments remain,
</l><l n="10:1176"> With solemn pomp in annual rites return'd,
</l><l n="10:1177"> Be thou for ever, my Adonis, mourn'd,
</l><l n="10:1178"> Could Pluto's queen with jealous fury storm,
</l><l n="10:1179"> And Menthe to a fragrant herb transform?
</l><l n="10:1180"> Yet dares not Venus with a change surprise,
</l><l n="10:1181"> And in a flow'r bid her fall'n heroe rise?
</l><l n="10:1182"> Then on the blood sweet nectar she bestows,
</l><l n="10:1183"> The scented blood in little bubbles rose:
</l><l n="10:1184"> Little as rainy drops, which flutt'ring fly,
</l><l n="10:1185"> Born by the winds, along a low'ring sky.
</l><l n="10:1186"> Short time ensu'd, 'till where the blood was shed,
</l><l n="10:1187"> A flow'r began to rear its purple head:
</l><l n="10:1188"> Such, as on Punick apples is reveal'd,
</l><l n="10:1189"> Or in the filmy rind but half conceal'd.
</l><l n="10:1190"> Still here the Fate of lovely forms we see,
</l><l n="10:1191"> So sudden fades the sweet Anemonie.
</l><l n="10:1192"> The feeble stems, to stormy blasts a prey,
</l><l n="10:1193"> Their sickly beauties droop, and pine away.
</l><l n="10:1194"> The winds forbid the flow'rs to flourish long,
</l><l n="10:1195"> Which owe to winds their names in Grecian song.

<head>The Death of Orpheus</head><lg type="verse">
<l n="11:1"> Here, while the Thracian bard's enchanting strain
</l><l n="11:2"> Sooths beasts, and woods, and all the listn'ing plain,
</l><l n="11:3"> The female Bacchanals, devoutly mad,
</l><l n="11:4"> In shaggy skins, like savage creatures, clad,
</l><l n="11:5"> Warbling in air perceiv'd his lovely lay,
</l><l n="11:6"> And from a rising ground beheld him play.
</l><l n="11:7"> When one, the wildest, with dishevel'd hair,
</l><l n="11:8"> That loosely stream'd, and ruffled in the air;
</l><l n="11:9"> Soon as her frantick eye the lyrist spy'd,
</l><l n="11:10"> See, see! the hater of our sex, she cry'd.
</l><l n="11:11"> Then at his face her missive javelin sent,
</l><l n="11:12"> Which whiz'd along, and brusht him as it went;
</l><l n="11:13"> But the soft wreathes of ivy twisted round,
</l><l n="11:14"> Prevent a deep impression of the wound.
</l><l n="11:15"> Another, for a weapon, hurls a stone,
</l><l n="11:16"> Which, by the sound subdu'd as soon as thrown,
</l><l n="11:17"> Falls at his feet, and with a seeming sense
</l><l n="11:18"> Implores his pardon for its late offence.
</l><l n="11:19"> But now their frantick rage unbounded grows,
</l><l n="11:20"> Turns all to madness, and no measure knows:
</l><l n="11:21"> Yet this the charms of musick might subdue,
</l><l n="11:22"> But that, with all its charms, is conquer'd too;
</l><l n="11:23"> In louder strains their hideous yellings rise,
</l><l n="11:24"> And squeaking horn-pipes eccho thro' the skies,
</l><l n="11:25"> Which, in hoarse consort with the drum, confound
</l><l n="11:26"> The moving lyre, and ev'ry gentle sound:
</l><l n="11:27"> Then 'twas the deafen'd stones flew on with speed,
</l><l n="11:28"> And saw, unsooth'd, their tuneful poet bleed.
</l><l n="11:29"> The birds, the beasts, and all the savage crew
</l><l n="11:30"> Which the sweet lyrist to attention drew,
</l><l n="11:31"> Now, by the female mob's more furious rage,
</l><l n="11:32"> Are driv'n, and forc'd to quit the shady stage.
</l><l n="11:33"> Next their fierce hands the bard himself assail,
</l><l n="11:34"> Nor can his song against their wrath prevail:
</l><l n="11:35"> They flock, like birds, when in a clustring flight,
</l><l n="11:36"> By day they chase the boding fowl of night.
</l><l n="11:37"> So crowded amphitheatres survey
</l><l n="11:38"> The stag, to greedy dogs a future prey.

</l><l n="12:146"> This is my hand, and this my lance, he said;

</l><l n="12:149"> I had it once; and the Lyrnessian wall,

</l><l n="12:159"> To some new tryal of his force proceeds.
</l><l n="12:160"> He chose Menoetes from among the rest;
</l><l n="12:161"> At him he launch'd his spear, and pierc'd his breast:

<l n="13:1"> The chiefs were set; the soldiers crown'd the field:
</l><l n="13:2"> To these the master of the seven-fold shield
</l><l n="13:3"> Upstarted fierce: and kindled with disdain.
</l><l n="13:4"> Eager to speak, unable to contain
</l><l n="13:5"> His boiling rage, he rowl'd his eyes around
</l><l n="13:6"> The shore, and Graecian gallies hall'd a-ground.
</l><l n="13:7"> Then stretching out his hands, O Jove, he cry'd,
</l><l n="13:8"> Must then our cause before the fleet be try'd?
</l><l n="13:9"> And dares Ulysses for the prize contend,
</l><l n="13:10"> In sight of what he durst not once defend?
</l><l n="13:11"> But basely fled that memorable day,
</l><l n="13:12"> When I from Hector's hands redeem'd the flaming prey.
</l><l n="13:13"> So much 'tis safer at the noisie bar
</l><l n="13:14"> With words to flourish, than ingage in war.
</l><l n="13:15"> By diff'rent methods we maintain our right,
</l><l n="13:16"> Nor am I made to talk, nor he to fight.
</l><l n="13:17"> In bloody fields I labour to be great;
</l><l n="13:18"> His arms are a smooth tongue, and soft deceit:
</l><l n="13:19"> Nor need I speak my deeds, for those you see,
</l><l n="13:20"> The sun, and day are witnesses for me.
</l><l n="13:21"> Let him who fights unseen, relate his own,
</l><l n="13:22"> And vouch the silent stars, and conscious moon.
</l><l n="13:23"> Great is the prize demanded, I confess,
</l><l n="13:24"> But such an abject rival makes it less;
</l><l n="13:25"> That gift, those honours, he but hop'd to gain,
</l><l n="13:26"> Can leave no room for Ajax to be vain:
</l><l n="13:27"> Losing he wins, because his name will be
</l><l n="13:28"> Ennobled by defeat, who durst contend with me.
</l><l n="13:29"> Were my known valour question'd, yet my blood
</l><l n="13:30"> Without that plea would make my title good:
</l><l n="13:31"> My sire was Telamon, whose arms, employ'd
</l><l n="13:32"> With Hercules, these Trojan walls destroy'd;
</l><l n="13:33"> And who before with Jason sent from Greece,
</l><l n="13:34"> In the first ship brought home the golden fleece.
</l><l n="13:35"> Great Telamon from Aeacus derives
</l><l n="13:36"> His birth (th' inquisitor of guilty lives
</l><l n="13:37"> In shades below; where Sisyphus, whose son
</l><l n="13:38"> This thief is thought, rouls up the restless heavy stone),
</l><l n="13:39"> Just Aeacus, the king of Gods above
</l><l n="13:40"> Begot: thus Ajax is the third from Jove.
</l><l n="13:41"> Nor shou'd I seek advantage from my line,
</l><l n="13:42"> Unless (Achilles) it was mix'd with thine:
</l><l n="13:43"> As next of kin, Achilles' arms I claim;
</l><l n="13:44"> This fellow wou'd ingraft a foreign name
</l><l n="13:45"> Upon our stock, and the Sisyphian seed
</l><l n="13:46"> By fraud, and theft asserts his father's breed:
</l><l n="13:47"> Then must I lose these arms, because I came
</l><l n="13:48"> To fight uncall'd, a voluntary name,
</l><l n="13:49"> Nor shunn'd the cause, but offer'd you my aid?
</l><l n="13:50"> While he long lurking was to war betray'd:
</l><l n="13:51"> Forc'd to the field he came, but in the reer;
</l><l n="13:52"> And feign'd distraction to conceal his fear:
</l><l n="13:53"> 'Till one more cunning caught him in the snare
</l><l n="13:54"> (Ill for himself); and dragg'd him into war.
</l><l n="13:55"> Now let a hero's arms a coward vest,
</l><l n="13:56"> And he who shunn'd all honours, gain the best:
</l><l n="13:57"> And let me stand excluded from my right,
</l><l n="13:58"> Robb'd of my kinsman's arms, who first appear'd in fight,
</l><l n="13:59"> Better for us, at home had he remain'd,
</l><l n="13:60"> Had it been true the madness which he feign'd,
</l><l n="13:61"> Or so believ'd; the less had been our shame,
</l><l n="13:62"> The less his counsell'd crime, which brands the Grecian name;
</l><l n="13:63"> Nor Philoctetes had been left inclos'd
</l><l n="13:64"> In a bare isle, to wants and pains expos'd,
</l><l n="13:65"> Where to the rocks, with solitary groans,
</l><l n="13:66"> His suff'rings, and our baseness he bemoans:
</l><l n="13:67"> And wishes (so may Heav'n his wish fulfill)
</l><l n="13:68"> The due reward to him, who caus'd his ill.
</l><l n="13:69"> Now he, with us to Troy's destruction sworn,
</l><l n="13:70"> Our brother of the war, by whom are born
</l><l n="13:71"> Alcides' arrows, pent in narrow bounds,
</l><l n="13:72"> With cold and hunger pinch'd, and pain'd with wounds,
</l><l n="13:73"> To find him food and cloathing, must employ
</l><l n="13:74"> Against the birds the shafts due to the fate of Troy.
</l><l n="13:75"> Yet still he lives, and lives from treason free,
</l><l n="13:76"> Because he left Ulysses' company;
</l><l n="13:77"> Poor Palamede might wish, so void of aid,
</l><l n="13:78"> Rather to have been left, than so to death betray'd.
</l><l n="13:79"> The coward bore the man immortal spight,
</l><l n="13:80"> Who sham'd him out of madness into fight:
</l><l n="13:81"> Nor daring otherwise to vent his hate,
</l><l n="13:82"> Accus'd him first of treason to the state;
</l><l n="13:83"> And then for proof produc'd the golden store,
</l><l n="13:84"> Himself had hidden in his tent before:
</l><l n="13:85"> Thus of two champions he depriv'd our host,
</l><l n="13:86"> By exile one, and one by treason lost.
</l><l n="13:87"> Thus fights Ulysses, thus his fame extends,
</l><l n="13:88"> A formidable man, but to his friends:
</l><l n="13:89"> Great, for what greatness is in words, and sound,
</l><l n="13:90"> Ev'n faithful Nestor less in both is found:
</l><l n="13:91"> But that he might without a rival reign,
</l><l n="13:92"> He left this faithful Nestor on the plain;
</l><l n="13:93"> Forsook his friend ev'n at his utmost need,
</l><l n="13:94"> Who tir'd, and tardy with his wounded steed,
</l><l n="13:95"> Cry'd out for aid, and call'd him by his name;
</l><l n="13:96"> But cowardice has neither ears nor shame;
</l><l n="13:97"> Thus fled the good old man, bereft of aid,
</l><l n="13:98"> And, for as much as lay in him, betray'd:
</l><l n="13:99"> That this is not a fable forg'd by me,

</l><l n="13:102"> Cannot that act excuse, much less defend:
</l><l n="13:103"> He call'd him back aloud, and tax'd his fear;
</l><l n="13:104"> And sure enough he heard, but durst not hear.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="13:105"> The Gods with equal eyes on mortal look,

</l><l n="13:108"> Found ev'ry fellow such another friend:
</l><l n="13:109"> No wonder, if he roar'd that all might hear;
</l><l n="13:110"> His elocution was increas'd by fear:
</l><l n="13:111"> I heard, I ran, I found him out of breath,
</l><l n="13:112"> Pale, trembling, and half dead with fear of death.
</l><l n="13:113"> Though he had judg'd himself by his own laws,
</l><l n="13:114"> And stood condemn'd, I help'd the common cause:
</l><l n="13:115"> With my broad buckler hid him from the foe
</l><l n="13:116"> (Ev'n the shield trembled as he lay below);
</l><l n="13:117"> And from impending Fate the coward freed:
</l><l n="13:118"> Good Heav'n forgive me for so bad a deed!
</l><l n="13:119"> If still he will persist, and urge the strife,
</l><l n="13:120"> First let him give me back his forfeit life:
</l><l n="13:121"> Let him return to that opprobrious field;
</l><l n="13:122"> Again creep under my protecting shield:
</l><l n="13:123"> Let him lie wounded, let the foe be near,
</l><l n="13:124"> And let his quiv'ring heart confess his fear;
</l><l n="13:125"> There put him in the very jaws of Fate;
</l><l n="13:126"> And let him plead his cause in that estate:
</l><l n="13:127"> And yet when snatch'd from death, when from below
</l><l n="13:128"> My lifted shield I loos'd, and let him go;
</l><l n="13:129"> Good Heav'ns, how light he rose, with what a bound
</l><l n="13:130"> He sprung from earth, forgetful of his wound;
</l><l n="13:131"> How fresh, how eager then his feet to ply;
</l><l n="13:132"> Who had not strength to stand, had speed to fly!
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="13:133"> Hector came on, and brought the Gods along;
</l><l n="13:134"> Fear seiz'd alike the feeble, and the strong:
</l><l n="13:135"> Each Greek was an Ulysses; such a dread
</l><l n="13:136"> Th' approach, and ev'n the sound of Hector bred:
</l><l n="13:137"> Him, flesh'd with slaughter, and with conquest crown'd,
</l><l n="13:138"> I met, and over-turn'd him to the ground;
</l><l n="13:139"> When after, matchless as he deem'd in might,
</l><l n="13:140"> He challeng'd all our host to single fight;
</l><l n="13:141"> All eyes were fix'd on me: the lots were thrown;
</l><l n="13:142"> But for your champion I was wish'd alone:
</l><l n="13:143"> Your vows were heard; we fought, and neither yield;

</l><l n="13:145"> With Jove to friend, th' insulting Trojan came,
</l><l n="13:146"> And menac'd us with force, our fleet with flame.

</l><l n="13:171"> The glitt'ring helm by moonlight will proclaim

</l><l n="13:181"> Which, shou'd your error on the wretch bestow,
</l><l n="13:182"> It would not frighten, but allure the foe:
</l><l n="13:183"> Why asks he, what avails him not in fight,
</l><l n="13:184"> And wou'd but cumber, and retard his flight,
</l><l n="13:185"> In which his only excellence is plac'd?
</l><l n="13:186"> You give him death, that intercept his haste.
</l><l n="13:187"> Add, that his own is yet a maiden-shield,
</l><l n="13:188"> Nor the least dint has suffer'd in the field,

</l><l n="13:191"> What farther need of words our right to scan?
</l><l n="13:192"> My arguments are deeds, let action speak the man.
</l><l n="13:193"> Since from a champion's arms the strife arose,

</l><l n="13:1395"> When strong convulsions shook my troubled breast;
</l><l n="13:1396"> I felt my heart grow fond of something strange,
</l><l n="13:1397"> And my whole Nature lab'ring with a change.
</l><l n="13:1398"> Restless I grew, and ev'ry place forsook,
</l><l n="13:1399"> And still upon the seas I bent my look.
</l><l n="13:1400"> Farewel for ever! farewel, land! I said;
</l><l n="13:1401"> And plung'd amidst the waves my sinking head.
</l><l n="13:1402"> The gentle Pow'rs, who that low empire keep,
</l><l n="13:1403"> Receiv'd me as a brother of the deep;
</l><l n="13:1404"> To Tethys, and to Ocean old, they pray
</l><l n="13:1405"> To purge my mortal earthy parts away.
</l><l n="13:1406"> The watry parents to their suit agreed,
</l><l n="13:1407"> And thrice nine times a secret charm they read,
</l><l n="13:1408"> Then with lustrations purify my limbs,
</l><l n="13:1409"> And bid me bathe beneath a hundred streams:
</l><l n="13:1410"> A hundred streams from various fountains run,
</l><l n="13:1411"> And on my head at once come rushing down.
</l><l n="13:1412"> Thus far each passage I remember well,
</l><l n="13:1413"> And faithfully thus far the tale I tell;
</l><l n="13:1414"> But then oblivion dark, on all my senses fell.
</l><l n="13:1415"> Again at length my thought reviving came,
</l><l n="13:1416"> When I no longer found my self the same;
</l><l n="13:1417"> Then first this sea-green beard I felt to grow,
</l><l n="13:1418"> And these large honours on my spreading brow;
</l><l n="13:1419"> My long-descending locks the billows sweep,
</l><l n="13:1420"> And my broad shoulders cleave the yielding deep;
</l><l n="13:1421"> My fishy tail, my arms of azure hue,
</l><l n="13:1422"> And ev'ry part divinely chang'd, I view.
</l><l n="13:1423"> But what avail these useless honours now?
</l><l n="13:1424"> What joys can immortality bestow?
</l><l n="13:1425"> What, tho' our Nereids all my form approve?
</l><l n="13:1426"> What boots it, while fair Scylla scorns my love?
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="13:1427"> Thus far the God; and more he wou'd have said;
</l><l n="13:1428"> When from his presence flew the ruthless maid.
</l><l n="13:1429"> Stung with repulse, in such disdainful sort,
</l><l n="13:1430"> He seeks Titanian Circe's horrid court.

<l n="14:1"> Now Glaucus, with a lover's haste, bounds o'er
</l><l n="14:2"> The swelling waves, and seeks the Latian shore.
</l><l n="14:3"> Messena, Rhegium, and the barren coast
</l><l n="14:4"> Of flaming Aetna, to his sight are lost:
</l><l n="14:5"> At length he gains the Tyrrhene seas, and views
</l><l n="14:6"> The hills where baneful philters Circe brews;
</l><l n="14:7"> Monsters, in various forms, around her press;
</l><l n="14:8"> As thus the God salutes the sorceress.
</l><l n="14:9"> O Circe, be indulgent to my grief,
</l><l n="14:10"> And give a love-sick deity relief.
</l><l n="14:11"> Too well the mighty pow'r of plants I know,
</l><l n="14:12"> To those my figure, and new Fate I owe.
</l><l n="14:13"> Against Messena, on th' Ausonian coast,
</l><l n="14:14"> I Scylla view'd, and from that hour was lost.
</l><l n="14:15"> In tend'rest sounds I su'd; but still the fair
</l><l n="14:16"> Was deaf to vows, and pityless to pray'r.
</l><l n="14:17"> If numbers can avail, exert their pow'r;
</l><l n="14:18"> Or energy of plants, if plants have more.
</l><l n="14:19"> I ask no cure; let but the virgin pine
</l><l n="14:20"> With dying pangs, or agonies, like mine.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="14:21"> No longer Circe could her flame disguise,
</l><l n="14:22"> But to the suppliant God marine, replies:
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="14:23"> When maids are coy, have manlier aims in view;
</l><l n="14:24"> Leave those that fly, but those that like, pursue.
</l><l n="14:25"> If love can be by kind compliance won;
</l><l n="14:26"> See, at your feet, the daughter of the Sun.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="14:27"> Sooner, said Glaucus, shall the ash remove
</l><l n="14:28"> From mountains, and the swelling surges love;
</l><l n="14:29"> Or humble sea-weed to the hills repair;
</l><l n="14:30"> E'er I think any but my Scylla fair.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="14:31"> Strait Circe reddens with a guilty shame,
</l><l n="14:32"> And vows revenge for her rejected flame.
</l><l n="14:33"> Fierce liking oft a spight as fierce creates;
</l><l n="14:34"> For love refus'd, without aversion, hates.
</l><l n="14:35"> To hurt her hapless rival she proceeds;
</l><l n="14:36"> And, by the fall of Scylla, Glaucus bleeds.
</l></lg><lg type="verse"><l n="14:37"> Some fascinating bev'rage now she brews;
</l><l n="14:38"> Compos'd of deadly drugs, and baneful juice.
</l><l n="14:39"> At Rhegium she arrives; the ocean braves,
</l><l n="14:40"> And treads with unwet feet the boiling waves.
</l><l n="14:41"> Upon the beach a winding bay there lies,
</l><l n="14:42"> Shelter'd from seas, and shaded from the skies:
</l><l n="14:43"> This station Scylla chose: a soft retreat
</l><l n="14:44"> From chilling winds, and raging Cancer's heat.
</l><l n="14:45"> The vengeful sorc'ress visits this recess;
</l><l n="14:46"> Her charm infuses, and infects the place.
</l><l n="14:47"> Soon as the nymph wades in, her nether parts
</l><l n="14:48"> Turn into dogs; then at her self she starts.
</l><l n="14:49"> A ghastly horror in her eyes appears;
</l><l n="14:50"> But yet she knows not, who it is she fears;
</l><l n="14:51"> In vain she offers from her self to run,
</l><l n="14:52"> And drags about her what she strives to shun.
