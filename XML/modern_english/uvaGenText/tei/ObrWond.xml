<head>GOLOSH STREET AND ITS PEOPLE</head>

<p>A SMALL lane, the name of which I have forgotten, or do not
choose to remember, slants suddenly off from Chatham Street,
(before that headlong thoroughfare reaches into the Park,) and
retreats suddenly down towards the East River, as if it were
disgusted with the smell of old clothes, and had determined to wash
itself clean.  This excellent intention it has, however, evidently
contributed towards the making of that imaginary pavement mentioned
in the old adage; for it is still emphatically a dirty street.  It
has never been able to shake off the Hebraic taint of filth which
it inherits from the ancestral thoroughfare.  It is slushy and
greasy, as if it were twin brother of the Roman Ghetto.
</p><p>I like a dirty slum; not because I am naturally unclean, &mdash; I
have not a drop of Neapolitan blood in my veins, &mdash; but because I
generally find a certain sediment of philosophy precipitated in its
gutters.  A clean street is terribly prosaic.  There is no food for
thought in carefully swept pavements, barren kennels, and vulgarly
spotless houses.  But when I go down a street which has been left
so long to itself that it has acquired a distinct outward
character, I find plenty to think about.  The scraps of sodden
letters lying in the ash-barrel have their meaning: desperate
appeals, perhaps, from Tom, the baker's assistant, to Amelia, the
daughter of the dry-goods retailer, who is always selling at a
sacrifice in consequence of the late fire.  That may be Tom himself
who is now passing me in a white apron, and I look up at the
windows of the house (which does not, however, give any signs of a
recent conflagration) and almost hope to see Amelia wave a white
pocket-handkerchief.  The bit of orange-peel lying on the sidewalk
inspires thought.  Who will fall over it? who but the industrious
mother of six children, the eldest of which is only nine months
old, all of whom are dependent on her exertions for support?  I see
her slip and tumble.  I see the pale face convulsed with agony, and
the vain struggle to get up; the pitying crowd closing her off from
all air; the anxious young doctor who happened to be passing by;
the manipulation of the broken limb, the shake of the head, the
moan of the victim, the litter borne on men's shoulders, the gates
of the New York Hospital unclosing, the subscription taken up on
the spot.  There is some food for speculation in that three-year-old, tattered child, masked with dirt, who is throwing a brick at
another three-year-old, tattered child, masked with dirt.  It is
not difficult to perceive that he is destined to lurk, as it were,
through life.  His bad, flat face &mdash; or, at least, what can be seen
of it &mdash; does not look as if it were made for the light of day.  The
mire in which he wallows now is but a type of the moral mire in
which he will wallow hereafter.  The feeble little hand lifted at
this instant to smite his companion, half in earnest, half in jest,
will be raised against his fellow-beings forevermore.
</p><p>Golosh Street &mdash; as I will call this nameless lane before
alluded to &mdash; is an interesting locality.  All the oddities of trade
seem to have found their way thither and made an eccentric
mercantile settlement.  There is a bird-shop at one corner,
wainscoted with little cages containing linnets, waxwings,
canaries, blackbirds, Mino-birds, with a hundred other varieties,
known only to naturalists.  Immediately opposite is an
establishment where they sell nothing but ornaments made out of the
tinted leaves of autumn, varnished and gummed into various forms.
Farther down is a second-hand book-stall, which looks like a
sentry-box mangled out flat, and which is remarkable for not
containing a complete
<pb n="464"/>
set of any work.  There is a small
chink between two ordinary-sized houses, in which a little
Frenchman makes and sells artificial eyes, specimens of which,
ranged on a black velvet cushion, stare at you unwinkingly through
the window as you pass, until you shudder and hurry on, thinking
how awful the world would be, if every one went about without
eyelids.  There are junk-shops in Golosh Street that seem to have
got hold of all the old nails in the Ark and all the old brass of
Corinth.  Madame Filomel, the fortune-teller, lives at No. 12
Golosh Street, second story front, pull the bell on the left-hand
side.  Next door to Madame is the shop of Herr Hippe, commonly
called the Wondersmith.
</p><p>Herr Hippe's shop is the largest in Golosh Street, and to all
appearance is furnished with the smallest stock.  Beyond a few
packing-cases, a turner's lathe, and a shelf laden with dissected
maps of Europe, the interior of the shop is entirely unfurnished.
The window, which is lofty and wide, but much begrimed with dirt,
contains the only pleasant object in the place.  This is a
beautiful little miniature theatre, &mdash; that is to say, the orchestra
and stage.  It is fitted with charmingly painted scenery and all
the appliances for scenic changes.  There are tiny traps, and
delicately constructed "lifts," and real footlights fed with
burning-fluid, and in the orchestra sits a diminutive conductor
before his desk, surrounded by musical manikins, all provided with
the smallest of violoncellos, flutes, oboes, drums, and such like.
There are characters also on the stage.  A Templar in a white cloak
is dragging a fainting female form to the parapet of a ruined
bridge, while behind a great black rock on the left one can see a
man concealed, who, kneeling, levels an arquebuse at the knight's
heart.  But the orchestra is silent; the conductor never beats the
time, the musicians never play a note.  The Templar never drags his
victim an inch nearer to the bridge, the masked avenger takes an
eternal aim with his weapon.  This repose appears unnatural; for so
admirably are the figures executed, that they seem replete with
life.  One is almost led to believe, in looking on them, that they
are resting beneath some spell which hinders their motion.  One
expects every moment to hear the loud explosion of the arquebuse, &mdash;
to see the blue smoke curling, the Templar falling, &mdash; to hear the
orchestra playing the requiem of the guilty.
</p><p>Few people knew what Herr Hippe's business or trade really
was.  That he worked at something was evident; else why the shop?
Some people inclined to the belief that he was an inventor, or
mechanician.  His workshop was in the rear of the store, and into
that sanctuary no one but himself had admission.  He arrived in
Golosh Street eight or ten years ago, and one fine morning, the
neighbors, taking down their shutters, observed that No. 13 had got
a tenant.  A tall, thin, sallow-faced man stood on a ladder outside
the shop-entrance, nailing up a large board, on which "Herr Hippe,
Wondersmith," was painted in black letters on a yellow ground.  The
little theatre stood in the window, where it stood ever after, and
Herr Hippe was established.
</p><p>But what was a Wondersmith? people asked each other.  No one
could reply.  Madame Filomel was consulted, but she looked grave,
and said that it was none of her business.  Mr. Pippel, the bird-fancier, who was a German, and ought to know best, thought it was
the English for some singular Teutonic profession; but his replies
were so vague, that Golosh Street was as unsatisfied as ever.
Solon, the little humpback, who kept the odd-volume book-stall at
the lowest corner, could throw no light upon it.  And at length
people had to come to the conclusion, that Herr Hippe was either a
coiner or a magician, and opinions were divided.
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="2" id="d4">
<head>A BOTTLEFUL OF SOULS.</head>

<p>IT was a dull December evening.  There was little trade doing
in Golosh
<pb n="465"/>
Street, and the shutters were up at most of the
shops.  Hippe's store had been closed at least an hour, and the
Mino-birds and Bohemian waxwings at Mr. Pippel's had their heads
tucked under their wings in their first sleep.
</p><p>Herr Hippe sat in his parlor, which was lit by a pleasant
wood-fire.  There were no candles in the room, and the flickering
blaze played fantastic tricks on the pale gray walls.  It seemed
the festival of shadows.  Processions of shapes, obscure and
indistinct, passed across the leaden-hued panels and vanished in
the dusk corners.  Every fresh blaze flung up by the wayward logs
created new images.  Now it was a funeral throng, with the bowed
figures of mourners, the shrouded coffin, the plumes that waved
like extinguished torches; now a knightly cavalcade with flags and
lances, and weird horses, that rushed silently along until they met
the angle of the room, when they pranced through the wall and
vanished.
</p><p>On a table close to where Herr Hippe sat was placed a large
square box of some dark wood, while over it was spread a casing of
steel, so elaborately wrought in an open arabesque pattern that it
seemed like a shining blue lace which was lightly stretched over
its surface.
</p><p>Herr Hippe lay luxuriously in his arm-chair, looking
meditatively into the fire.  He was tall and thin, and his skin was
of a dull saffron hue.  Long, straight hair, &mdash; sharply cut, regular
features, &mdash; a long, thin moustache, that curled like a dark asp
around his mouth, the expression of which was so bitter and cruel
that it seemed to distil the venom of the ideal serpent, &mdash; and a
bony, muscular form, were the prominent characteristics of the
Wondersmith.
</p><p>The profound silence that reigned in the chamber was broken by
a peculiar scratching at the panel of the door, like that which at
the French court was formerly substituted for the ordinary knock,
when it was necessary to demand admission to the royal apartments.
Herr Hippe started, raised his head, which vibrated on his long
neck like the head of a cobra when about to strike, and after a
moment's silence uttered a strange guttural sound.  The door
unclosed, and a squat, broad-shouldered woman, with large, wild,
Oriental eyes, entered softly.
</p><p>"Ah!  Filomel, you are come!" said the Wondersmith, sinking
back in his chair.  "Where are the rest of them?"
</p><p>"They will be here presently," answered Madame Filomel,
seating herself in an arm-chair much too narrow for a person of her
proportions, and over the sides of which she bulged like a pudding.
</p><p>"Have you brought the souls?" asked the Wondersmith.
</p><p>"They are here," said the fortune-teller, drawing a large pot-bellied black bottle from under her cloak.  "Ah!  I have had such
trouble with them!"
</p><p>"Are they of the right brand, &mdash; wild, tearing, dark, devilish
fellows?  We want no essence of milk and honey, you know.  None but
souls bitter as hemlock or scorching as lightning will suit our
purpose."
</p><p>"You will see, you will see, Grand Duke of Egypt!  They are
ethereal demons, every one of them.  They are the pick of a
thousand births.  Do you think that I, old midwife that I am, don't
know the squall of the demon child from that of the angel child,
the very moment they are delivered?  Ask a musician, how he knows,
even in the dark, a note struck by Thalberg from one struck by
Listz!"
</p><p>"I long to test them," cried the Wondersmith, rubbing his
hands joyfully.  "I long to see how the little devils will behave
when I give them their shapes.  Ah! it will be a proud day for us
when we let them loose upon the cursed Christian children!  Through
the length and breadth of the land they will go; wherever our
wandering people set foot, and wherever they are, the children of
the Christians shall die.  Then we, the despised Bohemians, the
gypsies, as they call us, will be once more lords of the earth, as
we were in the days when the accursed things called cities did not
exist,
<pb n="466"/>
and men lived in the free woods and hunted the game
of the forest.  Toys indeed!  Ay, ay, we will give the little dears
toys! toys that all day will sleep calmly in their boxes, seemingly
stiff and wooden and without life, &mdash; but at night, when the souls
enter them, will arise and surround the cots of the sleeping
children, and pierce their hearts with their keen, envenomed
blades!  Toys indeed! oh, yes!  I will sell them toys!"
</p><p>And the Wondersmith laughed horribly, while the snaky
moustache on his upper lip writhed as if it had truly a serpent's
power and could sting.
</p><p>"Have you got your first batch, Herr Hippe?" asked Madame
Filomel.  "Are they all ready?"
</p><p>"Oh, ay! they are ready," answered the Wondersmith with
gusto, &mdash; opening, as he spoke, the box covered with the blue steel
lace-work; "they are here."
</p><p>The box contained a quantity of exquisitely carved wooden
manikins of both sexes, painted with great dexterity so as to
present a miniature resemblance to Nature.  They were, in fact,
nothing more than admirable specimens of those toys which children
delight in placing in various positions on the table, &mdash; in
regiments, or sitting at meals, or grouped under the stiff green
trees which always accompany them in the boxes in which they are
sold at the toy-shops.
</p><p>The peculiarity, however, about the manikins of Herr Hippe was
not alone the artistic truth with which the limbs and the features
were gifted; but on the countenance of each little puppet the
carver's art had wrought an expression of wickedness that was
appalling.  Every tiny face had its special stamp of ferocity.  The
lips were thin and brimful of malice; the small black bead-like
eyes glittered with the fire of a universal hate.  There was not
one of the manikins, male or female, that did not hold in his or
her hand some miniature weapon.  The little men, scowling like
demons, clasped in their wooden fingers swords delicate as a
housewife's needle.  The women, whose countenances expressed
treachery and cruelty, clutched infinitesimal daggers, with which
they seemed about to take some terrible vengeance.
</p><p>"Good!" said Madame Filomel, taking one of the manikins out of
the box, and examining it attentively; "you work well, Duke
Balthazar!  These little ones are of the right stamp; they look as
if they had mischief in them.  Ah! here come our brothers."
</p><p>At this moment the same scratching that preceded the entrance
of Madame Filomel was heard at the door, and Herr Hippe replied
with a hoarse, guttural cry.  The next moment two men entered.  The
first was a small man with very brilliant eyes.  He was wrapt in a
long shabby cloak, and wore a strange nondescript species of cap on
his head, such a cap as one sees only in the low billiard-rooms in
Paris.  His companion was tall, long-limbed, and slender; and his
dress, although of the ordinary cut, either from the disposition of
colors, or from the careless, graceful attitudes of the wearer,
assumed a certain air of picturesqueness.  Both the men possessed
the same marked Oriental type of countenance which distinguished
the Wondersmith and Madame Filomel.  True gypsies they seemed, who
would not have been out of place telling fortunes, or stealing
chickens in the green lanes of England, or wandering with their
wild music and their sleight-of-hand tricks through Bohemian
villages.
</p><p>"Welcome, brothers!" said the Wondersmith; "you are in time.
Sister Filomel has brought the souls, and we are about to test
them.  Monsieur Kerplonne, take off your cloak.  Brother Oaksmith,
take a chair.  I promise you some amusement this evening; so make
yourselves comfortable.  Here is something to aid you."
</p><p>And while the Frenchman Kerplonne, and his tall companion,
Oaksmith, were obeying Hippe's invitation, he reached over to a
little closet let into the wall, and took thence a squat bottle and
some glasses, which he placed on the table.
</p><p>"Drink, brothers!" he said; "it is
<pb n="467"/>
not Christian
blood, but good stout wine of Oporto.  It goes right to the heart,
and warms one like the sunshine of the South."
</p><p>"It is good," said Kerplonne, smacking his lips with
enthusiasm.
</p><p>"Why don't you keep brandy?  Hang wine!" cried Oaksmith, after
having swallowed two bumpers in rapid succession.
</p><p>"Bah!  Brandy has been the ruin of our race.  It has made us
sots and thieves.  It shall never cross my threshold," cried the
Wondersmith, with a sombre indignation.
</p><p>"A little of it is not bad, though, Duke," said the fortune-teller.  "It consoles us for our misfortunes; it gives us the
crowns we once wore; it restores to us the power we once wielded;
it carries us back, as if by magic, to that land of the sun from
which fate has driven us; it darkens the memory of all the evils
that we have for centuries suffered."
</p><p>"It is a devil; may it be cursed!" cried Herr Hippe,
passionately.  "It is a demon that stole from me my son, the finest
youth in all Courland.  Yes! my son, the son of the Waywode
Balthazar, Grand Duke of Lower Egypt, died raving in a gutter, with
an empty brandy-bottle in his hands.  Were it not that the plant is
a sacred one to our race, I would curse the grape and the vine that
bore it."
</p><p>This outburst was delivered with such energy that the three
gypsies kept silence.  Oaksmith helped himself to another glass of
Port, and the fortune-teller rocked to and fro in her chair, too
much overawed by the Wondersmith's vehemence of manner to reply.
The little Frenchman, Kerplonne, took no part in the discussion,
but seemed lost in admiration of the manikins, which he took from
the box in which they lay, handling them with the greatest care.
After the silence had lasted for about a minute, Herr Hippe broke
it with the sudden question, &mdash;
</p><p>"How does your eye get on, Kerplonne?"
</p><p>"Excellently, Duke.  It is finished.  I have it here."  And
the little Frenchman put his hand into his breeches-pocket and
pulled out a large artificial human eye.  Its great size was the
only thing in this eye that would lead any one to suspect its
artificiality.  It was at least twice the size of life; but there
was a fearful speculative light in its iris, which seemed to expand
and contract like the eye of a living being, that rendered it a
horrible staring paradox.  It looked like the naked eye of the
Cyclops, torn from his forehead, and still burning with wrath and
the desire for vengeance.
</p><p>The little Frenchman laughed pleasantly as he held the eye in
his hand, and gazed down on that huge dark pupil, that stared back
at him, it seemed, with an air of defiance and mistrust.
</p><p>"It is a devil of an eye," said the little man, wiping the
enamelled surface with an old silk pocket-handkerchief; "it reads
like a demon.  My niece &mdash; the unhappy one &mdash; has a wretch of a lover,
and I have a long time feared that she would run away with him.  I
could not read her correspondence, for she kept her writing-desk
closely locked.  But I asked her yesterday to keep this eye in some
very safe place for me.  She put it, as I knew she would, into her
desk, and by its aid I read every one of her letters.  She was to
run away next Monday, the ungrateful! but she will find herself
disappointed."
</p><p>And the little man laughed heartily at the success of his
stratagem, and polished and fondled the great eye until that optic
seemed to grow sore with rubbing.
</p><p>"And you have been at work, too, I see, Herr Hippe.  Your
manikins are excellent.  But where are the souls?"
</p><p>"In that bottle," answered the Wondersmith, pointing to the
pot-bellied black bottle that Madame Filomel had brought with her.
"Yes, Monsieur Kerplonne," he continued, "my manikins are well
made.  I invoked the aid of Abigor, the demon of soldiery, and he
inspired me.  The little fellows will be famous assassins when they
are animated.  We will try them to-night."
</p><p>"Good!" cried Kerplonne, rubbing his hands joyously.  "It is
close upon New
<pb n="468"/>
Year's Day.  We will fabricate millions of
the little murderers by New Year's Even, and sell them in large
quantities; and when the households are all asleep, and the
Christian children are waiting for Santa Claus to come, the small
ones will troop from their boxes and the Christian children will
die.  It is famous!  Health to Abigor!"
</p><p>"Let us try them at once," said Oaksmith.  "Is your daughter,
Zonela, in bed, Herr Hippe?  Are we secure from intrusion?"
</p><p>"No one is stirring about the house," replied the Wondersmith,
gloomily.
</p><p>Filomel leaned over to Oaksmith, and said, in an undertone, &mdash;
</p><p>"Why do you mention his daughter?  You know he does not like
to have her spoken about."
</p><p>"I will take care that we are not disturbed," said Kerplonne,
rising.  "I will put my eye outside the door, to watch."
</p><p>He went to the door and placed his great eye upon the floor
with tender care.  As he did so, a dark form, unseen by him or his
second vision, glided along the passage noiselessly and was lost in
the darkness.
</p><p>"Now for it!" exclaimed Madam Filomel, taking up her fat black
bottle.  "Herr Hippe, prepare your manikins!"
</p><p>The Wondersmith took the little dolls out, one by one, and set
them upon the table.  Such an array of villanous countenances was
never seen.  An army of Italian bravos, seen through the wrong end
of a telescope, or a band of prisoners at the galleys in Lilliput,
will give some faint idea of the appearance they presented.  While
Madame Filomel uncorked the black bottle, Herr Hippe covered the
dolls over with a species of linen tent, which he took also from
the box.  This done, the fortune-teller held the mouth of the
bottle to the door of the tent, gathering the loose cloth closely
round the glass neck.  Immediately, tiny noises were heard inside
the tent.  Madame Filomel removed the bottle, and the Wondersmith
lifted the covering in which he had enveloped his little people.
</p><p>A wonderful transformation had taken place.  Wooden and
inflexible no longer, the crowd of manikins were now in full
motion.  The beadlike eyes turned, glittering, on all sides; the
thin, wicked lips quivered with bad passions; the tiny hands
sheathed and unsheathed the little swords and daggers.  Episodes,
common to life, were taking place in every direction.  Here two
martial manikins paid court to a pretty sly-faced female, who
smiled on each alternately, but gave her hand to be kissed to a
third manikin, an ugly little scoundrel, who crouched behind her
back.  There a pair of friendly dolls walked arm in arm, apparently
on the best terms, while, all the time, one was watching his
opportunity to stab the other in the back.
</p><p>"I think they'll do," said the Wondersmith, chuckling, as he
watched these various incidents.  "Treacherous, cruel,
bloodthirsty.  All goes marvellously well.  But stay!  I will put
the grand test to them."
</p><p>So saying, he drew a gold dollar from his pocket, and let it
fall on the table in the very midst of the throng of manikins.  It
had hardly touched the table, when there was a pause on all sides.
Every head was turned towards the dollar.  Then about twenty of the
little creatures rushed towards the glittering coin.  One, fleeter
than the rest, leaped upon it, and drew his sword.  The entire
crowd of little people had now gathered round this new centre of
attraction.  Men and women struggled and shoved to get nearer to
the piece of gold.  Hardly had the first Liliputian mounted upon
the treasure, when a hundred blades flashed back a defiant answer
to his, and a dozen men, sword in hand, leaped upon the yellow
platform and drove him off at the sword's point.  Then commenced a
general battle.  The miniature faces were convulsed with rage and
avarice.  Each furious doll tried to plunge dagger or sword into
his or her neighbor, and the women seemed possessed by a thousand
devils.
</p><p>"They will break themselves into atoms,"
<pb n="469"/>
cried
Filomel, as she watched with eagerness this savage <hi rend="italic">melee</hi>.  "You
had better gather them up, Herr Hippe.  I will exhaust my bottle
and suck all the souls back from them."
</p><p>"Oh, they are perfect devils! they are magnificent little
demons!" cried the Frenchman, with enthusiasm.  "Hippe, you are a
wonderful man.  Brother Oaksmith, you have no such man as Hippe
among your English gypsies."
</p><p>"Not exactly," answered Oaksmith, rather sullenly, "not
exactly.  But we have men there who can make a twelve-year-old
horse look like a four-year-old, &mdash; and who can take you and Herr
Hippe up with one hand, and throw you over their shoulders."
</p><p>"The good God forbid!" said the little Frenchman.  "I do not
love such play.  It is incommodious."
</p><p>While Oaksmith and Kerplonne were talking, the Wondersmith had
placed the linen tent over the struggling dolls, and Madame
Filomel, who had been performing some mysterious manipulations with
her black bottle, put the mouth once more to the door of the tent.
In an instant the confused murmur within ceased.  Madame Filomel
corked the bottle quickly.  The Wondersmith withdrew the tent, and,
lo! the furious dolls were once more wooden-jointed and inflexible;
and the old sinister look was again frozen on their faces.
</p><p>"They must have blood, though," said Herr Hippe, as he
gathered them up and put them into their box.  "Mr. Pippel, the
bird-fancier, is asleep.  I have a key that opens his door.  We
will let them loose among the birds; it will be rare fun."
</p><p>"Magnificent!" cried Kerplonne.  "Let us go on the instant.
But first let me gather up my eye."
</p><p>The Frenchman pocketed his eye, after having given it a polish
with the silk handkerchief; Herr Hippe extinguished the lamp;
Oaksmith took a last bumper of Port; and the four gypsies departed
for Mr. Pippel's, carrying the box of manikins with them.

<head>SOLON.</head>

<p>THE shadow that glided along the dark corridor, at the moment
that Monsieur Kerplonne deposited his sentinel eye outside the door
of the Wondersmith's apartment, sped swiftly through the passage
and ascended the stairs to the attic.  Here the shadow stopped at
the entrance to one of the chambers and knocked at the door.  There
was no reply.
</p><p>"Zonela, are you asleep?" said the shadow, softly.
</p><p>"Oh, Solon, is it you?" replied a sweet low voice from within.
"I thought it was Herr Hippe.  Come in."
</p><p>The shadow opened the door and entered.  There were neither
candles nor lamp in the room; but through the projecting window,
which was open, there came the faint gleams of the starlight, by
which one could distinguish a female figure seated on a low stool
in the middle of the floor.
</p><p>"Has he left you without light again, Zonela?" asked the
shadow, closing the door of the apartment.  "I have brought my
little lantern with me, though."
</p><p>"Thank you, Solon," answered she called Zonela; "you are a
good fellow.  He never gives me any light of an evening, but bids
me go to bed.  I like to sit sometimes and look at the moon and the
stars, &mdash; the stars more than all; for they seem all the time to look
right back into my face, very sadly, as if they would say, 'We see
you, and pity you, and would help you, if we could.'  But it is so
mournful to be always looking at such myriads of melancholy eyes!
and I long so to read those nice books that you lend me, Solon!"
</p><p>By this time the shadow had lit the lantern and was a shadow
no longer.  A large head, covered with a profusion of long blonde
hair, which was cut after that fashion known as <hi rend="italic">a l'enfants
d'Edouard</hi>; a beautiful pale face, lit with wide, blue, dreamy
eyes; long arms and slender hands, attenuated legs, and &mdash; an
enormous hump; &mdash; such was Solon, the
<pb n="470"/>
shadow.  As soon as the
humpback had lit the lamp, Zonela arose from the low stool on which
she had been seated, and took Solon's hand affectionately in hers.
</p><p>Zonela was surely not of gypsy blood.  That rich auburn hair,
that looked almost black in the lamp-light, that pale, transparent
skin, tinged with an under-glow of warm rich blood, the hazel eyes,
large and soft as those of a fawn, were never begotten of a
Zingaro.  Zonela was seemingly about sixteen; her figure, although
somewhat thin and angular, was full of the unconscious grace of
youth.  She was dressed in an old cotton print, which had been once
of an exceedingly boisterous pattern, but was now a mere suggestion
of former splendor; while round her head was twisted, in fantastic
fashion, a silk handkerchief of green ground spotted with bright
crimson.  This strange headdress gave her an elfish appearance.
</p><p>"I have been out all day with the organ, and I am so tired,
Solon! &mdash; not sleepy, but weary, I mean.  Poor Furbelow was sleepy,
though, and he's gone to bed."
</p><p>"I'm weary, too, Zonela; &mdash; not weary as you are, though, for I
sit in my little book-stall all day long, and do not drag round an
organ and a monkey and play old tunes for pennies, &mdash; but weary of
myself, of life, of the load that I carry on my shoulders"; and, as
he said this, the poor humpback glanced sideways, as if to call
attention to his deformed person.
</p><p>"Well, but you ought not to be melancholy amidst your books,
Solon.  Gracious!  If I could only sit in the sun and read as you
do, how happy I should be!  But it's very tiresome to trudge round
all day with that nasty organ, and look up at the houses, and know
that you are annoying the people inside; and then the boys play
such bad tricks on poor Furbelow, throwing him hot pennies to pick
up, and burning his poor little hands; and oh! sometimes, Solon,
the men in the street make me so afraid, &mdash; they speak to me and look
at me so oddly! &mdash; I'd a great deal rather sit in your book-stall and
read."
</p><p>"I have nothing but odd volumes in my stall," answered the
humpback.  "Perhaps that's right, though; for, after all, I'm
nothing but an odd volume myself."
</p><p>"Come, don't be melancholy, Solon.  Sit down and tell me a
story.  I'll bring Furbelow to listen."
</p><p>So saying, she went to a dusk corner of the cheerless attic-room, and returned with a little Brazilian monkey in her arms, &mdash; a
poor, mild, drowsy thing, that looked as if it had cried itself to
sleep.  She sat down on her little stool, with Furbelow in her lap,
and nodded her head to Solon, as much as to say, "Go on; we are
attentive."
</p><p>"You want a story, do you?" said the humpback, with a mournful
smile.  "Well, I'll tell you one.  Only what will your father say,
if he catches me here?"
</p><p>"Herr Hippe is not my father," cried Zonela, indignantly.
"He's a gypsy, and I know I'm stolen; and I'd run away from him, if
I only knew where to run to.  If I were his child, do you think
that he would treat me as he does? make me trudge round the city,
all day long, with a barrel-organ and a monkey, &mdash; though I love poor
dear little Furbelow, &mdash; and keep me up in a garret, and give me ever
so little to eat?  I know I'm not his child, for he hates me."
</p><p>"Listen to my story, Zonela, and we'll talk of that
afterwards.  Let me sit at your feet"; &mdash; and, having coiled himself
up at the little maiden's feet, he commenced: &mdash;
</p><p>"There once lived in a great city, just like this city of New
York, a poor little hunchback.  He kept a second-hand book-stall,
where he made barely enough money to keep body and soul together.
He was very sad at times, because he knew scarce any one, and those
that he did know did not love him.  He had passed a sickly,
secluded youth.  The children of his neighborhood would not play
with him, for he was not made like them; and the people in the
streets stared at him with pity, or scoffed at him when he went by.
Ah!  Zonela, how his poor heart was wrung with bitterness when he
beheld the procession of shapely men
<pb n="471"/>
and fine women that
every day passed him by in the thoroughfares of the great city!
How he repined and cursed his fate as the torrent of fleet-footed
firemen dashed past him to the toll of the bells, magnificent in
their overflowing vitality and strength!  But there was one
consolation left him, &mdash; one drop of honey in the jar of gall, so
sweet that it ameliorated all the bitterness of life.  God had
given him a deformed body, but his mind was straight and healthy.
So the poor hunchback shut himself into the world of books, and
was, if not happy, at least contented.  He kept company with
courteous paladins, and romantic heroes, and beautiful women; and
this society was of such excellent breeding that it never so much
as once noticed his poor crooked back or his lame walk.  The love
of books grew upon him with his years.  He was remarked for his
studious habits; and when, one day, the obscure people that he
called father and mother &mdash; parents only in name &mdash; died, a
compassionate book-vendor gave him enough stock in trade to set up
a little stall of his own.  Here, in his book-stall, he sat in the
sun all day, waiting for the customers that seldom came, and
reading the fine deeds of the people of the ancient time, or the
beautiful thoughts of the poets that had warmed millions of hearts
before that hour, and still glowed for him with undiminished fire.
One day, when he was reading some book, that, small as it was, was
big enough to shut the whole world out from him, he heard some
music in the street.  Looking up from his book, he saw a little
girl, with large eyes, playing an organ, while a monkey begged for
alms from a crowd of idlers who had nothing in their pockets but
their hands.  The girl was playing, but she was also weeping.  The
merry notes of the polka were ground out to a silent accompaniment
of tears.  She looked very sad, this organ-girl, and her monkey
seemed to have caught the infection, for his large brown eyes were
moist, as if he also wept.  The poor hunchback was struck with
pity, and called the little girl over to give her a penny, &mdash; not,
dear Zonela, because he wished to bestow alms, but because he
wanted to speak with her.  She came, and they talked together.  She
came the next day, &mdash; for it turned out that they were neighbors, &mdash;
and the next, and, in short, every day.  They became friends.  They
were both lonely and afflicted, with this difference, that she was
beautiful, and he &mdash; was a hunchback."
</p><p>"Why, Solon," cried Zonela, "that's the very way you and I
met!"
</p><p>"It was then," continued Solon, with a faint smile, "that life
seemed to have its music.  A great harmony seemed to the poor
cripple to fill the world.  The carts that took the flour-barrels
from the wharves to the store-houses seemed to emit joyous melodies
from their wheels.  The hum of the great business-streets sounded
like grand symphonies of triumph.  As one who has been travelling
through a barren country without much heed feels with singular
force the sterility of the lands he has passed through when he
reaches the fertile plains that lie at the end of his journey, so
the humpback, after his vision had been freshened with this
blooming flower, remembered for the first time the misery of the
life that he had led.  But he did not allow himself to dwell upon
the past.  The present was so delightful that it occupied all his
thoughts.  Zonela, he was in love with the organ-girl."
</p><p>"Oh, that's so nice!" said Zonela, innocently, &mdash; pinching poor
Furbelow, as she spoke, in order to dispel a very evident snooze
that was creeping over him.  "It's going to be a love-story."
</p><p>"Ah! but, Zonela, he did not know whether she loved him in
return.  You forget that he was deformed."
</p><p>"But," answered the girl, gravely, "he was good."
</p><p>A light like the flash of an aurora illuminated Solon's face
for an instant.  He put out his hand suddenly, as if to take
Zonela's and press it to his heart; but an unaccountable timidity
seemed to arrest the impulse, and he only stroked Furbelow's head, &mdash;
upon which that individual
<pb n="472"/>
opened one large brown eye to
the extent of the eighth of an inch, and, seeing that it was only
Solon, instantly closed it again, and resumed his dream of a city
where there were no organs and all the copper coin of the realm was
iced.
</p><p>"He hoped and feared," continued Solon, in a low, mournful
voice; "but at times he was very miserable, because he did not
think it possible that so much happiness was reserved for him as
the love of this beautiful, innocent girl.  At night, when he was
in bed, and all the world was dreaming, he lay awake looking up at
the old books that hung against the walls, thinking how he could
bring about the charming of her heart.  One night, when he was
thinking of this, with his eyes fixed upon the mouldy backs of the
odd volumes that lay on their shelves, and looked back at him
wistfully, as if they would say, &mdash; 'We also are like you, and wait
to be completed,' &mdash; it seemed as if he heard a rustle of leaves.
Then, one by one, the books came down from their places to the
floor, as if shifted by invisible hands, opened their worm-eaten
covers, and from between the pages of each the hunchback saw issue
forth a curious throng of little people that danced here and there
through the apartment.  Each one of these little creatures was
shaped so as to bear resemblance to some one of the letters of the
alphabet.  One tall, long-legged fellow seemed like the letter A;
a burly fellow, with a big head and a paunch, was the model of B;
another leering little chap might have passed for a Q; and so on
through the whole.  These fairies &mdash; for fairies they were &mdash; climbed
upon the hunchback's bed, and clustered thick as bees upon his
pillow.  'Come!' they cried to him, 'we will lead you into fairy-land.'  So saying, they seized his hand, and he suddenly found
himself in a beautiful country, where the light did not come from
sun or moon or stars, but floated round and over and in everything
like the atmosphere.  On all sides he heard mysterious melodies
sung by strangely musical voices.  None of the features of the
landscape were definite; yet when he looked on the vague harmonies
of color that melted one into another before his sight, he was
filled with a sense of inexplicable beauty.  On every side of him
fluttered radiant bodies which darted to and fro through the
illumined space.  They were not birds, yet they flew like birds;
and as each one crossed the path of his vision, he felt a strange
delight flash through his brain, and straightway an interior voice
seemed to sing beneath the vaulted dome of his temples a verse
containing some beautiful thought.  The little fairies were all
this time dancing and fluttering around him, perching on his head,
on his shoulders, or balancing themselves on his finger-tips.
'Where am I?' he asked, at last, of his friends, the fairies.  'Ah!
Solon,' he heard them whisper, in tones that sounded like the
distant tinkling of silver bells, 'this land is nameless; but those
whom we lead hither, who tread its soil, and breathe its air, and
gaze on its floating sparks of light, are poets forevermore!'
Having said this, they vanished, and with them the beautiful
indefinite land, and the flashing lights, and the illumined air;
and the hunchback found himself again in bed, with the moonlight
quivering on the floor, and the dusty books on their shelves, grim
and mouldy as ever."
</p><p>"You have betrayed yourself.  You called yourself Solon,"
cried Zonela.  "Was it a dream?"
</p><p>"I do not know," answered Solon; "but since that night I have
been a poet."
</p><p>"A poet?" screamed the little organ-girl, &mdash; "a real poet, who
makes verses which every one reads and every one talks of?"
</p><p>"The people call me a poet," answered Solon, with a sad smile.
"They do not know me by the name of Solon, for I write under an
assumed title; but they praise me, and repeat my songs.  But,
Zonela, I can't sing this load off of my back, can I?"
</p><p>"Oh, bother the hump!" said Zonela, jumping up suddenly.
"You're a poet, and that's enough, isn't it?  I'm so glad
<pb n="473"/>
you're a poet, Solon!  You must repeat all your best things to me,
won't you?"
</p><p>Solon nodded assent.
</p><p>"You don't ask me," he said, "who was the little girl that the
hunchback loved."
</p><p>Zonela's face flushed crimson.  She turned suddenly away, and
ran into a dark corner of the room.  In a moment she returned with
an old hand-organ in her arms.
</p><p>"Play, Solon, play!" she cried.  "I am so glad that I want to
dance.  Furbelow, come and dance in honor of Solon the Poet."
</p><p>It was her confession.  Solon's eyes flamed, as if his brain
had suddenly ignited.  He said nothing; but a triumphant smile
broke over his countenance.  Zonela, the twilight of whose cheeks
was still rosy with the setting blush, caught the lazy Furbelow by
his little paws; Solon turned the crank of the organ, which wheezed
out as merry a polka as its asthma would allow, and the girl and
the monkey commenced their fantastic dance.  They had taken but a
few steps when the door suddenly opened, and the tall figure of the
Wondersmith appeared on the threshold.  His face was convulsed with
rage, and the black snake that quivered on his upper lip seemed to
rear itself as if about to spring upon the hunchback.
</p>

<head>THE MANIKINS AND THE MINOS.</head>

<p>THE four gypsies left Herr Hippe's house cautiously, and
directed their steps towards Mr. Pippel's bird-shop.  Golosh Street
was asleep.  Nothing was stirring in that tenebrous slum, save a
dog that savagely gnawed a bone which lay on a dust-heap,
tantalizing him with the flavor of food without its substance.  As
the gypsies moved stealthily along in the darkness, they had a
sinister and murderous air that would not have failed to attract
the attention of the policeman of the quarter, if that worthy had
not at the moment been comfortably ensconced in the neighboring
"Rainbow" bar-room, listening to the improvisations of that
talented vocalist, Mr. Harrison, who was making impromptu verses on
every possible subject, to the accompaniment of a cithern which was
played by a sad little Italian in a large cloak, to whom the host
of the "Rainbow" gave so many toddies and a dollar for his nightly
performance.
</p><p>Mr. Pippel's shop was but a short distance from the
Wondersmith's house.  A few moments, therefore, brought the gypsy
party to the door, when, by aid of a key which Herr Hippe produced,
they silently slipped into the entry.  Here the Wondersmith took a
dark-lantern from under his cloak, removed the cap that shrouded
the light, and led the way into the shop, which was separated from
the entry only by a glass door, that yielded, like the outer one,
to a key which Hippe took from his pocket.  The four gypsies now
entered the shop and closed the door behind them.
</p><p>It was a little world of birds.  On every side, whether in
large or small cages, one beheld balls of various-colored feathers
standing on one leg and breathing peacefully.  Love-birds, nestling
shoulder to shoulder, with their heads tucked under their wings and
all their feathers puffed out, so that they looked like globes of
malachite; English bullfinches, with ashen-colored backs, in which
their black heads were buried, and corselets of a rosy down; Java
sparrows, fat and sleek and cleanly; troupials, so glossy and
splendid in plumage that they looked as if they were dressed in the
celebrated armor of the Black Prince, which was jet, richly
damascened with gold; a cock of the rock, gleaming, a ball of tawny
fire, like a setting sun; the Campanero of Brazil, white as snow,
with his dilatable tolling-tube hanging from his head, placid and
silent; &mdash; these, with a humbler crowd of linnets, canaries, robins,
mocking-birds, and phoebes, slumbered calmly in their little cages,
that were hung so thickly on the wall as not to leave an inch of it
visible.
</p><p>"Splendid little morsels, all of them!" exclaimed Monsieur
Kerplonne.  "Ah we are going to have a rare beating!"
<pb n="474"/>
</p><p>"So Pippel does not sleep in his shop," said the English
gypsy, Oaksmith.
</p><p>"No.  The fellow lives somewhere up one of the avenues,"
answered Madame Filomel.  "He came, the other evening, to consult
me about his fortune.  I did not tell him," she added, with a
laugh, "that he was going to have so distinguished a sporting party
on his premises."
</p><p>"Come," said the Wondersmith, producing the box of manikins,
"get ready with souls, Madame Filomel.  I am impatient to see my
little men letting out lives for the first time."
</p><p>Just at the moment that the Wondersmith uttered this sentence,
the four gypsies were startled by a hoarse voice issuing from a
corner of the room, and propounding in the most guttural tones the
intemperate query of "What'll you take?"  This sottish invitation
had scarce been given, when a second extremely thick voice replied
from an opposite corner, in accents so rough that they seemed to
issue from a throat torn and furrowed by the liquid lava of many
barrooms, "Brandy and water."
</p><p>"Hollo! who's here?" muttered Herr Hippe, flashing the light
of his lantern round the shop.
</p><p>Oaksmith turned up his coat-cuffs, as if to be ready for a
fight; Madame Filomel glided, or rather rolled, towards the door;
while Kerplonne put his hand into his pocket, as if to assure
himself that his supernumerary optic was all right.
</p><p>"What'll you take?" croaked the voice in the corner, once
more.
</p><p>"Brandy and water," rapidly replied the second voice in the
other corner.  And then, as if by a concerted movement, a series of
bibular invitations and acceptances were rolled backwards and
forwards with a volubility of utterance that threw Patter <hi rend="italic">
versus</hi> Clatter into the shade.
</p><p>"What the Devil can it be?" muttered the Wondersmith, flashing
his lantern here and there.  "Ah! it is those Minos."
</p><p>So saying, he stopped under one of the wicker cages that hung
high up on the wall, and raised the lantern above his head, so as
to throw the light upon that particular cage.  The hospitable
individual who had been extending all these hoarse invitations to
partake of intoxicating beverages was an inhabitant of the cage.
It was a large Mino-bird, who now stood perched on his cross-bar,
with his yellowish orange bill sloped slightly over his shoulder,
and his white eye cocked knowingly upon the Wondersmith.  The
respondent voice in the other corner came from another Mino-bird,
who sat in the dusk in a similar cage, also attentively watching
the Wondersmith.  These Mino-birds, I may remark, in passing, have
a singular aptitude for acquiring phrases.
</p><p>"What'll you take?" repeated the Mino, cocking his other eye
upon Herr Hippe.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">"Mon Dieu!</hi> what a bird!" exclaimed the little Frenchman.
"He is, in truth, polite."
</p><p>"I don't know what I'll take," said Hippe, as if replying to
the Mino-bird; "but I know what you'll get, old fellow!  Filomel,
open the cage-doors, and give me the bottle."
</p><p>Filomel opened, one after another, the doors of the numberless
little cages, thereby arousing from slumber their feathered
occupants, who opened their beaks, and stretched their claws, and
stared with great surprise at the lantern and the midnight
visitors.
</p><p>By this time the Wondersmith had performed the mysterious
manipulations with the bottle, and the manikins were once more in
full motion, swarming out of their box, sword and dagger in hand,
with their little black eyes glittering fiercely, and their white
teeth shining.  The little creatures seemed to scent their prey.
The gypsies stood in the centre of the shop, watching the
proceedings eagerly, while the Liliputians made in a body towards
the wall and commenced climbing from cage to cage.  Then was heard
a tremendous flittering of wings, and faint, despairing "quirks"
echoed on all sides.  In almost every cage there was a fierce
manikin thrusting his sword
<pb n="475"/>
or dagger vigorously into the
body of some unhappy bird.  It recalled the antique legend of the
battles of the Pygmies and the Cranes.  The poor love-birds lay
with their emerald feathers dabbled in their hearts' blood,
shoulder to shoulder in death as in life.  Canaries gasped at the
bottom of their cages, while the water in their little glass
fountains ran red.  The bullfinches wore an unnatural crimson on
their breasts.  The mocking-bird lay on his back, kicking
spasmodically, in the last agonies, with a tiny sword-thrust
cleaving his melodious throat in twain, so that from the instrument
which used to gush with wondrous music only scarlet drops of blood
now trickled.  The manikins were ruthless.  Their faces were ten
times wickeder than ever, as they roamed from cage to cage,
slaughtering with a fury that seemed entirely unappeasable.
Presently the feathery rustlings became fewer and fainter, and the
little pipings of despair died away; and in every cage lay a poor
murdered minstrel, with the song that abode within him forever
quenched; &mdash; in every cage but two, and those two were high up on the
wall; and in each glared a pair of wild, white eyes; and an orange
beak, touch as steel, pointed threateningly down.  With the needles
which they grasped as swords all wet and warm with blood, and their
beadlike eyes flashing in the light of the lantern, the Liliputian
assassins swarmed up the cages in two separate bodies, until they
reached the wickets of the habitations in which the Minos abode.
Mino saw them coming, &mdash; had listened attentively to the many death-struggles of his comrades, and had, in fact, smelt a rat.
Accordingly he was ready for the manikins.  There he stood at the
barbican of his castle, with formidable beak couched like a lance.
The manikins made a gallant charge.  "What'll you take?" was
rattled out by the Mino, in a deep bass, as with one plunge of his
sharp bill he scattered the ranks of the enemy, and sent three of
them flying to the floor, where they lay with broken limbs.  But
the manikins were brave automata, and again they closed and charged
the gallant Mino.  Again the wicked white eyes of the bird gleamed,
and again the orange bill dealt destruction.  Everything seemed to
be going on swimmingly for Mino, when he found himself attacked in
the rear by two treacherous manikins, who had stolen upon him from
behind, through the lattice-work of the cage.  Quick as lightning
the Mino turned to repel this assault, but all too late; two
slender quivering threads of steel crossed in his poor body, and he
staggered into a corner of the cage.  His white eyes closed, then
opened; a shiver passed over his body, beginning at his shoulder-tips and dying off in the extreme tips of the wings; he gasped as
if for air, and then, with a convulsive shudder, which ruffled all
his feathers, croaked out feebly his little speech, "What'll you
take?"  Instantly from the opposite corner came the old response,
still feebler than the question, &mdash; a mere gurgle, as it were, of
"Brandy and water."  Then all was silent.  The Mino-birds were
dead.
</p><p>"They spill blood like Christians," said the Wondersmith,
gazing fondly on the manikins.  "They will be famous assassins."
</p>

<head>TIED UP.</head>

<p>HERR HIPPE stood in the doorway, scowling.  His eyes seemed to
scorch the poor hunchback, whose form, physically inferior,
crouched before that baneful, blazing glance, while his head,
mentally brave, reared itself, as if to redeem the cowardice of the
frame to which it belonged.  So the attitude of the serpent: the
body pliant, yielding, supple; but the crest thrown aloft, erect,
and threatening.  As for Zonela, she was frozen in the attitude of
motion; &mdash; a dancing nymph in colored marble; agility stunned;
elasticity petrified.
</p><p>Furbelow, astonished at this sudden change, and catching, with
all the mysterious rapidity of instinct peculiar to the lower
animals, at the enigmatical character
<pb n="476"/>
of the situation,
turned his pleading, melancholy eyes from one to another of the
motionless three, as if begging that his humble intellect (pardon
me, naturalists, for the use of this word "intellect" in the matter
of a monkey!) should be enlightened as speedily as possible.  Not
receiving the desired information, he, after the manner of trained
animals, returned to his muttons; in other words, he conceived that
this unusual entrance, and consequent dramatic <hi rend="italic">tableau</hi>, meant
"shop."  He therefore dropped Zonela's hand and pattered on his
velvety little feet over towards the grim figure of the
Wondersmith, holding out his poor little paw for the customary
copper.  He had but one idea drilled into him, &mdash; soulless creature
that he was, &mdash; and that was, alms.  But I have seen creatures that
professed to have souls, and that would have been indignant, if you
had denied them immortality, who took to the soliciting of alms as
naturally as if beggary had been the original sin, and was
regularly born with them, and never baptized out of them.  I will
give these Bandits of the Order of Charity this credit, however,
that they knew the best highways and the richest founts of
benevolence, &mdash; unlike to Furbelow, who, unreasoning and
undiscriminating, begged from the first person that was near.
Burbelow, owing to this intellectual inferiority to the before-mentioned Alsatians, frequently got more kicks than coppers, and
the present supplication which he indulged in towards the
Wondersmith was a terrible confirmation of the rule.  The reply to
the extended pleading paw was what might be called a double-barrelled kick, &mdash; a kick to be represented by the power of two when
the foot touched the object, multiplied by four when the entire leg
formed an angle of 45 deg. with the spinal column.  The long,
nervous leg of the Wondersmith caught the little creature in the
centre of the body, doubled up his brown, hairy form, till he
looked like a fur driving-glove, and sent him whizzing across the
room into a far corner, where he dropped senseless and flaccid.
</p><p>This vengeance which Herr Hippe executed upon Furbelow seemed
to have operated as a sort of escape-valve, and he found voice.  He
hissed out the question, "Who are you?" to the hunchback; and in
listening to that essence of sibilation, it really seemed as if it
proceeded from the serpent that curled upon his upper lip.
</p><p>"Who are you?  Deformed dog, who are you?  What do you here?"
</p><p>"My name is Solon," answered the fearless head of the
hunchback, while the frail, cowardly body shivered and trembled
inch by inch into a corner.
</p><p>"So you come to visit my daughter in the night-time, when I am
away?" continued the Wondersmith, with a sneering tone that dropped
from his snake-wreathed mouth like poison.  "You are a brave and
gallant lover, are you not?  Where did you win that Order of the
Curse of God that decorates your shoulders?  The women turn their
heads and look after you in the street, when you pass, do they not?
lost in admiration of that symmetrical figure, those graceful
limbs, that neck pliant as the stem that moors the lotus!  Elegant,
conquering Christian cripple, what do you here in my daughter's
room?"
</p><p>Can you imagine Jove, limitless in power and wrath, hurling
from his vast grasp mountain after mountain upon the struggling
Enceladus, &mdash; and picture the Titan sinking, sinking, deeper and
deeper into the earth, crushed and dying, with nothing visible
through the super-incumbent masses of Pelion and Ossa, but a
gigantic head and two flaming eyes, that, despite the death which
is creeping through each vein, still flash back defiance to the
divine enemy?  Well, Solon and Herr Hippe presented such a picture,
seen through the wrong end of a telescope, &mdash; reduced in proportion,
but alike in action.  Solon's feeble body seemed to sink into utter
annihilation beneath the horrible taunts that his enemy hurled at
him, while the large, brave brow and unconquered eyes still sent
forth a magnetic resistance.
</p><p>Suddenly the poor hunchback felt his
<pb n="477"/>
arm grasped.  A
thrill seemed to run through his entire body.  A warm atmosphere,
invigorating and full of delicious odor, surrounded him.  It
appeared as if invisible bandages were twisted all about his limbs,
giving him a strange strength.  His sinking legs straightened.  His
powerless arms were braced.  Astonished, he glanced round for an
instant, and beheld Zonela, with a world of love burning in her
large lambent eyes, wreathing her round white arms about his humped
shoulders.  Then the poet knew the great sustaining power of love.
Solon reared himself boldly.
</p><p>"Sneer at my poor form," he cried, in strong vibrating tones,
flinging out one long arm and one thin finger at the Wondersmith,
as if he would have impaled him like a beetle.  "Humiliate me, if
you can.  I care not.  You are a wretch, and I am honest and pure.
This girl is not your daughter.  You are like one of those demons
in the fairy tales that held beauty and purity locked in infernal
spells.  I do not fear you, Herr Hippe.  There are stories abroad
about you in the neighborhood, and when you pass, people say that
they feel evil and blight hovering over their thresholds.  You
persecute this girl.  You are her tyrant.  You hate her.  I am a
cripple.  Providence has cast this lump upon my shoulders.  But
that is nothing.  The camel, that is the salvation of the children
of the desert, has been given his hump in order that he might bear
his human burden better.  This girl, who is homeless as the Arab,
is my appointed load in life, and, please God, I will carry her on
this back, hunched though it may be.  I have come to see her,
because I love her, &mdash; because she loves me.  You have no claim on
her; so I will take her from you."
</p><p>Quick as lightning, the Wondersmith had stridden a few paces,
and grasped the poor cripple, who was yet quivering with the
departing thunder of his passion.  He seized him in his bony,
muscular grasp, as he would have seized a puppet, and held him at
arm's length gasping and powerless; while Zonela, pale, breathless,
entreating, sank half-kneeling on the floor.
</p><p>"Your skeleton will be interesting to science when you are
dead, Mr. Solon," hissed the Wondersmith.  "But before I have the
pleasure of reducing you to an anatomy, which I will assuredly do,
I wish to compliment you on your power of penetration, or sources
of information; for I know not if you have derived your knowledge
from your own mental research or the efforts of others.  You are
perfectly correct in your statement, that this charming young
person, who day after day parades the streets with a barrel-organ
and a monkey, &mdash; the last unhappily indisposed at present, &mdash; listening
to the degrading jokes of ribald boys and depraved men, &mdash; you are
quite correct, Sir, in stating that she is not my daughter.  On the
contrary, she is the daughter of an Hungarian nobleman who had the
misfortune to incur my displeasure.  I had a son, crooked spawn of
a Christian! &mdash; a son, not like you, cankered, gnarled stump of life
that you are, &mdash; but a youth tall and fair and noble in aspect, as
became a child of one whose lineage makes Pharaoh modern, &mdash; a youth
whose foot in the dance was as swift and beautiful to look at as
the golden sandals of the sun when he dances upon the sea in
summer.  This youth was virtuous and good; and being of good race,
and dwelling in a country where his rank, gypsy as he was, was
recognized, he mixed with the proudest of the land.  One day he
fell in with this accursed Hungarian, a fierce drinker of that
Devil's blood called brandy.  My child until that hour had avoided
this bane of our race.  Generous wine he drank, because the soul of
the sun our ancestor palpitated in its purple waves.  But brandy,
which is fallen and accursed wine, as devils are fallen and
accursed angels, had never crossed his lips, until in an evil hour
he was reduced by this Christian hog, and from that day forth his
life was one fiery debauch, which set only in the black waves of
death.  I vowed vengeance on the destroyer of my child, and I kept
my
<pb n="478"/>
word.  I have destroyed <hi rend="italic">his</hi> child, &mdash; not compassed
her death, but blighted her life, steeped her in misery and
poverty, and now, thanks to the thousand devils, I have discovered
a new torture for her heart.  She thought to solace her life with
a love-episode!  Sweet little epicure that she was!  She shall have
her little crooked lover, shan't she?  Oh, yes!  She shall have
him, cold and stark and livid, with that great, black, heavy hunch,
which no back, however broad, can bear, Death, sitting between his
shoulders!"
</p><p>There was something so awful and demoniac in this entire
speech and the manner in which it was delivered, that it petrified
Zonela into a mere inanimate figure, whose eyes seemed unalterably
fixed on the fierce, cruel face of the Wondersmith.  As for Solon,
he was paralyzed in the grasp of his foe.  He heard, but could not
reply.  His large eyes, dilated with horror to far beyond their
ordinary size, expressed unutterable agony.
</p><p>The last sentence had hardly been hissed out by the gypsy when
he took from his pocket a long, thin coil of whipcord, which he
entangled in a complicated mesh around the cripple's body.  It was
not the ordinary binding of a prisoner.  The slender lash passed
and repassed in a thousand intricate folds over the powerless limbs
of the poor humpback.  When the operation was completed, he looked
as if he had been sewed from head to foot in some singularly
ingenious species of network.
</p><p>"Now, my pretty lop-sided little lover," laughed Herr Hippe,
flinging Solon over his shoulder, as a fisherman might fling a net-full of fish, "we will proceed to put you into your little cage
until your little coffin is quite ready.  Meanwhile we will lock up
your darling beggar-girl to mourn over your untimely end."
</p><p>So saying, he stepped from the room with his captive, and
securely locked the door behind him.
</p><p>When he had disappeared, the frozen Zonela thawed, and with a
shriek of anguish flung herself on the inanimate body of Furbelow.

<head>THE POISONING OF THE SWORDS.</head>

<p>IT was New Year's Eve, and eleven o'clock at night.  All over
this great land, and in every great city in the land, curly heads
were lying on white pillows, dreaming of the coming of the generous
Santa Claus.  Innumerable stockings hung by countless bedsides.
Visions of beautiful toys, passing in splendid pageantry through
myriads of dimly lit dormitories, made millions of little hearts
palpitate in sleep.  Ah! what heavenly toys those were that the
children of this soil beheld, that mystic night, in their dreams!
Painted cars with orchestral wheels, making music more delicious
than the roll of planets.  Agile men of cylindrical figure, who
sprang unexpectedly out of meek-looking boxes, with a supernatural
fierceness in their crimson cheeks and fur-whiskers.  Herds of
marvellous sheep, with fleeces as impossible as the one that Jason
sailed after; animals entirely indifferent to grass and water and
"rot" and "ticks."  Horses spotted with an astounding regularity,
and furnished with the most ingenious methods of locomotion.
Slender foreigners, attired in painfully short tunics, whose
existence passed in continually turning heels over head down a
steep flight of steps, at the bottom of which they lay in an
exhausted condition with dislocated limbs, until they were restored
to their former elevation, when they went at it again as if nothing
had happened.  Stately swans, that seemed to have a touch of the
ostrich in them; for they swam continually after a piece of iron
which was held before them, as if consumed with a ferruginous
hunger.  Whole farm-yards of roosters, whose tails curled the wrong
way, &mdash; a slight defect, that was, however, amply atoned for by the
size and brilliancy of their scarlet combs, which, it would appear,
Providence had intended for pen-wipers.  Pears, that, when applied
to youthful lips, gave forth sweet and inspiring sounds.  Regiments
of soldiers, that performed neat, but limited evolutions on
<pb n="479"/>
cross-jointed contractile battle-fields.  All these things,
idealized, transfigured, and illuminated by the powers and
atmosphere and colored lamps of Dreamland, did the millions of dear
sleeping children behold, the night of the New Year's Eve of which
I speak.
</p><p>It was on this night, when Time was preparing to shed his skin
and come out young and golden and glossy as ever, &mdash; when, in the
vast chambers of the universe, silent and infallible preparations
were making for the wonderful birth of the coming year, &mdash; when
mystic dews were secreted for his baptism, and mystic instruments
were tuned in space to welcome him, &mdash; it was at this holy and solemn
hour that the Wondersmith and his three gypsy companions sat in
close conclave in the little parlor before mentioned.
</p><p>There was a fire roaring in the grate.  On a table, nearly in
the centre of the room, stood a huge decanter of Port wine, that
glowed in the blaze which lit the chamber like a flask of crimson
fire.  On every side, piled in heaps, inanimate, but scowling with
the same old wondrous scowl, lay myriads of the manikins, all
clutching in their wooden hands their tiny weapons.  The
Wondersmith held in one hand a small silver bowl filled with a
green, glutinous substance, which he was delicately applying, with
the aid of a camel's-hair brush, to the tips of tiny swords and
daggers.  A horrible smile wandered over his sallow face, &mdash; a smile
as unwholesome in appearance as the sickly light that plays above
reeking graveyards.
</p><p>"Let us drink great draughts, brothers," he cried, leaving off
his strange anointment for a while, to lift a great glass, filled
with sparkling liquor, to his lips.  "Let us drink to our
approaching triumph.  Let us drink to the great poison, Macousha.
Subtle seed of Death, &mdash; swift hurricane that sweeps away Life, &mdash; vast
hammer that crushes brain and heart and artery with its resistless
weight, &mdash; I drink to it."
</p><p>"It is a noble decoction, Duke Balthazar," said the old
fortune-teller and mid-wife, Madame Filomel, nodding in her chair
as she swallowed her wine in great gulps.  "Where did you obtain
it?"
</p><p>"It is made," said the Wondersmith, swallowing another great
goblet-full of wine ere he replied, "in the wild woods of Guiana,
in silence and in mystery.  But one tribe of Indians, the Macoushi
Indians, know the secret.  It is simmered over fires built of
strange woods, and the maker of it dies in the making.  The place,
for a mile around the spot where it is fabricated, is shunned as
accursed.  Devils hover over the pot in which it stews; and the
birds of the air, scenting the smallest breath of its vapor from
far away, drop to earth with paralyzed wings, cold and dead."
</p><p>"It kills, then, fast?" asked Kerplonne, the artificial
eyemaker, &mdash; his own eyes gleaming, under the influence of the wine,
with a sinister lustre, as if they had been fresh from the factory,
and were yet untarnished by use.
</p><p>"Kills?" echoed the Wondersmith, derisively; "it is swifter
than thunderbolts, stronger than lightning.  But you shall see it
proved before we let forth our army on the city accursed.  You
shall see a wretch die, as if smitten by a falling fragment of the
sun."
</p><p>"What?  Do you mean Solon?" asked Oaksmith and the fortune-teller together.
</p><p>"Ah! you mean the young man who makes the commerce with
books?" echoed Kerplonne.  "It is well.  His agonies will instruct
us."
</p><p>"Yes!  Solon," answered Hippe, with a savage accent.  "I hate
him, and he shall die this horrid death.  Ah! how the little
fellows will leap upon him, when I bring him in, bound and
helpless, and give their beautiful wicked souls to them!  How they
will pierce him in ten thousand spots with their poisoned weapons,
until his skin turns blue and violet and crimson, and his form
swells with the venom, &mdash; until his hump is lost in shapeless flesh!
He hears what I say, every word of it.  He is in the closet next
door, and is listening.
<pb n="480"/>
How comfortable he feels!  How the
sweat of terror rolls on his brow!  How he tries to loosen his
bonds, and curses all earth and heaven when he finds that he
cannot!  Ho! ho!  Handsome lover of Zonela, will she kiss you when
you are livid and swollen?  Brothers, let us drink again, &mdash; drink
always.  Here, Oaksmith, take these brushes, &mdash; and you, Filomel, &mdash;
and finish the anointing of these swords.  This wine is grand.
This poison is grand.  It is fine to have good wine to drink, and
good poison to kill with; is it not?" and, with flushed face and
rolling eyes, the Wondersmith continued to drink and use his brush
alternately.
</p><p>The others hastened to follow his example.  It was a horrible
scene: those four wicked faces; those myriads of tiny faces, just
as wicked; the certain unearthly air that pervaded the apartment;
the red, unwholesome glare cast by the fire; the wild and reckless
way in which the weird company drank the red-illumined wine.
</p><p>The anointing of the swords went on rapidly, and the wine went
as rapidly down the throats of the four poisoners.  Their faces
grew more and more inflamed each instant; their eyes shone like
rolling fireballs; their hair was moist and dishevelled.  The old
fortune-teller rocked to and fro in her chair, like those legless
plaster figures that sway upon convex loaded bottoms.  All four
began to mutter incoherent sentences, and babble unintelligible
wickednesses.  Still the anointing of the swords went on.
</p><p>"I see the faces of millions of young corpses," babbled Herr
Hippe, gazing, with swimming eyes, into the silver bowl that
contained the Macousha poison, &mdash; "all young, all Christians, &mdash; and
the little fellows dancing, dancing, and stabbing, stabbing.
Filomel, Filomel, I say!"
</p><p>"Well, Grand Duke," snored the old woman, giving a violent
lurch.
</p><p>"Where's the bottle of souls?"
</p><p>"In my right-hand pocket, Herr Hippe"; and she felt, so as to
assure herself that it was there.  She half drew out the black
bottle, before described in this narrative, and let it slide again
into her pocket, &mdash; let it slide again, but it did not completely
regain its former place.  Caught by some accident, it hung half
out, swaying over the edge of the pocket, as the fat midwife rolled
backwards and forwards in her drunken efforts at equilibrium.
</p><p>"All right," said Herr Hippe, "perfectly right!  Let's drink."
</p><p>He reached out his hand for his glass, and, with a dull sigh,
dropped on the table, in the instantaneous slumber of intoxication.
Oaksmith soon fell back in his chair, breathing heavily.  Kerplonne
followed.  And the heavy, stertorous breathing of Filomel told that
she slumbered also; but still her chair retained its rocking
motion, and still the bottle of souls balanced itself on the edge
of her pocket.
</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="7" id="d9">
<head>LET LOOSE.</head>

<p>SURE enough, Solon heard every word of the fiendish talk of
the Wondersmith.  For how many days he had been shut up, bound in
the terrible net, in that dark closet, he did not know; but now he
felt that his last hour was come.  His little strength was
completely worn out in efforts to disentangle himself.  Once a day
a door opened, and Herr Hippe placed a crust of bread and a cup of
water within his reach.  On this meagre fare he had subsisted.  It
was a hard life; but, bad as it was, it was better than the
horrible death that menaced him.  His brain reeled with terror at
the prospect of it.  Then, where was Zonela?  Why did she not come
to his rescue?  But she was, perhaps, dead.  The darkness, too,
appalled him.  A faint light, when the moon was bright, came at
night through a chink far up in the wall; and the only other hole
in the chamber was an aperture through which, at some former time,
a stove-pipe had been passed.  Even if he were free, there would
have been small hope of escape; but, laced as it were in a network
of steel, what was to be done?  He groaned and writhed upon
<pb n="481"/>
the floor, and tore at the boards with his hands, which were free
from the wrists down.  All else was as solidly laced up as an
Indian papoose.  Nothing but pride kept him from shrieking aloud,
when, on the night of New Year's Eve, he heard the fiendish Hippe
recite the programme of his murder.
</p><p>While he was thus wailing and gnashing his teeth in darkness
and torture, he heard a faint noise above his head.  Then something
seemed to leap from the ceiling and alight softly on the floor.  He
shuddered with terror.  Was it some new torture of the
Wondersmith's invention?  The next moment, he felt some small
animal crawling over his body, and a soft, silky paw was pushed
timidly across his face.  His heart leaped with joy.
</p><p>"It is Furbelow!" he cried.  "Zonela has sent him.  He came
through the stove-pipe hole."
</p><p>It was Furbelow, indeed, restored to life by Zonela's care,
and who had come down a narrow tube, that no human being could have
threaded, to console the poor captive.  The monkey nestled closely
into the hunchback's bosom, and, as he did so, Solon felt something
cold and hard hanging from his neck.  He touched it.  It was sharp.
By the dim light that struggled through the aperture high up in the
wall, he discovered a knife, suspended by a bit of cord.  Ah! how
the blood came rushing through the veins that crossed over and
through his heart, when life and liberty came to him in this bit of
rusty steel!  With his manacled hands he loosened the heaven-sent
weapon; a few cuts were rapidly made in the cunning network of cord
that enveloped his limbs, and in a few seconds he was free! &mdash;
cramped and faint with hunger, but free! &mdash; free to move, to use the
limbs that God had given him for his preservation, &mdash; free to fight, &mdash;
to die fighting, perhaps, &mdash; but still to die free.  He ran to the
door.  The bolt was a weak one, for the Wondersmith had calculated
more surely on his prison of cords than on any jail of stone, &mdash; and
more; and with a few efforts the door opened.  He went cautiously
out into the darkness, with Furbelow perched on his shoulder,
pressing his cold muzzle against his cheek.  He had made but a few
steps when a trembling hand was put into his, and in another moment
Zonela's palpitating heart was pressed against his own.  One long
kiss, an embrace, a few whispered words, and the hunchback and the
girl stole softly towards the door of the chamber in which the four
gypsies slept.  All seemed still; nothing but the hard breathing of
the sleepers, and the monotonous rocking of Madame Filomel's chair
broke the silence.  Solon stooped down and put his eye to the
keyhole, through which a red bar of light streamed into the entry.
As he did so, his foot crushed some brittle substance that lay just
outside the door; at the same moment a howl of agony was heard to
issue from the room within.  Solon started; nor did he know that at
that instant he had crushed into dust Monsieur Kerplonne's
supernumerary eye, and the owner, though wrapt in a drunken sleep,
felt the pang quiver through his brain.
</p><p>While Solon peeped through the keyhole, all in the room was
motionless.  He had not gazed, however, for many seconds, when the
chair of the fortune-teller gave a sudden lurch, and the black
bottle, already hanging half out of her wide pocket, slipped
entirely from its resting-place, and, falling heavily to the
ground, shivered into fragments.
</p><p>Then took place an astonishing spectacle.  The myriads of
armed dolls, that lay in piles about the room, became suddenly
imbued with motion.  They stood up straight, their tiny limbs
moved, their black eyes flashed with wicked purposes, their thread-like swords gleamed as they waved them to and fro.  The villanous
souls imprisoned in the bottle began to work within them.  Like the
Liliputians, when they found the giant Gulliver asleep, they scaled
in swarms the burly sides of the four sleeping gypsies.  At every
step they took, they drove their thin swords and quivering daggers
into the flesh of the drunken authors of their
<pb n="482"/>
being.  To
stab and kill was their mission, and they stabbed and killed with
incredible fury.  They clustered on the Wondersmith's sallow cheeks
and sinewy throat, piercing every portion with their diminutive
poisoned blades.  Filomel's fat carcass was alive with them.  They
blackened the spare body of Monsieur Kerplonne.  They covered
Oaksmith's huge form like a cluster of insects.
</p><p>Overcome completely with the fumes of wine, these tiny wounds
did not for a few moments awaken the sleeping victims.  But the
swift and deadly poison Macousha, with which the weapons had been
so fiendishly anointed, began to work.  Herr Hippe, stung into
sudden life, leaped to his feet, with a dwarf army clinging to his
clothes and his hands, &mdash; always stabbing, stabbing, stabbing.  For
an instant, a look of stupid bewilderment clouded his face; then
the horrible truth burst upon him.  He gave a shriek like that
which a horse utters when he finds himself fettered and surrounded
by fire, &mdash; a shriek that curdled the air for miles and miles.
</p><p>"Oaksmith!  Kerplonne!  Filomel!  Awake! awake!  We are lost!
The souls have got loose!  We are dead! poisoned!  Oh, accursed
ones!  Oh, demons, ye are slaying me!  Ah! fiends of Hell!"
</p><p>Aroused by these frightful howls, the three gypsies sprang
also to their feet, to find themselves stung to death by the
manikins.  They raved, they shrieked, they swore.  They staggered
round the chamber.  Blinded in the eyes by the ever-stabbing
weapons, &mdash; with the poison already burning in their veins like red-hot lead, &mdash; their forms swelling and discoloring visibly every
moment, &mdash; their howls and attitudes and furious gestures made the
scene look like a chamber in Hell.
</p><p>Maddened beyond endurance, the Wondersmith, half-blind and
choking with the venom that had congested all the blood-vessels of
his body, seized dozens of the manikins and dashed them into the
fire, trampling them down with his feet.
</p><p>"Ye shall die too, if I die," he cried, with a roar like that
of a tiger.  "Ye shall burn, if I burn.  I gave ye life, &mdash; I give ye
death.  Down! &mdash; down! &mdash; burn! &mdash; flame!  Fiends that ye are, to slay
us!  Help me, brothers!  Before we die, let us have our revenge!"
</p><p>On this, the other gypsies, themselves maddened by approaching
death, began hurling manikins, by handfuls, into the fire.  The
little creatures, being wooden of body, quickly caught the flames,
and an awful struggle for life took place in miniature in the
grate.  Some of them escaped from between the bars and ran about
the room, blazing, writhing in agony, and igniting the curtains and
other draperies that hung around.  Others fought and stabbed one
another in the very core of the fire, like combating salamanders.
Meantime, the motions of the gypsies grew more languid and slow,
and their curses were uttered in choked guttural tones.  The faces
of all four were spotted with red and green and violet, like so
many egg-plants.  Their bodies were swollen to a frightful size,
and at last they dropped on the floor, like over-ripe fruit shaken
from the boughs by the winds of autumn.
</p><p>The chamber was now a sheet of fire.  The flames roared round
and round, as if seeking for escape, licking every projecting
cornice and sill with greedy tongues, as the serpent licks his prey
before he swallows it.  A hot, putrid breath came through the
keyhole and smote Solon and Zonela like a wind of death.  They
clasped each other's hands with a moan of terror, and fled from the
house.
</p><p>The next morning, when the young Year was just unclosing its
eyes, and the happy children all over the great city were peeping
from their beds into the myriads of stockings hanging near by, the
blue skies of heaven shone through a black network of stone and
charred rafters.  These were all that remained of the habitation of
Herr Hippe, the Wondersmith.
