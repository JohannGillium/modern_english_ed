<div1 type="story" id="d3"><pb n="118"/>   <head>EXILED TO SIBERIA. 
<lb/> 
BY COUNT LEON TOLSTOI.</head> 
 
<p>"God knows the truth, but he does not at once make it 
manifest."</p> 
 
<p>     IN the city of Vladimir lived a young merchant named Askenov.  
He owned two stores and a dwelling-house.</p> 
 
<p>     Askenov was attractive in person, blonde, curly-headed, and a 
lover of jollity and song.  He drank in his youth, and when 
intoxicated he quarreled.  But when once married he drank very 
rarely.</p> 
 
<p>     One day in summer he decided to attend the fair at Nijni-Novogorod.  As he was bidding his family farewell, his wife said to 
him:</p> 
 
<p>     "Ivan, do not go to-day; I had a bad dream about you."</p> 
 
<p>     Askenov began to laugh, and replied:</p> 
 
<p>     "You fear I will commit some folly at the fair."</p> 
 
<p>     His wife answered: "I do not myself exactly know what I fear; 
only I had a bad dream.  I saw you as you came from the city.  You 
took off your cap, and all at once I saw that your head was quite 
white."</p> 
<p>     Askenov began to laugh more cheerily still.  "Ah well! it is 
a good sign," he said.  "I shall do a good business, and will bring 
you a beautiful present."</p> 
<p>     So he took leave of his family and departed. 
     Midway in his journey he met an acquaintance, a merchant, with 
whom he lodged that night.  They drank tea together, and went to 
sleep in adjoining rooms.</p> 
<p>     Askenov was not a heavy sleeper.  He awoke in the middle of 
the night, and, to travel more comfortably in the coolness of the 
morning, aroused the postilion, and ordered him to put the horses 
before the wagon.  Then he entered the dim office, paid the 
landlord, and went away.</p> 
<p>     After having traveled forty miles, he stopped again to feed 
the horses, rested himself at the hotel, went out upon the door-step and had his samovar prepared.  He took a guitar and began to 
play.  All at once a <hi rend="italic"> troika</hi> with its gong arrives.  A state 
functionary with two soldiers descends, approaches Askenov, and 
inquires of him who he is and whither he is going.  Askenov excuses 
himself from replying, but asks him to take some tea.  The 
official, however, continues to press his questions.  Where had he 
slept the night before?  Was he alone with the merchant?  Why had 
he left the inn so precipitantly?</p> 
<p>     Askenov, surprised by these interrogatories, related what had 
taken place, then said: "Why do you ask me so many questions?  I am 
neither a thief nor a brigand.  I am traveling on my own business, 
and no one has a right to question me."</p> 
<p>     The official then called his soldiers and replied: "I am a 
police commissioner, and if I question you it is because the 
merchant with whom you passed the night was murdered.  Show your 
baggage&mdash;and you others, search it."</p> 
<p>     They entered the hotel-office, took his trunk and satchel, 
opened them, and in the latter found a knife.</p> 
<p>     The officer exclaimed, "Whose is this knife?" 
     Askenov turned to look, saw a blade covered with blood, and 
became terror-stricken.</p> 
<p>     "And why this blood on the knife?"</p> 
<p>     Askenov tried to reply, but he could not utter a word.</p> 
<p>     "I&mdash;I do not know&mdash;I&mdash;  A knife&mdash;I&mdash;  It is not mine," he 
stammered at last.</p> 
<p>     The police commissioner said: "This morning the merchant was 
found murdered in bed.  No one except yourself could have committed 
the crime.  The rooms were locked from the inside, and within was 
no one but you and he.  Moreover, a knife covered with blood has 
been found in your bag.  Besides, your crime can be read in your 
face.  Confess at once how you killed him, and how much money you 
stole."</p> 
<p>     Askenov called God to witness that he was not guilty; that he 
had not seen the merchant after having taken tea with him; that he 
had only his own money, eight thousand roubles, and that the knife 
was not his. <pb n="119"/>  But his voice was husky, his face had become 
pale, and he trembled like a criminal.</p> 
<p>     The officer called his soldiers, and ordered them to bind him 
and place him in the carriage.  When they had done so, Askenov, 
with his feet in irons, crossed himself and began to weep.  They 
took away all his effects, with his money, and put him in prison in 
the neighboring city.</p> 
<p>     An inquest was held at Vladimir.  All the merchants and 
inhabitants declared that Askenov, though he had been in the habit 
of drinking and amusing himself when a young man, was regarded as 
an honorable person.  Then the matter came before the courts.  He 
was accused of having murdered the merchant Riazan, and of having 
robbed him of twenty thousand roubles.</p> 
<p>     His wife was in despair, and knew not what to think.  Her 
children were all small, one of them still at the breast.  She took 
them all with her, and went to the city where her husband was 
imprisoned.  At first they refused to let her see him; but as she 
insisted, she was allowed that privilege.  When she saw him in his 
prison clothes, shackled, mingling with robbers, she fell to the 
ground, and some time passed before she came to herself again.  
Then she gathered her children about her, seated herself by 
Askenov's side, told him of what was going on at home, and asked 
him to relate how his misfortune had come about.  He told her all, 
and she asked:</p> 
<p>     "What is to be done now?"</p> 
<p>     "We must supplicate the Czar," he replied; "for it can not be 
that the innocent should be punished."</p> 
<p>     His wife then told him that she had already sent a petition to 
the Czar; "but it could not have been sent to him," she said.</p> 
<p>     Askenov made no reply, and remained overwhelmed.</p> 
<p>     His wife said: "My dream was not in vain.  Do you remember it?  
I saw you with white hair.  It will now become white with grief.  
You ought not to have gone that time."</p> 
<p>     She began to stroke his hair with her hand, and said:</p> 
<p>     "My dear Ivan, speak the truth to your wife.  Was it not you 
who killed him?"</p> 
<p>     "Askenov replied: "And you, also, think so!"  He hid his face 
in his hands and wept.</p> 
<p>     A soldier appeared.  He told the wife and children that it was 
time for them to go, and Askenov bade his family farewell for the 
last time.</p> 
<p>     When his wife was gone he mentally reviewed his conversation 
with her.  Recollecting that she also had asked him if he had not 
murdered the merchant, he said to himself: "God alone knows the 
truth.  Him I must implore.  I will await his mercy."  And from 
that moment he ceased to ask for human aid, lifted up his soul in 
hope, and prayed continually to God.</p> 
<p>     Askenov was sentenced to the knout, and then to hard labor for 
life.  The sentence was carried out.  He was beaten with the knout, 
and when his wounds were healed they sent him, with other life 
convicts, to Siberia.</p> 
<p>     There Askenov remained at hard labor for twenty-six years.  
His hair became white as snow, and his long gray beard hung limply 
from his face.  All his gayety disappeared.  He began to stoop and 
to lag in his gait.  He spoke but little, and never laughed.  He 
frequently prayed to God.</p> 
<p>     In prison he learned to make shoes, and with the money thus 
earned bought a book of martyrs, which he read when there was light 
in his dungeon.  On festal days he attended the prison chapel, read 
the Apostles, and sang in the choir.  He never lost his beautiful 
voice.  The officials loved him for his docility; his companions 
held him in high regard, called him "grandfather" and "man of God."  
When the convicts demanded any thing, it was always Askenov who was 
made to present their request.  When the prisoners quarreled, it 
was again Askenov whom they chose as arbitrator.  No one wrote him 
from home, and Askenov knew not whether his wife and children were 
still living.</p> 
<p>     One day new convicts were taken to the prison.  In the evening 
the old ones asked of the new from what cities or villages they 
came, and for what causes.  Askenov also approached, and with 
inclined head listened to what was said.  One of the new convicts 
was an old man of sixty years, tall in stature, and with a gray, 
trimmed beard.  He related the reasons for his doom.</p> 
<p>     "It is thus, my brothers," he said, "they have sent me here 
for nothing.  I detached a horse from a sleigh; they seized me, 
saying <pb n="120"/>  I stole it.  And I&mdash;I replied: 'I only wished to 
travel more rapidly; you see indeed that I have let the horse 
loose.  No crime has been committed.'  'No,' they said; 'you have 
stolen it,' but they knew neither where nor when I had stolen it.  
To be sure I was guilty of misdeeds, which ought to have sent me 
here long before, but they could never surprise me in the act.  And 
now they have brought me here contrary to all law.  Now, listen.  
I have already been in Siberia.  But I did not remain here long."</p> 
<p>     "Whence do you come?" asked one of the convicts.</p> 
<p>     "I am from the city of Vladimir.  I am a small shopkeeper of 
that place.  My name is Makar."</p> 
<p>     Askenov raised his head and asked: "Have you not heard the 
merchant Askenov spoken of at Vladimir?  Are they still alive?"</p> 
<p>     "Why, to be sure.  But they are rich merchants, although their 
father is in Siberia: he must have sinned like the rest of us."</p> 
<p>     Askenov did not like to speak on the subject of his 
misfortune.  He sighed and said: "It is for my sins that I have 
been in prison twenty-six years."</p> 
<p>     Makar asked, "For what sins?"</p> 
<p>     "I merit my punishment," responded Askenov, simply.</p> 
<p>     He would say nothing more.  But the other convicts related to 
the newly-arrived why Askenov found himself in Siberia; how some 
one, during the journey, had murdered the merchant and placed a 
bloody knife among Askenov's baggage; and how, by reason of that, 
he had been unjustly condemned.</p> 
<p>     In hearing this, Makar cast a glance upon Askenov, struck his 
knees with his hands, and exclaimed:</p> 
<p>     "Oh, what a wonder!  This is a miracle.  Ah, you have grown 
quite old, grandfather!"</p> 
<p>     They asked why he was so astonished; where he had seen 
Askenov.  But Makar did not reply; he merely said: "It is a 
miracle, brothers, that fate has re-united us here."</p> 
<p>     These expressions convinced Askenov that this man must be the 
assassin, and he said to him: "Have you heard this affair spoken of 
before, Maker [sic]; or have you indeed seen me elsewhere than 
here?"</p> 
<p>     "What?  I have heard it spoken of.  The earth is full of 
ears.<note n="1"><p>A Russian proverb.</p></note>   
 
But it is a long time since that affair took place, and I 
have forgotten the particulars they told me." 
</p> 
<p> "Perhaps you learned who killed the merchant?" asked Askenov.</p> 
<p>     Makar began to laugh, and said: "As it was in your bag the 
knife was found, you doubtless killed him yourself.  If it should 
be that some one else put the knife there&mdash;why, not caught, not a 
thief.  And, moreover, how could he have placed the knife in your 
bag?  You had it under your head.  You must have heard."</p> 
<p>     On hearing these words, Askenov perceived clearly that he was 
the person who had killed the merchant.  He arose and went away.  
All that night Askenov could not sleep.  He fell into profound 
listlessness, and dreamed dreams.  Now it was his wife he saw as 
she appeared at the time of that last fair.  He saw her still 
alive, her face, her eyes; he heard her speak and laugh: now it was 
his children who appeared to him as they then were, all small, one 
in a fur cloak and the other at the breast.  He saw himself as he 
then was, young, lively, seated and playing the guitar on the 
doorstep of the tavern, where he was arrested.  And he was reminded 
of the infamous place where they had whipped him, of the 
executioner, of the crowd round about, the irons, convicts, and of 
the twenty-six years he had spent in prison.  He thought of his old 
age, and a desire to take his own life seized upon Askenov.</p> 
<p>     "And all this on account of that brigand!" he thought.</p> 
<p>     He felt such a passion of wrath against Makar coming over him, 
that he would have been willing to perish that hour could he be 
revenged upon him.  He prayed all night without being able to calm 
himself.  The next morning he did not approach nor look at Makar.</p> 
<p>     Fifteen days passed thus.  Askenov could not sleep at night, 
and during the day he felt such a weariness that he knew not what 
to do with himself.  One night, as he was walking up and down in 
the prison, he perceived that earth was being thrown from under one 
of the planks used as a bed.  He stopped to see what was going on, 
and all at once Makar came quickly from beneath the <pb n="121"/>  bed, 
and looked at Askenov with an expression of terror.  The latter 
wished to pass on so as to avoid looking at him; but Makar seized 
him by the hand, and told him how he was digging a tunnel under the 
wall, how he was in the habit of filling his boots with the earth 
thrown up and emptying it in the street every morning when they 
were taken out to work.  He added:</p> 
<p>     "Only keep quiet, old man.  I will take you with me.  If you 
expose me I will be whipped to the last extremity, but you will pay 
for it.  I will kill you!"</p> 
<p>     Looking at him who had ruined him, Askenov trembled with 
anger.  He drew away his hand, and said: "I do not desire to 
escape, and you will have no need to murder me.  You have already 
killed me a long time ago.  Whether I shall expose you or not is 
for God to decide."</p> 
<p>     The next morning, when the convicts were taken to work, the 
soldiers noticed that Makar emptied earth from his boots.  An 
investigation was made in the prison, and the tunnel was 
discovered.  The overseer came and demanded to know who had 
excavated it.  Every body denied all knowledge of the matter.  
Those who knew, did not wish to betray Makar, as he would be 
whipped "half-dead" for his offense.  The chief then addressed 
himself to Askenov.</p> 
<p>     "Old man," he said, "you who are an upright fellow, tell me 
who has done this."</p> 
<p>     Makar remained impassible, looking at the superintendent 
without turning toward Askenov.  As to the latter, his arms and his 
legs trembled; he could not say a word.</p> 
<p>     "Shall I remain silent?" he thought.  "But why pardon him, 
since it is he who has ruined my life?  Let him pay for my 
tortures.  Shall I speak?  True, they will whip him nearly to 
death, and if it should not be he, if he should not be the assassin 
I suspect him to be&mdash;and then, would it be any solace to me?"</p> 
<p>     The chief repeated his demand.  Askenov looked at Makar, and 
replied:</p> 
<p>     "I cannot tell, your highness; God does not permit me, and I 
shall not tell you.  Do with me as you please.  You are master."</p> 
<p>     Notwithstanding every effort of the chief, Askenov said no 
more.  Thus it was that no one knew who had dug the tunnel.</p> 
<p>     The following night, as Askenov was reclining upon his plank-bed trying to sleep, he heard some one approach and place himself 
at his feet.  Through the obscurity he recognized Makar.  Askenov 
said to him:</p> 
<p>     "Have you still further need of me?  What are you doing 
there?"</p> 
<p>     Makar remained silent, and Askenov raised himself up saying: 
"What do you want?  Go away, or I will call the watchman."</p> 
<p>     Makar hung over Askenov and whispered in his ear: "Ivan 
Askenov, forgive me."</p> 
<p>     "Why?  What should I forgive you?"</p> 
<p>     "It was I who murdered the merchant, and I put the knife in 
your bag!  I intended to kill you also, but some one made a noise 
in the yard.  I placed the knife in your bag, and escaped by the 
window."</p> 
<p>     Askenov remained silent, and knew not what to say.</p> 
<p>     Makar slipped from the bed, prostrated himself on the earth, 
and said:</p> 
<p>     "Ivan Askenov, pardon me; in the name of God, pardon me!  I 
will declare that I killed the merchant; they will set you at 
liberty, and you can return home."</p> 
<p>     And Askenov replied: "That is easily said.  But I, I have 
suffered here too long.  Where should I go now?  My wife is dead; 
my children have forgotten me.  I have nowhere to go."</p> 
<p>     Makar, still prostrated and striking the earth with his head, 
said: "Ivan, pardon me.  If I had been beaten with the knout, that 
would have been less painful that [sic] to see you thus.  And you 
still had pity on me; you did not expose me.  Pardon me, in the 
name of Christ, pardon a wretched malefactor!"  And he began to 
sob.</p> 
<p>     Hearing Makar weeping, Askenov himself also began to weep.</p> 
<p>     "God will pardon you.  Perhaps I am a hundred times worse than 
you."</p> 
<p>     And he felt a sudden joy flooding his soul.  He ceased from 
that moment to grieve over his home, and no longer desired to leave 
his prison.  He thought only of his last hour.</p> 
<p>     Makar would not listen to Askenov, and declared himself the 
guilty one.  When the order came to restore Askenov to liberty, he 
was already dead.</p>
