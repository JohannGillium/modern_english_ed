AUTHOR'S FOREWORD

<div2 type="section" id="d10">


<p><lb/>
I FEAR the seemingly incredible
story which I am about to relate
will be regarded as the result of a
distorted intellect superinduced,
possibly, by the glamour of unveiling a
marvelous mystery, rather than a
truthful record of the unparalleled
experiences related by one Olaf
<pb n="11"/>
Jansen, whose eloquent madness so
appealed to my imagination that all
thought of an analytical criticism
has been effectually dispelled.
</p><p>
   Marco Polo will doubtless shift un
easily in his grave at the strange
story I am called upon to chronicle;
a story as strange as a Munchausen
tale. It is also incongruous that I,
a disbeliever, should be the one to
edit the story of Olaf Jansen, whose
name is now for the first time given
to the world, yet who must hereafter
rank as one of the notables of earth.
</p><p>
   I freely confess his statements
admit of no rational analysis, but have
to do with the profound mystery concerning
the frozen North that for centuries has
claimed the attention of scientists and
laymen alike.
<pb n="12"/>
</p><p>
   However much they are at variance
with the cosmographical manuscripts
of the past, these plain statements
may be relied upon as a record of the
things Olaf Jansen claims to have
seen with his own eyes.
</p><p>
   A hundred times I have asked myself
whether it is possible that the
world's geography is incomplete, and
that the startling narrative of Olaf
Jansen is predicated upon demonstrable
facts. The reader may be
able to answer these queries to his
own satisfaction, however far the
chronicler of this narrative may be
from having reached a conviction.
Yet sometimes even I am at a loss
to know whether I have been led away
from an abstract truth by the <hi rend="italic">ignes
fatui</hi> of a clever superstition, or
<pb n="13"/>
whether heretofore accepted facts are,
after all, founded upon falsity.
</p><p>
   It may be that the true home of
Apollo was not at Delphi, but in that
older earth-center of which Plato
speaks, where he says: "Apollo's
real home is among the Hyperboreans,
in a land of perpetual life,
where mythology tells us two doves
flying from the two opposite ends of
the world met in this fair region, the
home of Apollo. Indeed, according
to Hecat&aelig;us, Leto, the mother of
Apollo, was born on an island in the
Arctic Ocean far beyond the North
Wind."
</p><p>
   It is not my intention to attempt
a discussion of the theogony of the
deities nor the cosmogony of the
world. My simple duty is to
<pb n="14"/>
enlighten the world concerning a heretofore
unknown portion of the universe, as it was
seen and described by the old Norseman, Olaf
Jansen.
</p><p>
   Interest in northern research is
international. Eleven nations are
engaged in, or have contributed to, the
perilous work of trying to solve
Earth's one remaining cosmological
mystery.
</p><p>
   There is a saying, ancient as the
hills, that "truth is stranger than
fiction," and in a most startling manner
has this axiom been brought home
to me within the last fortnight.
</p><p>
   It was just two o'clock in the morning
when I was aroused from a restful
sleep by the vigorous ringing of my
door-bell. The untimely disturber
proved to be a messenger bearing a
<pb n="15"/>
note, scrawled almost to the point of
illegibility, from an old Norseman
by the name of Olaf Jansen. After
much deciphering, I made out the
writing, which simply said: "Am
ill unto death. Come." The call
was imperative, and I lost no time
in making ready to comply.
</p><p>
   Perhaps I may as well explain here
that Olaf Jansen, a man who quite
recently celebrated his ninety-fifth
birthday, has for the last half-dozen
years been living alone in an unpretentious
bungalow out Glendale way,
a short distance from the business
district of Los Angeles, California.
</p><p>
   It was less than two years ago,
while out walking one afternoon that
I was attracted by Olaf Jansen's
house and its homelike surroundings,
<pb n="16"/>
toward its owner and occupant, whom
I afterward came to know as a believer
in the ancient worship of Odin and Thor.
</p><p>
   There was a gentleness in his face,
and a kindly expression in the keenly
alert gray eyes of this man who had
lived more than four-score years and
ten; and, withal, a sense of loneliness
that appealed to my sympathy.
Slightly stooped, and with his hands
clasped behind him, he walked back
and forth with slow and measured
tread, that day when first we met. I
can hardly say what particular motive
impelled me to pause in my walk
and engage him in conversation. He
seemed pleased when I complimented
him on the attractiveness of his bungalow,
and on the well-tended vines
<pb n="17"/>
and flowers clustering in profusion
over its windows, roof and wide piazza.
</p><p>
   I soon discovered that my new
acquaintance was no ordinary person,
but one profound and learned to a
remarkable degree; a man who, in the
later years of his long life, had dug
deeply into books and become strong
in the power of meditative silence.
</p><p>
   I encouraged him to talk, and soon
gathered that he had resided only six
or seven years in Southern California,
but had passed the dozen years
prior in one of the middle Eastern
states. Before that he had been a
fisherman off the coast of Norway, in
the region of the Lofoden Islands,
from whence he had made trips still
<pb n="18"/>
farther north to Spitzbergen and
even to Franz Josef Land.
</p><p>
   When I started to take my leave,
he seemed reluctant to have me go,
and asked me to come again. Although
at the time I thought nothing
of it, I remember now that he made
a peculiar remark as I extended my
hand in leave-taking. "You will
come again?" he asked. "Yes, you
will come again some day. I am sure
you will; and I shall show you my
library and tell you many things of
which you have never dreamed,
things so wonderful that it may be
you will not believe me."
</p><p>
   I laughingly assured him that I
would not only come again, but would
be ready to believe whatever he might
<pb n="19"/>
choose to tell me of his travels and
adventures.
</p><p>
   In the days that followed I became
well acquainted with Olaf Jansen,
and, little by little, he told me his
story, so marvelous, that its very
daring challenges reason and belief.
The old Norseman always expressed
himself with so much earnestness and
sincerity that I became enthralled by
his strange narrations.
</p><p>
   Then came the messenger's call that
night, and within the hour I was at
Olaf Jansen's bungalow.
</p><p>
   He was very impatient at the long
wait, although after being summoned
I had come immediately to his bedside.
</p><p>
   "I must hasten," he exclaimed,
while yet he held my hand in greeting.
</p><pb n="20"/><p>
"I have much to tell you that
you know not, and I will trust no one
but you. I fully realize," he went on
hurriedly, "that I shall not survive
the night. The time has come to join
my fathers in the great sleep."
</p><p>
   I adjusted the pillows to make him
more comfortable, and assured him I
was glad to be able to serve him in
any way possible, for I was beginning
to realize the seriousness of his
condition.
</p><p>
   The lateness of the hour, the stillness
of the surroundings, the uncanny
feeling of being alone with the dying
man, together with his weird story,
all combined to make my heart beat
fast and loud with a feeling for which
I have no name. Indeed, there were
many times that night by the old
<pb n="21"/>
Norseman's couch, and there have
been many times since, when a sensation
rather than a conviction took
possession of my very soul, and I
seemed not only to believe in, but
actually see, the strange lands, the
strange people and the strange world
of which he told, and to hear the
mighty orchestral chorus of a thousand
lusty voices.
</p><p>
   For over two hours he seemed endowed
with almost superhuman
strength, talking rapidly, and to all
appearances, rationally. Finally he
gave into my hands certain data,
drawings and crude maps. "These,"
said he in conclusion, "I leave in
your hands. If I can have your
promise to give them to the world, I
shall die happy, because I desire that
<pb n="22"/>
people may know the truth, for then
all mystery concerning the frozen
Northland will be explained. There
is no chance of your suffering the
fate I suffered. They will not put
you in irons, nor confine you in a
mad-house, because you are not telling
your own story, but mine, and I,
thanks to the gods, Odin and Thor,
will be in my grave, and so beyond
the reach of disbelievers who would
persecute."
</p><p>
   Without a thought of the
far-reaching results the promise entailed,
or foreseeing the many sleepless
nights which the obligation has since
brought me, I gave my hand and with
it a pledge to discharge faithfully his
dying wish.
</p><p>
   As the sun rose over the peaks of
<pb n="23"/>
the San Jacinto, far to the eastward,
the spirit of Olaf Jansen, the navigator,
the explorer and worshiper of
Odin and Thor, the man whose experiences
and travels, as related, are
without a parallel in all the world's
history, passed away, and I was left
alone with the dead.
</p><p>
   And now, after having paid the last
sad rites to this strange man from the
Lofoden Islands, and the still farther
"Northward Ho!", the courageous
explorer of frozen regions, who in his
declining years (after he had passed
the four-score mark) had sought an
asylum of restful peace in sun-favored
California, I will undertake
to make public his story.
</p><p>
   But, first of all, let me indulge in
one or two reflections:
<pb n="24"/>
</p><p>
   Generation follows generation, and
the traditions from the misty past
are handed down from sire to son, but
for some strange reason interest in
the ice-locked unknown does not abate
with the receding years, either in the
minds of the ignorant or the tutored.
</p><p>
   With each new generation a restless
impulse stirs the hearts of men to capture
the veiled citadel of the Arctic,
the circle of silence, the land of
glaciers, cold wastes of waters and
winds that are strangely warm.
Increasing interest is manifested in the
mountainous icebergs, and marvelous
speculations are indulged in concerning
the earth's center of gravity, the
cradle of the tides, where the whales
have their nurseries, where the
magnetic needle goes mad, where the
<pb n="25"/>
Aurora Borealis illumines the night,
and where brave and courageous
spirits of every generation dare to
venture and explore, defying the dangers
of the "Farthest North."
</p><p>
   One of the ablest works of recent
years is "Paradise Found, or the
Cradle of The Human Race at the
North Pole," by William F. Warren.
In his carefully prepared volume,
Mr. Warren almost stubbed his toe
against the real truth, but missed it
seemingly by only a hair's breadth,
if the old Norseman's revelation be
true.
</p><p>
   Dr. Orville Livingston Leech,
scientist, in a recent article, says:
</p><q>
   <hi rend="italic">"The possibilities of a land inside
the earth were first brought to my
attention when I picked up a geode on</hi></q>
<pb n="26"/>
<q><hi rend="italic">the shores of the Great Lakes. The
geode is a spherical and apparently
solid stone, but when broken is found
to be hollow and coated with crystals.
The earth is only a larger form of
a geode, and the law that created the
geode in its hollow form undoubtedly
fashioned the earth in the same way</hi>."
</q><p>
   In presenting the theme of this
almost incredible story, as told by Olaf
Jansen, and supplemented by manuscript,
maps and crude drawings entrusted to me,
a fitting introduction
is found in the following quotation:
</p><p>
   "In the beginning God created the
heaven and the earth, and the earth
was without form and void." And
also, "God created man in his own
image." Therefore, even in things
material, man must be God-like,
<pb n="27"/>
because he is created in the likeness of
the Father.
</p><p>
   A man builds a house for himself
and family. The porches or verandas are
all without, and are secondary.
The building is really constructed for
the conveniences within.
</p><p>
   Olaf Jansen makes the startling
announcement through me, an humble
instrument, that in like manner, God
created the earth for the "within"&mdash;
that is to say, for its lands, seas,
rivers, mountains, forests and valleys,
and for its other internal conveniences,
while the outside surface of the earth
is merely the veranda, the porch, where
things grow by comparison but sparsely,
like the lichen on the mountain side,
clinging determinedly for bare existence.
<pb n="28"/>
</p><p>
   Take an egg-shell, and from each
end break out a piece as large as the
end of this pencil. Extract its contents,
and then you will have a perfect
representation of Olaf Jansen's
earth. The distance from the inside
surface to the outside surface, according
to him, is about three hundred
miles. The center of gravity is not
in the center of the earth, but in the
center of the shell or crust; therefore,
if the thickness of the earth's crust
or shell is three hundred miles, the
center of gravity is one hundred and
fifty miles below the surface.
</p><p>
   In their log-books Arctic explorers
tell us of the dipping of the needle
as the vessel sails in regions of the
farthest north known. In reality,
they are at the curve; on the edge of
<pb n="29"/>
the shell, where gravity is geometrically
increased, and while the electric current
seemingly dashes off into
space toward the phantom idea of the
North Pole, yet this same electric
current drops again and continues its
course southward along the inside
surface of the earth's crust.
</p><p>
   In the appendix to his work, Captain
Sabine gives an account of experiments
to determine the acceleration of the
pendulum in different latitudes. This
appears to have resulted from the joint
labor of Peary and Sabine. He says: "The
accidental discovery that a pendulum on
being removed from Paris to the
neighborhood of the equator increased
its time of vibration, gave the
first step to our present knowledge
<pb n="30"/>
that the polar axis of the globe is less
than the equatorial; that the force of
gravity at the surface of the earth
increases progressively from the equator
toward the poles."
</p><p>
   According to Olaf Jansen, in the
beginning this old world of ours was
created solely for the "within"
world, where are located the four
great rivers&mdash;the Euphrates, the
Pison, the Gihon and the Hiddekel.
These same names of rivers, when
applied to streams on the "outside"
surface of the earth, are purely
traditional from an antiquity beyond
the memory of man.
</p><p>
   On the top of a high mountain, near
the fountain-head of these four rivers,
Olaf Jansen, the Norseman, claims to
have discovered the long-lost
<pb n="31"/>
"Garden of Eden," the veritable navel of
the earth, and to have spent over two
years studying and reconnoitering in
this marvelous "within" land, exuberant
with stupendous plant life and
abounding in giant animals; a land
where the people live to be centuries
old, after the order of Methuselah and
other Biblical characters; a region
where one-quarter of the "inner"
surface is water and three-quarters
land; where there are large oceans
and many rivers and lakes; where the
cities are superlative in construction
and magnificence; where modes of
transportation are as far in advance
of ours as we with our boasted
achievements are in advance of the
inhabitants of "darkest Africa."
</p><p>
   The distance directly across the
<pb n="32"/>
space from inner surface to inner
surface is about six hundred miles less
than the recognized diameter of the
earth. In the identical center of this
vast vacuum is the seat of electricity
&mdash;a mammoth ball of dull red fire&mdash;
not startlingly brilliant, but surrounded
by a white, mild, luminous
cloud, giving out uniform warmth,
and held in its place in the center of
this internal space by the immutable
law of gravitation. This electrical
cloud is known to the people
"within" as the abode of "The
Smoky God." They believe it to be
the throne of "The Most High."
</p><p>
   Olaf Jansen reminded me of how,
in the old college days, we were all
familiar with the laboratory demonstrations
of centrifugal motion, which
<pb n="33"/>
clearly proved that, if the earth were
a solid, the rapidity of its revolution
upon its axis would tear it into a thousand
fragments.
</p><p>
   The old Norseman also maintained
that from the farthest points of land
on the islands of Spitzbergen and
Franz Josef Land, flocks of geese may
be seen annually flying still farther
northward, just as the sailors and
explorers record in their log-books. No
scientist has yet been audacious
enough to attempt to explain, even to
his own satisfaction, toward what
lands these winged fowls are guided
by their subtle instinct. However,
Olaf Jansen has given us a most
reasonable explanation.
</p><p>
   The presence of the open sea in the
Northland is also explained. Olaf
<pb n="34"/>
Jansen claims that the northern
aperture, intake or hole, so to speak, is
about fourteen hundred miles across.
In connection with this, let us read
what Explorer Nansen writes, on
page 288 of his book: "I have never
had such a splendid sail. On to the
north, steadily north, with a good
wind, as fast as steam and sail can
take us, an open sea mile after mile,
watch after watch, through these
unknown regions, always clearer and
clearer of ice, one might almost say:
'How long will it last?' The eye
always turns to the northward as one
paces the bridge. It is gazing into
the future. But there is always the
same dark sky ahead which means
open sea." Again, the Norwood
Review of England, in its issue of May
<pb n="35"/>
10, 1884, says: "We do not admit
that there is ice up to the Pole&mdash;once
inside the great ice barrier, a new
world breaks upon the explorer, the
climate is mild like that of England,
and, afterward, balmy as the Greek
Isles."
</p><p>
   Some of the rivers "within," Olaf
Jansen claims, are larger than our
Mississippi and Amazon rivers combined,
in point of volume of water
carried; indeed their greatness is
occasioned by their width and depth
rather than their length, and it is at
the mouths of these mighty rivers, as
they flow northward and southward
along the inside surface of the earth,
that mammoth icebergs are found,
some of them fifteen and twenty miles
<pb n="36"/>
wide and from forty to one hundred
miles in length.
</p><p>
   Is it not strange that there has
never been an iceberg encountered
either in the Arctic or Antarctic
Ocean that is not composed of fresh
water? Modern scientists claim that
freezing eliminates the salt, but Olaf
Jansen claims differently.
</p><p>
   Ancient Hindoo, Japanese and Chinese
writings, as well as the hiero-glyphics
of the extinct races of the North
American continent, all speak
of the custom of sun-worshiping,
and it is possible, in the startling light
of Olaf Jansen's revelations, that the
people of the inner world, lured
away by glimpses of the sun as it
shone upon the inner surface of the
<pb n="37"/>
earth, either from the northern or the
southern opening, became dissatisfied
with "The Smoky God," the great
pillar or mother cloud of electricity,
and, weary of their continuously mild
and pleasant atmosphere, followed
the brighter light, and were finally
led beyond the ice belt and scattered
over the "outer" surface of the earth,
through Asia, Europe, North America
and, later, Africa, Australia and
South America.<ref target="n1">[1]</ref>
<pb n="38"/>
</p><p>
   It is a notable fact that, as we
approach the Equator, the stature of the
human race grows less. But the
Patagonians of South America are
probably the only aborigines from
the center of the earth who came out
through the aperture usually designated
as the South Pole, and they are
called the giant race.
</p><p>
   Olaf Jansen avers that, in the
beginning, the world was created by
the Great Architect of the Universe,
so that man might dwell upon its
"inside" surface, which has ever since
been the habitation of the "chosen."
</p><p>
   They who were driven out of the
<pb n="39"/>
"Garden of Eden" brought their
traditional history with them.
</p><p>
   The history of the people living
"within" contains a narrative suggesting
the story of Noah and the ark
with which we are familiar. He
sailed away, as did Columbus, from
a certain port, to a strange land he
had heard of far to the northward,
carrying with him all manner of
beasts of the fields and fowls of the
air, but was never heard of afterward.
</p><p>
   On the northern boundaries of
Alaska, and still more frequently on
the Siberian coast, are found
boneyards containing tusks of ivory in
quantities so great as to suggest the
burying-places of antiquity. From
Olaf Jansen's account, they have
<pb n="40"/>
come from the great prolific animal
life that abounds in the fields and
forests and on the banks of numerous
rivers of the Inner World. The
materials were caught in the ocean
currents, or were carried on ice-floes,
and have accumulated like driftwood on
the Siberian coast. This has been
going on for ages, and hence these
mysterious bone-yards.
</p><p>
   On this subject William F. Warren, in
his book already cited, pages 297 and 298,
says: "The Arctic rocks tell of a lost
Atlantis more wonderful than Plato's.
The fossil ivory beds of Siberia excel
everything of the kind in the world. From
the days of Pliny, at least, they have
constantly been undergoing exploitation,
and still they are the chief
<pb n="41"/>
headquarters of supply. The remains of
mammoths are so abundant that, as
Gratacap says, 'the northern islands of
Siberia seem built up of crowded
bones.' Another scientific writer,
speaking of the islands of New
Siberia, northward of the mouth of the
River Lena, uses this language:
'Large quantities of ivory are dug
out of the ground every year.
Indeed, some of the islands are believed
to be nothing but an accumulation of
drift-timber and the bodies of
mammoths and other antediluvian
animals frozen together.' From this we
may infer that, during the years that
have elapsed since the Russian
conquest of Siberia, useful tusks from
more than twenty thousand mammoths have
been collected."
<pb n="42"/>
</p><p>
   But now for the story of Olaf Jansen.
I give it in detail, as set down
by himself in manuscript, and woven
into the tale, just as he placed them,
are certain quotations from recent
works on Arctic exploration, showing
how carefully the old Norseman compared
with his own experiences those
of other voyagers to the frozen North.
Thus wrote the disciple of Odin and
Thor:

OLAF JANSEN'S STORY
</head>

<div2 type="section" id="d13">


<p><lb/>
MY name is Olaf Jansen. I am
a Norwegian, although I was
born in the little seafaring Russian
town of Uleaborg, on the eastern
coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, the
northern arm of the Baltic Sea.
</p><p>
   My parents were on a fishing cruise
in the Gulf of Bothnia, and put into
this Russian town of Uleaborg at the
time of my birth, being the
twenty-seventh day of October, 1811.
</p><p>
   My father, Jens Jansen, was born
at Rodwig on the Scandinavian coast,
<pb n="45"/>
near the Lofoden Islands, but after
marrying made his home at Stockholm,
because my mother's people resided
in that city. When seven years
old, I began going with my father on
his fishing trips along the
Scandinavian coast.
</p><p>
   Early in life I displayed an
aptitude for books, and at the age of nine
years was placed in a private school
in Stockholm, remaining there until
I was fourteen. After this I made
regular trips with my father on all
his fishing voyages.
</p><p>
   My father was a man fully six feet
three in height, and weighed over
fifteen stone, a typical Norseman of
the most rugged sort, and capable of
more endurance than any other man
I have ever known. He possessed the
<pb n="46"/>
gentleness of a woman in tender
little ways, yet his determination and
will-power were beyond description.
His will admitted of no defeat.
</p><p>
   I was in my nineteenth year when
we started on what proved to be our
last trip as fishermen, and which
resulted in the strange story that shall
be given to the world,&mdash;but not until
I have finished my earthly pilgrimage.
</p><p>
   I dare not allow the facts as I know
them to be published while I am living,
for fear of further humiliation,
confinement and suffering. First of
all, I was put in irons by the captain
of the whaling vessel that rescued me,
for no other reason than that I told
the truth about the marvelous discoveries
made by my father and myself.
<pb n="47"/>
But this was far from being the end
of my tortures.
</p><p>
   After four years and eight months'
absence I reached Stockholm, only to
find my mother had died the previous
year, and the property left by my
parents in the possession of my
mother's people, but it was at once
made over to me.
</p><p>
   All might have been well, had I
erased from my memory the story of
our adventure and of my father's
terrible death.
</p><p>
   Finally, one day I told the story in
detail to my uncle, Gustaf Osterlind,
a man of considerable property, and
urged him to fit out an expedition for
me to make another voyage to the
strange land.
</p><p>
   At first I thought he favored my
<pb n="48"/>
project. He seemed interested, and
invited me to go before certain
officials and explain to them, as I had
to him, the story of our travels and
discoveries. Imagine my disappointment
and horror when, upon the conclusion
of my narrative, certain papers were
signed by my uncle, and, without warning,
I found myself arrested and hurried away
to dismal and fearful confinement in a
mad-house, where I remained for twenty-eight
years&mdash;long, tedious, frightful
years of suffering!
</p><p>
   I never ceased to assert my sanity,
and to protest against the injustice of
my confinement. Finally, on
the seventeenth of October, 1862, I
was released. My uncle was dead,
and the friends of my youth were now
<pb n="51"/>
strangers. Indeed, a man over fifty
years old, whose only known record
is that of a madman, has no friends.
</p><p>
   I was at a loss to know what to do
for a living, but instinctively turned
toward the harbor where fishing boats
in great numbers were anchored, and
within a week I had shipped with a
fisherman by the name of Yan
Hansen, who was starting on a long fishing
cruise to the Lofoden Islands.
</p><p>
   Here my earlier years of training
proved of the very greatest advantage,
especially in enabling me to
make myself useful. This was but
the beginning of other trips, and by
frugal economy I was, in a few years,
able to own a fishing-brig of my own.
</p><p>
   For twenty-seven years thereafter
<pb n="52"/>
I followed the sea as a fisherman, five
years working for others, and the last
twenty-two for myself.
</p><p>
   During all these years I was a most
diligent student of books, as well as
a hard worker at my business, but I
took great care not to mention to
anyone the story concerning the discoveries
made by my father and myself.
Even at this late day I would be fearful
of having any one see or know the
things I am writing, and the records
and maps I have in my keeping.
When my days on earth are finished,
I shall leave maps and records that
will enlighten and, I hope, benefit
mankind.
</p><p>
   The memory of my long confinement
with maniacs, and all the
<pb n="53"/>
horrible anguish and sufferings are too
vivid to warrant my taking further
chances.
</p><p>
   In 1889 I sold out my fishing boats,
and found I had accumulated a
fortune quite sufficient to keep me the
remainder of my life. I then came
to America.
</p><p>
   For a dozen years my home was in
Illinois, near Batavia, where I gathered
most of the books in my present
library, though I brought many
choice volumes from Stockholm.
Later, I came to Los Angeles, arriving
here March 4, 1901. The date I
well remember, as it was President
McKinley's second inauguration day.
I bought this humble home and
determined, here in the privacy of my
own abode, sheltered by my own vine
<pb n="54"/>
and fig-tree, and with my books about
me, to make maps and drawings of
the new lands we had discovered, and
also to write the story in detail from
the time my father and I left Stockholm
until the tragic event that
parted us in the Antarctic Ocean.
</p><p>
   I well remember that we left Stockholm
in our fishing-sloop on the third
day of April, 1829, and sailed to the
southward, leaving Gothland Island
to the left and Oeland Island to the
right. A few days later we succeeded
in doubling Sandhommar
Point, and made our way through
the sound which separates Denmark
from the Scandinavian coast. In
due time we put in at the town of
Christiansand, where we rested two
days, and then started around the
<pb n="55"/>
Scandinavian coast to the westward,
bound for the Lofoden Islands.
</p><p>
   My father was in high spirit, because
of the excellent and gratifying
returns he had received from our last
catch by marketing at Stockholm,
instead of selling at one of the seafaring
towns along the Scandinavian
coast. He was especially pleased
with the sale of some ivory tusks that
he had found on the west coast of
Franz Joseph Land during one of his
northern cruises the previous year,
and he expressed the hope that this
time we might again be fortunate
enough to load our little fishing-sloop
with ivory, instead of cod, herring,
mackerel and salmon.
</p><p>
   We put in at Hammerfest, latitude
<pb n="56"/>
seventy-one degrees and forty
minutes, for a few days' rest. Here we
remained one week, laying in an
extra supply of provisions and several
casks of drinking-water, and then
sailed toward Spitzbergen.
</p><p>
   For the first few days we had an
open sea and a favoring wind, and
then we encountered much ice and
many icebergs. A vessel larger than
our little fishing-sloop could not
possibly have threaded its way among
the labyrinth of icebergs or squeezed
through the barely open channels.
These monster bergs presented an
endless succession of crystal palaces,
of massive cathedrals and fantastic
mountain ranges, grim and sentinel-like,
immovable as some towering cliff
<pb n="59"/>
of solid rock, standing; silent as a
sphinx, resisting the restless waves
of a fretful sea.
</p><p>
   After many narrow escapes, we
arrived at Spitzbergen on the 23d of
June, and anchored at Wijade Bay
for a short time, where we were quite
successful in our catches. We then
lifted anchor and sailed through the
Hinlopen Strait, and coasted along
the North-East-Land.<ref target="n2">[2]</ref>
</p><p>
   A strong wind came up from the
southwest, and my father said that we
had better take advantage of it and
try to reach Franz Josef Land, where,
<pb n="60"/>
the year before he had, by accident,
found the ivory tusks that had
brought him such a good price at
Stockholm.
</p><p>
   Never, before or since, have I seen
so many sea-fowl; they were so numerous
that they hid the rocks on the
coast line and darkened the sky.
</p><p>
   For several days we sailed along
the rocky coast of Franz Josef Land.
Finally, a favoring wind came up that
enabled us to make the West Coast,
and, after sailing twenty-four hours,
we came to a beautiful inlet.
</p><p>
   One could hardly believe it was the
far Northland. The place was green
with growing vegetation, and while
the area did not comprise more than
one or two acres, yet the air was
<pb n="61"/>
warm and tranquil. It seemed to be
at that point where the Gulf Stream's
influence is most keenly felt.<ref target="n3">[3]</ref>
</p><p>
   On the east coast there were numerous
icebergs, yet here we were in
open water. Far to the west of us,

<pb n="62"/>
however, were icepacks, and still farther
to the westward the ice appeared
like ranges of low hills. In front of
us, and directly to the north, lay an
open sea.<ref target="n4">[4]</ref>
</p><p>
   My father was an ardent believer
in Odin and Thor, and had frequently
told me they were gods who came
from far beyond the "North Wind."
</p><p>
   There was a tradition, my father

<pb n="63"/>
explained, that still farther northward
was a land more beautiful than
any that mortal man had ever known,
and that it was inhabited by the
"Chosen."<ref target="n5">[5]</ref>
</p><p>
   My youthful imagination was fired
by the ardor, zeal and religious fervor

<pb n="64"/>
of my good father, and I exclaimed:
"Why not sail to this goodly land?
The sky is fair, the wind favorable
and the sea open."
</p><p>
   Even now I can see the expression
of pleasurable surprise on his countenance
as he turned toward me and
asked: "My son, are you willing to
go with me and explore&mdash;to go far
beyond where man has ever ventured?"
I answered affirmatively.
"Very well," he replied. "May the
god Odin protect us!" and, quickly
adjusting the sails, he glanced at our
compass, turned the prow in due
northerly direction through an open
channel, and our voyage had begun.<ref target="n6">[6]</ref>

<pb n="65"/>
</p><p>
   The sun was low in the horizon, as
it was still the early summer. Indeed,
we had almost four months of
day ahead of us before the frozen
night could come on again.
</p><p>
   Our little fishing-sloop sprang
forward as if eager as ourselves for
adventure. Within thirty-six hours we
were out of sight of the highest point
on the coast line of Franz Josef
Land. "We seemed to be in a strong
current running north by northeast.
Far to the right and to the left of us
were icebergs, but our little sloop
bore down on the narrows and passed
through channels and out into open
seas&mdash;channels so narrow in places
<pb n="66"/>
that, had our craft been other than
small, we never could have gotten
through.
</p><p>
   On the third day we came to an
island. Its shores were washed by an
open sea. My father determined to
land and explore for a day. This
new land was destitute of timber, but
we found a large accumulation of
drift-wood on the northern shore.
Some of the trunks of the trees were
forty feet long and two feet in
diameter.<ref target="n7">[7]</ref>

<pb n="67"/>

</p><p>
   After one day's exploration of the
coast line of this island, we lifted
anchor and turned our prow to the north
in an open sea.<ref target="n8">[8]</ref>
</p><p>
   I remember that neither my father
nor myself had tasted food for almost

<pb n="68"/>
thirty hours. Perhaps this was
because of the tension of excitement
about our strange voyage in waters
farther north, my father said, than
anyone had ever before been. Active
mentality had dulled the demands of
the physical needs.
</p><p>
   Instead of the cold being intense as
we had anticipated, it was really
warmer and more pleasant than it
had been while in Hammerfest on the
north coast of Norway, some six
weeks before.<ref target="n9">[9]</ref>

<pb n="69"/>
</p><p>
   We both frankly admitted that we
were very hungry, and forthwith I
prepared a substantial meal from our
well-stored larder. When we had
partaken heartily of the repast, I
told my father I believed I would
sleep, as I was beginning to feel
quite drowsy. "Very well," he
replied, "I will keep the watch."
</p><p>
   I have no way to determine how

<pb n="70"/>
long I slept; I only know that I was
rudely awakened by a terrible
commotion of the sloop. To my surprise,
I found my father sleeping soundly.
I cried out lustily to him, and
starting up, he sprang quickly to his feet.
Indeed, had he not instantly clutched
the rail, he would certainly have been
thrown into the seething waves.
</p><p>
   A fierce snow-storm was raging.
The wind was directly astern, driving
our sloop at a terrific speed, and was
threatening every moment to capsize
us. There was no time to lose, the
sails had to be lowered immediately.
Our boat was writhing in convulsions.
A few icebergs we knew were on
either side of us, but fortunately the
channel was open directly to the
north. But would it remain so? In
<pb n="71"/>
front of us, girding the horizon from
left to right, was a vaporish fog or
mist, black as Egyptian night at the
water's edge, and white like a steam-cloud
toward the top, which was
finally lost to view as it blended with
the great white flakes of falling snow.
Whether it covered a treacherous
iceberg, or some other hidden obstacle
against which our little sloop would
dash and send us to a watery grave,
or was merely the phenomenon of an
Arctic fog, there was no way to
determine.<ref target="n10">[10]</ref>
<pb n="72"/>
</p><p>
   By what miracle we escaped being
dashed to utter destruction, I do not
know. I remember our little craft
creaked and groaned, as if its joints
were breaking. It rocked and staggered
to and fro as if clutched by
some fierce undertow of whirlpool or
maelstrom.
</p><p>
   Fortunately our compass had been
fastened with long screws to a cross-beam.
Most of our provisions, however, were tumbled
out and swept away from the deck of the cuddy,
and
<pb n="75"/>
had we not taken the precaution at
the very beginning to tie ourselves
firmly to the masts of the sloop, we
should have been swept into the
lashing sea.
</p><p>
   Above the deafening tumult of the
raging waves, I heard my father's
voice. "Be courageous, my son," he
shouted, "Odin is the god of the
waters, the companion of the brave,
and he is with us. Fear not."
</p><p>
   To me it seemed there was no
possibility of our escaping a horrible
death. The little sloop was shipping
water, the snow was falling so fast
as to be blinding, and the waves were
tumbling over our counters in reckless
white-sprayed fury. There was
no telling what instant we should be
dashed against some drifting ice-<pb n="76"/>
pack. The tremendous swells would
heave us up to the very peaks of
mountainous waves, then plunge us
down into the depths of the sea's
trough as if our fishing-sloop were a
fragile shell. Gigantic white-capped
waves, like veritable walls, fenced us
in, fore and aft.
</p><p>
   This terrible nerve-racking ordeal,
with its nameless horrors of suspense
and agony of fear indescribable,
continued for more than three hours, and
all the time we were being driven
forward at fierce speed. Then suddenly,
as if growing weary of its frantic
exertions, the wind began to lessen its
fury and by degrees to die down.
</p><p>
   At last we were in a perfect calm.
The fog mist had also disappeared,
and before us lay an iceless channel
<pb n="77"/>
perhaps ten or fifteen miles wide,
with a few icebergs far away to our
right, and an intermittent archipelago
of smaller ones to the left.
</p><p>
   I watched my father closely, determined
to remain silent until he spoke.
Presently he untied the rope from his
waist and, without saying a word,
began working the pumps, which
fortunately were not damaged, relieving
the sloop of the water it had shipped
in the madness of the storm.
</p><p>
   He put up the sloop's sails as
calmly as if casting a fishing-net, and
then remarked that we were ready for
a favoring wind when it came. His
courage and persistence were truly
remarkable.
</p><p>
   On investigation we found less than
one-third of our provisions
<pb n="78"/>
remaining, while to our utter dismay, we
discovered that our water-casks had been
swept overboard during the violent
plungings of our boat.
</p><p>
   Two of our water-casks were in the
main hold, but both were empty. We
had a fair supply of food, but no
fresh water. I realized at once the
awfulness of our position. Presently
I was seized with a consuming thirst.
"It is indeed bad," remarked my
father. "However, let us dry our
bedraggled clothing, for we are
soaked to the skin. Trust to the god
Odin, my son. Do not give up hope."
</p><p>
   The sun was beating down slantingly,
as if we were in a southern latitude,
instead of in the far North-land.
It was swinging around, its orbit ever
visible and rising higher
<pb n="79"/>
and higher each day, frequently
mist-covered, yet always peering
through the lacework of clouds like
some fretful eye of fate, guarding
the mysterious Northland and jealously
watching the pranks of man. Far to our
right the rays decking the prisms of
icebergs were gorgeous. Their reflections
emitted flashes of garnet, of diamond,
of sapphire. A pyrotechnic panorama of
countless colors and shapes, while below
could be seen the green-tinted sea, and
above, the purple sky.

a rise of wind at Melville Island was
generally accompanied by a simultaneous

<p><lb/>
I TRIED to forget my thirst by busying
myself with bringing up some food and
an empty vessel from the hold. Reaching
over the side-rail, I filled the vessel
with water for the purpose of laving my
hands and face. To my astonishment, when
the water came in contact with my lips, I
could taste no salt. I was startled by
the discovery. "Father!" I fairly
gasped, "the water, the water; it is
fresh!" "What, Olaf?" exclaimed
<pb n="81"/>
my father, glancing hastily around.
"Surely you are mistaken. There is
no land. You are going mad."
"But taste it!" I cried.
</p><p>
   And thus we made the discovery
that the water was indeed fresh,
absolutely so, without the least briny
taste or even the suspicion of a salty
flavor.
</p><p>
   We forthwith filled our two
remaining water-casks, and my father
declared it was a heavenly dispensation
of mercy from the gods Odin
and Thor.
</p><p>
   We were almost beside ourselves
with joy, but hunger bade us end our
enforced fast. Now that we had
found fresh water in the open sea,
what might we not expect in this
strange latitude where ship had never
<pb n="82"/>
before sailed and the splash of an oar
had never been heard? <ref target="n11">[11]</ref>
</p><p>
   We had scarcely appeased our
hunger when a breeze began filling the
idle sails, and, glancing at the

<pb n="83"/>
compass, we found the northern point
pressing hard against the glass.
</p><p>
   In response to my surprise, my
father said, "I have heard of this
before; it is what they call the dipping
of the needle."
</p><p>
   We loosened the compass and
turned it at right angles with the
surface of the sea before its point would
free itself from the glass and point
according to unmolested attraction.
It shifted uneasily, and seemed as
unsteady as a drunken man, but finally
pointed a course.
</p><p>
   Before this we thought the wind
was carrying us north by northwest,
but, with the needle free, we discovered,
if it could be relied upon, that
we were sailing slightly north by
<pb n="84"/>
northeast. Our course, however, was
ever tending northward.<ref target="n12">[12]</ref>
<pb n="85"/>
</p><p>
   The sea was serenely smooth, with
hardly a choppy wave, and the wind brisk
and exhilarating. The sun's rays, while
striking us aslant, furnished tranquil
warmth. And thus time wore on day after
day, and we found from the record in our
log-book, we had been sailing eleven days
since the storm in the open sea.
</p><p>
   By strictest economy, our food was
holding out fairly well, but beginning
to run low. In the meantime, one of
<pb n="86"/>
our casks of water had been exhausted,
and my father said: "We will fill it
again." But, to our dismay, we found
the water was now as salt as in the
region of the Lofoden Islands off the
coast of Norway. This necessitated our
being extremely careful of the remaining
cask.
</p><p>
   I found myself wanting to sleep
much of the time; whether it was the
effect of the exciting experience of
sailing in unknown waters, or the
relaxation from the awful excitement
incident to our adventure in a storm
at sea, or due to want of food, I could
not say.
</p><p>
   I frequently lay down on the
bunker of our little sloop, and looked
far up into the blue dome of the sky;
and, notwithstanding the sun was
<pb n="87"/>
shining far away in the east, I always
saw a single star overhead. For
several days, when I looked for this star,
it was always there directly above us.
</p><p>
   It was now, according to our
reckoning, about the first of August. The
sun was high in the heavens, and was
so bright that I could no longer see
the one lone star that attracted my
attention a few days earlier.
</p><p>
   One day about this time, my father
startled me by calling my attention to
a novel sight far in front of us, almost
at the horizon. "It is a mock sun,"
exclaimed my father. "I have read
of them; it is called a reflection or
mirage. It will soon pass away."
</p><p>
   But this dull-red, false sun, as we
supposed it to be, did not pass away
for several hours; and while we were
<pb n="88"/>
unconscious of its emitting any rays of
light, still there was no time there-after
when we could not sweep the horizon in front
and locate the illumination of the so-called
false sun, during a period of at least twelve
hours out of every twenty-four.
</p><p>
   Clouds and mists would at times
almost, but never entirely, hide its
location. Gradually it seemed to climb
higher in the horizon of the uncertain
purply sky as we advanced.
</p><p>
   It could hardly be said to resemble
the sun, except in its circular shape,
and when not obscured by clouds or
the ocean mists, it had a hazy-red,
bronzed appearance, which would
change to a white light like a
luminous cloud, as if reflecting some
greater light beyond.
<pb n="91"/>
</p><p>
   "We finally agreed in our discussion
of this smoky furnace-colored sun,
that, whatever the cause of the
phenomenon, it was not a reflection of
our sun, but a planet of some sort&mdash;a
reality.<ref target="n13">[13]</ref>

<pb n="92"/>
</p><p>
   One day soon after this, I felt
exceedingly drowsy, and fell into a
sound sleep. But it seemed that I
was almost immediately aroused by
my father's vigorous shaking of me

<pb n="93"/>
by the shoulder and saying: "Olaf,
awaken; there is land in sight!"
</p><p>
   I sprang to my feet, and oh! joy
unspeakable! There, far in the
distance, yet directly in our path, were
lands jutting boldly into the sea.
The shore-line stretched far away to
the right of us, as far as the eye could
see, and all along the sandy beach
were waves breaking into choppy
foam, receding, then going forward
again, ever chanting in monotonous
thunder tones the song of the deep.
The banks were covered with trees
and vegetation.
</p><p>
   I cannot express my feeling of
exultation at this discovery. My father
stood motionless, with his hand on the
tiller, looking straight ahead,
pouring out his heart in thankful prayer
<pb n="94"/>
and thanksgiving to the gods Odin
and Thor.
</p><p>
   In the meantime, a net which we
found in the stowage had been cast,
and we caught a few fish that
materially added to our dwindling stock of
provisions.
</p><p>
   The compass, which we had
fastened back in its place, in fear of
another storm, was still pointing due
north, and moving on its pivot, just
as it had at Stockholm. The dipping
of the needle had ceased. What could
this mean? Then, too, our many
days of sailing had certainly carried
us far past the North Pole. And yet
the needle continued to point north.
We were sorely perplexed, for surely
our direction was now south.<ref target="n14">[14]</ref>

<pb n="95"/>
</p><p>
   We sailed for three days along the
shoreline, then came to the mouth of
a fjord or river of immense size. It
seemed more like a great bay, and
into this we turned our fishing-craft,
the direction being slightly northeast
of south. By the assistance of a
fretful wind that came to our aid about
twelve hours out of every twenty-four,
we continued to make our way
<pb n="96"/>
inland, into what afterward proved to
be a mighty river, and which we
learned was called by the inhabitants
Hiddekel.
</p><p>
   We continued our journey for ten
days thereafter, and found we had
fortunately attained a distance inland
where ocean tides no longer affected
the water, which had become fresh.
</p><p>
   The discovery came none too soon,
for our remaining cask of water was

<pb n="97"/>
well-nigh exhausted. We lost no
time in replenishing our casks, and
continued to sail farther up the river
when the wind was favorable.
</p><p>
   Along the banks great forests miles
in extent could be seen stretching
away on the shore-line. The trees
were of enormous size. We landed
after anchoring near a sandy beach,
and waded ashore, and were rewarded
by finding a quantity of nuts that
were very palatable and satisfying to
hunger, and a welcome change from
the monotony of our stock of
provisions.
</p><p>
   It was about the first of September,
over five months, we calculated, since
our leave-taking from Stockholm.
Suddenly we were frightened almost
out of our wits by hearing in the far
<pb n="98"/>
distance the singing of people. Very
soon thereafter we discovered a huge
ship gliding down the river directly
toward us. Those aboard were singing
in one mighty chorus that, echoing
from bank to bank, sounded like
a thousand voices, filling the whole
universe with quivering melody.
The accompaniment was played on
stringed instruments not unlike our
harps.
</p><p>
   It was a larger ship than any we
had ever seen, and was differently
constructed.<ref target="n15">[15]</ref>

<pb n="99"/>
</p><p>
   At this particular time our sloop
was becalmed, and not far from the
shore. The bank of the river,
covered with mammoth trees, rose up
several hundred feet in beautiful
fashion. We seemed to be on the
edge of some primeval forest that
doubtless stretched far inland.
</p><p>
   The immense craft paused, and
almost immediately a boat was lowered
and six men of gigantic stature rowed
to our little fishing-sloop. They
spoke to us in a strange language.
We knew from their manner,
<pb n="100"/>
however, that they were not unfriendly.
They talked a great deal among
themselves, and one of them laughed
immoderately, as though in finding us a
queer discovery had been made. One
of them spied our compass, and it
seemed to interest them more than
any other part of our sloop.
</p><p>
   Finally, the leader motioned as if
to ask whether we were willing to
leave our craft to go on board their
ship. "What say you, my son?"
asked my father. "They cannot do
any more than kill us."
</p><p>
   "They seem to be kindly disposed,"
I replied, "although what terrible
giants! They must be the select six
of the kingdom's crack regiment.
Just look at their great size."
</p><p>
   "We may as well go willingly as be
<pb n="103"/>
taken by force," said my father,
smiling, "for they are certainly able to
capture us." Thereupon he made
known, by signs, that we were ready
to accompany them.
</p><p>
   Within a few minutes we were on
board the ship, and half an hour later
our little fishing-craft had been lifted
bodily out of the water by a strange
sort of hook and tackle, and set on
board as a curiosity.
</p><p>
   There were several hundred people
on board this, to us, mammoth ship,
which we discovered was called "The
Naz," meaning, as we afterward
learned, "Pleasure," or to give a
more proper interpretation,
"Pleasure Excursion" ship.
</p><p>
   If my father and I were curiously
<pb n="104"/>
observed by the ship's occupants, this
strange race of giants offered us an
equal amount of wonderment.
</p><p>
   There was not a single man aboard
who would not have measured fully
twelve feet in height. They all wore
full beards, not particularly long, but
seemingly short-cropped. They had
mild and beautiful faces, exceedingly
fair, with ruddy complexions. The
hair and beard of some were black,
others sandy, and still others yellow.
The captain, as we designated the
dignitary in command of the great
vessel, was fully a head taller than
any of his companions. The women
averaged from ten to eleven feet in
height. Their features were especially
regular and refined, while their
<pb n="105"/>
complexion was of a most delicate
tint heightened by a healthful glow.<ref target="n16">[16]</ref>
</p><p>
   Both men and women seemed to
possess that particular ease of manner
which we deem a sign of good
breeding, and, notwithstanding their
huge statures, there was nothing
about them suggesting awkwardness.
As I was a lad in only my nineteenth

<pb n="106"/>
year, I was doubtless looked upon as
a true Tom Thumb. My father's six
feet three did not lift the top of his
head above the waist line of these
people.
</p><p>
   Each one seemed to vie with the
others in extending courtesies and
showing kindness to us, but all
laughed heartily, I remember, when
they had to improvise chairs for my
father and myself to sit at table.
They were richly attired in a costume
peculiar to themselves, and very
attractive. The men were clothed in
handsomely embroidered tunics of
silk and satin and belted at the waist.
They wore knee-breeches and stockings
of a fine texture, while their feet
were encased in sandals adorned with
gold buckles. We early discovered
<pb n="107"/>
that gold was one of the most common
metals known, and that it was used
extensively in decoration.
</p><p>
   Strange as it may seem, neither my
father nor myself felt the least bit
of solicitude for our safety. "We
have come into our own," my father
said to me. "This is the fulfillment
of the tradition told me by my father
and my father's father, and still back
for many generations of our race.
This is, assuredly, the land beyond the
North Wind."
</p><p>
   We seemed to make such an
impression on the party that we were
given specially into the charge of one
of the men, Jules Galdea, and his
wife, for the purpose of being
educated in their language; and we, on
<pb n="108"/>
our part, were just as eager to learn
as they were to instruct.
</p><p>
   At the captain's command, the
vessel was swung cleverly about, and
began retracing its course up the river.
The machinery, while noiseless, was
very powerful.
</p><p>
   The banks and trees on either side seemed
to rush by. The ship's speed, at times,
surpassed that of any rail-road train on
which I have ever ridden, even here in America.
It was wonderful.
</p><p>
   In the meantime we had lost sight
of the sun's rays, but we found a
radiance "within" emanating from the
dull-red sun which had already
attracted our attention, now giving out
a white light seemingly from a cloud-<pb n="109"/>
bank far away in front of us. It
dispensed a greater light, I should say,
than two full moons on the clearest
night.
</p><p>
   In twelve hours this cloud of
whiteness would pass out of sight as if
eclipsed, and the twelve hours
following corresponded with our night.
We early learned that these strange
people were worshipers of this great
cloud of night. It was "The Smoky
God" of the "Inner World."
</p><p>
   The ship was equipped with a mode
of illumination which I now presume
was electricity, but neither my father
nor myself were sufficiently skilled
in mechanics to understand whence
came the power to operate the ship,
or to maintain the soft beautiful
lights that answered the same purpose
<pb n="110"/>
of our present methods of lighting the
streets of our cities, our houses and
places of business.
</p><p>
   It must be remembered, the time of
which I write was the autumn of 1829,
and we of the "outside" surface of
the earth knew nothing then, so to
speak, of electricity.
</p><p>
   The electrically surcharged
condition of the air was a constant
vitalizer. I never felt better in my life
than during the two years my father
and I sojourned on the inside of the
earth.
</p><p>
   To resume my narrative of events;
The ship on which we were sailing
came to a stop two days after we had
been taken on board. My father said
as nearly as he could judge, we were
directly under Stockholm or London.
<pb n="111"/>
The city we had reached was called
"Jehu," signifying a seaport town.
The houses were large and beautifully
constructed, and quite uniform in
appearance, yet without sameness. The
principal occupation of the people
appeared to be agriculture; the hillsides
were covered with vineyards, while
the valleys were devoted to the
growing of grain.
</p><p>
   I never saw such a display of gold.
It was everywhere. The door-casings
were inlaid and the tables were
veneered with sheetings of gold.
Domes of the public buildings were
of gold. It was used most generously
in the finishings of the great temples
of music.
</p><p>
   Vegetation grew in lavish exuberance,
and fruit of all kinds possessed
<pb n="112"/>
the most delicate flavor. Clusters of
grapes four and five feet in length,
each grape as large as an orange, and
apples larger than a man's head
typified the wonderful growth of all
things on the "inside" of the earth.
</p><p>
   The great redwood trees of California
would be considered mere under-brush
compared with the giant forest
trees extending for miles and miles in
all directions. In many directions
along the foothills of the mountains
vast herds of cattle were seen during
the last day of our travel on the river.
</p><p>
   "We heard much of a city called
"Eden," but were kept at "Jehu" for
an entire year. By the end of that
time we had learned to speak fairly
well the language of this strange race
of people. Our instructors, Jules
<pb n="113"/>
Galdea and his wife, exhibited a
patience that was truly commendable.
</p><p>
   One day an envoy from the Ruler
at "Eden" came to see us, and for
two whole days my father and myself
were put through a series of surprising
questions. They wished to know
from whence we came, what sort of
people dwelt "without," what God we
worshiped, our religious beliefs, the
mode of living in our strange land,
and a thousand other things.
</p><p>
   The compass which we had brought
with us attracted especial attention.
My father and I commented between
ourselves on the fact that the
compass still pointed north, although we
now knew that we had sailed over the
curve or edge of the earth's aperture,
and were far along southward on the
<pb n="114"/>
"inside" surface of the earth's crust,
which, according to my father's
estimate and my own, is about three
hundred miles in thickness from the
"inside" to the "outside" surface.
Relatively speaking, it is no thicker
than an egg-shell, so that there is
almost as much surface on the "inside"
as on the "outside" of the earth.
</p><p>
   The great luminous cloud or ball of
dull-red fire&mdash;fiery-red in the
mornings and evenings, and during the day
giving off a beautiful white light,
"The Smoky God,"&mdash;is seemingly
suspended in the center of the great
vacuum "within" the earth, and held
to its place by the immutable law of
gravitation, or a repellant atmospheric
force, as the case may be. I refer
to the known power that draws or
<pb n="115"/>
repels with equal force in all directions.
</p><p>
   The base of this electrical cloud or
central luminary, the seat of the gods,
is dark and non-transparent, save for
innumerable small openings, seemingly
in the bottom of the great support
or altar of the Deity, upon which
"The Smoky God" rests; and, the
lights shining through these many
openings twinkle at night in all their
splendor, and seem to be stars, as
natural as the stars we saw shining when
in our home at Stockholm, excepting
that they appear larger. "The
Smoky God," therefore, with each
daily revolution of the earth, appears
to come up in the east and go down
in the west, the same as does our sun
on the external surface. In reality,
the people "within" believe that
<pb n="116"/>
"The Smoky God" is the throne of
their Jehovah, and is stationary.
The effect of night and day is,
therefore, produced by the earth's daily
rotation.
</p><p>
   I have since discovered that the
language of the people of the Inner
World is much like the Sanskrit.
</p><p>
   After we had given an account of
ourselves to the emissaries from the
central seat of government of the
inner continent, and my father had, in
his crude way, drawn maps, at their
request, of the "outside" surface of
the earth, showing the divisions of
land and water, and giving the name
of each of the continents, large
islands and the oceans, we were taken
overland to the city of "Eden," in a
conveyance different from anything
<pb n="117"/>
we have in Europe or America. This
vehicle was doubtless some electrical
contrivance. It was noiseless, and ran
on a single iron rail in perfect balance.
The trip was made at a very high rate of
speed. We were carried up hills and down
dales, across valleys and again along the
sides of steep mountains, without any
apparent attempt having been made to level
the earth as we do for rail-road tracks.
The car seats were huge yet comfortable
affairs, and very high above the floor of
the car. On the top of each car were high
geared fly wheels lying on their sides,
which were so automatically adjusted
that, as the speed of the car increased,
the high speed of these fly wheels
geometrically increased.
<pb n="118"/>
Jules Galdea explained to us that
these revolving fan-like wheels on
top of the cars destroyed atmospheric
pressure, or what is generally understood
by the term gravitation, and
with this force thus destroyed or
rendered nugatory the car is as safe from
falling to one side or the other from
the single rail track as if it were in a
vacuum; the fly wheels in their rapid
revolutions destroying effectually the
so-called power of gravitation, or the
force of atmospheric pressure or
whatever potent influence it may be
that causes all unsupported things to
fall downward to the earth's surface
or to the nearest point of resistance.
</p><p>
   The surprise of my father and
myself was indescribable when, amid the
regal magnificence of a spacious hall,
<pb n="119"/>
we were finally brought before the
Great High Priest, ruler over all the
land. He was richly robed, and
much taller than those about him, and
could not have been less than
fourteen or fifteen feet in height. The
immense room in which we were
received seemed finished in solid slabs
of gold thickly studded with jewels, of
amazing brilliancy.
</p><p>
   The city of "Eden" is located in
what seems to be a beautiful valley,
yet, in fact, it is on the loftiest
mountain plateau of the Inner
Continent, several thousand feet higher
than any portion of the surrounding
country. It is the most beautiful
place I have ever beheld in all my
travels. In this elevated garden all
manner of fruits, vines, shrubs, trees,
<pb n="120"/>
and flowers grow in riotous profusion.
</p><p>
   In this garden four rivers have
their source in a mighty artesian
fountain. They divide and flow in
four directions. This place is called
by the inhabitants the "navel of the
earth," or the beginning, "the cradle
of the human race." The names of
the rivers are the Euphrates, the
Pison, the Gihon, and the Hiddekel.<ref target="n17">[17]</ref>
</p><p>
   The unexpected awaited us in this
palace of beauty, in the finding of our
little fishing-craft. It had been
brought before the High Priest in
perfect shape, just as it had been

<pb n="123"/>
taken from the waters that day when
it was loaded on board the ship by
the people who discovered us on the
river more than a year before.
</p><p>
   "We were given an audience of over
two hours with this great dignitary,
who seemed kindly disposed and
considerate. He showed himself
eagerly interested, asking us numerous
questions, and invariably regarding
things about which his emissaries had
failed to inquire.
</p><p>
   At the conclusion of the interview
he inquired our pleasure, asking us
whether we wished to remain in his
country or if we preferred to return
to the "outer" world, providing it
were possible to make a successful
return trip, across the frozen belt
barriers that encircle both the northern
<pb n="124"/>
and southern openings of the earth.
</p><p>
   My father replied: "It would
please me and my son to visit your
country and see your people, your
colleges and palaces of music and art,
your great fields, your wonderful
forests of timber; and after we have
had this pleasurable privilege, we
should like to try to return to our
home on the 'outside' surface of the
earth. This son is my only child,
and my good wife will be weary
awaiting our return."
</p><p>
   "I fear you can never return,"
replied the Chief High Priest, "because
the way is a most hazardous one.
However, you shall visit the different
countries with Jules Galdea as your
escort, and be accorded every courtesy
and kindness. Whenever you
<pb n="125"/>
are ready to attempt a return voyage,
I assure you that your boat which is
here on exhibition shall be put in the
waters of the river Hiddekel at its
mouth, and we will bid you Jehovah-speed."
</p><p>
   Thus terminated our only interview
with the High Priest or Ruler of the
continent.

outermost edge of the ice. According
to the enthusiastic descriptions
given by many Arctic travelers of the
first appearance of this god of life

impression ought to be one of jubilant
excitement; but it was not so in my
case. We had not expected to see it
for some days yet, so that my feeling
was rather one of pain, of disappointment
that we must have drifted farther
south than we thought. So itwas with
pleasure I soon discovered that it could
not be the sun itself. The mirage was at
first a flattened-out, glowing red, streak
of fire on the horizon; later there were
two streaks, the one above the other, with
a dark space between; and from the maintop
I could see four, or even five, such
horizontal lines directly over one
another, all of equal length, as if one
could only imagine a square, dull-red

<p><lb/>
WE learned that the males do not
marry before they are from
seventy-five to one hundred years old,
and that the age at which women enter
wedlock is only a little less, and that
both men and women frequently live
to be from six to eight hundred years
old, and in some instances much
older.<ref target="n18">[18]</ref>
<pb n="127"/>
</p><p>
   During the following year we visited
many villages and towns, prominent among
them being the cities of Nigi, Delfi,
Hectea, and my father was called upon no
less than a half-dozen times to go over
the maps which had been made from the rough
sketches he had originally given of the
divisions of land and water on the
"outside" surface of the earth.
</p><p>
   I remember hearing my father
remark that the giant race of people
in the land of "The Smoky God" had
<pb n="128"/>
almost as accurate an idea of the
geography of the "outside" surface
of the earth as had the average
college professor in Stockholm.
</p><p>
   In our travels we came to a forest
of gigantic trees, near the city of
Delfi. Had the Bible said there were
trees towering over three hundred
feet in height, and more than thirty
feet in diameter, growing in the
Garden of Eden, the Ingersolls, the Tom
Paines and Voltaires would doubtless
have pronounced the statement a
myth. Yet this is the description of
the California <hi rend="italic">sequoia gigantea</hi>; but
these California giants pale into
insignificance when compared with the
forest Goliaths found in the "within"
continent, where abound mighty trees
from eight hundred to one thousand
<pb n="129"/>
feet in height, and from one hundred
to one hundred and twenty feet in
diameter; countless in numbers and
forming forests extending hundreds
of miles back from the sea.
</p><p>
   The people are exceedingly musical,
and learned to a remarkable degree
in their arts and sciences, especially
geometry and astronomy. Their
cities are equipped with vast palaces
of music, where not infrequently as
many as twenty-five thousand lusty
voices of this giant race swell forth
in mighty choruses of the most
sublime symphonies.
</p><p>
   The children are not supposed to
attend institutions of learning before
they are twenty years old. Then
their school life begins and continues
for thirty years, ten of which are
<pb n="130"/>
uniformly devoted by both sexes to
the study of music.
</p><p>
   Their principal vocations are
architecture, agriculture, horticulture,
the raising of vast herds of cattle, and
the building of conveyances peculiar
to that country, for travel on land
and water. By some device which I
cannot explain, they hold communion
with one another between the most
distant parts of their country, on air
currents.
</p><p>
   All buildings are erected with
special regard to strength, durability,
beauty and symmetry, and with a
style of architecture vastly more
attractive to the eye than any I have
ever observed elsewhere.
</p><p>
   About three-fourths of the "inner"
surface of the earth is land and
<pb n="131"/>
about one-fourth water. There are
numerous rivers of tremendous size,
some flowing in a northerly direction
and others southerly. Some of these
rivers are thirty miles in width, and
it is out of these vast waterways, at
the extreme northern and southern
parts of the "inside" surface of the
earth, in regions where low temperatures
are experienced, that fresh-water
icebergs are formed. They are
then pushed out to sea like huge
tongues of ice, by the abnormal
freshets of turbulent waters that,
twice every year, sweep everything
before them.
</p><p>
   We saw innumerable specimens of
bird-life no larger than those encountered
in the forests of Europe or
America. It is well known that
<pb n="132"/>
during the last few years whole species
of birds have quit the earth.
<ref target="n19">[19]</ref>
</p><p>
   Is it not possible that these
disappearing bird species quit their
habitation without, and find an asylum in
the "within world"?
</p><p>
   Whether inland among the mountains,
or along the seashore, we found
bird life prolific. When they spread
their great wings some of the birds
appeared to measure thirty feet from

<pb n="133"/>
tip to tip. They are of great variety
and many colors. We were permitted
to climb up on the edge of a rock
and examine a nest of eggs. There
were five in the nest, each of which
was at least two feet in length and
fifteen inches in diameter.
</p><p>
   After we had been in the city of
Hectea about a week, Professor Galdea
took us to an inlet, where we saw
thousands of tortoises along the sandy
shore. I hesitate to state the size of
these great creatures. They were
from twenty-five to thirty feet in
length, from fifteen to twenty feet in
width and fully seven feet in height.
When one of them projected its head
it had the appearance of some hideous
sea monster.
</p><p>
   The strange conditions "within"
<pb n="134"/>
are favorable not only for vast meadows
of luxuriant grasses, forests of
giant trees, and all manner of vegetable
life, but wonderful animal life as
well.
</p><p>
   One day we saw a great herd of elephants.
There must have been five hundred of these
thunder-throated monsters, with their
restlessly waving trunks. They were
tearing huge boughs from the trees
and trampling smaller growth into
dust like so much hazel-brush. They
would average over 100 feet in length
and from 75 to 85 in height.
</p><p>
   It seemed, as I gazed upon this
wonderful herd of giant elephants,
that I was again living in the public
library at Stockholm, where I had
spent much time studying the
<pb n="137"/>
wonders of the Miocene age. I was filled
with mute astonishment, and my
father was speechless with awe. He
held my arm with a protecting grip,
as if fearful harm would overtake us.
We were two atoms in this great
forest, and, fortunately, unobserved by
this vast herd of elephants as they
drifted on and away, following a
leader as does a herd of sheep. They
browsed from growing herbage which
they encountered as they traveled,
and now and again shook the firmament
with their deep bellowing.<ref target="n20">[20]</ref>

<pb n="138"/>
</p><p>
   There is a hazy mist that goes up
from the land each evening, and it
invariably rains once every twenty-four
hours. This great moisture and the
invigorating electrical light and
warmth account perhaps for the luxuriant
vegetation, while the highly charged
electrical air and the evenness of
climatic conditions may have much to
do with the giant growth and
longevity of all animal life.
</p><p>
   In places the level valleys stretched
away for many miles in every direction.
"The Smoky God," in its clear
white light, looked calmly down.
There was an intoxication in the
electrically surcharged air that fanned

<pb n="139"/>
the cheek as softly as a vanishing
whisper. Nature chanted a lullaby in
the faint murmur of winds whose
breath was sweet with the fragrance
of bud and blossom.
</p><p>
   After having spent considerably
more than a year in visiting several
of the many cities of the "within"
world and a great deal of intervening
country, and more than two years had
passed from the time we had been
picked up by the great excursion ship
on the river, we decided to cast our
fortunes once more upon the sea, and
endeavor to regain the "outside"
surface of the earth.
</p><p>
   We made known our wishes, and
they were reluctantly but promptly
followed. Our hosts gave my father,
at his request, various maps showing
<pb n="140"/>
the entire "inside" surface of the
earth, its cities, oceans, seas, rivers,
gulfs and bays. They also generously
offered to give us all the bags of gold
nuggets&mdash;some of them as large as a
goose's egg&mdash;that we were willing to
attempt to take with us in our little
fishing-boat.
</p><p>
   In due time we returned to Jehu,
at which place we spent one month
in fixing up and overhauling our
little fishing sloop. After all was in
readiness, the same ship "Naz" that
originally discovered us, took us on
board and sailed to the mouth of the
river Hiddekel.
</p><p>
   After our giant brothers had
launched our little craft for us, they
were most cordially regretful at
parting, and evinced much solicitude for
<pb n="141"/>
our safety. My father swore by the
Gods Odin and Thor that he would
surely return again within a year or
two and pay them another visit. And
thus we bade them adieu. We made
ready and hoisted our sail, but there
was little breeze. We were becalmed
within an hour after our giant friends
had left us and started on their
return trip.
</p><p>
   The winds were constantly blowing
south, that is, they were blowing from
the northern opening of the earth
toward that which we knew to be south,
but which, according to our compass's
pointing finger, was directly north.
</p><p>
   For three days we tried to sail, and
to beat against the wind, but to no
avail. Whereupon my father said:
"My son, to return by the same route
<pb n="142"/>
as we came in is impossible at this
time of year. I wonder why we did
not think of this before. We have
been here almost two and a half
years; therefore, this is the season
when the sun is beginning to shine in
at the southern opening of the earth.
The long cold night is on in the
Spitzbergen country."
</p><p>
   "What shall we do?" I inquired.
</p><p>
   "There is only one thing we can
do," my father replied, "and that is
to go south." Accordingly, he turned
the craft about, gave it full reef, and
started by the compass north but, in
fact, directly south. The wind was
strong, and we seemed to have struck
a current that was running with
remarkable swiftness in the same
direction.
<pb n="143"/>
</p><p>
   In just forty days we arrived at
Delfi, a city we had visited in
company with our guides Jules Galdea
and his wife, near the mouth of the
Gihon river. Here we stopped for
two days, and were most hospitably
entertained by the same people who
had welcomed us on our former visit.
We laid in some additional provisions
and again set sail, following the
needle due north.
</p><p>
   On our outward trip we came
through a narrow channel which
appeared to be a separating body of
water between two considerable
bodies of land. There was a
beautiful beach to our right, and we decided
to reconnoiter. Casting anchor, we
waded ashore to rest up for a day
before continuing the outward
<pb n="144"/>
hazardous undertaking. We built a
fire and threw on some sticks of
dry drift-wood. While my father was
walking along the shore, I prepared a
tempting repast from supplies we
had provided.
</p><p>
   There was a mild, luminous light
which my father said resulted from
the sun shining in from the south
aperture of the earth. That night we
slept soundly, and awakened the next
morning as refreshed as if we had
been in our own beds at Stockholm.
</p><p>
   After breakfast we started out on
an inland tour of discovery, but had
not gone far when we sighted some
birds which we recognized at once as
belonging to the penguin family.
</p><p>
   They are flightless birds, but excellent
swimmers and tremendous in size,
<pb n="145"/>
with white breast, short wings, black
head, and long peaked bills. They
stand fully nine feet high. They
looked at us with little surprise, and
presently waddled, rather than
walked, toward the water, and swam
away in a northerly direction.<ref target="n21">[21]</ref>
</p><p>
   The events that occurred during the
following hundred or more days
beggar description. We were on an
open and iceless sea. The month we
reckoned to be November or December,
and we knew the so-called South

<pb n="146"/>
Pole was turned toward the sun.
Therefore, when passing out and
away from the internal electrical light
of "The Smoky God" and its genial
warmth, we would be met by the light
and warmth of the sun, shining in
through the south opening of the
earth. We were not mistaken.<ref target="n22">[22]</ref>
</p><p>
   There were times when our little
craft, driven by wind that was
continuous and persistent, shot through
the waters like an arrow. Indeed,

<pb n="147"/>
had we encountered a hidden rock or
obstacle, our little vessel would have
been crushed into kindling-wood.
</p><p>
   At last we were conscious that the
atmosphere was growing decidedly
colder, and, a few days later, icebergs
were sighted far to the left. My
father argued, and correctly, that the
winds which filled our sails came from
the warm climate "within." The
time of the year was certainly most
auspicious for us to make our dash
for the "outside" world and attempt
to scud our fishing sloop through open
channels of the frozen zone which
surrounds the polar regions.
</p><p>
   We were soon amid the ice-packs,
and how our little craft got through.
the narrow channels and escaped
being crushed I know not. The
<pb n="148"/>
compass behaved in the same drunken
and unreliable fashion in passing over
the southern curve or edge of the
earth's shell as it had done on our
in-bound trip at the northern entrance.
It gyrated, dipped and seemed like a
thing possessed.<ref target="n23">[23]</ref>

<pb n="149"/>
</p><p>
   One day as I was lazily looking
over the sloop's side into the clear
waters, my father shouted: "Breakers
ahead!" Looking up, I saw through
a lifting mist a white object that
towered several hundred feet high,
completely shutting off our advance.
We lowered sail immediately, and
none too soon. In a moment we found
ourselves wedged between two
monstrous icebergs. Each was crowding
and grinding against its fellow
mountain of ice. They were like two gods
of war contending for supremacy.
We were greatly alarmed. Indeed,
we were between the lines of a battle
royal; the sonorous thunder of the
grinding ice was like the continued
volleys of artillery. Blocks of ice
larger than a house were frequently
<pb n="150"/>
lifted up a hundred feet by the mighty
force of lateral pressure; they would
shudder and rock to and fro for a few
seconds, then come crashing down
with a deafening roar, and disappear
in the foaming waters. Thus, for
more than two hours, the contest of
the icy giants continued.
</p><p>
   It seemed as if the end had come.
The ice pressure was terrific, and
while we were not caught in the
dangerous part of the jam, and were
safe for the time being, yet the
heaving and rending of tons of ice as
it fell splashing here and there into
the watery depths filled us with shaking
fear.
</p><p>
   Finally, to our great joy, the
grinding of the ice ceased, and within a few
hours the great mass slowly divided,
<pb n="153"/>
and, as if an act of Providence had
been performed, right before us lay
an open channel. Should we venture
with our little craft into this opening?
If the pressure came on again, our
little sloop as well as ourselves would be
crushed into nothingness. We decided to
take the chance, and, accordingly,
hoisted our sail to a favoring
breeze, and soon started out like a
race-horse, running the gauntlet of
this unknown narrow channel of open
water.

PART FIVE<lb/>

AMONG THE ICE PACKS
</head>

<p><lb/>
FOR the next forty-five days our
time was employed in dodging
icebergs and hunting channels;
indeed, had we not been favored with a
strong south wind and a small boat, I
doubt if this story could have ever
been given to the world.
</p><p>
   At last, there came a morning when
my father said: "My son, I think we
are to see home. We are almost
through the ice. See! the open water
lies before us."
</p><p>
   However, there were a few icebergs
<pb n="155"/>
that had floated far northward into
the open water still ahead of us on
either side, stretching away for many
miles. Directly in front of us, and
by the compass, which had now
righted itself, due north, there was an
open sea.
</p><p>
   "What a wonderful story we have
to tell to the people of Stockholm,"
continued my father, while a look of
pardonable elation lighted up his
honest face. "And think of the gold
nuggets stowed away in the hold!"
</p><p>
   I spoke kind words of praise to my
father, not alone for his fortitude and
endurance, but also for his courageous
daring as a discoverer, and for
having made the voyage that now
promised a successful end. I was
grateful, too, that he had gathered
<pb n="156"/>
the wealth of gold we were carrying
home.
</p><p>
   While congratulating ourselves on
the goodly supply of provisions and
water we still had on hand, and on
the dangers we had escaped, we were
startled by hearing a most terrific
explosion, caused by the tearing apart
of a huge mountain of ice. It was
a deafening roar like the firing of a
thousand cannon. We were sailing at the
time with great speed, and happened to
be near a monstrous iceberg which to
all appearances was as immovable as a
rockbound island. It seemed, however,
that the iceberg had split and was
breaking apart, where-upon the balance
of the monster along which we were
sailing was destroyed, and it began
dipping from us. My
<pb n="157"/>
father quickly anticipated the danger
before I realized its awful possibilities.
The iceberg extended down into
the water many hundreds of feet, and,
as it tipped over, the portion coming
up out of the water caught our fishing-craft
like a lever on a fulcrum,
and threw it into the air as if it had
been a foot-ball.
</p><p>
   Our boat fell back on the iceberg,
that by this time had changed the side
next to us for the top. My father
was still in the boat, having become
entangled in the rigging, while I was
thrown some twenty feet away.
</p><p>
   I quickly scrambled to my feet and
shouted to my father, who answered:
"All is well." Just then a realization
dawned upon me. Horror upon
horror! The blood froze in my veins.
<pb n="158"/>
The iceberg was still in motion, and
its great weight and force in toppling
over would cause it to submerge
temporarily. I fully realized what a
sucking maelstrom it would produce amid
the worlds of water on every side. They
would rush into the depression in all
their fury, like white-fanged wolves
eager for human prey.
</p><p>
   In this supreme moment of mental
anguish, I remember glancing at our
boat, which was lying on its side, and
wondering if it could possibly right
itself, and if my father could escape.
Was this the end of our struggles and
adventures? Was this death? All
these questions flashed through my
mind in the fraction of a second, and
a moment later I was engaged in a life
and death struggle. The ponderous
<pb n="159"/>
monolith of ice sank below the
surface, and the frigid waters gurgled
around me in frenzied anger. I was
in a saucer, with the waters pouring
in on every side. A moment more
and I lost consciousness.
</p><p>
   When I partially recovered my
senses, and roused from the swoon of
a half-drowned man, I found myself
wet, stiff, and almost frozen, lying on
the iceberg. But there was no sign
of my father or of our little fishing
sloop. The monster berg had recovered
itself, and, with its new balance,
lifted its head perhaps fifty feet above
the waves. The top of this island of
ice was a plateau perhaps half an acre
in extent.
</p><p>
   I loved my father well, and was
grief-stricken at the awfulness of his
<pb n="160"/>
death. I railed at fate, that I, too,
had not been permitted to sleep with
him in the depths of the ocean.
Finally, I climbed to my feet and looked
about me. The purple-domed sky
above, the shoreless green ocean
beneath, and only an occasional iceberg
discernible! My heart sank in hopeless
despair. I cautiously picked my
way across the berg toward the other
side, hoping that our fishing craft had
righted itself.
</p><p>
   Dared I think it possible that my
father still lived? It was but a ray
of hope that flamed up in my heart.
But the anticipation warmed my
blood in my veins and started it
rushing like some rare stimulant through
every fiber of my body.
</p><p>
   I crept close to the precipitous side
<pb n="161"/>
of the iceberg, and peered far down,
hoping, still hoping. Then I made a
circle of the berg, scanning every foot
of the way, and thus I kept going
around and around. One part of my
brain was certainly becoming
maniacal, while the other part, I believe,
and do to this day, was perfectly
rational.
</p><p>
   I was conscious of having made the
circuit a dozen times, and while one
part of my intelligence knew, in all
reason, there was not a vestige of
hope, yet some strange fascinating
aberration bewitched and compelled
me still to beguile myself with
expectation. The other part of my brain
seemed to tell me that while there was
no possibility of my father being
alive, yet, if I quit making the
<pb n="162"/>
circuitous pilgrimage, if I paused for
a single moment, it would be
acknowledgment of defeat, and, should I do
this, I felt that I should go mad.
Thus, hour after hour I walked
around and around, afraid to stop and
rest, yet physically powerless to
continue much longer. Oh! horror of
horrors! to be cast away in this wide
expanse of waters without food or
drink, and only a treacherous iceberg
for an abiding place. My heart sank
within me, and all semblance of hope
was fading into black despair.
</p><p>
   Then the hand of the Deliverer was
extended, and the death-like stillness
of a solitude rapidly becoming
unbearable was suddenly broken by the
firing of a signal-gun. I looked up in
startled amazement, when, I saw, less
<pb n="163"/>
than a half-mile away, a whaling-vessel
bearing down toward me with her sail full set.
</p><p>
   Evidently my continued activity on
the iceberg had attracted their attention.
On drawing near, they put out a boat, and,
descending cautiously to the water's edge,
I was rescued, and a little later lifted
on board the whaling-ship.
</p><p>
   I found it was a Scotch whaler,
"The Arlington." She had cleared
from Dundee in September, and
started immediately for the Antarctic,
in search of whales. The captain,
Angus MacPherson, seemed kindly
disposed, but in matters of discipline,
as I soon learned, possessed of an iron
will. When I attempted to tell him
that I had come from the "inside" of
<pb n="164"/>
the earth, the captain and mate looked
at each other, shook their heads, and
insisted on my being put in a bunk
under strict surveillance of the ship's
physician.
</p><p>
   I was very weak for want of food,
and had not slept for many hours.
However, after a few days' rest, I got
up one morning and dressed myself
without asking permission of the physician
or anyone else, and told them
that I was as sane as anyone.
</p><p>
   The captain sent for me and again
questioned me concerning where I
had come from, and how I came to be
alone on an iceberg in the far off
Antarctic Ocean. I replied that I had
just come from the "inside" of the
earth, and proceeded to tell him how
my father and myself had gone in by
<pb n="167"/>
way of Spitzbergen, and come out by
way of the South Pole country,
whereupon I was put in irons. I
afterward heard the captain tell the mate
that I was as crazy as a March hare,
and that I must remain in confinement
until I was rational enough to
give a truthful account of myself.
</p><p>
   Finally, after much pleading and
many promises, I was released from
irons. I then and there decided to
invent some story that would satisfy the
captain, and never again refer to my
trip to the land of "The Smoky God,"
at least until I was safe among
friends.
</p><p>
   Within a fortnight I was permitted
to go about and take my place as one
of the seamen. A little later the
captain asked me for an explanation. I
<pb n="168"/>
told him that my experience had been
so horrible that I was fearful of my
memory, and begged him to permit
me to leave the question unanswered
until some time in the future. "I
think you are recovering considerably,"
he said, "but you are not sane
yet by a good deal." "Permit me to
do such work as you may assign," I
replied, "and if it does not compensate
you sufficiently, I will pay you
immediately after I reach Stockholm
&mdash;to the last penny." Thus the
mater rested.
</p><p>
   On finally reaching Stockholm, as
I have already related, I found that
my good mother had gone to her
reward more than a year before. I
have also told how, later, the treachery
of a relative landed me in a mad-<pb n="171"/>
house, where I remained for
twenty-eight years&mdash;seemingly
unending years&mdash;and, still later,
after my release, how I returned to
the life of a fisherman, following it
sedulously for twenty-seven years, then
how I came to America, and finally to Los
Angeles, California. But all this can
be of little interest to the reader.
Indeed, it seems to me the climax of
my wonderful travels and strange
adventures was reached when the Scotch
sailing-vessel took me from an iceberg
on the Antarctic Ocean.

CONCLUSION
</head>

<div2 type="section" id="d23">


<p><lb/>
IN concluding this history of my
adventures, I wish to state that I
firmly believe science is yet in its
infancy concerning the cosmology of
the earth. There is so much that is
unaccounted for by the world's
accepted knowledge of to-day, and will
ever remain so until the land of "The
Smoky God" is known and recognized
by our geographers.
</p><p>
   It is the land from whence came
the great logs of cedar that have
been found by explorers in open
waters far over the northern edge of
<pb n="173"/>
the earth's crust, and also the bodies
of mammoths whose bones are found
in vast beds on the Siberian coast.
</p><p>
   Northern explorers have done
much. Sir John Franklin, De
Haven Grinnell, Sir John Murray,
Kane, Melville, Hall, Nansen,
Schwatka, Greely, Peary, Ross, Gerlache,
Bernacchi, Andree, Amsden,
Amundson and others have all been
striving to storm the frozen citadel of
mystery.
</p><p>
   I firmly believe that Andree and
his two brave companions, Strindberg
and Fraenckell, who sailed
away in the balloon "Oreon" from
the northwest coast of Spitzbergen on
that Sunday afternoon of July 11,
1897, are now in the "within" world,
and doubtless are being entertained,
<pb n="174"/>
as my father and myself were entertained
by the kind-hearted giant race
inhabiting the inner Atlantic Continent.
</p><p>
   Having, in my humble way, devoted
years to these problems, I am
well acquainted with the accepted
definitions of gravity, as well as the
cause of the magnetic needle's
attraction, and I am prepared to say
that it is my firm belief that the
magnetic needle is influenced solely by
electric currents which completely
envelop the earth like a garment, and
that these electric currents in an
endless circuit pass out of the southern
end of the earth's cylindrical
opening, diffusing and spreading
themselves over all the "outside" surface,
and rushing madly on in their course
<pb n="175"/>
toward the North Pole. And while these
currents seemingly dash off into space
at the earth's curve or edge, yet they
drop again to the "inside" surface and
continue their way south-ward along the
inside of the earth's crust, toward the
opening of the so-called South
Pole.<ref target="n24">[24]</ref>
</p><p>
   As to gravity, no one knows what
it is, because it has not been
<pb n="176"/>
determined whether it is atmospheric
pressure that causes the apple to fall, or
whether, 150 miles below the surface
of the earth, supposedly one-half way
through the earth's crust, there exists
some powerful loadstone attraction
that draws it. Therefore, whether
the apple, when it leaves the limb of
the tree, is drawn or impelled downward
to the nearest point of resistance,
is unknown to the students of
physics.
</p><p>
   Sir James Ross claimed to have
discovered the magnetic pole at about
seventy-four degrees latitude. This
is wrong&mdash;the magnetic pole is
exactly one-half the distance through
the earth's crust. Thus, if the
earth's crust is three hundred miles
in thickness, which is the distance I
<pb n="177"/>
estimate it to be, then the magnetic
pole is undoubtedly one hundred and
fifty miles below the surface of the
earth, it matters not where the test
is made. And at this particular point
one hundred and fifty miles below
the surface, gravity ceases, becomes
neutralized; and when we pass
beyond that point on toward the
"inside" surface of the earth, a reverse
attraction geometrically increases in
power, until the other one hundred
and fifty miles of distance is
traversed, which would bring us out on
the "inside" of the earth.
</p><p>
   Thus, if a hole were bored down
through the earth's crust at London,
Paris, New York, Chicago, or Los
Angeles, a distance of three hundred
miles, it would connect the two
<pb n="178"/>
surfaces. While the inertia and momentum
of a weight dropped in from the "outside"
surface would carry it far past the magnetic
center, yet, before reaching the "inside"
surface of the earth it would gradually
diminish in speed, after passing the
half-way point, finally pause and
immediately fall back toward the
"out-side" surface, and continue thus to
oscillate, like the swinging of a
pendulum with the power removed,
until it would finally rest at the
magnetic center, or at that particular
point exactly one-half the distance
between the "outside" surface and
the "inside" surface of the earth.
</p><p>
   The gyration of the earth in its
daily act of whirling around in its
spiral rotation&mdash;at a rate greater
<pb n="179"/>
than one thousand miles every hour,
or about seventeen miles per second
&mdash;makes of it a vast electro-generating
body, a huge machine, a mighty
prototype of the puny-man-made
dynamo, which, at best, is but a feeble
imitation of nature's original,
</p><p>
   The valleys of this inner Atlantis
Continent, bordering the upper
waters of the farthest north are in
season covered with the most
magnificent and luxuriant flowers. Not
hundreds and thousands, but millions,
of acres, from which the pollen or
blossoms are carried far away in
almost every direction by the earth's
spiral gyrations and the agitation of
the wind resulting therefrom, and it
is these blossoms or pollen from the
vast floral meadows "within" that
<pb n="180"/>
produce the colored snows of the
Arctic regions that have so mystified
the northern explorers.<ref target="n25">[25]</ref>
</p><p>
   Beyond question, this new land
<pb n="181"/>
"within" is the home, the cradle, of
the human race, and viewed from the
standpoint of the discoveries made
by us, must of necessity have a most
important bearing on all physical,
paleontological, arch&aelig;ological,
philological and mythological theories of
antiquity.
</p><p>
   The same idea of going back to
the land of mystery&mdash;to the very
beginning&mdash;to the origin of man&mdash;is
found in Egyptian traditions of the
earlier terrestrial regions of the gods,
heroes and men, from the historical
fragments of Manetho, fully verified
by the historical records taken from
the more recent excavations of
Pompeii as well as the traditions of the
North American Indians.
<pb n="182"/>
</p><p>
   It is now one hour past midnight
&mdash;the new year of 1908 is here, and
this is the third day thereof, and
having at last finished the record of
my strange travels and adventures I
wish given to the world, I am ready,
and even longing, for the peaceful
rest which I am sure will follow life's
trials and vicissitudes. I am old in
years, and ripe both with adventures
and sorrows, yet rich with the few
friends I have cemented to me in my
struggles to lead a just and upright
life. Like a story that is well-nigh
told, my life is ebbing away. The
presentiment is strong within me that
I shall not live to see the rising of
another sun. Thus do I conclude my
message.

AUTHOR'S AFTERWORD
</head>

<p><lb/>
I FOUND much difficulty in deciphering
and editing the manuscripts of Olaf
Jansen. However, I have taken the liberty
of reconstructing only a very few expressions,
and in doing this have in no way changed
the spirit or meaning. Otherwise, the
original text has neither been added to
nor taken from.
</p><p>
   It is impossible for me to express
my opinion as to the value or reliability
of the wonderful statements made by Olaf
Jansen. The description here given of the
strange lands
<pb n="184"/>
and people visited by him, location of
cities, the names and directions of
rivers, and other information herein
combined, conform in every way to
the rough drawings given into my
custody by this ancient Norseman,
which drawings together with the
manuscript it is my intention at some
later date to give to the Smithsonian
Institution, to preserve for the
benefit of those interested in the mysteries
of the "Farthest North"&mdash;the frozen
circle of silence. It is certain there
are many things in Vedic literature,
in "Josephus," the "Odyssey," the
"Iliad," Terrien de Lacouperie's
"Early History of Chinese Civilization,"
Flammarion's "Astronomical
Myths," Lenormant's "Beginnings
of History," Hesiod's "Theogony,"
<pb n="185"/>
Sir John de Maundeville's writings,
and Sayce's "Records of the Past,"
that, to say the least, are strangely in
harmony with the seemingly incredible
text found in the yellow manuscript of
the old Norseman, Olaf Jansen, and now
for the first time given to the world.
