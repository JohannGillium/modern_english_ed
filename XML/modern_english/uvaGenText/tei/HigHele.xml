<p><hi rend="small-caps">THE</hi> news of the death of Mrs. Helen Jackson   &mdash;   better known as
"H. H."   &mdash;   will probably carry a pang of regret into more American
homes than similar intelligence in regard to any other woman, with
the possible exception of Mrs. H. B. Stowe, who belongs to an
earlier literary generation.  With this last-named exception, no
American woman has produced literary work of such marked
ability.  Her fame was limited by the comparatively late period at
which she began to write, and by her preference for a somewhat
veiled and disguised way of writing.  It is hard for two initial letters
to cross the Atlantic, and she had therefore no European fame; and
as she took apparently a real satisfaction in concealing her identity
and mystifying her public, it is very likely that the authorship of
some of her best prose work will never be absolutely known.
Enough remained, however, to give her a peculiar both hold upon
thoughtful and casual readers.</p>
   <p>Helen Maria (Fiske) Jackson was the daughter of Prof. Nathan
W. Fiske, of Amherst College, whose 'Manual of Classical
Literature,' based on that of Eschenberg, was long in use in our
colleges, and who wrote several other books.  She was born in
Amherst, Mass., October 18, 1831; her mother's maiden name being
Vinal.  The daughter was educated in part at Ipswich (Mass.)
Female Seminary, and in part at the school of the Rev. J. S. C.
Abbott in this city.  She was early married to Captain (afterward
Major) Edward B. Hunt, an eminent engineer officer of the United
States Army.  Major Hunt was a man of scientific attainments quite
unusual in his profession, was a member of various learned
societies, and for some time an assistant professor at West Point.
He contributed to one of the early volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic
Monthly</hi> (xii, 794) a paper on "Military Bridges."  His wife
resided with him at various military stations   &mdash;   West Point,
Washington, Newport, R. I., etc.   &mdash;   and they had several children, all
of whom died very young except one boy, Rennie, who lived to the
age of eight or ten, showing extraordinary promise.  His death and
that of Major Hunt   &mdash;   who was killed in 1863 by the discharge of
suffocating vapors from a submarine battery of his own invention &mdash;
left Mrs. Hunt alone in the world, and she removed her residence a
year or two after to Newport, R. I., where the second period of her
life began.
</p><p>Up to this time she had given absolutely no signs of literary
talent.  She had been absorbed in her duties as wife and mother, and
had been fond of society, in which she was always welcome
because of her vivacity, wit, and ready sympathy.  In Newport she
found herself, from various causes, under strong literary influences,
appealing to tastes that developed rapidly in herself.  She soon
began to publish poems, one of the first of which, if not the first   &mdash;   a
translation from Victor Hugo   &mdash;   appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>.
Others of her poems, perhaps her best   &mdash;   including the sonnets
"Burnt Ships" and "Ariadne's Farewell"   &mdash;   appeared also in the
<hi rend="italic">Nation</hi>.  Not long after, she began to print short papers on
domestic subjects in the <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi> and elsewhere, and
soon found herself thoroughly embarked in a literary career.  Her
first poem in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> appeared in February,
1869; and her volume of 'Verses' was printed at her own expense in
1870, being reprinted with some enlargement in 1871, and again,
almost doubled in size, in 1874.  Her 'Bits of Travel' (1872) was
made up of sketches of a tour in Europe in 1868-9; a portion of
these, called 'Encyclicals of a Traveller,' having been originally
written as circular letters to her many friends and then printed &mdash;
rather against her judgment, but at the urgent request of Mr. J. T.
Fields   &mdash;   almost precisely as they were written.  Upon this followed
'Bits of Talk About Home Matters' (1873), 'Bits of Talk for Young
Folks' (1876), and 'Bits of Travel at Home' (1878).  These, with a
little poem called 'The Story of Boon,' constituted, for some time,
all her acknowledged volumes; but it is now no secret that she wrote
two of the most successful novels of the "No Name" series   &mdash;   'Mercy
Philbrick's Choice' (1876) and 'Hetty's Strange History' (1877).  We
do not propose here to enter into the vexed question of the
authorship of the "Saxe Holm" stories, which appeared in the early
volumes of <hi rend="italic">Scribner's Monthly</hi>, and were published in two
volumes (1873, 1878).  The secret was certainly very well kept, and
in spite of her denials, they were very often attributed to her by
readers and critics.
</p><p>Her residence in Newport as a busy and successful literary
woman thus formed a distinct period of her life, quite apart from the
epoch which preceded it and from the later one which followed.  A
change soon came.  Her health was never very strong, and she was
liable to severe attacks of diphtheria, to relieve which she tried the
climate of Colorado.  She finally took up her residence there, and
was married, about 1876, to William S. Jackson, a merchant of
Colorado Springs.  She had always had the greatest love for travel
and exploration, and found unbounded field for this in her new life,
driving many miles a day over precipitous roads, and thinking little
of crossing the continent by rail from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  In
the course of these journeys she became profoundly interested in
the wrongs of the Indians, and for the rest of her life all literary
interests and ambitions were utterly subordinated to this.  During a
winter of hard work at the Astor Library in this city she prepared her
'Century of Dishonor' (1881).  As one result of this book she was
appointed by the United States Government as one of two
commissioners (Abbot Kinney being the other) to examine and
report upon "the condition and needs of the Mission Indians of
California."  Their report, to which Mrs. Jackson's name is first
signed, is dated at Colorado Springs, July 13, 1883, and is a
thoroughly business-like document of thirty-five pages.
</p><p>As another fruit of this philanthropic interest, she wrote,
during another winter in this city, her


<pb n="151"/>

novel, 'Ramona,' a book composed with the greatest rapidity, and
printed first in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Union</hi>, afterward appearing in a
volume in 1884.  Its sole object was further to delineate the wrongs
of the aborigines.  Besides these two books, she wrote, during this
later period, some children's stories, 'Nelly's Silver Mine, a Story of
Colorado Life' (1878), and two little volumes of tales about cats.
But her lifework, as she viewed it at the end, was in her two books
in behalf of the Indians.  In one of her last letters to her Eastern
friends she said (July 27, 1885):

 <q>"I feel that my work is done, and I am heartily, honestly, and
cheerfully ready to go.  In fact, I am glad to go.  You have never
fully realized how for the last four years my whole heart has been
full of the Indian cause   &mdash;   how I have felt, as the Quakers say, 'a
concern' to work for it.  My 'Century of Dishonor' and 'Ramona' are
the only things I have done of which I am glad now.  The rest is of
no moment.  They will live, and they will bear fruit.  They already
have.  The change in public feeling on the Indian question in the last
three years is marvellous; an Indians Rights' Association in every
large city in the land. . . .  Every word of the Indian history in
'Ramona' is literally true, and it is being re-enacted here every day.</q>
    <q>"I did mean to write a child's story on the same theme as
'Ramona,' but I doubt if I could have made it so telling a stroke, so
perhaps it is as well that I shall not do it.  And perhaps I shall do it
after all, but I cannot conceive of getting well after such an illness
as this."</q></p>

<p>In all this there was not a trace of personal vanity or display;
there never was a more complete absorption in a "cause" than that
of this woman, whose earlier years had been so different.  But in all
else she remained the same; time could not dim her vivacity, her
freshness, her wit, her winning and persuasive manners.  Few
women who have such variety of nature as she had, make friends so
warmly or so easily, or light up life for these friends in so many
different ways.  Her likes and dislikes were spontaneous, ardent,
sometimes unjust; yet even the injustice was sometimes an
inaccurately aimed impulse of justice in disguise; and when she was
convinced of it   &mdash;   which indeed was not always   &mdash;   she would be
quick to apologize to any one whom she had wronged.  In literature
her work was conscientious and thorough beyond that of almost any
American woman; she never slighted it, never wilfully neglected
details, never was weary of trying to perfect it.  This applies
especially to her prose.  For her poetry, it is enough to say that it has
won the applause of very fastidious critics   &mdash;   including emphatically
the late Mr. R. W. Emerson   &mdash;   while her simpler poems are to be
found widely distributed through the cottages and log-huts of our
furthest borders, and have given comfort to many hearts.  Many
notices of her separate books may be found scattered through the
magazines; but we can recall no systematic critical essay on her
qualities as a writer except that contained in Higginson's 'Short
Studies of American Authors.'
</p><p>Mrs. Jackson died far away from home and kindred; but the
spirit with which she met death may be seen in a further extract
which we are permitted to make from the letter already mentioned.
It would be difficult to imagine a worthier ending to a life marked
by steady progress in the direction of unselfish aims:

</p><q>"As you say, we may meet and 'smile over these solicitudes.'
But I do not think we shall   &mdash;   and I want you to know that I am
looking with almost an eager interest into the 'undiscovered
country,' and leaving this earth with no regret except that I have not
accomplished more work; especially that it was so late in the day
when I began to work in real earnest.  But I do not doubt we shall
keep on working.  Do you not believe so?  Any other conception of
existence is to me monstrous.  It seems to me also impossible that
we shall not be able to return to this earth and see our loved ones.
Whether we can in any way communicate with them I doubt   &mdash;   but
that we can see them I believe."</q>
