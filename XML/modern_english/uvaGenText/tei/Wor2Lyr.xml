<head>LYRICAL BALLADS<lb/> 
William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge<lb/> 
<lb/> 
<pb/>

Editor's note: </head>

<p>This is the original version of <hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi>, taken 
from the first anonymous Bristol imprint of 1798. No attempt has been made 
to correct the text, with the exception that the corrections indicated on 
the original errata slip have been made. The copy in the British Museum 
contains two tables of contents, one including Coleridge's "The 
Nightingale," while the other includes his "Lewti." Both poems appear in 
the book, with duplicate pagination, and this has been retained as found in 
the original. Pagination appears to the right of your screen; when no folio 
number is found at the head of a page, the corresponding page number is 
shown here within parentheses. Although this electronic text has been 
proofread, no warranty is made or implied as to its accuracy. The editor 
does not wish to copyright his presentation of this book, and places it in 
the public domain for the enjoyment of scholars and general readers alike.

<head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head> 
 
<p>It is the honourable characteristic of Poetry that its materials are to be 
found in every subject which can interest the human mind. The evidence of 
this fact is to be sought, not in the writings of Critics, but in those of 
Poets themselves. 
 
</p><p>The majority of the following poems are to be considered as experiments. 
They were written chiefly with a view to ascertain how far the language of 
conversation in the middle and lower classes of society is adapted to the 
purposes of poetic pleasure. Readers accustomed to the 
<pb n="ii"/> 
gaudiness and inane 
phraseology of many modern writers, if they persist in reading this book to 
its conclusion, will perhaps frequently have to struggle with feelings of 
strangeness and aukwardness: they will look round for poetry, and will be 
induced to enquire by what species of courtesy these attempts can be 
permitted to assume that title. It is desirable that such readers, for 
their own sakes, should not suffer the solitary word Poetry, a word of very 
disputed meaning, to stand in the way of their gratification; but that, 
while they are perusing this book, they should ask themselves if it 
contains a natural delineation of human passions, human characters, and 
human incidents; and if the answer be favorable to the author's wishes, 
that they should consent to be pleased in spite of that most dreadful enemy 
to our pleasures, our own pre-established codes of decision. 
<pb n="iii"/> 
</p><p>Readers of superior judgment may disapprove of the style in which many of 
these pieces are executed it must be expected that many lines and phrases 
will not exactly suit their taste. It will perhaps appear to them, that 
wishing to avoid the prevalent fault of the day, the author has sometimes 
descended too low, and that many of his expressions are too familiar, and 
not of sufficient dignity. It is apprehended, that the more conversant the 
reader is with our elder writers, and with those in modern times who have 
been the most successful in painting manners and passions, the fewer 
complaints of this kind will he have to make. 
 
</p><p>An accurate taste in poetry, and in all the other arts, Sir Joshua Reynolds 
has observed, is an acquired talent, which can only be produced by severe 
thought, and a long continued intercourse with the best models of 
composition. This is 
<pb n="iv"/>
 
mentioned not so much with so ridiculous a purpose as 
to prevent the most inexperienced reader from judging for himself; but 
merely to temper the rashness of decision, and to suggest that if poetry be 
a subject on which much time has not been bestowed, the judgment may be 
erroneous, and that in many cases it necessarily will be so. 
 
</p><p>The tale of Goody Blake and Harry Gill is founded on a well-authenticated 
fact which hap pened in Warwickshire. Of the other poems in the collection, 
it may be proper to say that they are either absolute inventions of the 
author, or facts which took place within his personal observation or that 
of his friends. The poem of the Thorn, as the reader will soon discover, is 
not supposed to be spoken in the author's own person: the character of the 
loquacious narrator will sufficiently shew itself in the course of the 
story. The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere was professedly 
<pb n="v"/>
 
written in 
imitation of the <hi rend="italic">style</hi>, as well as of the spirit, of the elder poets; but 
with a few exceptions, the Author believes that the language adopted in it 
has been equally intelligible for these three last centuries. The lines 
entitled Expostulation and Reply, and those which follow, arose out of 
conversation with a friend who was somewhat unreasonably attached to modern 
books of moral philosophy.

<l>I never saw the man whom you describe.</l> 
</sp><sp> 
<speaker>                    MARIA.</speaker> 
<l>'Tis strange! He spake of you familiarly</l> 
<l>As mine and Albert's common Foster-mother.</l> 
</sp><sp> 
<speaker>                FOSTER-MOTHER.</speaker> 
<l>Now blessings on the man, whoe'er he be,</l> 
<l>That joined your names with mine! O my sweet lady,</l> 
<l>As often as I think of those dear times</l> 
<l>When you two little ones would stand at eve</l> 
<l>On each side of my chair, and make me learn</l> 
<l>All you had learnt in the day; and how to talk</l> 
<pb n="54"/>
 
<l>In gentle phrase, then bid me sing to you &mdash; </l> 
<l>'Tis more like heaven to come than what has been.</l> 
</sp><sp> 
<speaker>                    MARIA.</speaker> 
<l>O my dear Mother! this strange man has left me</l> 
<l>Troubled with wilder fancies, than the moon</l> 
<l>Breeds in the love-sick maid who gazes at it,</l> 
<l>Till lost in inward vision, with wet eye</l> 
<l>She gazes idly! &mdash; But that entrance, Mother!</l> 
</sp><sp> 
<speaker>                FOSTER-MOTHER.</speaker> 
<l>Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale!</l> 
</sp><sp> 
<speaker>                    MARIA.</speaker> 
<l>No one.</l> 
</sp><sp> 
<speaker>                FOSTER-MOTHER</speaker> 
<l>        My husband's father told it me,</l> 
<l>Poor old Leoni! &mdash; Angels rest his soul!</l> 
<l>He was a woodman, and could fell and saw</l> 
<l>With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam</l> 
<l>Which props the hanging wall of the old chapel?</l> 
<l>Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree</l> 
<pb n="55"/>
 
<l>He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined</l> 
<l>With thistle-beards, and such small locks of wool</l> 
<l>As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home, And</l> 
<l>reared him at the then Lord Velez' cost.</l> 
<l>And so the babe grew up a pretty boy,</l> 
<l>A pretty boy, but most unteachable &mdash; </l> 
<l>And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead,</l> 
<l>But knew the names of birds, and mocked their notes,</l> 
<l>And whistled, as he were a bird himself:</l> 
<l>And all the autumn 'twas his only play</l> 
<l>To get the seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them</l> 
<l>With earth and water, on the stumps of trees.</l> 
<l>A Friar, who gathered simples in the wood,</l> 
<l>A grey-haired man &mdash; he loved this little boy,</l> 
<l>The boy loved him &mdash; and, when the Friar taught him,</l> 
<l>He soon could write with the pen: and from that time,</l> 
<l>Lived chiefly at the Convent or the Castle.</l> 
<l>So he became a very learned youth.</l> 
<l>But Oh! poor wretch! &mdash; he read, and read, and read,</l> 
<l>'Till his brain turned &mdash; and ere his twentieth year,</l> 
<pb n="56"/>
 
<l>He had unlawful thoughts of many things:</l> 
<l>And though he prayed, he never loved to pray</l> 
<l>With holy men, nor in a holy place &mdash; </l> 
<l>But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet,</l> 
<l>The late Lord Velez ne'er was wearied with him.</l> 
<l>At once, as by the north side of the Chapel</l> 
<l>They stood together, chained in deep discourse,</l> 
<l>The earth heaved under them with such a groan,</l> 
<l>That the wall tottered, and had well-nigh fallen</l> 
<l>Right on their heads. My Lord was sorely frightened;</l> 
<l>A fever seized him, and he made confession</l> 
<l>Of all the heretical and lawless talk</l> 
<l>Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seized</l> 
<l>And cast into that hole. My husband's father</l> 
<l>Sobbed like a child &mdash; it almost broke his heart:</l> 
<l>And once as he was working in the cellar,</l> 
<l>He heard a voice distinctly; 'twas the youth's,</l> 
<l>Who sung a doleful song about green fields,</l> 
<l>How sweet it were on lake or wild savannah,</l> 
<l>To hunt for food, and be a naked man,</l> 
<pb n="57"/>
 
<l>And wander up and down at liberty.</l> 
<l>He always doted on the youth, and now</l> 
<l>His love grew desperate; and defying death,</l> 
<l>He made that cunning entrance I described:</l> 
<l>And the young man escaped.</l> 
</sp><sp> 
<speaker>                    MARIA.</speaker> 
<l>                    'Tis a sweet tale:</l> 
<l>Such as would lull a listening child to sleep,</l> 
<l>His rosy face besoiled with unwiped tears.</l> 
<l>And what became of him?</l> 
</sp><sp> 
<speaker>                FOSTER-MOTHER</speaker> 
<l>                He went on ship-board</l> 
<l>With those bold voyagers, who made discovery</l> 
<l>Of golden lands. Leoni's younger brother</l> 
<l>Went likewise, and when he returned to Spain,</l> 
<l>He told Leoni, that the poor mad youth,</l> 
<l>Soon after they arrived in that new world,</l> 
<l>In spite of his dissuasion, seized a boat,</l> 
<l>And all alone, set sail by silent moonlight</l> 
<pb n="58"/>
 
<l>Up a great river, great as any sea,</l> 
<l>And ne'er was heard of more: but 'tis supposed,</l> 
<l>He lived and died among the savage men.</l></sp>

<l>First covered o'er, and taught this aged tree,</l> 
<l>now wild, to bend its arms in circling shade,</l> 
<l>I well remember. &mdash; He was one who own'd</l> 
<l>No common soul. In youth, by genius nurs'd,</l> 
<l>And big with lofty views, he to the world</l> 
<l>Went forth pure in his heart, against the taint</l> 
<l>Of dissolute tongues, 'gainst jealousy, and hate,</l> 
<l>And scorn, against all enemies prepared,</l> 
<l>All but neglect: and so, his spirit damped</l> 
<l>At once, with rash disdain he turned away,</l> 
<l>And with the food of pride sustained his soul</l> 
<l>In solitude. &mdash; Stranger! these gloomy boughs</l> 
<l>Had charms for him; and here he loved to sit,</l> 
<l>His only visitants a straggling sheep,</l> 
<l>The stone-chat, or the glancing sand-piper;</l> 
<l>And on these barren rocks, with juniper,</l> 
<l>And heath, and thistle, thinly sprinkled o'er,</l> 
<l>Fixing his downward eye, he many an hour</l> 
<l>A morbid pleasure nourished, tracing here</l> 
<l>An emblem of his own unfruitful life:</l> 
<pb n="61"/>
 
<l>And lifting up his head, he then would gaze</l> 
<l>On the more distant scene; how lovely 'tis</l> 
<l>Thou seest, and he would gaze till it became</l> 
<l>Far lovelier, and his heart could not sustain</l> 
<l>The beauty still more beauteous. Nor, that time,</l> 
<l>Would he forget those beings, to whose minds,</l> 
<l>Warm from the labours of benevolence,</l> 
<l>The world, and man himself, appeared a scene</l> 
<l>Of kindred loveliness: then he would sigh</l> 
<l>With mournful joy, to think that others felt</l> 
<l>What he must never feel: and so, lost man!</l> 
<l>On visionary views would fancy feed,</l> 
<l>Till his eye streamed with tears. In this deep vale</l> 
<l>He died, this seat his only monument.</l> 
</lg><lg type="verse"> 
<l>If thou be one whose heart the holy forms</l> 
<l>Of younger imagination have kept pure,</l> 
<l>Stranger! henceforth be warned; and know, that pride,</l> 
<l>Howe'er disguised in its own majesty,</l> 
<l>Is littleness; that he, who feels contempt</l> 
<pb n="62"/>
 
<l>For any living thing, hath faculties</l> 
<l>Which he has never used; that thought with him</l> 
<l>Is in its infancy. The man, whose eye</l> 
<l>Is ever on himself, doth look on one,</l> 
<l>The least of nature's works, one who might move</l> 
<l>The wise man to that scorn which wisdom holds</l> 
<l>Unlawful, ever. O, be wiser thou!</l> 
<l>Instructed that true knowledge leads to love,</l> 
<l>True dignity abides with him alone</l> 
<l>Who, in the silent hour of inward thought,</l>

<hi rend="italic">"Most musical,  most  melancholy</hi>."  This  passage  in  Milton 
possesses an excellence far superior to that of mere description: 
it is spoken  in  the  character  of  the melancholy Man, and has 
therefore a  *dramatic* propriety.  The Author makes this remark, 
to rescue himself from  the  charge of having alluded with levity 
to a line of Milton:  a  charge  than  which  none  could be more 
painful  to him, except  perhaps  that  of  having  ridiculed his 
Bible.

<l>With fast thick warble his delicious notes,</l> 
<l>As he were fearful, that an April night</l> 
<l>Would be too short for him to utter forth</l> 
<l>His love-chant, and disburden his full soul</l> 
<l>Of all its music! And I know a grove</l> 
<l>Of large extent, hard by a castle huge</l> 
<l>Which the great lord inhabits not: and so</l> 
<l>This grove is wild with tangling underwood,</l> 
<l>And the trim walks are broken up, and grass,</l> 
<l>Thin grass and king-cups grow within the paths.</l> 
<l>But never elsewhere in one place I knew</l> 
<l>So many Nightingales: and far and near</l> 
<l>In wood and thicket over the wide grove</l> 
<l>They answer and provoke each other's songs &mdash; </l> 
<l>With skirmish and capricious passagings,</l> 
<l>And murmurs musical and swift jug jug</l> 
<l>And one low piping sound more sweet than all &mdash; </l> 
<pb n="67"/>
 
<l>Stirring the air with such an harmony,</l> 
<l>That should you close your eyes, you might almost</l> 
<l>Forget it was not day! On moonlight bushes,</l> 
<l>Whose dewy leafits are but half disclos'd,</l> 
<l>You may perchance behold them on the twigs,</l> 
<l>Their bright, bright eyes, their eyes both bright and full,</l> 
<l>Glistning, while many a glow-worm in the shade</l> 
<l>Lights up her love-torch.</l> 
</lg><lg type="verse"> 
<l>                          A most gentle maid</l>

<l>Hath heard a pause of silence: till the Moon</l>

<l>With one sensation, and those wakeful Birds</l>

<l>Many a Nightingale perch giddily</l> 
<l>On blosmy twig still swinging from the breeze,</l> 
<l>And to that motion tune his wanton song,</l> 
<l>Like tipsy Joy that reels with tossing head.</l>

<l>Who, capable of no articulate sound,</l> 
<l>Mars all things with his imitative lisp,</l> 
<l>How he would place his hand beside his ear,</l> 
<l>His little hand, the small forefinger up,</l> 
<l>And bid us listen! And I deem it wise</l> 
<pb n="69"/>
 
<l>To make him Nature's playmate. He knows well</l> 
<l>The evening star: and once when he awoke</l> 
<l>In most distressful mood (some inward pain</l> 
<l>Had made up that strange thing, an infant's dream)</l> 
<l>I hurried with him to our orchard plot,</l> 
<l>And he beholds the moon, and hush'd at once</l> 
<l>Suspends his sobs, and laughs most silently,</l> 
<l>While his fair eyes that swam with undropt tears</l> 
<l>Did glitter in the yellow moon-beam! Well-</l> 
<l>It is a father's tale. But if that Heaven</l> 
<l>Should give me life, his childhood shall grow up</l> 
<l>Familiar with these songs, that with the night</l> 
<l>He may associate Joy! Once more farewell,</l> 
<l>Sweet Nightingale! once more, my friends! farewell.</l></lg>

<l>Came, where beneath the trees a faggot blazed;</l>

<l>What could I do, unaided and unblest?</l> 
<l>Poor Father! gone was every friend of thine.</l> 
<l>And kindred of dead husband are at best</l> 
<l>Small help, and after marriage such as mine,</l> 
<l>With little kindness would to me incline.</l> 
<l>Ill was I then for toil or service fit:</l> 
<l>With tears whose course no effort could confine,</l> 
<l>By high-way side forgetful would I sit</l> 
<l>Whole hours, my idle arms in moping sorrow knit.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>I liv'd upon the mercy of the fields,</l>

<l>On hazard, or what general bounty yields,</l> 
<l>Now coldly given, now utterly refused.</l> 
<l>The fields I for my bed have often used:</l> 
<l>But, what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth</l> 
<l>Is, that I have my inner self abused,</l> 
<l>Foregone the home delight of constant truth,</l> 
<l>And clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="84"/>
 
<l>Three years a wanderer, often have I view'd,</l> 
<l>In tears, the sun towards that country tend</l> 
<l>Where my poor heart lost all its fortitude:</l> 
<l>And now across this moor my steps I bend &mdash; </l> 
<l>Oh! tell me whither &mdash; for no earthly friend</l> 
<l>Have I. &mdash; She ceased, and weeping turned away,</l> 
<l>As if because her tale was at an end</l> 
<l>She wept; &mdash; because she had no more to say</l> 
<l>Of that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay.</l></lg>

<l>Oh! what's the matter?</l> 
<l>What is't that ails young Harry Gill?</l> 
<l>That evermore his teeth they chatter,</l> 
<l>Chatter, chatter, chatter still.</l> 
<l>Of waistcoats Harry has no lack,</l> 
<l>Good duffle grey, and flannel fine;</l> 
<l>He has a blanket on his back,</l> 
<l>And coats enough to smother nine.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="86"/>
 
<l>In March, December, and in July,</l> 
<l>'Tis all the same with Harry Gill;</l> 
<l>The neighbors tell, and tell you truly,</l> 
<l>His teeth they chatter, chatter still.</l> 
<l>At night, at morning, and at noon,</l> 
<l>'Tis all the same with Harry Gill;</l> 
<l>Beneath the sun, beneath the moon,</l> 
<l>His teeth they chatter, chatter still.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Young Harry was a lusty drover,</l> 
<l>And who so stout of limb as he?</l> 
<l>His cheeks were red as ruddy clover,</l> 
<l>His voice was like the voice of three.</l> 
<l>Auld Goody Blake was old and poor,</l> 
<l>Ill fed she was, and thinly clad;</l> 
<l>And any man who pass'd her door,</l> 
<l>Might see how poor a hut she had.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="87"/>
 
<l>All day she spun in her poor dwelling,</l> 
<l>And then her three hours' work at night!</l> 
<l>Alas! 'twas hardly worth the telling,</l> 
<l>It would not pay for candle-light.</l> 
<l> &mdash; This woman dwelt in Dorsetshire,</l> 
<l>Her hut was on a clod hill-side,</l> 
<l>And in that country coals are dear,</l> 
<l>For they come far by wind and tide.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>By the same fire to boil their pottage,</l> 
<l>Two poor old dames, As I have known,</l> 
<l>Will often live in one small cottage,</l> 
<l>But she, poor woman, dwelt alone.</l> 
<l>'Twas well enough when summer came,</l> 
<l>The long, warm, lightsome summer-day,</l> 
<l>Then at her door the <hi rend="italic">canty</hi> dame</l> 
<l>Would sit, as any linnet gay.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="88"/>
 
<l>But when the ice our streams did fetter,</l> 
<l>Oh! then how her old bones would shake!</l> 
<l>You would have said, if you had met her,</l> 
<l>'Twas a hard time for Goody Blake.</l> 
<l>Her evenings then were dull and dead;</l> 
<l>Sad case it was, as you may think,</l> 
<l>For very cold to go to bed,</l> 
<l>And then for cold not sleep a wink.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Oh joy for her! when e'er in winter</l> 
<l>The winds at night had made a rout,</l> 
<l>And scatter'd many a lusty splinter,</l> 
<l>And many a rotten bough about.</l> 
<l>Yet never had she, well or sick,</l> 
<l>As every man who knew her says,</l> 
<l>A pile before-hand, wood or stick,</l> 
<l>Enough to warm her for three days.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="89"/>
 
<l>Now when the frost was past enduring,</l> 
<l>And made her poor old bones to ache,</l> 
<l>Could any thing be more alluring,</l> 
<l>Than an old hedge to Goody Blake?</l> 
<l>And now and then, it must be said,</l> 
<l>When her old bones were cold and chill,</l> 
<l>She left her fire, or left her bed,</l> 
<l>To seek the hedge of Harry Gill.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Now Harry he had long suspected</l> 
<l>This trespass of old Goody blake,</l> 
<l>And vow'd that she should be detexted,</l> 
<l>And he on her would vengeance take.</l> 
<l>And oft from his warm fire he'd go,</l> 
<l>And to the fields his road would take,</l> 
<l>And there, at night, in frost and snow,</l> 
<l>He watch'd to seize old Goody Blake.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="90"/>
 
<l>And once, behind a rick of barley,</l> 
<l>Thus looking out did Harry stand;</l> 
<l>The moon was full and shining clearly,</l> 
<l>And crisp with frost the stubble-and.</l> 
<l> &mdash; He hears a noise &mdash; he's all awake &mdash; </l> 
<l>Again? &mdash; on tiptoe down the hill</l> 
<l>He softly creeps &mdash; 'Tis Goody Blake,</l> 
<l>She's at the hedge of Harry Gill.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Right glad was he when he beheld her:</l> 
<l>Stick after stick did Goody pull,</l> 
<l>He stood behind a bush of elder,</l> 
<l>Till she had filled her apron full.</l> 
<l>When with her load she turned about,</l> 
<l>The bye-road back again to take,</l> 
<l>He started forward with a shout,</l> 
<l>And sprang upon poor Goody Blake.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="91"/>
 
<l>And fiercely by the arm he took her,</l> 
<l>And by the arm he held her fast,</l> 
<l>And fiercely by the arm he shook her,</l> 
<l>And cried, "I've caught you at last!"</l> 
<l>Then Goody, who had nothing said,</l> 
<l>Her bundle from her lap let fall;</l> 
<l>And kneeling on the sticks, she pray'd</l> 
<l>To God that is the judge of all.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>She pray'd, her wither'd hand uprearing,</l> 
<l>While Harry held her by the arm &mdash; </l> 
<l>"God! who art never out of hearing,</l> 
<l>"O may he never more be warm!"</l> 
<l>The cold, cold moon above her head,</l> 
<l>Thus on her knees did Goody pray,</l> 
<l>Young Harry heard what she had said,</l> 
<l>And icy-cold he turned away.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="92"/>
 
<l>He went complaining all the morrow</l> 
<l>That he was cold and very chill:</l> 
<l>His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow,</l> 
<l>Alas! that day for Harry Gill!</l> 
<l>That day he wore a riding-coat,</l> 
<l>But not a whit the warmer he:</l> 
<l>Another was on Thursday brought,</l> 
<l>And ere the Sabbath he had three.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>'Twas all in vain, a useless matter,</l> 
<l>And blankets were about him pinn'd;</l> 
<l>Yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter,</l> 
<l>Like a loose casement in the wind.</l> 
<l>And Harry's flesh it fell away;</l> 
<l>And all who see him say 'tis plain,</l> 
<l>That live as long as live he may,</l> 
<l>He never will be warm again.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="93"/>
 
<l>No word to any man he utters,</l> 
<l>A-bed or up, to young or old;</l> 
<l>But ever to himself he mutters,</l> 
<l>"Poor Harry Gill is very cold."</l> 
<l>A-bed or up, by night or day;</l> 
<l>His teeth they chatter, chatter still.</l> 
<l>Now think, ye farmers all, I pray,</l>

<l>In the sweet shire of Cardigan,</l> 
<l>Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall,</l> 
<l>An old man dwells, a little man,</l> 
<l>I've heard he once was tall.</l> 
<l>Of years he has upon his back,</l> 
<l>No doubt, a burthen weighty;</l> 
<l>He says he is three score and ten,</l> 
<l>But others say he's eighty.</l>

<l>A long blue livery-coat has he,</l> 
<l>That's fair behind, and fair before;</l> 
<l>Yet, meet him where you will, you see</l> 
<l>At once that he is poor.</l> 
<l>Full five and twenty years he lived</l> 
<l>A running huntsman merry;</l> 
<l>And, though he has but one eye left,</l> 
<l>His cheek is like a cherry.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>No man like him the horn could sound,</l> 
<l>And no man was so full of glee;</l> 
<l>To say the least, four counties round</l>

<l>His master's dead, and no one now</l>

<l>He has no son, he has no child,</l>

<l>When he was young he little knew</l>

<l>He all the country could outrun,</l> 
<l>Could leave both man and horse behind;</l>

<l>And still there's something in the world</l> 
<l>At which his heart rejoices;</l> 
<l>For when the chiming hounds are out,</l> 
<l>He dearly loves their voices!</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Old Ruth works out of doors with him,</l>

<l>Beside their moss-grown hut of clay,</l> 
<l>Not twenty paces from the door,</l>

<l>This scrap of land he from the heath</l>

<l>Which they can till no longer?</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Few months of life he has in store,</l>

<l>My gentle reader, I perceive</l>

<l>What more I have to say is short,</l>

<l>'Tis said, a child was in her womb,</l>

<l>There is no need of boot or spur,</l> 
<l>There is no need of whip or wand,</l> 
<l>For Johnny has his holly-bough,</l> 
<l>And with a hurly-burly now</l> 
<l>He shakes the green bough in his hand.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>And Betty o'er and o'er has told</l> 
<l>The boy who is her best delight,</l> 
<l>Both what to follow, what to shun,</l> 
<l>What to do, and what to leave undone,</l> 
<l>How to turn left, and how to turn right.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>And Betty's most especial charge,</l> 
<l>Was, "Johnny! Johnny! mind that you</l> 
<l>"Come home again, nor stop at all,</l> 
<l>"Come home again, whate'er befal,</l> 
<l>"My Johnny do, I pray you do."</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza">

<l>To this did Johnny answer make,</l> 
<l>Both with his head, and with his hand,</l> 
<l>And proudly shook the bridle too,</l> 
<l>And then! his words were not a few,</l> 
<l>Which Betty well could understand.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>And now that Johnny is just going,</l> 
<l>Though Betty's in a mighty flurry,</l> 
<l>She gently pats the pony's side,</l> 
<l>On which her idiot boy must ride,</l> 
<l>And seems no longer in a hurry.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>But when the pony moved his legs,</l> 
<l>Oh! then for the poor idiot boy!</l> 
<l>For joy he cannot hold the bridle,</l> 
<l>For joy his head and heels are idle,</l> 
<l>He's idle all for very joy.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="155"/>
 
<l>And while the pony moves his legs,</l> 
<l>In Johnny's left-hand you may see,</l> 
<l>The green bough's motionless and dead;</l> 
<l>The moon that shines above his head</l> 
<l>Is not more still and mute than he.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>His heart it was so full of glee,</l> 
<l>That till full fifty yards were gone,</l> 
<l>He quite forgot his holly whip,</l> 
<l>And all his skill in horsemanship,</l> 
<l>Oh! happy, happy, happy John.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>And Betty's standing at the door,</l> 
<l>And Betty's face with joy o'erflows,</l>

<l>She sees him in his traveling trim;</l> 
<l>How quietly her Johnny goes.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="156"/>
 
<l>The silence of her idiot boy,</l> 
<l>What hope it sends to Betty's heart!</l> 
<l>He's at the guide-post &mdash; he turns right,</l> 
<l>She watches till he's out of sight,</l> 
<l>And Betty will not then depart.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Burr, burr &mdash; now Johnny's lips they burr,</l> 
<l>As loud as any mill, or near it,</l> 
<l>Meek as a lamb, the pony moves,</l> 
<l>And Johnny makes the noise he loves,</l> 
<l>And Betty listens, glad to hear it.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Away she hies to Susan Gale:</l> 
<l>And Johnny's in a merry tune,</l> 
<l>The owlets hoot, the owlets curr,</l> 
<l>And Johnny's lips they burr, burr, burr,</l> 
<l>And on he goes beneath the moon.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="157"/>
 
<l>His steed and he right well agree,</l> 
<l>For of this pony there's rumour,</l> 
<l>That should he lose his eyes and ears,</l> 
<l>And should he live a thousand years,</l> 
<l>He never will be out of humour.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>But then he is a horse that thinks!</l> 
<l>And when he thinks his pace is slack;</l> 
<l>Now, though he knows poor Johnny well,</l> 
<l>Yet for his life he cannot tell</l> 
<l>What he has got upon his back.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>So through the moonlight lanes they go,</l> 
<l>And far into the moonlight dale,</l> 
<l>And by the church, and o'er the down,</l> 
<l>To bring a doctor from the town,</l> 
<l>To comfort poor old Susan Gale.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="158"/>
 
<l>And Betty, now at Susan's side,</l> 
<l>Is in the middle of her story,</l> 
<l>What comfort Johnny soon will bring,</l> 
<l>With many a most diverting thing,</l> 
<l>Of Johnny's wit and Johnny's glory.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>And Betty's still at Susan's side,</l> 
<l>By this time she's not quite so flurried;</l> 
<l>Demure with porringer and plate</l> 
<l>She sits, as if in Susan's fate</l> 
<l>Her life and soul were buried.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>But Betty, poor good woman! she,</l> 
<l>You plainly in her face may read it,</l>

<l>Five years of happiness or more,</l> 
<l>To any that might need it.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="159"/>
 
<l>But yet I guess that now and then</l> 
<l>With Betty all was not so well,</l> 
<l>And to the road she turns her ears,</l> 
<l>And thence full many a sound she hears,</l> 
<l>Which she to Susan will not tell.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans,</l> 
<l>"As sure as there's a moon in heaven,"</l>

<l>"As sure as there's a moon in heaven."</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza">

<l>The clock is on the stroke of twelve,</l> 
<l>And Johnny is not yet in sight,</l>

<l>But Betty is not quite at ease;</l> 
<l>And Susan has a dreadful night.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>And Betty, half an hour ago,</l> 
<l>On Johnny vile reflections cast;</l> 
<l>"A little idle sauntering thing!"</l> 
<l>With other names, an endless string,</l> 
<l>But now that time is gone and past.</l>

<l>"The doctor he has made him wait,</l> 
<l>"Susan they'll both be here anon."</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="161"/>
 
<l>And Susan's growing worse and worse,</l> 
<l>And Betty's in sad quandary;</l> 
<l>And then there's nobody to say</l> 
<l>If she must go or she must stay:</l> 
<l> &mdash; She's in a sad quandary.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>The clock is on the stroke of one;</l> 
<l>But neither Doctor nor his guide</l>

<l>There's neither horse nor man abroad,</l> 
<l>And Betty's still at Susan's side.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>And Susan she begins to fear</l> 
<l>Of sad mischances not a few,</l> 
<l>That Johnny may perhaps be drown'd,</l> 
<l>Or lost perhaps, and never found;</l> 
<l>Which they must both for ever rue.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="162"/>
 
<l>She prefaced half a hint of this</l> 
<l>With, "God forbid it should be true!"</l> 
<l>At the first word that Susan said</l> 
<l>Cried Betty, rising from the bed,</l> 
<l>"Susan I'd gladly stay with you.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>"I must be gone, I must away.</l> 
<l>"Consider, Johnny's but half-wise;</l> 
<l>"Susan, we must take care of him,</l> 
<l>"If he is hurt in life or limb" &mdash; </l> 
<l>"Oh God forbid!" poor Susan cries.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>"What can I do?" says Betty, going,</l> 
<l>"What can I do to ease your pain?</l> 
<l>"Good Susan tell me, and I'll stay;</l> 
<l>"I fear you're in a dreadful way,</l> 
<l>"But I shall  soon be back again."</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza">

<l>"Good Betty go, good Betty go,</l> 
<l>"There's nothing that can ease my pain."</l> 
<l>Then off she hies, but with a prayer</l> 
<l>That God poor Susan's life would spare,</l> 
<l>Till she comes back again.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>O, through the moonlight lane she goes,</l> 
<l>And far into the moonlight dale;</l> 
<l>And how she ran, and how she walked,</l>

</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>In high and low, above, below,</l>

<l>Perhaps, with head and heels on fire,</l>

<l>"Oh! Johnny, never mind the Doctor;</l>

<l>Away she posts up hill and down,</l> 
<l>And to the wood at length is come,</l>

<l>As ever was in Christendom.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>The owls have hardly sung their last,</l> 
<l>While our four travelers homeward wend;</l>

<l>And with the owls must end.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza">

<l>For while they all were travelling home,</l> 
<l>Cried Betty, "Tell us, Johnny, do,</l>

<l>"What you have heard, what you have seen,</l> 
<l>"And Johnny, mind you tell us true."</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Now Johnny all night long had heard</l> 
<l>The owls in tuneful concert strive;</l> 
<l>No doubt too he the moon had seen;</l> 
<l>For in the moon light he had been</l> 
<l>From eight o'clock till five.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>And thus to Betty's question, he</l> 
<l>Made answer, like a traveller bold,</l> 
<l>(His very words I give to you,)</l> 
<l>"The cocks did crow to-whoo, tu-whoo,</l>

                  THE CONVICT.<lb/> 
 
                      &mdash; <lb/></head> 
<lg type="stanza"> 
<l>The glory of evening was spread through the west;</l> 
<l>  &mdash; On the slope of a mountain I stood,</l> 
<l>While the joy that precedes the calm season of rest</l> 
<l> Rang loud through the meadow and wood.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>"And must we then part from a dwelling so fair?"</l> 
<l> In the pain of my spirit I said,</l> 
<l>And with a deep sadness I turned, to repair</l> 
<l> To the cell where the convict is laid.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>The thick-ribbed walls that o'ershadow the gate</l> 
<l> Resound; and the dungeons unfold:</l> 
<l>I pause; and at length, through the glimmering grate</l> 
<l> That outcast of pity behold.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="198"/>
 
<l>His black matted head on his shoulder is bent,</l> 
<l> And deep is the sigh of his breath,</l> 
<l>And with steadfast dejection his eyes are intent</l> 
<l> On the fetters that link him to death.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>Tis sorrow enough on that visage to gaze,</l> 
<l> That body dismiss'd from his care;</l> 
<l>Yet my fancy has pierced to his heart, and pourtrays</l> 
<l> More terrible images there.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>His bones are consumed, and his life-blood is dried,</l> 
<l> With wishes the past to undo;</l> 
<l>And his crime, through the pains that o'erwhelm him, descried,</l> 
<l> Still blackens and grows on his view.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>When from the dark synod, or blood-reeking field,</l> 
<l> To his chamber the monarch is led,</l> 
<l>All soothers of sense their soft virtue shall yield,</l> 
<l> And quietness pillow his head.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<pb n="199"/>
 
<l>But if grief, self-consumed, in oblivion would doze,</l> 
<l> And conscience her tortures appease,</l> 
<l>'Mid tumult and uproar this man must repose;</l> 
<l> In the conmfortless vault of disease.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>When his fetters at night have so press'd on his limbs,</l> 
<l> That the weight can no longer be born,</l> 
<l>If, while a half-slumber his memory bedims,</l> 
<l> The wretch on his pallet should turn,</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>While the jail-mastiff howls at the dull clinking chain,</l> 
<l> From the roots of his hair there shall start</l> 
<l>A thousand sharp punctures of cold-sweating pain,</l> 
<l> And terror shall leap at his heart.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>But now he half-raises his deep-sunken eye,</l> 
<l> And the motion unsettles a tear;</l> 
<l>The silence of sorrow it seems to supply,</l> 
<l> And asks of me why I am here.</l>

<l>"Poor victim! no idle intruder has stood</l> 
<l> "With o'erweening complacence our state to compare,</l>

<l> "Is come as a brother thy sorrows to share.</l> 
</lg><lg type="stanza"> 
<l>"At thy name though compassion her nature resign,</l> 
<l> "Though in virtue's proud mouth thy report be a stain,</l>

<l>The landscape with the quiet of the sky.</l> 
<l>The day is come when I again repose</l> 
<l>Here, under this dark sycamore, and view</l> 
<l>These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,</l> 
<l>Which, at this season, with their unripe fruits,</l> 
<l>Among the woods and copses lose themselves,</l> 
<l>Nor, with their green and simple hue, disturb</l> 
<l>The wild green landscape. Once again I see</l> 
<l>These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines</l> 
<l>Of sportive wood run wild; these pastoral farms</l> 
<l>Green to the very door; and wreathes of smoke</l> 
<l>Sent up, in silence, from among the trees,</l> 
<l>With some uncertain notice, as might seem,</l> 
<l>Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,</l> 
<l>Or of some hermit's cave, where by his fire</l> 
<l>The hermit sits alone.</l> 
<l>                       Though absent long,</l> 
<l>These forms of beauty have not been to me,</l> 
<pb n="203"/>
 
<l>As is a landscape to a blind man's eye:</l> 
<l>But oft, in lonely rooms, and mid the din</l> 
<l>Of towns and cities, I have owed to them,</l> 
<l>In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,</l> 
<l>Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart,</l> 
<l>And passing even into my purer mind</l> 
<l>With tranquil restoration: &mdash; feelings too</l> 
<l>Of unremembered pleasure; such, perhaps,</l> 
<l>As may have had no trivial influence</l> 
<l>On that best portion of a good man's life;</l> 
<l>His little, nameless, unremembered acts</l> 
<l>Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,</l> 
<l>To them I may have owed another gift,</l> 
<l>Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,</l> 
<l>In which the burthen of the mystery,</l> 
<l>In which the heavy and the weary weight</l> 
<l>Of all this unintelligible world</l> 
<l>Is lighten'd &mdash; that serene and blessed mood,</l> 
<l>In which the affections gently lead us on,</l> 
<pb n="204"/>
 
<l>Until, the breath of this corporeal frame,</l> 
<l>And even the motion of our human blood</l> 
<l>Almost suspended, we are laid asleep</l> 
<l>In body, and become a living soul:</l> 
<l>While with an eye made quiet by the power</l> 
<l>Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,</l> 
<l>We see into the life of things.</l> 
<l>                                     If this</l> 
<l>Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft,</l> 
<l>In darkness, and amid the many shapes</l> 
<l>Of joyless day-lights; when the fretful stir</l> 
<l>Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,</l> 
<l>Have hung upon the beatings of my heart,</l> 
<l>How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee</l> 
<l>O sylvan Wye! Thou wanderer through the wood</l> 
<l>How often has my spirit turned to thee!</l> 
</lg><lg type="verse"> 
<l>And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,</l> 
<pb n="205"/>
 
<l>With many recognitions dim and faint,</l> 
<l>And somewhat of a sad perplexity,</l> 
<l>The picture of the mind revives again:</l> 
<l>While here I stand, not only with the sense</l> 
<l>Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts</l> 
<l>That in this moment there is life and food</l> 
<l>For future years. And so I dare to hope</l> 
<l>Though changed, no doubt, from what I was, when first</l> 
<l>I came among these hills; when like a roe</l> 
<l>I bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides</l> 
<l>Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,</l> 
<l>Wherever nature led; more like a man</l> 
<l>Flying from something that he dreads, than one</l> 
<l>Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then</l> 
<l>(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,</l> 
<l>And their glad animal movements all gone by,)</l> 
<l>To me was all in all. &mdash; I cannot paint</l> 
<pb n="206"/>
 
<l>What then I was, The sounding cataract</l> 
<l>Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,</l> 
<l>The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,</l> 
<l>Their colours and their forms, were then to me</l> 
<l>An appetite: a feeling and a love,</l> 
<l>That had no need of a remoter charm,</l> 
<l>By thought supplied, or any interest</l> 
<l>Unborrowed from the eye. &mdash; That time is past,</l> 
<l>And all its aching joys are now no more,</l> 
<l>And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this</l> 
<l>Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur: other gifts</l> 
<l>Have followed, for such loss, I would believe,</l> 
<l>Abundant recompence. For I have learned</l> 
<l>To look on nature, not as in the hour</l> 
<l>Of thoughtless youth, but hearing oftentimes</l> 
<l>The still, sad music of humanity,</l> 
<l>Not harsh or  grating, though of ample power</l> 
<pb n="207"/>
 
<l>To chasten and subdue. And I have felt</l> 
<l>A presence that disturbs me with the joy</l> 
<l>Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime</l> 
<l>Of something far more deeply interfused,</l> 
<l>Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,</l> 
<l>And the round ocean, and the living air,</l> 
<l>And the blue sky, and in the mind of man,</l> 
<l>A motion and a spirit, that impels</l> 
<l>All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</l> 
<l>And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still</l> 
<l>A lover of the meadows and the woods,</l> 
<l>And mountains; and of all that we behold</l> 
<l>From this green earth; of all the mighty world</l> 
<l>Of eye and ear, both what they half-create,<ref target="note5">5</ref></l></lg>

<l>Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while</l> 
<l>May I behold in thee what I was once,</l> 
<l>My dear, dear Sister! And this prayer I make,</l> 
<l>Knowing that Nature never did betray</l> 
<pb n="209"/>
 
<l>The heart that loved her; 'tis her privilege,</l> 
<l>Through all the years of this our life, to lead</l> 
<l>>From joy to joy: for she can so inform</l> 
<l>The mind that is within us, so impress</l> 
<l>With quietness and beauty, and so feed</l> 
<l>With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,</l> 
<l>Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,</l> 
<l>Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all</l> 
<l>The dreary intercourse of daily life,</l> 
<l>Shall e'er prevail against us, or disturb</l> 
<l>Our chearful faith that all which we behold</l> 
<l>Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon</l> 
<l>Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;</l> 
<l>And let the misty mountain winds be free</l> 
<l>To blow against thee: and in after years,</l> 
<l>When these wild ecstasies shall be matured</l> 
<l>Into a sober pleasure, when thy mind</l> 
<l>Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,</l> 
<l>Thy memory be as a dwelling-place</l> 
<pb n="210"/>
 
<l>For all sweet sounds and harmonies; Oh! then,</l> 
<l>If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,</l> 
<l>Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts</l> 
<l>Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,</l> 
<l>And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance,</l> 
<l>If I should be, where I no more can hear</l> 
<l>Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams</l> 
<l>Of past existence, wilt thou then forget</l> 
<l>That on the banks of this delightful stream</l> 
<l>We stood together; And that I, so long</l> 
<l>A worshipper of Nature, hither came,</l> 
<l>Unwearied in that service: rather say</l> 
<l>With warmer love, oh! with far deeper zeal</l> 
<l>Of holier love. Now wilt thou then forget,</l> 
<l>That after many wanderings, many years</l> 
<l>Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,</l> 
<l>And this green pastoral landscape, were to me</l> 
<l>More dear, both for themselves, and for thy sake.</l></lg>
