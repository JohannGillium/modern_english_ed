<pb n="96"/>

<p>EAST away from the Sierras, south from Panamint and Amargosa,
east and south many an uncounted mile, is the Country of Lost
Borders.
</p><p>Ute, Paiute, Mojave, and Shoshone inhabit its frontiers, and
as far into the heart of it as a man dare go.  Not the law, but the
land sets the limit.  Desert is the name it wears upon the maps,
but the Indian's is the better word.  Desert is a loose term to
indicate lands that support no man; whether the lands can be bitted
and broken to that purpose is not proven.  Void of life it never
is, however dry the air and villainous the soil.
</p><p>This is the nature of that country.  There are hills, rounded,
blunt, burned, squeezed up out of chaos, chrome and vermilion
painted, aspiring to the snow-line.  Between the hills lie high
level-looking plains full of intolerable sun glare, or narrow
valleys drowned in a blue haze.  The hill surface is streaked with
ash drift and black, unweathered lava flows.  After rains water
accumulates in the hollows of small closed valleys, and,
evaporating, leaves hard dry levels of pure desertness that get the
local name of dry lakes.  When the mountains are high and the rains
heavy the pool is never quite dry, but dark and bitter, rimmed
about with the efflorescence of alkaline deposits.  A thin crust of
it lies along the marsh over the vegetating area, which has neither
beauty nor freshness.  In the broad wastes open to the wind the
sand drifts in hummocks about the stubby shrubs, and between them
the soil shows saline traces.  The sculpture of the hills here is
more wind than water work, though the quick storms do sometimes
scar them past many a year's redeeming.  In all the Western desert
edges there are essays in miniature at the famed, terrible Grand
Canon, to which, if you keep on long enough in this country, you
will come at last.
</p><p>Since this is a hill country one expects to find springs, but
not to depend upon them; for when found they are often brackish and
unwholesome, or maddening, slow dribbles in a thirsty soil.  Here
you find the hot sink of Death Valley, or high rolling districts
where the air has always a tang of frost.  Here are the long heavy
winds and breathless calms on the tilted mesas where dust devils
dance, whirling up into a wide, pale sky.  Here you have no rain
when all the earth cries for it, or quick downpours called cloud
bursts for violence.  A land of lost rivers, with little in it to
love; yet a land that once visited must be come back to inevitably.
If it were not so there would be little told of it.
</p><p>This is the country of three seasons.  From June on to
November it lies hot, still, and unbearable, sick with violent
unrelieving storms; then on until April, chill, quiescent, drinking
its scant rain and scanter snows; from April to the hot season
again, blossoming, radiant, and seductive.  These months are only
approximate; later or earlier the rain-laden wind may drift up the
water gate of the Colorado from the Gulf, and the land sets its
seasons by the rain.
</p><p>The desert floras shame us with their cheerful adaptations to
the seasonal <pb n="97"/>  limitations.  Their whole duty is to flower and
fruit, and they do it hardly, or with tropical luxuriance, as the
rain admits.  It is recorded in the report of the Death Valley
expedition that after a year of abundant rains, on the Colorado
desert was found a specimen of Amaranthus ten feet high.  A year
later the same species in the same place matured in the drought at
four inches.  One hopes the land may breed like qualities in her
human offspring, not tritely to "try," but to do.  Seldom does the
desert herb attain the full stature of the type.  Extreme aridity
and extreme altitude have the same dwarfing effect, so that we find
in the high Sierras and in Death Valley related species in
miniature that reach a comely growth in mean temperatures.  Very
fertile are the desert plants in expedients to prevent evaporation,
turning their foliage edgewise toward the sun; growing silky hairs,
exuding viscid gum.  The wind, which has a long sweep, harries and
helps them.  It rolls up dunes about the stocky stems, encompassing
and protective, and above the dunes, which may be, as with the
mesquite, three times as high as a man, the blossoming twigs
flourish and bear fruit.
</p><p>There are many areas in the desert where drinkable water lies
within a few feet of the surface, indicated by the mesquite and the
bunch grass (<hi rend="italic"> Sporobolus airoides</hi>).  It is this nearness of
unimagined help that makes the tragedy of desert deaths.  It is
related that the final breakdown of that hapless party that gave
Death Valley its forbidding name occurred in a locality where
shallow wells would have saved them.  But how were they to know
that?  Properly equipped it is possible to go safely across that
ghastly sink, yet every year it takes its toll of death, and yet
men find there sun-dried mummies, of whom no trace or recollection
is preserved.  To under-estimate one's thirst, to pass a given
landmark to the right or left, to find a dry spring where one
looked for running water&mdash;there is no help for any of these things.
</p><p>Along springs and sunken water-courses one is surprised to
find such water-loving plants as grow widely in moist ground, but
the true desert breeds its own kind, each in its particular
habitat.  The angle of the slope, the frontage of a hill, the
structure of the soil determines the plant.  South-looking hills
are nearly bare, and the treeline higher here by a thousand feet.
Canons running east and west will have one wall naked and one
clothed.  Around dry lakes and marshes the herbage preserves a set
and orderly arrangement.  Most species have well-defined areas of
growth, the best index the voiceless land can give the traveler of
his whereabouts.
</p><p>If you have any doubt about it, know that the desert begins
with the creosote.  This immortal shrub spreads down into Death
Valley and up to the timber-line, odorous and medicinal as you
might guess from the name, wandlike, with shining fretted foliage.
Its vivid green is grateful to the eye in a wilderness of gray and
greenish white shrubs.  In the spring it exudes a resinous gum
which the Indians of those parts know how to use with pulverized
rock for cementing arrow points to shafts.  Trust Indians not to
miss any virtues of the plant world!
</p><p>Nothing the desert produces expresses it better than the
unhappy growth of the tree yuccas.  Tormented, thin forests of it
stalk drearily in the high mesas, particularly in that triangular
slip that fans out eastward from the meeting of the Sierras and
coastwise hills where the first swings across the southern end of
the San Joaquin Valley.  The yucca bustles with bayonet-pointed
leaves, dull green, growing shaggy with age, tipped with panicles
of fetid greenish bloom.  After death, which is slow, the ghostly
hollow network of its woody skeleton, with hardly power to rot,
makes the moonlight fearful.<pb n="98"/>   Before the yucca has come to
flower, while yet its bloom is a creamy cone-shaped bud, of the
size of a small cabbage full of sugary sap, the Indians twist it
deftly out of its fence of daggers and roast it for their own
delectation.  So it is that in those parts where man inhabits one
sees young plants of <hi rend="italic"> Yucca aborensis</hi> infrequently.  Other
yuccas, cacti, low herbs, a thousand sorts, one finds journeying
east from the coastwise hills.  There is neither poverty of soil
nor species to account for the sparseness of desert growth, but
simply that each plant requires more room.  So much earth must be
pre-empted to extract so much moisture.  The real struggle for
existence, the real brain of the plant, is underground; above there
is room for a rounded perfect growth.  In Death Valley, reputed the
very core of desolation, are nearly two hundred identified species.
</p><p>Above the treeline which is also the snowline, mapped out
abruptly by the sun, one finds spreading growth of pinon, juniper,
branched nearly to the ground, lilac and sage, and scattering white
pines.
</p><p>There is no special preponderance of self-fertilized or wind-fertilized plants, but everywhere the demand for and evidence of
insect life.  Now where there are seeds and insects there will be
birds and small mammals, and where these are, will come the
slinking, sharp-toothed kind that prey on them.  Go as far as you
dare in the heart of a lonely land, you cannot go so far that life
and death are not before you.  Painted lizards slip in and out of
rock crevices, and pant on the white hot sands.  Birds, humming-birds even, nest in the cactus scrub; woodpeckers befriend the
demoniac yuccas; out of the stark, treeless waste rings the music
of the night-singing mocking-bird.  If it be summer and the sun
well down, there will be a burrowing owl to call.  Strange, furry,
tricksy things dart across the open places, or sit motionless in
the conning towers of the creosote.  The poet may have "named all
the birds without a gun," but not the fairy-footed, ground-inhabiting, furtive, small folk of the rainless regions.  They are
too many and too swift; how many you would not believe without
seeing the footprint tracings in the sand.  They are nearly all
night workers, finding the days too hot and white.  In mid-desert
where there are no cattle, there are no birds of carrion, but if
you go far in that direction the chances are that you will find
yourself shadowed by their tilted winds.  Nothing so large as a man
can move unspied upon in that country, and they know well how the
land deals with strangers.  There are hints to be had here of the
way in which a land forces new habits on its dwellers.  The quick
increase of suns at the end of spring sometimes overtakes birds in
their nesting and effects a reversal of the ordinary manner of
incubation.  It becomes necessary to keep eggs cool rather than
warm.  One hot, stifling spring in the Little Antelope I had
occasion to pass and repass frequently the nest of a pair of meadow
larks, located unhappily in the shelter of a very slender weed.  I
never caught them setting except near night, but at midday they
stood, or drooped above it, half fainting with pitifully parted
bills, between their treasure and the sun.  Sometimes both of them
together with wings spread and half lifted continued a spot of
shade in a temperature that constrained me at last in a fellow
feeling to spare them a bit of canvas for permanent shelter.
</p><p>There was a fence in that country shutting in a cattle range,
and along its fifteen miles of posts one could be sure of finding
a bird or two in every strip of shadow; sometimes the sparrow and
the hawk, with wings trailed and beaks parted, drooping in the
white truce of noon.
</p><p>If one is inclined to wonder at first how so many dwellers
came to be in the loneliest land that ever came out of <pb n="99"/>  God's
hands, what they do there and why stay, one does not wonder so much
after having lived there.  None other than this long brown land
lays such a hold on the affections.  The rainbow hills, the tender
bluish mists, the luminous radiance of the spring, have the lotus
charm.  They trick the sense of time, so that once inhabiting there
you always mean to go away without quite realizing that you have
not done it.  Men who have lived there, miners and cattle-men, will
tell you this, not so fluently, but emphatically, cursing the land
and going back to it.  For one thing there is the divinest,
cleanest air to be breathed anywhere in God's world.  Some day the
world will understand that, and the little oases on the windy tops
of hills will harbor for healing its ailing, house weary broods.
There is promise there of great wealth in ores and earths, which is
no wealth by reason of being so far removed from water and workable
conditions, but men are bewitched by it and tempted to try the
impossible.
</p><p>You should hear Salty Williams tell how he used to drive
eighteen and twenty mule teams from the borax marsh to Mojave,
ninety miles, with the trail wagon full of water barrels.  Hot days
the mules would go so mad for drink that the clank of the water
bucket set them into an uproar of hideous, maimed noises, and a
tangle of harness chains, while Salty would sit on the high seat
with the sun glare heavy in his eyes, dealing out curses of
pacification in a level, uninterested voice until the clamor fell
off from sheer exhaustion.  There was a line of shallow graves
along that road; they used to count on dropping a man or two of
every new gang of coolies brought out in the hot season.  But when
he lost his swamper, smitten without warning at the noon halt,
Salty quit his job; he said it was "too durn hot."  The swamper he
buried by the way with stones upon him to keep the coyotes from
digging him up, and seven years later I read the penciled lines on
the pine headboard, still bright and unweathered.
</p><p>The palpable sense of mystery in the desert air breeds fables,
chiefly of lost treasure.  Somewhere within its stark borders, if
one believes report, is a hill strewn with nuggets; one seamed with
virgin silver; an old clayey water bed where Indians scooped up
earth to make cooking pots and shaped them reeking with grains of
pure gold.  Old miners drifting about the desert edges, weathered
into the semblance of the tawny hills, will tell you tales like
these convincingly.  After a little sojourn in that land you will
believe them on their own account.  It is a question whether it is
not better to be bitten by the little horned snake of the desert
that goes sidewise and strikes without coiling, than by the
tradition of a lost mine.
</p><p>For all the toll the desert takes of a man it gives
compensations, deep breaths, deep sleep, and the communion of the
stars.  It comes upon one with new force in the pauses of the night
that the Chaldeans were a desert-bred people.  It is hard to escape
the sense of mastery as the stars move in the wide clear heavens to
risings and settings unobscured.  They look large and near and
palpitant; as if they moved on some stately service not needful to
declare.  Wheeling to their stations in the sky they make the poor
world-fret of no account.  Of no account you who lie out there
watching, nor the lean coyote that stands off in the scrub from you
and howls and howls.
