THE HAUNTED BOOKSHOP<lb/>
By CHRISTOPHER MORLEY <lb/>
Author of "Parnassus on Wheels," <lb/>
"Where the Blue Begins," etc.<lb/>
</p>
<p>Every reader who made the delightful
acquaintance of Roger Mifflin in "Parnassus on
Wheels" will rejoice upon finding him in this
volume the proprietor of a bookshop in
Brooklyn.  So realistically does the story
begin that one is almost impelled to take down
the telephone book to get the address of the
haunted bookshop.  While much of the charm of
the book lies in the character of the
whimsical, bookloving Roger Mifflin and his
comments on all manner of things, a gentle
love story runs through the novel and an
exciting bomb plot of which the bookshop
becomes the tragic scene.
</p><p>If you have not yet had the great joy of
reading this charming book, prepare now to
partake of a real mental feast&mdash;from appetizer
of mystery, through meat of information, crisp
salad of romance, to dessert of humor.

</p><p>This book, while produced under
wartime conditions, in full compliance
with government regulations for the
conservation of paper and other
essential materials, is
COMPLETE AND UNABRIDGED

PARNASSUS ON WHEELS<lb/>
By CHRISTOPHER MORLEY <lb/>

</p>
<p>Andrew McGill and his sister, Helen, were
wonderfully happy on their farm in the country
until Andrew wrote a book and suddenly found
himself famous as The Sage of Redfield and the
author of Happiness and Hayseed.  Perhaps it
was because the publishers once referred to
her as a "Rural Xantippe," or perhaps it was
the madness of the whole proposition or just a
desire to have an adventure of her own that
impelled Helen McGill to buy "Parnassus on
Wheels," the traveling book van, from the
little red-bearded "Professor" who drove into
the yard one day.  At any rate, she suddenly
abandoned the baking of bread and drove off
with the "Professor" with no attempt at an
explanation to her brother.  This whimsical,
fantastic little story is the record of their
adventures, and of how the "Professor" brought
the splendor of an ideal into her hum-drum
life.</p>

<head>Dedication</head>
<salute>TO THE BOOKSELLERS</salute>

<p>Be pleased to know, most worthy, that this little
book is dedicated to you in affection and respect.
</p><p>The faults of the composition are plain to you all.
I begin merely in the hope of saying something further of
the adventures of ROGER MIFFLIN, whose exploits in
"Parnassus on Wheels" some of you have been kind enough
to applaud.  But then came Miss Titania Chapman, and my
young advertising man fell in love with her, and the two
of them rather ran away with the tale.
</p><p>I think I should explain that the passage in Chapter
VIII, dealing with the delightful talent of Mr. Sidney
Drew, was written before the lamented death of that
charming artist.  But as it was a sincere tribute,
sincerely meant, I have seen no reason for removing it.
</p><p>Chapters I, II, III, and VI appeared originally in
<hi rend="italic">The Bookman,</hi> and to the editor of that admirable magazine
I owe thanks for his permission to reprint.
</p><p>Now that Roger is to have ten Parnassuses on


<pb n="vi"/>

the road, I am emboldened to think that some of you may
encounter them on their travels.  And if you do, I hope
you will find that these new errants of the Parnassus on
Wheels Corporation are living up to the ancient and
honourable traditions of our noble profession.</p>

The Haunted Bookshop
</head>
<pb n="3"/>
<p>If you are ever in Brooklyn, that borough of superb
sunsets and magnificent vistas of husband-propelled
baby-carriages, it is to be hoped you may chance upon a
quiet by-street where there is a very remarkable
bookshop.
</p><p>This bookshop, which does business under the unusual
name "Parnassus at Home," is housed in one of the
comfortable old brown-stone dwellings which have been the
joy of several generations of plumbers and cockroaches.
The owner of the business has been at pains to remodel
the house to make it a more suitable shrine for his
trade, which deals entirely in second-hand volumes.
There is no second-hand bookshop in the world more worthy
of respect.
</p><p>It was about six o'clock of a cold November evening,
with gusts of rain splattering upon the


<pb n="4"/>
pavement, when a young man proceeded uncertainly along Gissing
Street, stopping now and then to look at shop windows as
though doubtful of his way.  At the warm and shining face
of a French rotisserie he halted to compare the number
enamelled on the transom with a memorandum in his hand.
Then he pushed on for a few minutes, at last reaching the
address he sought.  Over the entrance his eye was caught
by the sign:

<lb/>PARNASSUS AT HOME
<lb/>R. AND H. MIFFLIN
<lb/>BOOKLOVERS WELCOME!
<lb/>THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED


He stumbled down the three steps that led into the
dwelling of the muses, lowered his overcoat collar, and
looked about.
</p><p>It was very different from such bookstores as he had
been accustomed to patronize.  Two stories of the old
house had been thrown into one: the lower space was
divided into little alcoves; above, a gallery ran round
the wall, which carried books to the ceiling.  The air
was heavy with the delightful fragrance of mellowed paper
and leather surcharged with a strong bouquet of tobacco.
In


<pb n="5"/>

front of him he found a large placard in a frame:
</p>
<p>
<lb/>THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED by the ghosts
<lb/>Of all great literature, in hosts;
<lb/>We sell no fakes or trashes.
<lb/>Lovers of books are welcome here,
<lb/>No clerks will babble in your ear,
<lb/>Please smoke&mdash;but don't drop ashes!
<lb/>&mdash;
<lb/>Browse as long as you like.
<lb/>Prices of all books plainly marked.
<lb/>If you want to ask questions, you'll find the proprietor
<lb/>where the tobacco smoke is thickest.
<lb/>We pay cash for books.
<lb/>We have what you want, though you may not know you want
<lb/>it.
<lb/>Malnutrition of the reading faculty is a serious
<lb/>thing.
<lb/>           Let us prescribe for you.

<hi rend="italic">           By R. &amp; H. MIFFLIN,
               Proprs.</hi>
 </p>

<p>The shop had a warm and comfortable obscurity, a kind
of drowsy dusk, stabbed here and there by bright cones of
yellow light from green-shaded electrics.  There was an
all-pervasive drift of tobacco smoke, which eddied and
fumed under the glass lamp shades.  Passing down a narrow
aisle between the alcoves the visitor noticed that some
of the compartments were wholly in darkness;



<pb n="6"/>
in others where lamps were glowing he could see a table and
chairs. In one corner, under a sign lettered ESSAYS, an elderly
gentleman was reading, with a face of fanatical ecstasy
illumined by the sharp glare of electricity; but there
was no wreath of smoke about him so the newcomer
concluded he was not the proprietor.
</p><p>As the young man approached the back of the shop the
general effect became more and more fantastic.  On some
skylight far overhead he could hear the rain drumming;
but otherwise the place was completely silent, peopled
only (so it seemed) by the gurgitating whorls of smoke
and the bright profile of the essay reader.  It seemed
like a secret fane, some shrine of curious rites, and the
young man's throat was tightened by a stricture which was
half agitation and half tobacco.  Towering above him into
the gloom were shelves and shelves of books, darkling
toward the roof.  He saw a table with a cylinder of brown
paper and twine, evidently where purchases might be
wrapped; but there was no sign of an attendant.
</p><p>"This place may indeed be haunted," he thought,
"perhaps by the delighted soul of Sir Walter Raleigh,
patron of the weed, but seemingly not by the
proprietors."
</p><p>His eyes, searching the blue and vaporous vistas of
the shop, were caught by a circle of brightness


<pb n="7"/>
that shone with a curious egg-like lustre.  It was round and
white, gleaming in the sheen of a hanging light, a bright
island in a surf of tobacco smoke.  He came more close,
and found it was a bald head.
</p><p>This head (he then saw) surmounted a small,
sharp-eyed man who sat tilted back in a swivel chair, in
a corner which seemed the nerve centre of the
establishment.  The large pigeon-holed desk in front of
him was piled high with volumes of all sorts, with tins
of tobacco and newspaper clippings and letters.  An
antiquated typewriter, looking something like a
harpsichord, was half-buried in sheets of manuscript.
The little bald-headed man was smoking a corn-cob pipe
and reading a cookbook.
</p><p>"I beg your pardon," said the caller, pleasantly; "is
this the proprietor?"
</p><p>Mr. Roger Mifflin, the proprietor of "Parnassus at
Home," looked up, and the visitor saw that he had keen
blue eyes, a short red beard, and a convincing air of
competent originality.
</p><p>"It is," said Mr. Mifflin.  "Anything I can do for
you?"
</p><p>"My name is Aubrey Gilbert," said the young man.  "I
am representing the Grey-Matter Advertising Agency.  I
want to discuss with you the advisability of your letting
us handle your advertising account, prepare snappy copy
for you, and


<pb n="8"/>

place it in large circulation mediums.
Now the war's over, you ought to prepare some
constructive campaign for bigger business."
</p><p>The bookseller's face beamed.  He put down his
cookbook, blew an expanding gust of smoke, and looked up
brightly.
</p><p>"My dear chap," he said, "I don't do any
advertising."
</p><p>"Impossible!" cried the other, aghast as at some
gratuitous indecency.
</p><p>"Not in the sense you mean.  Such advertising as
benefits me most is done for me by the snappiest
copywriters in the business."
</p><p>"I suppose you refer to Whitewash and Gilt?" said Mr.
Gilbert wistfully.
</p><p>"Not at all.  The people who are doing my advertising
are Stevenson, Browning, Conrad and Company."
</p><p>"Dear me," said the Grey-Matter solicitor.  "I don't
know that agency at all.  Still, I doubt if their copy
has more pep than ours."
</p><p>"I don't think you get me.  I mean that my
advertising is done by the books I sell.  If I sell a man
a book by Stevenson or Conrad, a book that delights or
terrifies him, that man and that book become my living
advertisements."
</p><p>"But that word-of-mouth advertising is exploded,"
said Gilbert.  "You can't get Distribution


<pb n="9"/>
that way.  You've got to keep your trademark before the public."
</p><p>"By the bones of Tauchnitz!" cried Mifflin.  "Look
here, you wouldn't go to a doctor, a medical specialist,
and tell him he ought to advertise in papers and
magazines?  A doctor is advertised by the bodies he
cures.  My business is advertised by the minds I
stimulate.  And let me tell you that the book business is
different from other trades.  People don't know they want
books.  I can see just by looking at you that your mind
is ill for lack of books but you are blissfully unaware
of it! People don't go to a bookseller until some serious
mental accident or disease makes them aware of their
danger.  Then they come here.  For me to advertise would
be about as useful as telling people who feel perfectly
well that they ought to go to the doctor.  Do you know
why people are reading more books now than ever before?
Because the terrific catastrophe of the war has made them
realize that their minds are ill.  The world was
suffering from all sorts of mental fevers and aches and
disorders, and never knew it.  Now our mental pangs are
only too manifest.  We are all reading, hungrily,
hastily, trying to find out&mdash;after the trouble is
over&mdash;what was the matter with our minds."
</p><p>The little bookseller was standing up now, and



<pb n="10"/>
his visitor watched him with mingled amusement and
alarm.
</p><p>"You know," said Mifflin, "I am interested that you
should have thought it worth while to come in here.  It
reinforces my conviction of the amazing future ahead of
the book business.  But I tell you that future lies not
merely in systematizing it as a trade.  It lies in
dignifying it as a profession.  It is small use to jeer
at the public for craving shoddy books, quack books,
untrue books.  Physician, cure thyself! Let the
bookseller learn to know and revere good books, he will
teach the customer.  The hunger for good books is more
general and more insistent than you would dream.  But it
is still in a way subconscious.  People need books, but
they don't know they need them.  Generally they are not
aware that the books they need are in existence."
</p><p>"Why wouldn't advertising be the way to let them
know?" asked the young man, rather acutely.
</p><p>"My dear chap, I understand the value of advertising.
But in my own case it would be futile.  I am not a dealer
in merchandise but a specialist in adjusting the book to
the human need.  Between ourselves, there is no such
thing, abstractly, as a `good' book.  A book is `good'
only when it meets some human hunger or refutes some
human error.  A book that is good for me would very
likely be


<pb n="11"/>
punk for you.  My pleasure is to prescribe
books for such patients as drop in here and are willing
to tell me their symptoms.  Some people have let their
reading faculties decay so that all I can do is hold a
post mortem on them.  But most are still open to
treatment.  There is no one so grateful as the man to
whom you have given just the book his soul needed and he
never knew it.  No advertisement on earth is as potent as
a grateful customer.
</p><p>"I will tell you another reason why I don't
advertise," he continued.  "In these days when everyone
keeps his trademark before the public, as you call it,
not to advertise is the most original and startling thing
one can do to attract attention.  It was the fact that I
do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> advertise that drew you here.  And everyone who
comes here thinks he has discovered the place himself.
He goes and tells his friends about the book asylum run
by a crank and a lunatic, and they come here in turn to
see what it is like."
</p><p>"I should like to come here again myself and browse
about," said the advertising agent.  "I should like to
have you prescribe for me."
</p><p>"The first thing needed is to acquire a sense of
pity.  The world has been printing books for 450 years,
and yet gunpowder still has a wider circulation.  Never
mind!  Printer's ink is the greater



<pb n="12"/>

explosive: it will win.  Yes, I have a few of the good books
here. There are only about 30,000 really important books in the
world.  I suppose about 5,000 of them were written in the
English language, and 5,000 more have been translated."
</p><p>"You are open in the evenings?"
</p><p>"Until ten o'clock.  A great many of my best
customers are those who are at work all day and can only
visit bookshops at night.  The real book-lovers, you
know, are generally among the humbler classes.  A man who
is impassioned with books has little time or patience to
grow rich by concocting schemes for cozening his
fellows."
</p><p>The little bookseller's bald pate shone in the light
of the bulb hanging over the wrapping table.  His eyes
were bright and earnest, his short red beard bristled
like wire.  He wore a ragged brown Norfolk jacket from
which two buttons were missing.
</p><p>A bit of a fanatic himself, thought the customer, but
a very entertaining one.  "Well, sir," he said, "I am
ever so grateful to you.  I'll come again.  Good-night."
And he started down the aisle for the door.
</p><p>As he neared the front of the shop, Mr. Mifflin
switched on a cluster of lights that hung high up, and
the young man found himself beside a large bulletin board
covered with clippings, announcements, circulars, and
little notices written on cards



<pb n="13"/>
in a small neat script.  The following caught his eye:</p>
<p>
<lb/>R
<lb/>If your mind needs phosphorus, try "Trivia," by Logan
<lb/>Pearsall Smith.
<lb/>If your mind needs a whiff of strong air, blue and
<lb/>cleansing, from hilltops and primrose valleys, try "The
<lb/>Story of My Heart," by Richard Jefferies.
<lb/>If your mind needs a tonic of iron and wine, and a
<lb/>thorough rough-and-tumbling, try Samuel Butler's
<lb/>"Notebooks" or "The Man Who Was Thursday," by Chesterton.
<lb/>If you need "all manner of Irish," and a relapse into
<lb/>irresponsible freakishness, try "The Demi-Gods," by
<lb/>James Stephens.  It is a better book than one deserves or
<lb/>expects.
<lb/>It's a good thing to turn your mind upside down now
<lb/>and then, like an hour-glass, to let the particles run
<lb/>the other way.
<lb/>One who loves the English tongue can have a lot of
<lb/>fun with a Latin dictionary.
<hi rend="italic">ROGER MIFFLIN.</hi>
</p>

<p>Human beings pay very little attention to what is told
them unless they know something about it already.  The
young man had heard of none of these books prescribed by
the practitioner of bibliotherapy.  He was about to open
the door when Mifflin appeared at his side.
</p>


<pb n="14"/>

<p>"Look here," he said, with a quaint touch of
embarrassment.  "I was very much interested by our talk.
I'm all alone this evening&mdash;my wife is away on a holiday.
Won't you stay and have supper with me?  I was just
looking up some new recipes when you came in."
</p><p>The other was equally surprised and pleased by this
unusual invitation.
</p><p>"Why&mdash;that's very good of you," he said.  "Are you
sure I won't be intruding?"
</p><p>"Not at all!" cried the bookseller.  "I detest eating
alone: I was hoping someone would drop in.  I always try
to have a guest for supper when my wife is away.  I have
to stay at home, you see, to keep an eye on the shop.  We
have no servant, and I do the cooking myself.  It's great
fun.  Now you light your pipe and make yourself
comfortable for a few minutes while I get things ready.
Suppose you come back to my den."
</p><p>On a table of books at the front of the shop Mifflin
laid a large card lettered:
</p>
<p>
<lb/>PROPRIETOR AT SUPPER
<lb/>IF YOU WANT ANYTHING
<lb/>RING THIS BELL
</p>


<pb n="15"/>

<p>Beside the card he placed a large old-fashioned
dinner bell, and then led the way to the rear of the
shop.
</p><p>Behind the little office in which this unusual
merchant had been studying his cookbook a narrow stairway
rose on each side, running up to the gallery.  Behind
these stairs a short flight of steps led to the domestic
recesses.  The visitor found himself ushered into a small
room on the left, where a grate of coals glowed under a
dingy mantelpiece of yellowish marble.  On the mantel
stood a row of blackened corn-cob pipes and a canister of
tobacco.  Above was a startling canvas in emphatic oils,
representing a large blue wagon drawn by a stout white
animal&mdash;evidently a horse.  A background of lush scenery
enhanced the forceful technique of the limner.  The walls
were stuffed with books.  Two shabby, comfortable chairs
were drawn up to the iron fender, and a mustard-coloured
terrier was lying so close to the glow that a smell of
singed hair was sensible.
</p><p>"There," said the host; "this is my cabinet, my
chapel of ease.  Take off your coat and sit down."
</p><p>"Really," began Gilbert, "I'm afraid this is&mdash;"
</p><p>"Nonsense!  Now you sit down and commend



<pb n="16"/>
your soul to Providence and the kitchen stove.  I'll bustle
round and get supper."  Gilbert pulled out his pipe, and
with a sense of elation prepared to enjoy an unusual
evening.  He was a young man of agreeable parts, amiable
and sensitive.  He knew his disadvantages in literary
conversation, for he had gone to an excellent college
where glee clubs and theatricals had left him little time
for reading.  But still he was a lover of good books,
though he knew them chiefly by hearsay.  He was
twenty-five years old, employed as a copywriter by the
Grey-Matter Advertising Agency.
</p><p>The little room in which he found himself was plainly
the bookseller's sanctum, and contained his own private
library.  Gilbert browsed along the shelves curiously.
The volumes were mostly shabby and bruised; they had
evidently been picked up one by one in the humble mangers
of the second-hand vendor.  They all showed marks of use
and meditation.
</p><p>Mr. Gilbert had the earnest mania for
self-improvement which has blighted the lives of so many
young men&mdash;a passion which, however, is commendable in
those who feel themselves handicapped by a college career
and a jewelled fraternity emblem.  It suddenly struck him
that it would be valuable to make a list of some of the
titles in



<pb n="17"/>
Mifflin's collection, as a suggestion for
his own reading.  He took out a memorandum book and began
jotting down the books that intrigued him:
</p>

<p>So far had he got, and was beginning to say to himself
that in the interests of Advertising (who is a jealous
mistress) he had best call a halt, when his host entered
the room, his small face eager, his eyes blue points of
light.
</p><p>"Come, Mr. Aubrey Gilbert!" he cried.  "The meal is
set.  You want to wash your hands?  Make haste then, this
way:  the eggs are hot and waiting."
</p><p>The dining room into which the guest was conducted
betrayed a feminine touch not visible in the smoke-dimmed
quarters of shop and cabinet.



<pb n="18"/>
At the windows were
curtains of laughing chintz and pots of pink geranium.
The table, under a drop-light in a flame-coloured silk
screen, was brightly set with silver and blue china.  In
a cut-glass decanter sparkled a ruddy brown wine.  The
edged tool of Advertising felt his spirits undergo an
unmistakable upward pressure.
</p><p>"Sit down, sir," said Mifflin, lifting the roof of a
platter.  "These are eggs Samuel Butler, an invention of
my own, the apotheosis of hen fruit."
</p><p>Gilbert greeted the invention with applause.  An <hi rend="italic">Egg
Samuel Butler,</hi> for the notebook of housewives, may be
summarized as a pyramid, based upon toast, whereof the
chief masonries are a flake of bacon, an egg poached to
firmness, a wreath of mushrooms, a cap-sheaf of red
peppers; the whole dribbled with a warm pink sauce of
which the inventor retains the secret.  To this the
bookseller <hi rend="italic">chef</hi> added fried potatoes from another dish,
and poured for his guest a glass of wine.
</p><p>"This is California catawba," said Mifflin, "in which
the grape and the sunshine very pleasantly (and cheaply)
fulfil their allotted destiny.  I pledge you prosperity
to the black art of Advertising!"
</p><p>The psychology of the art and mystery of Advertising
rests upon tact, an instinctive perception of the tone
and accent which will be en rapport with the mood of the
hearer.  Mr. Gilbert was



<pb n="19"/>
aware of this, and felt that
quite possibly his host was prouder of his whimsical
avocation as gourmet than of his sacred profession as a
bookman.
</p><p>"Is it possible, sir," he began, in lucid Johnsonian,
"that you can concoct so delicious an entree in so few
minutes?  You are not hoaxing me?  There is no secret
passage between Gissing Street and the laboratories of
the Ritz?"
</p><p>"Ah, you should taste Mrs. Mifflin's cooking!" said
the bookseller.  "I am only an amateur, who dabble in the
craft during her absence.  She is on a visit to her
cousin in Boston.  She becomes, quite justifiably, weary
of the tobacco of this establishment, and once or twice
a year it does her good to breathe the pure serene of
Beacon Hill.  During her absence it is my privilege to
inquire into the ritual of housekeeping.  I find it very
sedative after the incessant excitement and speculation
of the shop."
</p><p>"I should have thought," said Gilbert, "that life in
a bookshop would be delightfully tranquil."
</p><p>"Far from it.  Living in a bookshop is like living in
a warehouse of explosives.  Those shelves are ranked with
the most furious combustibles in the world&mdash;the brains of
men.  I can spend a rainy afternoon reading, and my mind
works itself up to such a passion and anxiety over mortal
problems as almost unmans me.  It is terribly
nerve-racking.



<pb n="20"/>
Surround a man with Carlyle, Emerson,
Thoreau, Chesterton, Shaw, Nietzsche, and George
Ade&mdash;would you wonder at his getting excited?  What would
happen to a cat if she had to live in a room tapestried
with catnip?  She would go crazy!"
</p><p>"Truly, I had never thought of that phase of
bookselling," said the young man.  "How is it, though,
that libraries are shrines of such austere calm?  If
books are as provocative as you suggest, one would expect
every librarian to utter the shrill screams of a
hierophant, to clash ecstatic castanets in his silent
alcoves!"
</p><p>"Ah, my boy, you forget the card index! Librarians
invented that soothing device for the febrifuge of their
souls, just as I fall back upon the rites of the kitchen.
Librarians would all go mad, those capable of
concentrated thought, if they did not have the cool and
healing card index as medicament!  Some more of the
eggs?"
</p><p>"Thank you," said Gilbert.  "Who was the butler whose
name was associated with the dish?"
</p><p>"What?" cried Mifflin, in agitation, "you have not
heard of Samuel Butler, the author of <hi rend="italic">The Way of All
Flesh?</hi>  My dear young man, whoever permits himself to die
before he has read that book, and also <hi rend="italic">Erewhon,</hi> has
deliberately forfeited his chances of paradise.  For
paradise in the world to come is uncertain, but there is
indeed



<pb n="21"/>
a heaven on this earth, a heaven which we
inhabit when we read a good book.  Pour yourself another
glass of wine, and permit me&mdash;"
</p><p>(Here followed an enthusiastic development of the
perverse philosophy of Samuel Butler, which, in deference
to my readers, I omit.  Mr. Gilbert took notes of the
conversation in his pocketbook, and I am pleased to say
that his heart was moved to a realization of his
iniquity, for he was observed at the Public Library a few
days later asking for a copy of <hi rend="italic">The Way of All Flesh.</hi>
After inquiring at four libraries, and finding all copies
of the book in circulation, he was compelled to buy one.
He never regretted doing so.)
</p><p>"But I am forgetting my duties as host," said
Mifflin.  "Our dessert consists of apple sauce,
gingerbread, and coffee."  He rapidly cleared the empty
dishes from the table and brought on the second course.
</p><p>"I have been noticing the warning over the
sideboard," said Gilbert.  "I hope you will let me help
you this evening?" He pointed to a card hanging near the
kitchen door.  It read:
</p>
 <p>
<lb/>ALWAYS WASH DISHES
<lb/>IMMEDIATELY AFTER MEALS
<lb/>   IT SAVES TROUBLE
 </p>


<pb n="22"/>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't always obey that precept," said
the bookseller as he poured the coffee.  "Mrs. Mifflin
hangs it there whenever she goes away, to remind me.
But, as our friend Samuel Butler says, he that is stupid
in little will also be stupid in much.  I have a
different theory about dish-washing, and I please myself
by indulging it.
</p><p>"I used to regard dish-washing merely as an ignoble
chore, a kind of hateful discipline which had to be
undergone with knitted brow and brazen fortitude.  When
my wife went away the first time, I erected a reading
stand and an electric light over the sink, and used to
read while my hands went automatically through base
gestures of purification.  I made the great spirits of
literature partners of my sorrow, and learned by heart a
good deal of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> and of Walt Mason, while I
soused and wallowed among pots and pans.  I used to
comfort myself with two lines of Keats: </p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>`The moving waters at their priest-like task </l>
<l>Of pure ablution round earth's human shores&mdash;'</l>
</lg>
<p>
Then a new conception of the matter struck me.  It is
intolerable for a human being to go on doing any task as
a penance, under duress.  No matter what the work is, one
must spiritualize it in some way, shatter the old idea of
it into bits and rebuild



<pb n="23"/>
it nearer to the heart's
desire.  How was I to do this with dish-washing?
</p><p>"I broke a good many plates while I was pondering
over the matter.  Then it occurred to me that here was
just the relaxation I needed.  I had been worrying over
the mental strain of being surrounded all day long by
vociferous books, crying out at me their conflicting
views as to the glories and agonies of life.  Why not
make dish-washing my balm and poultice?
</p><p>"When one views a stubborn fact from a new angle, it
is amazing how all its contours and edges change shape!
Immediately my dishpan began to glow with a kind of
philosophic halo!  The warm, soapy water became a
sovereign medicine to retract hot blood from the head;
the homely act of washing and drying cups and saucers
became a symbol of the order and cleanliness that man
imposes on the unruly world about him.  I tore down my
book rack and reading lamp from over the sink.
</p><p>"Mr. Gilbert," he went on, "do not laugh at me when
I tell you that I have evolved a whole kitchen philosophy
of my own.  I find the kitchen the shrine of our
civilization, the focus of all that is comely in life.
The ruddy shine of the stove is as beautiful as any
sunset.  A well-polished jug or spoon is as fair, as
complete and beautiful, as any sonnet.  The dish mop,
properly rinsed and wrung



<pb n="24"/>
and hung outside the back
door to dry, is a whole sermon in itself.  The stars
never look so bright as they do from the kitchen door
after the ice-box pan is emptied and the whole place is
`redd up,' as the Scotch say."
</p><p>"A very delightful philosophy indeed," said Gilbert.
"And now that we have finished our meal, I insist upon
your letting me give you a hand with the washing up.  I
am eager to test this dish-pantheism of yours!"
</p><p>"My dear fellow," said Mifflin, laying a restraining
hand on his impetuous guest, "it is a poor philosophy
that will not abide denial now and then.  No, no&mdash;I did
not ask you to spend the evening with me to wash dishes."
And he led the way back to his sitting room.
</p><p>"When I saw you come in," said Mifflin, "I was afraid
you might be a newspaper man, looking for an interview.
A young journalist came to see us once, with very unhappy
results.  He wheedled himself into Mrs. Mifflin's good
graces, and ended by putting us both into a book, called
<hi rend="italic">Parnassus on Wheels,</hi> which has been rather a trial to me.
In that book he attributes to me a number of shallow and
sugary observations upon bookselling that have been an
annoyance to the trade.  I am happy to say, though, that
his book had only a trifling sale."


</p>

<pb n="25"/>

<p>"I have never heard of it," said Gilbert.
</p><p>"If you are really interested in bookselling you
should come here some evening to a meeting of the Corn
Cob Club.  Once a month a number of booksellers gather
here and we discuss matters of bookish concern over
corn-cobs and cider.  We have all sorts and conditions of
booksellers: one is a fanatic on the subject of
libraries.  He thinks that every public library should be
dynamited.  Another thinks that moving pictures will
destroy the book trade.  What rot!  Surely everything
that arouses people's minds, that makes them alert and
questioning, increases their appetite for books."
</p><p>"The life of a bookseller is very demoralizing to the
intellect," he went on after a pause.  "He is surrounded
by innumerable books; he cannot possibly read them all;
he dips into one and picks up a scrap from another.  His
mind gradually fills itself with miscellaneous flotsam,
with superficial opinions, with a thousand
half-knowledges.  Almost unconsciously he begins to rate
literature according to what people ask for.  He begins
to wonder whether Ralph Waldo Trine isn't really greater
than Ralph Waldo Emerson, whether J. M. Chapple isn't as
big a man as J. M. Barrie.  That way lies intellectual
suicide.
</p><p>"One thing, however, you must grant the good
bookseller.  He is tolerant.  He is patient of all




<pb n="26"/>
ideas and theories.  Surrounded, engulfed by the
torrent of men's words, he is willing to listen to them
all.  Even to the publisher's salesman he turns an
indulgent ear.  He is willing to be humbugged for the
weal of humanity.  He hopes unceasingly for good books to
be born.
</p><p>"My business, you see, is different from most.  I
only deal in second-hand books; I only buy books that I
consider have some honest reason for existence.  In so
far as human judgment can discern, I try to keep trash
out of my shelves.  A doctor doesn't traffic in quack
remedies.  I don't traffic in bogus books.
</p><p>"A comical thing happened the other day.  There is a
certain wealthy man, a Mr. Chapman, who has long
frequented this shop&mdash;"
</p><p>"I wonder if that could be Mr. Chapman of the Chapman
Daintybits Company?" said Gilbert, feeling his feet touch
familiar soil.
</p><p>"The same, I believe," said Mifflin.  "Do you know
him?"
</p><p>"Ah," cried the young man with reverence.  "There is
a man who can tell you the virtues of advertising.  If he
is interested in books, it is advertising that made it
possible.  We handle all his copy&mdash;I've written a lot of
it myself.  We have made the Chapman prunes a staple of
civilization and culture.  I myself devised that slogan




<pb n="27"/>
`We preen ourselves on our prunes' which you see in
every big magazine.  Chapman prunes are known the world
over.  The Mikado eats them once a week.  The Pope eats
them.  Why, we have just heard that thirteen cases of
them are to be put on board the <hi rend="italic">George Washington</hi> for the
President's voyage to the peace Conference.  The
Czecho-Slovak armies were fed largely on prunes.  It is
our conviction in the office that our campaign for the
Chapman prunes did much to win the war."
</p><p>"I read in an ad the other day&mdash;perhaps you wrote
that, too?" said the bookseller, "that the Elgin watch
had won the war.  However, Mr. Chapman has long been one
of my best customers.  He heard about the Corn Cob Club,
and though of course he is not a bookseller he begged to
come to our meetings.  We were glad to have him do so,
and he has entered into our discussions with great zeal.
Often he has offered many a shrewd comment.  He has grown
so enthusiastic about the bookseller's way of life that
the other day he wrote to me about his daughter (he is a
widower).  She has been attending a fashionable girls'
school where, he says, they have filled her head with
absurd, wasteful, snobbish notions.  He says she has no
more idea of the usefulness and beauty of life than a
Pomeranian dog.  Instead of sending her to college, he
has asked me if Mrs. Mifflin and I



<pb n="28"/>
will take her in
here to learn to sell books.  He wants her to think she
is earning her keep, and is going to pay me privately for
the privilege of having her live here.  He thinks that
being surrounded by books will put some sense in her
head.  I am rather nervous about the experiment, but it
is a compliment to the shop, isn't it?"
</p><p>"Ye gods," cried Gilbert, "what advertising copy that
would make!"
</p><p>At this point the bell in the shop rang, and Mifflin
jumped up.  "This part of the evening is often rather
busy," he said.  "I'm afraid I'll have to go down on the
floor.  Some of my habitues rather expect me to be on
hand to gossip about books."
</p><p>"I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed myself," said
Gilbert.  "I'm going to come again and study your
shelves."
</p><p>"Well, keep it dark about the young lady," said the
bookseller.  "I don't want all you young blades dropping
in here to unsettle her mind.  If she falls in love with
anybody in this shop, it'll have to be Joseph Conrad or
John Keats!"
</p><p>As he passed out, Gilbert saw Roger Mifflin engaged
in argument with a bearded man who looked like a college
professor.  "Carlyle's Oliver <hi rend="italic">Cromwell?"</hi> he was saying.
"Yes, indeed!  Right over here!  Hullo, that's odd!  It
<hi rend="italic">was</hi> here."

<head>CHAPTER II
<lb/>
The Corn Cob <ref target="n2.1">Club</ref>
</head>



<p>The Haunted Bookshop was a delightful place, especially
of an evening, when its drowsy alcoves were kindled with
the brightness of lamps shining on the rows of volumes.
Many a passer-by would stumble down the steps from the
street in sheer curiosity; others, familiar visitors,
dropped in with the same comfortable emotion that a man
feels on entering his club.  Roger's custom was to sit at
his desk in the rear, puffing his pipe and reading;
though if any customer started a conversation, the little
man was quick and eager to carry it on.  The lion of talk
lay only sleeping in him; it was not hard to goad it up.
</p><p>It may be remarked that all bookshops that are open
in the evening are busy in the after-supper hours.  Is it
that the true book-lovers are nocturnal gentry, only
venturing forth when darkness and silence and the gleam
of hooded lights irresistibly


<pb n="30"/>
suggest reading?  Certainly night-time has a mystic affinity for
literature, and it is strange that the Esquimaux have
created no great books.  Surely, for most of us, an
arctic night would be insupportable without O. Henry and
Stevenson.  Or, as Roger Mifflin remarked during a
passing enthusiasm for Ambrose Bierce, the true <hi rend="italic">noctes
ambrosianae are the noctes ambrose bierceianae.</hi>
</p><p>But Roger was prompt in closing Parnassus at ten
o'clock.  At that hour he and Bock (the mustard-coloured
terrier, named for Boccaccio) would make the round of the
shop, see that everything was shipshape, empty the ash
trays provided for customers, lock the front door, and
turn off the lights.  Then they would retire to the den,
where Mrs. Mifflin was generally knitting or reading.
She would brew a pot of cocoa and they would read or talk
for half an hour or so before bed.  Sometimes Roger would
take a stroll along Gissing Street before turning in.
All day spent with books has a rather exhausting effect
on the mind, and he used to enjoy the fresh air sweeping
up the dark Brooklyn streets, meditating some thought
that had sprung from his reading, while Bock sniffed and
padded along in the manner of an elderly dog at night.
</p><p>While Mrs. Mifflin was away, however, Roger's routine
was somewhat different.  After closing


<pb n="31"/>
the shop he would return to his desk and with a furtive,
shamefaced air take out from a bottom drawer an untidy folder of
notes and manuscript.  This was the skeleton in his
closet, his secret sin.  It was the scaffolding of his
book, which he had been compiling for at least ten years,
and to which he had tentatively assigned such different
titles as "Notes on Literature," "The Muse on Crutches,"
"Books and I," and "What a Young Bookseller Ought to
Know."  It had begun long ago, in the days of his odyssey
as a rural book huckster, under the title of "Literature
Among the Farmers," but it had branched out until it
began to appear that (in bulk at least) Ridpath would
have to look to his linoleum laurels.  The manuscript in
its present state had neither beginning nor end, but it
was growing strenuously in the middle, and hundreds of
pages were covered with Roger's minute script.  The
chapter on "Ars Bibliopolae," or the art of bookselling,
would be, he hoped, a classic among generations of book
vendors still unborn.  Seated at his disorderly desk,
caressed by a counterpane of drifting tobacco haze, he
would pore over the manuscript, crossing out,
interpolating, re-arguing, and then referring to volumes
on his shelves.  Bock would snore under the chair, and
soon Roger's brain would begin to waver.  In the end he
would fall asleep over his

<pb n="32"/>
papers, wake with a cramp
about two o'clock, and creak irritably to a lonely bed.
</p><p>All this we mention only to explain how it was that
Roger was dozing at his desk about midnight, the evening
after the call paid by Aubrey Gilbert.  He was awakened
by a draught of chill air passing like a mountain brook
over his bald pate.  Stiffly he sat up and looked about.
The shop was in darkness save for the bright electric
over his head.  Bock, of more regular habit than his
master, had gone back to his couch in the kitchen, made
of a packing case that had once coffined a set of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica.
</p><p>"That's funny," said Roger to himself.  "Surely I
locked the door?"  He walked to the front of the shop,
switching on the cluster of lights that hung from the
ceiling.  The door was ajar, but everything else seemed
as usual.  Bock, hearing his footsteps, came trotting out
from the kitchen, his claws rattling on the bare wooden
floor.  He looked up with the patient inquiry of a dog
accustomed to the eccentricities of his patron.
</p><p>"I guess I'm getting absent-minded," said Roger.  "I
must have left the door open."  He closed and locked it.
Then he noticed that the terrier was sniffing in the
History alcove, which was at the front of the shop on the
left-hand side.
</p><p>"What is it, old man?" said Roger.  "Want


<pb n="33"/>
something to read in bed?" He turned on the light in
that alcove.  Everything appeared normal.  Then he
noticed a book that projected an inch or so beyond the
even line of bindings.  It was a fad of Roger's to keep
all his books in a flat row on the shelves, and almost
every evening at closing time he used to run his palm
along the backs of the volumes to level any
irregularities left by careless browsers.  He put out a
hand to push the book into place.  Then he stopped.
</p><p>"Queer again," he thought.  "Carlyle's <hi rend="italic">Oliver
Cromwell!</hi> I looked for that book last night and couldn't
find it.  When that professor fellow was here.  Maybe I'm
tired and can't see straight.  I'll go to bed."


The next day was a date of some moment.  Not only was it
Thanksgiving Day, with the November meeting of the Corn
Cob Club scheduled for that evening, but Mrs. Mifflin had
promised to get home from Boston in time to bake a
chocolate cake for the booksellers.  It was said that
some of the members of the club were faithful in
attendance more by reason of Mrs. Mifflin's chocolate
cake, and the cask of cider that her brother Andrew
McGill sent down from the Sabine Farm every autumn, than
on account of the bookish conversation.
</p>


<pb n="34"/>
<p>Roger spent the morning in doing a little
housecleaning, in preparation for his wife's return.  He
was a trifle abashed to find how many mingled crumbs and
tobacco cinders had accumulated on the dining-room rug.
He cooked himself a modest lunch of lamb chops and baked
potatoes, and was pleased by an epigram concerning food
that came into his mind.  "It's not the food you dream
about that matters," he said to himself; "it's the
vittles that walk right in and become a member of the
family."  He felt that this needed a little polishing and
rephrasing, but that there was a germ of wit in it.  He
had a habit of encountering ideas at his solitary meals.
</p><p>After this, he was busy at the sink scrubbing the
dishes, when he was surprised by feeling two very
competent arms surround him, and a pink gingham apron was
thrown over his head.  "Mifflin," said his wife, "how
many times have I told you to put on an apron when you
wash up!"
</p><p>They greeted each other with the hearty, affectionate
simplicity of those congenially wedded in middle age.
Helen Mifflin was a buxom, healthy creature, rich in good
sense and good humour, well nourished both in mind and
body.  She kissed Roger's bald head, tied the apron
around his shrimpish person, and sat down on a kitchen
chair to watch him finish wiping the china.  Her cheeks



<pb n="35"/>
were cool and ruddy from the keen air, her face lit
with the tranquil satisfaction of those who have
sojourned in the comfortable city of Boston.
</p><p>"Well, my dear," said Roger, "this makes it a real
Thanksgiving.  You look as plump and full of matter as
<hi rend="italic">The Home Book of Verse."</hi>
</p><p>"I've had a stunning time," she said, patting Bock
who stood at her knee, imbibing the familiar and
mysterious fragrance by which dogs identify their human
friends.  "I haven't even heard of a book for three
weeks.  I did stop in at the Old Angle Book Shop
yesterday, just to say hullo to Joe Jillings.  He says
all booksellers are crazy, but that you are the craziest
of the lot.  He wants to know if you're bankrupt yet."
</p><p>Roger's slate-blue eyes twinkled.  He hung up a cup
in the china closet and lit his pipe before replying.
</p><p>"What did you say?"
</p><p>"I said that our shop was haunted, and mustn't be
supposed to come under the usual conditions of the
trade."
</p><p>"Bully for you!  And what did Joe say to that?"
</p><p>"`Haunted by the nuts!'"
</p><p>"Well," said Roger, "when literature goes bankrupt
I'm willing to go with it.  Not till then.  But by the
way, we're going to be haunted by a


<pb n="36"/>
beauteous damsel pretty soon.  You remember my telling you that
Mr. Chapman wants to send his daughter to work in the shop?
Well, here's a letter I had from him this morning."
</p><p>He rummaged in his pocket, and produced the
following, which Mrs. Mifflin read:
</p>
<p>
DEAR MR. MIFFLIN,</p>
<p>I am so delighted that you and Mrs. Mifflin are
willing to try the experiment of taking my daughter as an
apprentice.  Titania is really a very charming girl, and
if only we can get some of the "finishing school"
nonsense out of her head she will make a fine woman.  She
has had (it was my fault, not hers) the disadvantage of
being brought up, or rather brought down, by having every
possible want and whim gratified.  Out of kindness for
herself and her future husband, if she should have one,
I want her to learn a little about earning a living.  She
is nearly nineteen, and I told her if she would try the
bookshop job for a while I would take her to Europe for
a year afterward.
</p><p>As I explained to you, I want her to think she is
really earning her way.  Of course I don't want the
routine to be too hard for her, but I do want her to get
some idea of what it means to face life on one's own.  If
you will pay her ten dollars a week as a beginner, and
deduct her board from that, I will pay you twenty dollars
a week, privately, for your responsibility in caring for
her and keeping your and Mrs. Mifflin's friendly eyes on
her.  I'm coming round to the Corn Cob meeting to-morrow
night, and we can make the final arrangements.
</p><p>Luckily, she is very fond of books, and I really
think she is looking forward to the adventure with much
anticipation.



<pb n="37"/>
I overheard her saying to one of her
friends yesterday that she was going to do some "literary
work" this winter.  That's the kind of nonsense I want
her to outgrow.  When I hear her say that she's got a job

<p>"Well?" said Roger, as Mrs. Mifflin made no comment.
"Don't you think it will be rather interesting to get a
naive young girl's reactions toward the problems of our
tranquil existence?"
</p><p>"Roger, you blessed innocent!" cried his wife.  "Life
will no longer be tranquil with a girl of nineteen round
the place.  You may fool yourself, but you can't fool me.
A girl of nineteen doesn't <hi rend="italic">react</hi> toward things.  She
explodes.  Things don't `react' anywhere but in Boston
and in chemical laboratories.  I suppose you know you're
taking a human bombshell into the arsenal?"
</p><p>Roger looked dubious.  "I remember something in <hi rend="italic">Weir
of Hermiston</hi> about a girl being `an explosive engine,'"
he said.  "But I don't see that she can do any very great
harm round here.  We're both pretty well proof against
shell shock.  The worst that could happen would be if she
got hold of my private copy of <hi rend="italic">Fireside Conversation in
the Age of queen Elizabeth.</hi>  Remind me to lock it up
somewhere, will you?"

</p><p>This secret masterpiece by Mark Twain was one of the
bookseller's treasures.  Not even Helen had ever been
permitted to read it; and she had shrewdly judged that it
was not in her line, for though she knew perfectly well
where he kept it (together with his life insurance
policy, some Liberty Bonds, an autograph letter from
Charles Spencer Chaplin, and a snapshot of herself taken
on their honeymoon) she had never made any attempt to
examine it.
</p><p>"Well," said Helen; "Titania or no Titania, if the
Corn Cobs want their chocolate cake to-night, I must get
busy.  Take my suitcase upstairs like a good fellow."


</p><p>A gathering of booksellers is a pleasant sanhedrim to
attend.  The members of this ancient craft bear
mannerisms and earmarks just as definitely recognizable
as those of the cloak and suit business or any other
trade.  They are likely to be a little&mdash;shall we
say&mdash;worn at the bindings, as becomes men who have
forsaken worldly profit to pursue a noble calling ill
rewarded in cash.  They are possibly a trifle embittered,
which is an excellent demeanour for mankind in the face
of inscrutable heaven.  Long experience with publishers
salesmen makes them suspicious of books praised between
the courses of a heavy meal.  When a



<pb n="39"/>
publisher's salesman takes you out to dinner, it is not
surprising if the conversation turns toward literature about
the time the last of the peas are being harried about the plate.
But, as Jerry Gladfist says (he runs a shop up on
Thirty-Eighth Street) the publishers' salesmen supply a
long-felt want, for they do now and then buy one a dinner
the like of which no bookseller would otherwise be likely
to commit.
</p><p>"Well, gentlemen," said Roger as his guests assembled
in his little cabinet, "it's a cold evening.  Pull up
toward the fire.  Make free with the cider.  The cake's
on the table.  My wife came back from Boston specially to
make it."
</p><p>"Here's Mrs. Mifflin's health!" said Mr. Chapman, a
quiet little man who had a habit of listening to what he
heard.  "I hope she doesn't mind keeping the shop while
we celebrate?"
</p><p>"Not a bit," said Roger.  "She enjoys it."
</p><p>"I see <hi rend="italic">Tarzan of the Apes</hi> is running at the Gissing

Street movie palace," said Gladfist.  "Great stuff.  Have
you seen it?"
</p><p>"Not while I can still read <hi rend="italic">The Jungle Book,"</hi> said
Roger.
</p><p>"You make me tired with that talk about literature,"
cried Jerry.  "A book's a book, even if Harold Bell
Wright wrote it."  "A book's a book if you enjoy reading
it,"



<pb n="40"/>
amended Meredith, from a big Fifth Avenue
bookstore.  "Lots of people enjoy Harold Bell Wright just
as lots of people enjoy tripe.  Either of them would kill
me.  But let's be tolerant."
</p><p>"Your argument is a whole succession of <hi rend="italic">non
sequiturs,"</hi> said Jerry, stimulated by the cider to
unusual brilliance.
</p><p>"That's a long putt," chuckled Benson, the dealer in
rare books and first editions.
</p><p>"What I mean is this," said Jerry.  "We aren't
literary critics.  It's none of our business to say
what's good and what isn't.  Our job is simply to supply
the public with the books it wants when it wants them.
How it comes to want the books it does is no concern of
ours."
</p><p>"You're the guy that calls bookselling the worst
business in the world," said Roger warmly, "and you're
the kind of guy that makes it so.  I suppose you would
say that it is no concern of the bookseller to try to
increase the public appetite for books?"
</p><p>"Appetite is too strong a word," said Jerry.  "As far
as books are concerned the public is barely able to sit
up and take a little liquid nourishment.  Solid foods
don't interest it.  If you try to cram roast beef down
the gullet of an invalid you'll kill him.  Let the public
alone, and thank God when it comes round to amputate any
of its hard-earned cash."




<pb n="41"/>

</p><p>"Well, take it on the lowest basis," said Roger.  "I
haven't any facts to go upon&mdash;"
</p><p>"You never have," interjected Jerry.
</p><p>"But I'd like to bet that the Trade has made more
money out of Bryce's <hi rend="italic">American Commonwealth</hi> than it ever
did out of all Parson Wright's books put together."
</p><p>"What of it?  Why shouldn't they make both?"
</p><p>This preliminary tilt was interrupted by the arrival
of two more visitors, and Roger handed round mugs of
cider, pointed to the cake and the basket of pretzels,
and lit his corn-cob pipe.  The new arrivals were Quincy
and Fruehling; the former a clerk in the book department
of a vast drygoods store, the latter the owner of a
bookshop in the Hebrew quarter of Grand Street&mdash;one of
the best-stocked shops in the city, though little known
to uptown book-lovers.
</p><p>"Well," said Fruehling, his bright dark eyes
sparkling above richly tinted cheek-bones and bushy
beard, "what's the argument?"
</p><p>"The usual one," said Gladfist, grinning, "Mifflin
confusing merchandise with metaphysics."
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;Not at all.  I am simply saying that it is
good business to sell only the best.
</p><p>GLADFIST&mdash;Wrong again.  You must select your stock
according to your customers.  Ask Quincy



<pb n="42"/>
here.  Would there be any sense in his loading up his shelves
with Maeterlinck and Shaw when the department-store trade
wants Eleanor Porter and the Tarzan stuff?  Does a
country grocer carry the same cigars that are listed on
the wine card of a Fifth Avenue hotel?  Of course not.
He gets in the cigars that his trade enjoys and is
accustomed to.  Bookselling must obey the ordinary rules
of commerce.
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;A fig for the ordinary rules of commerce!
I came over here to Gissing Street to get away from them.
My mind would blow out its fuses if I had to abide by the
dirty little considerations of supply and demand.  As far
as I am concerned, supply <hi rend="italic">creates</hi> demand.
</p><p>GLADFIST&mdash;Still, old chap, you have to abide by the
dirty little consideration of earning a living, unless
someone has endowed you?
</p><p>BENSON&mdash;Of course my line of business isn't strictly
the same as you fellows'.  But a thought that has often
occurred to me in selling rare editions may interest you.
The customer's willingness to part with his money is
usually in inverse ratio to the permanent benefit he
expects to derive from what he purchases.
</p><p>MEREDITH&mdash;Sounds a bit like John Stuart Mill.
</p><p>BENSON&mdash;Even so, it may be true.  Folks will pay a
darned sight more to be amused than they



<pb n="43"/>
will to be
exalted.  Look at the way a man shells out five bones for
a couple of theatre seats, or spends a couple of dollars
a week on cigars without thinking of it.  Yet two dollars
or five dollars for a book costs him positive anguish.
The mistake you fellows in the retail trade have made is
in trying to persuade your customers that books are
necessities.  Tell them they're luxuries.  That'll get
them! People have to work so hard in this life they're
shy of necessities.  A man will go on wearing a suit
until it's threadbare, much sooner than smoke a thread
bare cigar.
</p><p>GLADFIST&mdash;Not a bad thought.  You know, Mifflin here
calls me a material-minded cynic, but by thunder, I think
I'm more idealistic than he is.  I'm no propagandist
incessantly trying to cajole poor innocent customers into
buying the kind of book _I_ think they ought to buy.
When I see the helpless pathos of most of them, who drift
into a bookstore without the slightest idea of what they
want or what is worth reading, I would disdain to take
advantage of their frailty.  They are absolutely at the
mercy of the salesman.  They will buy whatever he tells
them to.  Now the honourable man, the high-minded man (by
which I mean myself) is too proud to ram some shimmering
stuff at them just because he thinks they ought to read
it.  Let the boobs blunder around and grab what



<pb n="44"/>
they can.  Let natural selection operate.  I think it is
fascinating to watch them, to see their helpless groping,
and to study the weird ways in which they make their
choice.  Usually they will buy a book either because they
think the jacket is attractive, or because it costs a
dollar and a quarter instead of a dollar and a half, or
because they say they saw a review of it.  The "review"
usually turns out to be an ad.  I don't think one
book-buyer in a thousand knows the difference.
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;Your doctrine is pitiless, base, and false!
What would you think of a physician who saw men suffering
from a curable disease and did nothing to alleviate their
sufferings?
</p><p>GLADFIST&mdash;Their sufferings (as you call them) are
nothing to what mine would be if I stocked up with a lot
of books that no one but highbrows would buy.  What would
you think of a base public that would go past my shop day
after day and let the high-minded occupant die of
starvation?
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;Your ailment, Jerry, is that you conceive
yourself as merely a tradesman.  What I'm telling you is
that the bookseller is a public servant.  He ought to be
pensioned by the state.  The honour of his profession
should compel him to do all he can to spread the
distribution of good stuff.
</p><p>QUINCY&mdash;I think you forget how much we who



<pb n="45"/>
deal chiefly in new books are at the mercy of the publishers.
We have to stock the new stuff, a large proportion of
which is always punk.  Why it is punk, goodness knows,
because most of the bum books don't sell.
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;Ah, that is a mystery indeed!  But I can
give you a fair reason.  First, because there isn't
enough good stuff to go round.  Second, because of the
ignorance of the publishers, many of whom honestly don't
know a good book when they see it.  It is a matter of
sheer heedlessness in the selection of what they intend
to publish.  A big drug factory or a manufacturer of a
well-known jam spends vast sums of money on chemically
assaying and analyzing the ingredients that are to go
into his medicines or in gathering and selecting the
fruit that is to be stewed into jam.  And yet they tell
me that the most important department of a publishing
business, which is the gathering and sampling of
manuscripts, is the least considered and the least
remunerated.  I knew a reader for one publishing house:
he was a babe recently out of college who didn't know a
book from a frat pin.  If a jam factory employs a trained
chemist, why isn't it worth a publisher's while to employ
an expert book analyzer?  There are some of them.  Look
at the fellow who runs the <hi rend="italic">Pacific Monthly's</hi> book
business for example!  He knows a thing or two.



<pb n="46"/>

</p><p>CHAPMAN&mdash;I think perhaps you exaggerate the value of
those trained experts.  They are likely to be
fourflushers.  We had one once at our factory, and as far
as I could make out he never thought we were doing good
business except when we were losing money.
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;As far as I have been able to observe,
making money is the easiest thing in the world.  All you
have to do is to turn out an honest product, something
that the public needs.  Then you have to let them know
that you have it, and teach them that they need it.  They
will batter down your front door in their eagerness to
get it.  But if you begin to hand them gold bricks, if
you begin to sell them books built like an apartment
house, all marble front and all brick behind, you're
cutting your own throat, or rather cutting your own
pocket, which is the same thing.
</p><p>MEREDITH&mdash;I think Mifflin's right.  You know the kind
of place our shop is: a regular Fifth Avenue store, all
plate glass front and marble columns glowing in the
indirect lighting like a birchwood at full moon.  We sell
hundreds of dollars' worth of bunkum every day because
people ask for it; but I tell you we do it with
reluctance.  It's rather the custom in our shop to scoff
at the book-buying public and call them boobs, but they
really want good books&mdash;the poor souls don't know how to




<pb n="47"/>
get them.  Still, Jerry has a certain grain of truth
to his credit.  I get ten times more satisfaction in
selling a copy of Newton's The Amenities of
Book-Collecting than I do in selling a copy of&mdash;well,
Tarzan;  but it's poor business to impose your own
private tastes on your customers.  All you can do is to
hint them along tactfully, when you get a chance, toward
the stuff that counts.
</p><p>QUINCY&mdash;You remind me of something that happened in
our book department the other day.  A flapper came in and
said she had forgotten the name of the book she wanted,
but it was something about a young man who had been
brought up by the monks.  I was stumped.  I tried her
with <hi rend="italic">The Cloister and the Hearth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Monastery
Bells</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Legends of the Monastic Orders</hi>
and so on, but her face
was blank.  Then one of the salesgirls overheard us
talking, and she guessed it right off the bat.  Of course
it was <hi rend="italic">Tarzan.</hi>
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;YOU poor simp, there was your chance to
introduce her to Mowgli and the bandar-log.
</p><p>QUINCY&mdash;True&mdash;I didn't think of it.
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;I'd like to get you fellows' ideas about
advertising.  There was a young chap in here the other
day from an advertising agency, trying to get me to put
some copy in the papers.  Have you found that it pays?
</p><p>FRUEHLING&mdash;It always pays&mdash;somebody.  The



<pb n="48"/>
only
question is, does it pay the man who pays for the ad?
</p><p>MEREDITH&mdash;What do you mean?
</p><p>FRUEHLING&mdash;Did you ever consider the problem of what
I call tangential advertising?  By that I mean
advertising that benefits your rival rather than
yourself?  Take an example.  On Sixth Avenue there is a
lovely delicatessen shop, but rather expensive.  Every
conceivable kind of sweetmeat and relish is displayed in
the brightly lit window.  When you look at that window it
simply makes your mouth water.  You decide to have
something to eat.  But do you get it there?  Not much!
You go a little farther down the street and get it at the
Automat or the Crystal Lunch.  The delicatessen fellow
pays the overhead expense of that beautiful food exhibit,
and the other man gets the benefit of it.  It's the same
way in my business.  I'm in a factory district, where
people can't afford to have any but the best books.
(Meredith will bear me out in saying that only the
wealthy can afford the poor ones.)  They read the book
ads in the papers and magazines, the ads of Meredith's
shop and others, and then they come to me to buy them.
I believe in advertising, but I believe in letting
someone else pay for it.
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;I guess perhaps I can afford to go on riding
on Meredith's ads.  I hadn't thought of

<pb n="49"/>
that.  But I think I shall put a little notice in one of the
papers some day, just a little card saying

<lb/>              PARNASSUS AT HOME
<lb/>              GOOD BOOKS BOUGHT
<lb/>                 AND SOLD
<lb/>            THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED


It will be fun to see what come-back I get.
</p><p>QUINCY&mdash;The book section of a department store
doesn't get much chance to enjoy that tangential
advertising, as Fruehling calls it.  Why, when our
interior decorating shark puts a few volumes of a pirated
Kipling bound in crushed oilcloth or a copy of
"Knock-kneed Stories," into the window to show off a
Louis XVIII boudoir suite, display space is charged up
against my department!  Last summer he asked me for
"something by that Ring fellow, I forget the name," to
put a punchy finish on a layout of porch furniture.  I
thought perhaps he meant Wagner's Nibelungen operas, and
began to dig them out.  Then I found he meant Ring
Lardner.
</p><p>GLADFIST&mdash;There you are.  I keep telling you
bookselling is an impossible job for a man who loves
literature.  When did a bookseller ever make any real
contribution to the world's happiness?


<pb n="50"/>

</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;Dr. Johnson's father was a bookseller.
</p><p>GLADFIST&mdash;Yes, and couldn't afford to pay for Sam's
education.
</p><p>FRUEHLING&mdash;There's another kind of tangential
advertising that interests me.  Take, for instance, a
Coles Phillips painting for some brand of silk stockings.
Of course the high lights of the picture are cunningly
focussed on the stockings of the eminently beautiful
lady; but there is always something else in the
picture&mdash;an automobile or a country house or a Morris
chair or a parasol&mdash;which makes it just as effective an
ad for those goods as it is for the stockings.  Every now
and then Phillips sticks a book into his paintings, and
I expect the Fifth Avenue book trade benefits by it.  A
book that fits the mind as well as a silk stocking does
the ankle will be sure to sell.
</p><p>MIFFLIN&mdash;You are all crass materialists.  I tell you,
books are the depositories of the human spirit, which is
the only thing in this world that endures.  What was it
Shakespeare said&mdash;
 </p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>Not marble nor the gilded monuments </l>
<l>princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme&mdash;</l>
</lg>
<p>
By the bones of the Hohenzollerns, he was right!  And
wait a minute!  There's something in Carlyle's <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>
that comes back to me.




<pb n="51"/>

</p><p>He ran excitedly out of the room, and the members of
the Corn Cob fraternity grinned at each other.  Gladfist
cleaned his pipe and poured out some more cider.  "He's
off on his hobby," he chuckled.  "I love baiting him."
</p><p>"Speaking of Carlyle's <hi rend="italic">Cromwell,"</hi> said Fruehling,
"that's a book I don't often hear asked for.  But a
fellow came in the other day hunting for a copy, and to
my chagrin I didn't have one.  I rather pride myself on
keeping that sort of thing in stock.  So I called up
Brentano's to see if I could pick one up, and they told
me they had just sold the only copy they had.  Somebody
must have been boosting Thomas!  Maybe he's quoted in
<hi rend="italic">Tarzan,</hi> or somebody has bought up the film rights."
</p><p>Mifflin came in, looking rather annoyed.
</p><p>"Here's an odd thing," he said.  "I know damn well
that copy of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> was on the shelf because I saw it
there last night.  It's not there now."
</p><p>"That's nothing," said Quincy.  "You know how people
come into a second-hand store, see a book they take a
fancy to but don't feel like buying just then, and tuck
it away out of sight or on some other shelf where they
think no one else will spot it, but they'll be able to
find it when they can afford it.  Probably someone's done
that with your <hi rend="italic">Cromwell."</hi>


<pb n="52"/>

</p><p>"Maybe, but I doubt it," said Mifflin.  "Mrs. Mifflin
says she didn't sell it this evening.  I woke her up to
ask her.  She was dozing over her knitting at the desk.
I guess she's tired after her trip."
</p><p>"I'm sorry to miss the Carlyle quotation," said
Benson.  "What was the gist?"
</p><p>"I think I've got it jotted down in a notebook," said
Roger, hunting along a shelf.  "Yes, here it is."  He
read aloud:
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">"The works of a man, bury them under what guano-mountains
and obscene owl-droppings you will, do not perish, cannot
perish.  What of Heroism, what of Eternal Light was in a
Man and his Life, is with very great exactness added to
the Eternities, remains forever a new divine portion of
the Sum of Things.</hi></p>

<p>"Now, my friends, the bookseller is one of the keys in
that universal adding machine, because he aids in the
cross-fertilization of men and books.  His delight in his
calling doesn't need to be stimulated even by the bright
shanks of a Coles Phillips picture.
</p><p>"Roger, my boy," said Gladfist, "your innocent
enthusiasm makes me think of Tom Daly's favourite story
about the Irish priest who was rebuking his flock for
their love of whisky.  `Whisky,' he said, `is the bane of
this congregation.  Whisky, that steals away a man's
brains.  Whisky, that makes you shoot at landlords&mdash;and
not hit them!'



<pb n="53"/>
Even so, my dear Roger, your
enthusiasm makes you shoot at truth and never come
anywhere near it."
</p><p>"Jerry," said Roger, "you are a upas tree.  Your
shadow is poisonous!"
</p><p>"Well, gentlemen," said Mr. Chapman, "I know Mrs.
Mifflin wants to be relieved of her post.  I vote we
adjourn early.  Your conversation is always delightful,
though I am sometimes a bit uncertain as to the
conclusions.  My daughter is going to be a bookseller,
and I shall look forward to hearing her views on the
business."
</p><p>As the guests made their way out through the shop,
Mr. Chapman drew Roger aside.  "It's perfectly all right
about sending Titania?" he asked.
</p><p>"Absolutely," said Roger.  "When does she want to
come?"
</p><p>"Is to-morrow too soon?"
</p><p>"The sooner the better.  We've got a little spare
room upstairs that she can have.  I've got some ideas of
my own about furnishing it for her.  Send her round
to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<head>CHAPTER III
<lb/>
Titania Arrives</head>

<p>The first pipe after breakfast is a rite of some
importance to seasoned smokers, and Roger applied the
flame to the bowl as he stood at the bottom of the
stairs.  He blew a great gush of strong blue reek that
eddied behind him as he ran up the flight, his mind
eagerly meditating the congenial task of arranging the
little spare room for the coming employee.  Then, at the
top of the steps, he found that his pipe had already gone
out.  "What with filling my pipe and emptying it,
lighting it and relighting it," he thought, "I don't seem
to get much time for the serious concerns of life.  Come
to think of it, smoking, soiling dishes and washing them,
talking and listening to other people talk, take up most
of life anyway."
</p><p>This theory rather pleased him, so he ran downstairs
again to tell it to Mrs. Mifflin.
</p><p>"Go along and get that room fixed up," she said, "and
don't try to palm off any bogus doctrines on me so early
in the morning.  Housewives have no time for philosophy
after breakfast."
</p><p>Roger thoroughly enjoyed himself in the task of


<pb n="55"/>
preparing the guest-room for the new assistant.  It
was a small chamber at the back of the second storey,
opening on to a narrow passage that connected through a
door with the gallery of the bookshop.  Two small windows
commanded a view of the modest roofs of that quarter of
Brooklyn, roofs that conceal so many brave hearts, so
many baby carriages, so many cups of bad coffee, and so
many cartons of the Chapman prunes.
</p><p>"By the way," he called downstairs, "better have some
of the prunes for supper to-night, just as a compliment
to Miss Chapman."
</p><p>Mrs. Mifflin preserved a humorous silence.
</p><p>Over these noncommittal summits the bright eye of the
bookseller, as he tacked up the freshly ironed muslin
curtains Mrs. Mifflin had allotted, could discern a
glimpse of the bay and the leviathan ferries that link
Staten Island with civilization.  "Just a touch of
romance  in the outlook," he thought to himself.  "It
will suffice to keep a blasee young girl aware of the
excitements of existence."
</p><p>The room, as might be expected in a house presided
over by Helen Mifflin, was in perfect order to receive
any occupant, but Roger had volunteered to psychologize
it in such a fashion as (he thought) would convey
favourable influences to the misguided young spirit that
was to be its tenant.  Incurable idealist, he had taken
quite gravely his



<pb n="56"/>
responsibility as landlord and
employer of Mr. Chapman's daughter.  No chambered
nautilus was to have better opportunity to expand the
tender mansions of its soul.
</p><p>Beside the bed was a bookshelf with a reading lamp.
The problem Roger was discussing was what books and
pictures might be the best preachers to this congregation
of one.  To Mrs. Mifflin's secret amusement he had taken
down the picture of Sir Galahad which he had once hung
there, because (as he had said) if Sir Galahad were
living to-day he would be a bookseller.  "We don't want
her feasting her imagination on young Galahads," he had
remarked at breakfast.  "That way lies premature
matrimony.  What I want to do is put up in her room one
or two good prints representing actual men who were so
delightful in their day that all the young men she is
likely to see now will seem tepid and prehensile.  Thus
she will become disgusted with the present generation of
youths and there will be some chance of her really
putting her mind on the book business."
</p><p>Accordingly he had spent some time in going through
a bin where he kept photos and drawings of authors that
the publishers' "publicity men" were always showering
upon him.  After some thought he discarded promising
engravings of Harold Bell Wright and Stephen Leacock, and
chose



<pb n="57"/>
pictures of Shelley, Anthony Trollope, Robert
Louis Stevenson, and Robert Burns.  Then, after further
meditation, he decided that neither Shelley nor Burns
would quite do for a young girl's room, and set them
aside in favour of a portrait of Samuel Butler.  To these
he added a framed text that he was very fond of and had
hung over his own desk.  He had once clipped it from a
copy of <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> and found much pleasure in it.  It runs
thus:</p>

<p>
<hi rend="italic">ON THE RETURN OF A BOOK
LENT TO A FRIEND</hi>
 </p>
<p>I GIVE humble and hearty thanks for the safe return of
this book which having endured the perils of my friend's
bookcase, and the bookcases of my friend's friends, now
returns to me in reasonably good condition.


</p><p>I GIVE humble and hearty thanks that my friend did not
see fit to give this book to his infant as a plaything,
nor use it as an ash-tray for his burning cigar, nor as
a teething-ring for his mastiff.

</p><p>WHEN I lent this book I deemed it as lost: I was resigned
to the bitterness of the long parting: I never thought to
look upon its pages again.


</p><p>BUT NOW that my book is come back to me, I rejoice
and am exceeding glad!  Bring hither the fatted morocco
and let us rebind the volume and set it on the shelf of
honour: for this my book was lent, and is returned again.


</p><p>PRESENTLY, therefore, I may return some of the books that
I myself have borrowed.
</p>


<pb n="58"/>

<p>"There!" he thought.  "That will convey to her the
first element of book morality."
</p>
<p>These decorations having been displayed on the walls,
he bethought himself of the books that should stand on
the bedside shelf.
</p><p>This is a question that admits of the utmost nicety
of discussion.  Some authorities hold that the proper
books for a guest-room are of a soporific quality that
will induce swift and  painless repose.  This school
advises <hi rend="italic">The Wealth of Nations, Rome under the C&aelig;sars,
The Statesman's Year Book,</hi> certain novels of Henry James,
and <hi rend="italic">The Letters of Queen Victoria</hi> (in three volumes).  It
is plausibly contended that books of this kind cannot be
read (late at night) for more than a few minutes at a
time, and that they afford useful scraps of information.
</p><p>Another branch of opinion recommends for bedtime
reading short stories, volumes of pithy anecdote, swift
and sparkling stuff that may keep one awake for a space,
yet will advantage all the sweeter slumber in the end.
Even ghost stories and harrowing matter are maintained
seasonable by these pundits.  This class of reading
comprises O. Henry, Bret Harte, Leonard Merrick, Ambrose
Bierce, W. W. Jacobs, Daudet, de Maupassant, and possibly
even <hi rend="italic">On a Slow Train Through Arkansaw,</hi> that grievous
classic of the railway bookstalls



<pb n="59"/>
whereof its author,
Mr. Thomas W. Jackson, has said "It will sell forever,
and a thousand years afterward."  To this might be added
another of Mr. Jackson's onslaughts on the human
intelligence, <hi rend="italic">I'm From Texas, You Can't Steer Me,</hi> whereof
is said (by the author) "It is like a hard-boiled egg,
you can't beat it."  There are other of Mr. Jackson's
books, whose titles escape memory, whereof he has said
"They are a dynamite for sorrow."  Nothing used to annoy
Mifflin more than to have someone come in and ask for
copies of these works.  His brother-in-law, Andrew
McGill, the writer, once gave him for Christmas (just to
annoy him) a copy of <hi rend="italic">On a Slow Train Through Arkansaw</hi>
sumptuously bound and gilded in what is known to the
trade as "dove-coloured ooze."  Roger retorted by sending
Andrew (for his next birthday) two volumes of Brann the
Iconoclast bound in what Robert Cortes Holliday calls
"embossed toadskin."  But that is apart from the story.
</p><p>To the consideration of what to put on Miss Titania's
bookshelf Roger devoted the delighted hours of the
morning.  Several times Helen called him to come down and
attend to the shop, but he was sitting on the floor,
unaware of numbed shins, poring over the volumes he had
carted upstairs for a final culling.  "It will be a great
privilege," he



<pb n="60"/>
said to himself, "to have a young mind
to experiment with.  Now my wife, delightful creature
though she is, was&mdash;well, distinctly mature when I had
the good fortune to meet her; I have never been able
properly to supervise her mental processes.  But this
Chapman girl will come to us wholly unlettered.  Her
father said she had been to a fashionable school: that
surely is a guarantee that the delicate tendrils of her
mind have never begun to sprout.  I will test her
(without her knowing it) by the books I put here for her.
By noting which of them she responds to, I will know how
to proceed.  It might be worth while to shut up the shop
one day a week in order to give her some brief talks on
literature.  Delightful!  Let me see, a little series of
talks on the development of the English novel, beginning
with Tom Jones&mdash;hum, that would hardly do!  Well, I have
always longed to be a teacher, this looks like a chance
to begin.  We might invite some of the neighbours to send
in their children once a week, and start a little school.
<hi rend="italic">Causeries du lundi,</hi> in fact! Who knows I may yet be the
Sainte Beuve of Brooklyn."
</p><p>Across his mind flashed a vision of newspaper
clippings&mdash;<hi rend="italic">"This remarkable student of letters, who hides
his brilliant parts under the unassuming existence of a
second-hand bookseller, is now recognized as the&mdash;"
</hi>



<pb n="61"/>

</p><p>"Roger!" called Mrs. Mifflin from downstairs:
"Front! someone wants to know if you keep back numbers of
<hi rend="italic">Foamy Stories."</hi>
</p><p>After he had thrown out the intruder, Roger returned
to his meditation.  "This selection," he mused, "is of
course only tentative.  It is to act as a preliminary
test, to see what sort of thing interests her.  First of
all, her name naturally suggests Shakespeare and the
Elizabethans.  It's a remarkable name, Titania Chapman:
there must be great virtue in prunes!  Let's begin with
a volume of Christopher Marlowe.  Then Keats, I guess:
every young person ought to shiver over St. Agnes' Eve on
a bright cold winter evening.  <hi rend="italic">Over Bemerton's,</hi>
certainly, because it's a bookshop story.  Eugene Field's
<hi rend="italic">Tribune Primer</hi> to try out her sense of humour.  And
Archy, by all means, for the same reason.  I'll go down
and get the Archy scrapbook."
</p><p>It should be explained that Roger was a keen admirer
of Don Marquis, the humourist of the New York <hi rend="italic">Evening
Sun.</hi>  Mr. Marquis once lived in Brooklyn, and the
bookseller was never tired of saying that he was the most
eminent author who had graced the borough since the days
of Walt Whitman.  Archy, the imaginary cockroach whom Mr.
Marquis uses as a vehicle for so much excellent fun, was
a constant delight to Roger, and he had



<pb n="62"/>
kept a
scrapbook of all Archy's clippings.  This bulky tome he
now brought out from the grotto by his desk where his
particular treasures were kept.  He ran his eye over it,
and Mrs. Mifflin heard him utter shrill screams of
laughter.
</p><p>"What on earth is it?" she asked.
</p><p>"Only Archy," he said, and began to read aloud&mdash;

<p>"What on earth is there funny in that?" said Mrs.
Mifflin.  "Poor little lamb, I think it was terrible."
</p><p>"There's more of it," cried Roger, and opened his
mouth to continue.
</p><p>"No more, thank you," said Helen.  "There ought to be
a fine for using the meter of <hi rend="italic">Love in the Valley</hi> that
way.  I'm going out to market so if the bell rings you'll
have to answer it."
</p><p>Roger added the Archy scrapbook to Miss Titania's
shelf, and went on browsing over the volumes he had
collected.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">"The Nigger of the Narcissus,"</hi> he said to himself,
"for even if she doesn't read the story perhaps she'll

introduce her to Mrs. Lirriper, the queen of landladies.
Publishers tell me that Norfolk Street, Strand, is best
known for the famous literary agent that has his office
there, but I wonder how many of them know that that was
where Mrs. Lirriper had her immortal lodgings?  <hi rend="italic">The
Notebooks of Samuel Butler,</hi> just to give her a little
intellectual jazz.  <hi rend="italic">The Wrong Box,</hi> be



<pb n="64"/>
cause it's the
best farce in the language.  <hi rend="italic">Travels with a Donkey,</hi> to
show her what good writing is like.  The <hi rend="italic">Four Horsemen of
the Apocalypse</hi> to give her a sense of pity for human
woes&mdash;wait a minute, though: that's a pretty broad book
for young ladies.  I guess we'll put it aside and see
what else there is.  Some of Mr. Mosher's catalogues:
fine! they'll show her the true spirit of what one
book-lover calls biblio-bliss.  <hi rend="italic">Walking-Stick
Papers</hi>&mdash;yes, there are still good essayists running
around.  A bound file of `The Publishers' Weekly to give
her a smack of trade matters.  <hi rend="italic">Jo's Boys</hi> in case she
needs a little relaxation.  <hi rend="italic">The Lays of Ancient Rome</hi> and
Austin Dobson to show her some good poetry.  I wonder if
they give them <hi rend="italic">The Lays</hi> to read in school nowadays?  I
have a horrible fear they are brought up on the battle of
Salamis and the brutal redcoats of '76.  And now we'll be
exceptionally subtle: we'll stick in a Robert Chambers to
see if she falls for it."
</p><p>He viewed the shelf with pride.  "Not bad," he said
to himself.  "I'll just add this Leonard Merrick,
<hi rend="italic">Whispers about Women,</hi> to amuse her.  I bet that title
will start her guessing.  Helen will say I ought to have
included the Bible, but I'll omit it on purpose, just to
see whether the girl misses it."
</p><p>With typical male curiosity he pulled out the




<pb n="65"/>
bureau drawers to see what disposition his wife had
made of them, and was pleased to find a little muslin bag
of lavender dispersing a quiet fragrance in each.  "Very
nice," he remarked.  "Very nice indeed!  About the only
thing missing is an ashtray.  If Miss Titania is as
modern as some of them, that'll be the first thing she'll
call for.  And maybe a copy of Ezra Pound's poems.  I do
hope she's not what Helen calls a bolshevixen."


There was nothing bolshevik about a glittering limousine
that drew up at the corner of Gissing and Swinburne
streets early that afternoon.  A chauffeur in green
livery opened the door, lifted out a suitcase of
beautiful brown leather, and gave a respectful hand to
the vision that emerged from depths of lilac-coloured
upholstery.
</p><p>"Where do you want me to carry the bag, miss?"
</p><p>"This is the bitter parting," replied Miss Titania.
"I don't want you to know my address, Edwards.  Some of
my mad friends might worm it out of you, and I don't want
them coming down and bothering me.  I am going to be very
busy with literature.  I'll walk the rest of the way."
</p><p>Edwards saluted with a grin&mdash;he worshipped the
original young heiress&mdash;and returned to his wheel.
</p><p>"There's one thing I want you to do for me,"



<pb n="66"/>
said
Titania.  "Call up my father and tell him I'm on the
job."
</p><p>"Yes, miss," said Edwards, who would have run the
limousine into a government motor truck if she had
ordered it.
</p><p>Miss Chapman's small gloved hand descended into an
interesting purse that was cuffed to her wrist with a
bright little chain.  She drew out a nickel&mdash;it was
characteristic of her that it was a very bright and
engaging looking nickel&mdash;and handed it gravely to her
charioteer.  Equally gravely he saluted, and the car,
after moving through certain dignified arcs, swam swiftly
away down Thackeray Boulevard.
</p><p>Titania, after making sure that Edwards was out of
sight, turned up Gissing Street with a fluent pace and an
observant eye.  A small boy cried, "Carry your bag,
lady?" and she was about to agree, but then remembered
that she was now engaged at ten dollars a week and waved
him away.  Our readers would feel a justifiable grudge if
we did not attempt a description of the young lady, and
we will employ the few blocks of her course along Gissing
Street for this purpose.
</p><p>Walking behind her, the observer, by the time she had
reached Clemens Place, would have seen that she was
faultlessly tailored in genial tweeds;



<pb n="67"/>
that her small
brown boots were sheltered by spats of that pale tan
complexion exhibited by Pullman porters on the
Pennsylvania Railroad; that her person was both slender
and vigorous; that her shoulders were carrying a
sumptuous fur of the colour described by the trade as
nutria, or possibly opal smoke.  The word chinchilla
would have occurred irresistibly to this observer from
behind; he might also, if he were the father of a family,
have had a fleeting vision of many autographed stubs in
a check book.  The general impression that he would have
retained, had he turned aside at Clemens Place, would be
"expensive, but worth the expense."
</p><p>It is more likely, however, that the student of
phenomena would have continued along Gissing Street to
the next corner, being that of Hazlitt Street.  Taking
advantage of opportunity, he would overtake the lady on
the pavement, with a secret, sidelong glance.  If he were
wise, he would pass her on the right side where her
tilted bonnet permitted a wider angle of vision.  He
would catch a glimpse of cheek and chin belonging to the
category known (and rightly) as adorable; hair that held
sunlight through the dullest day; even a small platinum
wrist watch that might pardonably be excused, in its
exhilarating career, for beating a trifle fast.  Among
the greyish furs he would



<pb n="68"/>
note a bunch of such
violets as never bloom in the crude springtime, but
reserve themselves for November and the plate glass
windows of Fifth Avenue.
</p><p>It is probable that whatever the errand of this
spectator he would have continued along Gissing Street a
few paces farther.  Then, with calculated innocence, he
would have halted halfway up the block that leads to the
Wordsworth Avenue "L," and looked backward with carefully
simulated irresolution, as though considering some
forgotten matter.  With apparently unseeing eyes he would
have scanned the bright pedestrian, and caught the full
impact of her rich blue gaze.  He would have seen a small
resolute face rather vivacious in effect, yet with a
quaint pathos of youth and eagerness.  He would have
noted the cheeks lit with excitement and rapid movement
in the bracing air.  He would certainly have noted the
delicate contrast of the fur of the wild nutria with the
soft V of her bare throat.  Then, to his surprise, he
would have seen this attractive person stop, examine her
surroundings, and run down some steps into a rather
dingy-looking second-hand bookshop.  He would have gone
about his affairs with a new and surprised conviction
that the Almighty had the borough of Brooklyn under His
especial care.
</p><p>Roger, who had conceived a notion of some



<pb n="69"/>
rather
peevish foundling of the Ritz-Carlton lobbies and Central
Park riding academies, was agreeably amazed by the sweet
simplicity of the young lady.
</p><p>"Is this Mr. Mifflin?" she said, as he advanced all
agog from his smoky corner.
</p><p>"Miss Chapman?" he replied, taking her bag.  "Helen!"
he called.  "Miss Titania is here."
</p><p>She looked about the sombre alcoves of the shop.  "I
do think it's adorable of you to take me in," she said.
"Dad has told me so much about you.  He says I'm
impossible.  I suppose this is the literature he talks
about.  I want to know all about it."
</p><p>"And here's Bock!" she cried.  "Dad says he's the
greatest dog in the world, named after Botticelli or
somebody.  I've brought him a present.  It's in my bag.
Nice old Bocky!"
</p><p>Bock, who was unaccustomed to spats, was examining
them after his own fashion.
</p><p>"Well, my dear," said Mrs. Mifflin.  "We are
delighted to see you.  I hope you'll be happy with us,
but I rather doubt it.  Mr. Mifflin is a hard man to get
along with."
</p><p>"Oh, I'm sure of it!" cried Titania.  "I mean, I'm
sure I shall be happy!  You mustn't believe a word of
what Dad says about me.  I'm crazy



<pb n="70"/>
about books.  I
don't see how you can bear to sell them.  I brought these
violets for you, Mrs. Mifflin."
</p><p>"How perfectly sweet of you," said Helen, captivated
already.  "Come along, we'll put them right in water.
I'll show you your room."
</p><p>Roger heard them moving about overhead.  It suddenly
occurred to him that the shop was rather a dingy place
for a young girl.  "I wish I had thought to get in a cash
register," he mused.  "She'll think I'm terribly
unbusiness-like."
</p><p>"Now," said Mrs. Mifflin, as she and Titania came
downstairs again, "I'm making some pastry, so I'm going
to turn you over to your employer.  He can show you round
the shop and tell you where all the books are."
</p><p>"Before we begin," said Titania, "just let me give
Bock his present."  She showed a large package of tissue
paper and, unwinding innumerable layers, finally
disclosed a stalwart bone.  "I was lunching at Sherry's,
and I made the head waiter give me this.  He was awfully
amused."
</p><p>"Come along into the kitchen and give it to him,"
said Helen.  "He'll be your friend for life."
</p><p>"What an adorable kennel!" cried Titania, when she
saw the remodelled packing-case that



<pb n="71"/>
served Bock as
a retreat.  The bookseller's ingenious carpentry had
built it into the similitude of a Carnegie library, with
the sign READING-ROOM over the door; and he had painted
imitation book-shelves along the interior.
</p><p>"You'll get used to Mr. Mifflin after a while," said
Helen amusedly.  "He spent all one winter getting that
kennel fixed to his liking.  You might have thought he
was going to live in it instead of Bock.  All the titles
that he painted in there are books that have dogs in
them, and a lot of them he made up."
</p><p>Titania insisted on getting down to peer inside.
Bock was much flattered at this attention from the new
planet that had swum into his kennel.
</p><p>"Gracious!" she said, "here's `The Rubaiyat of Omar
Canine.' I do think that's clever!"
</p><p>"Oh, there are a lot more," said Helen.  "The works
of Bonar Law, and Bohn's `Classics,' and `Catechisms on
Dogma' and goodness knows what.  If Roger paid half as
much attention to business as he does to jokes of that
sort, we'd be rich.  Now, you run along and have a look
at the shop."
</p><p>Titania found the bookseller at his desk.  "Here I
am, Mr.  Mifflin," she said.  "See, I brought a nice
sharp pencil along with me to



<pb n="72"/>
make out sales slips.
I've been practicing sticking it in my hair.  I can do it
quite nicely now.  I hope you have some of those big red
books with all the carbon paper in them and everything.
I've been watching the girls up at Lord and Taylor's make
them out, and I think they're fascinating.  And you must
teach me to run the elevator.  I'm awfully keen about
elevators."
</p><p>"Bless me," said Roger, "You'll find this very
different from Lord and Taylor's!  We haven't any
elevators, or any sales slips, or even a cash register.
We don't wait on customers unless they ask us to.  They
come in and browse round, and if they find anything they
want they come back here to my desk and ask about it.
The price is marked in every book in red pencil.  The
cash-box is here on this shelf.  This is the key hanging
on this little hook.  I enter each sale in this ledger.
When you sell a book you must write it down here, and the
price paid for it."
</p><p>"But suppose it's charged?" said Titania.
</p><p>"No charge accounts.  Everything is cash.  If someone
comes in to sell books, you must refer him to me.  You
mustn't be surprised to see people drop in here and spend
several hours reading.  Lots of them look on this as a
kind of club.  I hope you don't mind the smell of
tobacco,



<pb n="73"/>
for almost all the men that come here smoke
in the shop.  You see, I put ash trays around for them."
</p><p>"I love tobacco smell," said Titania.  "Daddy's
library at home smells something like this, but not quite
so strong.  And I want to see the worms, bookworms you
know.  Daddy said you had lots of them."
</p><p>"You'll see them, all right," said Roger, chuckling.
"They come in and out.  To-morrow I'll show you how my
stock is arranged.  It'll take you quite a while to get
familiar with it.  Until then I just want you to poke
around and see what there is, until you know the shelves
so well you could put your hand on any given book in the
dark.  That's a game my wife and I used to play.  We
would turn off all the lights at night, and I would call
out the title of a book and see how near she could come
to finding it.  Then I would take a turn.  When we came
more than six inches away from it we would have to pay a
forfeit.  It's great fun."
</p><p>"What larks we'll have," cried Titania.  "I do think
this is a cunning place!"
</p><p>"This is the bulletin board, where I put up notices
about books that interest me.  Here's a card I've just
been writing."
</p><p>Roger drew from his pocket a square of cardboard


<pb n="74"/>
and affixed it to the board with a thumbtack.
Titania read:</p>
<p>
<lb/>THE BOOK THAT SHOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE WAR
 </p>
<p>Now that the fighting is over is a good time to read
Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts.  I don't want to sell it,
because it is one of the greatest treasures I own.  But
if any one will guarantee to read all three volumes, and
let them sink into his mind, I'm willing to lend them.
</p><p>If enough thoughtful Germans had read The Dynasts
before July, 1914, there would have been no war.
</p><p>If every delegate to the Peace Conference could be
made to read it before the sessions begin, there will be
no more wars.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">R.  MIFFLIN.</hi>
</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Titania, "Is it so good as all that?
Perhaps I'd better read it."
</p><p>"It is so good that if I knew any way of doing so I'd
insist on Mr. Wilson reading it on his voyage to France.
I wish I could get it onto his ship.  My, what a book!
It makes one positively ill with pity and terror.
Sometimes I wake up at night and look out of the window
and imagine I hear Hardy laughing.  I get him a little
mixed up with the Deity, I fear.  But he's a bit too hard
for you to tackle."
</p><p>Titania was puzzled, and said nothing.  But


<pb n="75"/>
her busy mind made a note of its own:  <hi rend="italic">Hardy, hard to read,
makes one ill, try it.</hi>
</p><p>"What did you think of the books I put in your room?"
said Roger.  He had vowed to wait until she made some
comment unsolicited, but he could not restrain himself.
</p><p>"In my room?" she said.  "Why, I'm sorry, I never
noticed them!"
</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV
<lb/>
The Disappearing Volume</head>

<p>Well, my dear," said Roger after supper that evening, "I
think perhaps we had better introduce Miss Titania to our
custom of reading aloud."
</p><p>"Perhaps it would bore her?" said Helen.  "You know
it isn't everybody that likes being read to."
</p><p>"Oh, I should love it!" exclaimed Titania.  "I don't
think anybody ever read to me, that is not since I was a
child."
</p><p>"Suppose we leave you to look after the shop," said
Helen to Roger, in a teasing mood, "and I'll take Titania
out to the movies.  I think <hi rend="italic">Tarzan</hi> is still running."
</p><p>Whatever private impulses Miss Chapman may have felt,
she saw by the bookseller's downcast face that a visit to
<hi rend="italic">Tarzan</hi> would break his heart, and she was prompt to
disclaim any taste for the screen classic.
</p><p>"Dear me," she said; <hi rend="italic">"Tarzan</hi>&mdash;that's all that
nature
stuff by John Burroughs; isn't it?  Oh,



<pb n="77"/>
Mrs. Mifflin, I think it would be very tedious.  Let's have Mr.
Mifflin read to us.  I'll get down my knitting bag."
</p><p>"You mustn't mind being interrupted," said Helen.
"When anybody rings the bell Roger has to run out and
tend the shop."
</p><p>"You must let me do it," said Titania.  "I want to
earn my wages, you know."
</p><p>"All right," said Mrs. Mifflin; "Roger, you settle
Miss Chapman in the den and give her something to look at
while we do the dishes."
</p><p>But Roger was all on fire to begin the reading.  "Why
don't we postpone the dishes," he said, "just to
celebrate?"
</p><p>"Let me help," insisted Titania.  "I should think
washing up would be great fun."
</p><p>"No, no, not on your first evening," said Helen.
"Mr. Mifflin and I will finish them in a jiffy."
</p><p>So Roger poked up the coal fire in the den, disposed
the chairs, and gave Titania a copy of <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> to
look at.  He then vanished into the kitchen with his
wife, whence Titania heard the cheerful clank of crockery
in a dishpan and the splashing of hot water.  "The best
thing about washing up," she heard Roger say, "is that it
makes one's hands so clean, a novel sensation for a
second-hand bookseller."




<pb n="78"/>

</p><p>She gave <hi rend="italic">Sartor Resartus</hi> what is graphically
described as a "once over," and then seeing the morning
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> lying on the table, picked it up, as she had not
read it.  Her eye fell upon the column headed


<lb/>LOST AND FOUND
<lb/>   Fifty cents an agate line


and as she had recently lost a little pearl brooch, she
ran hastily through it.  She chuckled a little over

<lb/>LOST&mdash;Hotel Imperial lavatory, set of teeth.
<lb/>Call or communicate Steel, 134 East 43 St.
<lb/>Reward, no questions asked.

Then she saw this:

<lb/>LOST&mdash;Copy of Thomas Carlyle's "Oliver
<lb/>Cromwell," between Gissing Street, Brooklyn, and
<lb/>the Octagon Hotel.  If found before midnight,
<lb/>Tuesday, Dec. 3, return to assistant chef,
<lb/>Octagon Hotel.


</p><p>"Why" she exclaimed, "Gissing Street&mdash;that's here!
And what a funny kind of book for an assistant chef to
read.  No wonder their lunches have been so bad lately!"
</p><p>When Roger and Helen rejoined her in the den a few
minutes later she showed the bookseller the
advertisement.  He was very much excited.
</p><p>"That's a funny thing," he said.  "There's something
queer about that book.  Did I tell



<pb n="79"/>
you about it?  Last Tuesday&mdash;I know it was then because it was
the evening young Gilbert was here&mdash;a man with a beard came
in asking for it, and it wasn't on the shelf.  Then the
next night, Wednesday, I was up very late writing, and
fell asleep at my desk.  I must have left the front door
ajar, because I was waked up by the draught, and when I
went to close the door I saw the book sticking out a
little beyond the others, in its usual place.  And last
night, when the Corn Cobs were here, I went out to look
up a quotation in it, and it was gone again."
</p><p>"Perhaps the assistant chef stole it?" said Titania.
</p><p>"But if so, why the deuce would he advertise having
done so?" asked Roger.
</p><p>"Well, if he did steal it," said Helen, "I wish him
joy of it.  I tried to read it once, you talked so much
about it, and I found it dreadfully dull."
</p><p>"If he did steal it," cried the bookseller, "I'm
perfectly delighted.  It shows that my contention is
right: people <hi rend="italic">do</hi> really care for good books.  If an
assistant chef is so fond of good books that he has to
steal them, the world is safe for democracy.  Usually the
only books any one wants to steal are sheer piffle, like
<hi rend="italic">Making Life Worth While</hi> by Douglas Fairbanks or Mother
Shipton's



<pb n="80"/>
<hi rend="italic">Book of Oracles.</hi>  I don't mind a man
stealing books if he steals good ones!"
</p><p>"You see the remarkable principles that govern this
business," said Helen to Titania.  They sat down by the
fire and took up their knitting while the bookseller ran
out to see if the volume had by any chance returned to
his shelves.
</p><p>"Is it there?" said Helen, when he came back.
</p><p>"No," said Roger, and picked up the advertisement
again.  "I wonder why he wants it returned before
midnight on Tuesday?"
</p><p>"So he can read it in bed, I guess," said Helen.
"Perhaps he suffers from insomnia."
</p><p>"It's a darn shame he lost it before he had a chance
to read it.  I'd like to have known what he thought of
it.  I've got a great mind to go up and call on him."
</p><p>"Charge it off to profit and loss and forget about
it," said Helen.  "How about that reading aloud?"
</p><p>Roger ran his eye along his private shelves, and
pulled down a well-worn volume.
</p><p>"Now that Thanksgiving is past," he said, "my mind
always turns to Christmas, and Christmas means Charles
Dickens.  My dear, would it bore you if we had a go at
the old <hi rend="italic">Christmas Stories?"</hi>
</p><p>Mrs. Mifflin held up her hands in mock dismay.




<pb n="81"/>
"He reads them to me every year at this time," she
said to Titania.  "Still, they're worth it.  I know good
old Mrs. Lirriper better than I do most of my friends."
</p><p>"What is it, the Christmas Carol?" said Titania.  "We
had to read that in school."
</p><p>"No," said Roger; "the other stories, infinitely
better.  Everybody gets the Carol dinned into them until
they're weary of it, but no one nowadays seems to read
the others.  I tell you, Christmas wouldn't be Christmas
to me if I didn't read these tales over again every year.
How homesick they make one for the good old days of real
inns and real beefsteak and real ale drawn in pewter.  My
dears, sometimes when I am reading Dickens I get a vision
of rare sirloin with floury boiled potatoes and plenty of
horse-radish, set on a shining cloth not far from a blaze
of English coal&mdash;"
</p><p>"He's an incorrigible visionary," said Mrs. Mifflin.
"To hear him talk you might think no one had had a square
meal since Dickens died.  You might think that all
landladies died with Mrs. Lirriper."
</p><p>"Very ungrateful of him," said Titania.  "I'm sure I
couldn't ask for better potatoes, or a nicer hostess,
than I've found in Brooklyn."
</p><p>"Well, well," said Roger.  "You are right, of




<pb n="82"/>
course.  And yet something went out of the world when
Victorian England vanished, something that will never
come again.  Take the stagecoach drivers, for instance.
What a racy, human type they were! And what have we now
to compare with them?  Subway guards?  Taxicab drivers?
I have hung around many an all-night lunchroom to hear
the chauffeurs talk.  But they are too much on the move,
you can't get the picture of them the way Dickens could
of his types.  You can't catch that sort of thing in a
snapshot, you know: you have to have a time exposure.
I'll grant you, though, that lunchroom food is mighty
good.  The best place to eat is always a counter where
the chauffeurs congregate.  They get awfully hungry, you
see, driving round in the cold, and when they want food
they want it hot and tasty.  There's a little hash-alley
called Frank's, up on Broadway near 77th, where I guess
the ham and eggs and French fried is as good as any Mr.
Pickwick ever ate."
</p><p>"I must get Edwards to take me there," said Titania.
"Edwards is our chauffeur.  I've been to the Ansonia for
tea, that's near there."
</p><p>"Better keep away," said Helen.  "When Roger comes
home from those places he smells so strong of onions it
brings tears to my eyes."
</p><p>"We've just been talking about an assistant




<pb n="83"/>
chef," said Roger; that suggests that I read you
<hi rend="italic">Somebody's Luggage,</hi> which is all about a head waiter.  I
have often wished I could get a job as a waiter or a bus
boy, just to learn if there really are any such head
waiters nowadays.  You know there are all sorts of jobs
I'd like to have, just to fructify my knowledge of human
nature and find out whether life is really as good as
literature.  I'd love to be a waiter, a barber, a
floorwalker&mdash;"
</p><p>"Roger, my dear," said Helen, "why don't you get on
with the reading?"
</p><p>Roger knocked out his pipe, turned Bock out of his
chair, and sat down with infinite relish to read the
memorable character sketch of Christopher, the head
waiter, which is dear to every lover of taverns.  "The
writer of these humble lines being a Waiter," he began.
The knitting needles flashed with diligence, and the dog
by the fender stretched himself out in the luxuriant
vacancy of mind only known to dogs surrounded by a happy
group of their friends.  And Roger, enjoying himself
enormously, and particularly pleased by the chuckles of
his audience, was approaching the ever-delightful items
of the coffee-room bill which is to be found about ten
pages on in the first chapter&mdash;how sad it is that hotel
bills are not so rendered in these times&mdash;when the bell
in the shop clanged.  Picking up his pipe and




<pb n="84"/>
matchbox, and grumbling "It's always the way," he
hurried out of the room.
</p><p>He was agreeably surprised to find that his caller
was the young advertising man, Aubrey Gilbert.
</p><p>"Hullo!" he said.  "I've been saving something for
you.  It's a quotation from Joseph Conrad about
advertising."
</p><p>"Good enough," said Aubrey.  "And I've got something
for you.  You were so nice to me the other evening I took
the liberty of bringing you round some tobacco.  Here's
a tin of Blue-Eyed Mixture, it's my favourite.  I hope
you'll like it."
</p><p>"Bully for you.  Perhaps I ought to let you off the
Conrad quotation since you're so kind."
</p><p>"Not a bit.  I suppose it's a knock.  Shoot!" The
bookseller led the way back to his desk, where he
rummaged among the litter and finally found a scrap of
paper on which he had written:


</p><p>Being myself animated by feelings of affection toward my
fellowmen, I am saddened by the modern system of
advertising.  Whatever evidence it offers of enterprise,
ingenuity, impudence, and resource in certain
individuals, it proves to my mind the wide prevalence of
that form of mental degradation which is called
gullibility.
<lb/><hi rend="italic">JOSEPH CONRAD.</hi><lb/>
</p>


<pb n="85"/>

<p>"What do you think of that?" said Roger.  "You'll
find that in the story called <hi rend="italic">The Anarchist."</hi>
</p><p>"I think less than nothing of it," said Aubrey.  "As
your friend Don Marquis observed the other evening, an
idea isn't always to be blamed for the people who believe
in it.  Mr. Conrad has been reading some quack ads,
that's all.  Because there are fake ads, that doesn't
condemn the principle of Publicity.  But look here, what
I really came round to see you for is to show you this.
It was in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> this morning."
</p><p>He pulled out of his pocket a clipping of the LOST
insertion to which Roger's attention had already been
drawn.
</p><p>"Yes, I've just seen it," said Roger.  "I missed the
book from my shelves, and I believe someone must have
stolen it."
</p><p>"Well, now, I want to tell you something," said
Aubrey.  "To-night I had dinner at the Octagon with Mr.
Chapman."  "Is that so?" said Roger.  "You know his
daughter's here now."
</p><p>"So he told me.  It's rather interesting how it all
works out.  You see, after you told me the other day that
Miss Chapman was coming to work for you, that gave me an
idea.  I knew her father would be specially interested in
Brooklyn, on that



<pb n="86"/>
account, and it suggested to me an
idea for a window-display campaign here in Brooklyn for
the Daintybits Products.  You know we handle all his
sales promotion campaigns.  Of course I didn't let on
that I knew about his daughter coming over here, but he
told me about it himself in the course of our talk.
Well, here's what I'm getting at.  We had dinner in the
Czecho-Slovak Grill, up on the fourteenth floor, and
going up in the elevator I saw a man in a chef's uniform
carrying a book.  I looked over his shoulder to see what
it was.  I thought of course it would be a cook book.  It
was a copy of <hi rend="italic">Oliver Cromwell."</hi>
</p><p>"So he found it again, eh?  I must go and have a talk
with that chap.  If he's a Carlyle fan I'd like to know
him."
</p><p>"Wait a minute.  I had seen the LOST ad in the paper
this morning, because I always look over that column.
Often it gives me ideas for advertising stunts.  If you
keep an eye on the things people are anxious to get back,
you know what they really prize, and if you know what
they prize you can get a line on what goods ought to be
advertised more extensively.  This was the first time I
had ever noticed a LOST ad for a book, so I thought to
myself "the book business is coming up."  Well, when I
saw the chef with the book in his hand, I said to him
jokingly, "I see



<pb n="87"/>
you found it again."  He was a
foreign-looking fellow, with a big beard, which is
unusual for a chef, because I suppose it's likely to get
in the soup.  He looked at me as though I'd run a carving
knife into him, almost scared me the way he looked.
"Yes, yes," he said, and shoved the book out of sight
under his arm.  He seemed half angry and half frightened,
so I thought maybe he had no right to be riding in the
passenger elevator and was scared someone would report
him to the manager.  Just as we were getting to the
fourteenth floor I said to him in a whisper, "It's all
right, old chap, I'm not going to report you."  I give
you my word he looked more scared than before.  He went
quite white.  I got off at the fourteenth, and he
followed me out.  I thought he was going to speak to me,
but Mr. Chapman was there in the lobby, and he didn't
have a chance.  But I noticed that he watched me into the
grill room as though I was his last chance of salvation."
</p><p>"I guess the poor devil was scared you'd report him
to the police for stealing the book," said Roger.  "Never
mind, let him have it."
</p><p>"Did he steal it?"
</p><p>"I haven't a notion.  But somebody did, because it
disappeared from here."
</p><p>"Well, now, wait a minute.  Here's the queer part of
it.  I didn't think anything more about it,



<pb n="88"/>
except
that it was a funny coincidence my seeing him after
having noticed that ad in the paper.  I had a long talk
with Mr. Chapman, and we discussed some plans for a prune
and Saratoga chip campaign, and I showed him some
suggested copy I had prepared.  Then he told me about his
daughter, and I let on that I knew you.  I left the
Octagon about eight o'clock, and I thought I'd run over
here on the subway just to show you the LOST notice and
give you this tobacco.  And when I got off the subway at
Atlantic Avenue, who should I see but friend chef again.
He got off the same train I did.  He had on civilian
clothes then, of course, and when he was out of his white
uniform and pancake hat I recognized him right off.  Who
do you suppose it was?"
</p><p>"Can't imagine," said Roger, highly interested by
this time.
</p><p>"Why, the professor looking guy who came in to ask
for the book the first night I was here."
</p><p>"Humph!  Well, he must be keen about Carlyle, because
he was horribly disappointed that evening when he asked
for the book and I couldn't find it.  I remember how he
insisted that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have it, and I hunted all through
the History shelves to make sure it hadn't got misplaced.
He said that some friend of his had seen it here, and he
had come right round to buy it.  I told



<pb n="89"/>
him he could
certainly get a copy at the Public Library, and he said
that wouldn't do at all."
</p><p>"Well, I think he's nuts," said Aubrey, "because I'm
damn sure he followed me down the street after I left the
subway.  I stopped in at the drug store on the corner to
get some matches, and when I came out, there he was
underneath the lamp-post."
</p><p>"If it was a modern author, instead of Carlyle," said
Roger, "I'd say it was some publicity stunt pulled off by
the publishers.  You know they go to all manner of queer
dodges to get an author's name in print.  But Carlyle's
copyrights expired long ago, so I don't see the game."
</p><p>"I guess he's picketing your place to try and steal
the formula for eggs Samuel Butler," said Aubrey, and
they both laughed.
</p><p>"You'd better come in and meet my wife and Miss
Chapman," said Roger.  The young man made some feeble
demur, but it was obvious to the bookseller that he was
vastly elated at the idea of making Miss Chapman's
acquaintance.
</p><p>"Here's a friend of mine," said Roger, ushering
Aubrey into the little room where Helen and Titania were
still sitting by the fire.  "Mrs. Mifflin, Mr. Aubrey
Gilbert, Miss Chapman, Mr. Gilbert."
</p><p>Aubrey was vaguely aware of the rows of books, of the
shining coals, of the buxom hostess and the



<pb n="90"/>
friendly
terrier; but with the intense focus of an intelligent
young male mind these were all merely appurtenances to
the congenial spectacle of the employee.  How quickly a
young man's senses assemble and assimilate the data that
are really relevant!  Without seeming even to look in
that direction he had performed the most amazing feat of
lightning calculation known to the human faculties.  He
had added up all the young ladies of his acquaintance,
and found the sum total less than the girl before him.
He had subtracted the new phenomenon from the universe as
he knew it, including the solar system and the
advertising business, and found the remainder a minus
quantity.  He had multiplied the contents of his
intellect by a factor he had no reason to assume
"constant," and was startled at what teachers call (I
believe) the "product."  And he had divided what was in
the left-hand armchair into his own career, and found no
room for a quotient.  All of which transpired in the
length of time necessary for Roger to push forward
another chair.
</p><p>With the politeness desirable in a well-bred youth,
Aubrey's first instinct was to make himself square with
the hostess.  Resolutely he occluded blue eyes, silk
shirtwaist, and admirable chin from his mental vision.




<pb n="91"/>

</p><p>"It's awfully good of you to let me come in," he said
to Mrs. Mifflin.  "I was here the other evening and Mr.
Mifflin insisted on my staying to supper with him."
</p><p>"I'm very glad to see you," said Helen.  "Roger told
me about you.  I hope he didn't poison you with any of
his outlandish dishes.  Wait till he tries you with
brandied peaches a la Harold Bell Wright."
</p><p>Aubrey uttered some genial reassurance, still making
the supreme sacrifice of keeping his eyes away from where
(he felt) they belonged.
</p><p>"Mr. Gilbert has just had a queer experience," said
Roger.  "Tell them about it."
</p><p>In the most reckless way, Aubrey permitted himself to
be impaled upon a direct and interested flash of blue
lightning.  "I was having dinner with your father at the
Octagon."
</p><p>The high tension voltage of that bright blue current
felt like ohm sweet ohm, but Aubrey dared not risk too
much of it at once.  Fearing to blow out a fuse, he
turned in panic to Mrs. Mifflin.  "You see," he
explained, "I write a good deal of Mr. Chapman's
advertising for him.  We had an appointment to discuss
some business matters.  We're planning a big barrage on
prunes."
</p><p>"Dad works much too hard, don't you think?" said
Titania.




<pb n="92"/>

</p><p>Aubrey welcomed this as a pleasant avenue of
discussion leading into the parkland of Miss Chapman's
family affairs; but Roger insisted on his telling the
story of the chef and the copy of <hi rend="italic">Cromwell.</hi>
</p><p>"And he followed you here?" exclaimed Titania.  "What
fun! I had no idea the book business was so exciting."
</p><p>"Better lock the door to-night, Roger," said Mrs.
Mifflin, "or he may walk off with a set of the
Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica."
</p><p>"Why, my dear," said Roger, "I think this is grand
news.  Here's a man, in a humble walk of life, so keen
about good books that he even pickets a bookstore on the
chance of swiping some.  It's the most encouraging thing
I've ever heard of.  I must write to the Publishers'
Weekly about it."
</p><p>"Well," said Aubrey, "you mustn't let me interrupt
your little party."
</p><p>"You're not interrupting," said Roger.  "We were only
reading aloud.  Do you know Dickens' <hi rend="italic">Christmas Stories?"</hi>
</p><p>"I'm afraid I don't."
</p><p>"Suppose we go on reading, shall we?"
</p><p>"Please do."
</p><p>"Yes, do go on," said Titania.  "Mr. Mifflin was just
reading about a most adorable head waiter in a London
chop house."


<pb n="93"/>

</p><p>Aubrey begged permission to light his pipe, and Roger
picked up the book.  "But before we read the items of the
coffee-room bill," he said, "I think it only right that
we should have a little refreshment.  This passage should
never be read without something to accompany it.  My
dear, what do you say to a glass of sherry all round?"
</p><p>"It is sad to have to confess it," said Mrs. Mifflin
to Titania, "Mr. Mifflin can never read Dickens without
having something to drink.  I think the sale of Dickens
will fall off terribly when prohibition comes in."
</p><p>"I once took the trouble to compile a list of the
amount of liquor drunk in Dickens' works," said Roger,
"and I assure you the total was astounding: 7,000
hogsheads, I believe it was.  Calculations of that sort
are great fun.  I have always intended to write a little
essay on the rainstorms in the stories of Robert Louis
Stevenson.  You see R. L. S.  was a Scot, and well
acquainted with wet weather.  Excuse me a moment, I'll
just run down cellar and get up a bottle."
</p><p>Roger left the room, and they heard his steps passing
down into the cellar.  Bock, after the manner of dogs,
followed him.  The smells of cellars are a rare treat to
dogs, especially ancient Brooklyn cellars which have a
cachet all their



<pb n="94"/>
own.  The cellar of the Haunted
Bookshop was, to Bock, a fascinating place, illuminated
by a warm glow from the furnace, and piled high with
split packing-cases which Roger used as kindling.  From
below came the rasp of a shovel among coal, and the
clear, musical slither as the lumps were thrown from the
iron scoop onto the fire.  Just then the bell rang in the
shop.
</p><p>"Let me go," said Titania, jumping up.
</p><p>"Can't I?" said Aubrey.
</p><p>"Nonsense!" said Mrs. Mifflin, laying down her
knitting.  "Neither of you knows anything about the
stock.  Sit down and be comfortable.  I'll be right
back."
</p><p>Aubrey and Titania looked at each other with a touch
of embarrassment.
</p><p>"Your father sent you his&mdash;his kind regards," said
Aubrey.  That was not what he had intended to say, but
somehow he could not utter the word.  "He said not to
read all the books at once."
</p><p>Titania laughed.  "How funny that you should run into
him just when you were coming here.  He's a duck, isn't
he?"
</p><p>"Well, you see I only know him in a business way, but
he certainly is a corker.  He believes in advertising,
too."
</p><p>"Are you crazy about books?"
</p><p>"Why, I never really had very much to do with




<pb n="95"/>
them.  I'm afraid you'll think I'm terribly
ignorant&mdash;"
</p><p>"Not at all.  I'm awfully glad to meet someone who
doesn't think it's a crime not to have read all the books
there are."
</p><p>"This is a queer kind of place, isn't it?"
</p><p>"Yes, it's a funny idea to call it the Haunted
Bookshop.  I wonder what it means."
</p><p>"Mr. Mifflin told me it meant haunted by the ghosts
of great literature.  I hope they won't annoy you.  The
ghost of Thomas Carlyle seems to be pretty active."
</p><p>"I'm not afraid of ghosts," said Titania.
</p><p>Aubrey gazed at the fire.  He wanted to say that he
intended from now on to do a little haunting on his own
account but he did not know just how to break it gently.
And then Roger returned from the cellar with the bottle
of sherry.  As he was uncorking it, they heard the shop
door close, and Mrs. Mifflin came in.
</p><p>"Well, Roger," she said; "if you think so much of
your old <hi rend="italic">Cromwell,</hi> you'd better keep it in here.  Here it
is."  She laid the book on the table.
</p><p>"For the love of Mike!" exclaimed Roger.  "Who
brought it back?"
</p><p>"I guess it was your friend the assistant chef," said
Mrs. Mifflin.  "Anyway, he had a beard like a Christmas
tree.  He was mighty polite.



<pb n="96"/>
He said he was terribly
absent minded, and that the other day he was in here
looking at some books and just walked off with it without
knowing what he was doing.  He offered to pay for the
trouble he had caused, but of course I wouldn't let him.
I asked if he wanted to see you, but he said he was in a
hurry."
</p><p>"I'm almost disappointed," said Roger.  "I thought
that I had turned up a real booklover.  Here we are, all
hands drink the health of Mr. Thomas Carlyle."
</p><p>The toast was drunk, and they settled themselves in
their chairs.
</p><p>"And here's to the new employee," said Helen.  This
also was dispatched, Aubrey draining his glass with a
zeal which did not escape Miss Chapman's discerning eye.
Roger then put out his hand for the Dickens.  But first
he picked up his beloved <hi rend="italic">Cromwell. </hi> He looked at it
carefully, and then held the volume close to the light.
</p><p>"The mystery's not over yet," he said.  "It's been
rebound.  This isn't the original binding."
</p><p>"Are you sure?" said Helen in surprise.  "It looks
the same."
</p><p>"The binding has been cleverly imitated, but it can't
fool me.  In the first place, there was a rubbed corner
at the top; and there was an ink stain on one of the end
papers."
</p>



<pb n="97"/>

<p>"There's still a stain there," said Aubrey, looking
over his shoulder.
</p><p>"Yes, but not the same stain.  I've had that book
long enough to know it by heart.  Now what the deuce
would that lunatic want to have it rebound for?"
</p><p>"Goodness gracious," said Helen, "put it away and
forget about it.  We'll all be dreaming about Carlyle if
you're not careful."
</p>

<head>CHAPTER V
<lb/>
Aubrey Walks Part Way Home&mdash;and Rides The Rest of the Way</head>

<p>It was a cold, clear night as Mr. Aubrey Gilbert left the
Haunted Bookshop that evening, and set out to walk
homeward.  Without making a very conscious choice, he
felt instinctively that it would be agreeable to walk
back to Manhattan rather than permit the roaring
disillusion of the subway to break in upon his
meditations.
</p><p>It is to be feared that Aubrey would have badly
flunked any quizzing on the chapters of <hi rend="italic">Somebody's
Luggage</hi> which the bookseller had read aloud.  His mind
was swimming rapidly in the agreeable, unfettered fashion
of a stream rippling downhill.  As O. Henry puts it in
one of his most delightful stories:  "He was outwardly
decent and managed to preserve his aquarium, but inside
he was impromptu and full of unexpectedness."  To say
that he was thinking of Miss Chapman would imply too much
power of ratiocination and abstract scrutiny on his part.
He was not thinking: he was being thought.  Down the
accustomed channels



<pb n="99"/>
of his intellect he felt his mind
ebbing with the irresistible movement of tides drawn by
the blandishing moon.  And across these shimmering
estuaries of impulse his will, a lost and naked athlete,
was painfully attempting to swim, but making much leeway
and already almost resigned to being carried out to sea.
</p><p>He stopped a moment at Weintraub's drug store, on the
corner of Gissing Street and Wordsworth Avenue, to buy
some cigarettes, unfailing solace of an agitated bosom.
</p><p>It was the usual old-fashioned pharmacy of those
parts of Brooklyn: tall red, green, and blue vases of
liquid in the windows threw blotches of coloured light
onto the pavement; on the panes was affixed white china
lettering: H.  WE TRAUB, DEUT CHE APOTHEKER.  Inside, the
customary shelves of labelled jars, glass cases holding
cigars, nostrums and toilet knick-knacks, and in one
corner an ancient revolving bookcase deposited long ago
by the Tabard Inn Library.  The shop was empty, but as he
opened the door a bell buzzed sharply.  In a back chamber
he could hear voices.  As he waited idly for the druggist
to appear, Aubrey cast a tolerant eye over the dusty
volumes in the twirling case.  There were the usual
copies of Harold MacGrath's <hi rend="italic">The Man on the Box, A Girl of
the Limberlost, and The House



<pb n="100"/>
boat on the Styx.  The Divine Fire,</hi> much grimed, leaned
against Joe Chapple's <hi rend="italic">Heart Throbs.</hi>  Those familiar with
the Tabard Inn
bookcases still to be found in outlying drug-shops know
that the stock has not been "turned" for many a year.
Aubrey was the more surprised, on spinning the the case
round, to find wedged in between two other volumes the
empty cover of a book that had been torn loose from the
pages to which it belonged.  He glanced at the lettering
on the back.  It ran thus:
</p>
<p>
<lb/>CARLYLE
<lb/> &mdash;
<lb/>OLIVER CROMWELL'S
<lb/>LETTERS
<lb/>  AND
<lb/>  SPEECHES
 </p>
<p>Obeying a sudden impulse, he slipped the book cover
in his overcoat pocket.
</p><p>Mr. Weintraub entered the shop, a solid Teutonic
person with discoloured pouches under his eyes and a face
that was a potent argument for prohibition.  His manner,
however, was that of one anxious to please.  Aubrey
indicated the brand of cigarettes he wanted.  Having
himself coined the advertising catchword for
them&mdash;<hi rend="italic">They're mild&mdash;but they satisfy</hi>&mdash;he felt a certain
loyal compulsion always to smoke this kind.  The


<pb n="101"/>
druggist held out the packet, and Aubrey noticed
that his fingers were stained a deep saffron colour.
</p><p>"I see you're a cigarette smoker, too," said Aubrey
pleasantly, as he opened the packet and lit one of the
paper tubes at a little alcohol flame burning in a globe
of blue glass on the counter.
</p><p>"Me?  I never smoke," said Mr. Weintraub, with a
smile which somehow did not seem to fit his surly face.
"I must have steady nerves in my profession.
Apothecaries who smoke make up bad prescriptions."
</p><p>"Well, how do you get your hands stained that way?"
Mr. Weintraub removed his hands from the counter.
</p><p>"Chemicals," he grunted.  "Prescriptions&mdash;all that
sort of thing."
</p><p>"Well," said Aubrey, "smoking's a bad habit.  I guess
I do too much of it."  He could not resist the impression
that someone was listening to their talk.  The doorway at
the back of the shop was veiled by a portiere of beads
and thin bamboo sections threaded on strings.  He heard
them clicking as though they had been momentarily pulled
aside.  Turning, just as he opened the door to leave, he
noticed the bamboo curtain swaying.
</p><p>"Well, good-night," he said, and stepped out onto the
street.


<pb n="102"/>

</p><p>As he walked down Wordsworth Avenue, under the
thunder of the L, past lighted lunchrooms, oyster
saloons, and pawnshops, Miss Chapman resumed her sway.
With the delightful velocity of thought his mind whirled
in a narrowing spiral round the experience of the
evening.  The small book-crammed sitting room of the
Mifflins, the sparkling fire, the lively chirrup of the
bookseller reading aloud&mdash;and there, in the old easy
chair whose horsehair stuffing was bulging out, that
blue-eyed vision of careless girlhood!  Happily he had
been so seated that he could study her without seeming to
do so.  The line of her ankle where the firelight danced
upon it put Coles Phillips to shame, he averred.
Extraordinary, how these creatures are made to torment us
with their intolerable comeliness!  Against the
background of dusky bindings her head shone with a soft
haze of gold.  Her face, that had an air of naive and
provoking independence, made him angry with its
unnecessary surplus of enchantment.  An unaccountable
gust of rage drove him rapidly along the frozen street.
"Damn it," he cried, "what right has any girl to be as
pretty as that?  Why&mdash;why, I'd like to beat her!" he
muttered, amazed at himself.  "What the devil right has
a girl got to look so innocently adorable?"
</p><p>It would be unseemly to follow poor Aubrey in


<pb n="103"/>
his vacillations of rage and worship as he thrashed
along Wordsworth Avenue, hearing and seeing no more than
was necessary for the preservation of his life at street
crossings.  Half-smoked cigarette stubs glowed in his
<ref target="n5.1">wake;</ref> his burly bosom echoed with
incoherent oratory.
In the darker stretches of Fulton Street that lead up to
the Brooklyn Bridge he fiercely exclaimed:  "By God, it's
not such a bad world."  As he ascended the slope of that
vast airy span, a black midget against a froth of stars,
he was gravely planning such vehemence of exploit in the
advertising profession as would make it seem less absurd
to approach the President of the Daintybits Corporation
with a question for which no progenitor of loveliness is
ever quite prepared.</p>


<p>In the exact centre of the bridge something diluted
his mood; he halted, leaning against the railing, to
consider the splendour of the scene.  The hour was
late&mdash;moving on toward midnight&mdash;but in the tall black
precipices of Manhattan scattered lights gleamed, in an
odd, irregular pattern like the sparse punctures on the
raffle-board&mdash;"take a chance on a Milk-Fed Turkey"&mdash;the
East Indian elevator-boy presents to apartment-house
tenants about Hallowe'en.  A fume of golden light eddied
over

<pb n="104"/>
uptown merriment: he could see the ruby beacon
on the Metropolitan Tower signal three quarters.
Underneath the airy decking of the bridge a tug went
puffing by, her port and starboard lamps trailing red and
green threads over the tideway.  Some great argosy of the
Staten Island fleet swept serenely down to St. George,
past Liberty in her soft robe of light, carrying theatred
commuters, dazed with weariness and blinking at the raw
fury of the electric bulbs.  Overhead the night was a
superb arch of clear frost, sifted with stars.  Blue
sparks crackled stickily along the trolley wires as the
cars groaned over the bridge.
</p><p>Aubrey surveyed all this splendid scene without exact
observation.  He was of a philosophic turn, and was
attempting to console his discomfiture in the
overwhelming lustre of Miss Titania by the thought that
she was, after all, the creature and offspring of the
science he worshipped&mdash;that of Advertising.  Was not the
fragrance of her presence, the soft compulsion of her
gaze, even the delirious frill of muslin at her wrist, to
be set down to the credit of his chosen art?  Had he not,
pondering obscurely upon "attention-compelling" copy and
lay-out and type-face, in a corner of the Grey-Matter
office, contributed to the triumphant prosperity and
grace of this unconscious beneficiary?  Indeed she seemed
to him, fiercely tormenting

<pb n="105"/>
himself with her
loveliness, a symbol of the mysterious and subtle power
of publicity.  It was Advertising that had done
this&mdash;that had enabled Mr. Chapman, a shy and droll
little person, to surround this girl with all the
fructifying glories of civilization&mdash;to foster and
cherish her until she shone upon the earth like a morning
star!  Advertising had clothed her, Advertising had fed
her, schooled, roofed, and sheltered her.  In a sense she
was the crowning advertisement of her father's career,
and her innocent perfection taunted him just as much as
the bright sky-sign he knew was flashing the words
CHAPMAN PRUNES above the teeming pavements of Times
Square.  He groaned to think that he himself, by his
conscientious
labours, had helped to put this girl in
such a position that he could hardly dare approach her.
</p><p>He would never have approached her again, on any
pretext, if the intensity of his thoughts had not caused
him, unconsciously, to grip the railing of the bridge
with strong and angry hands.  For at that moment a sack
was thrown over his head from behind and he was violently
seized by the legs, with the obvious intent of hoisting
him over the parapet.  His unexpected grip on the railing
delayed this attempt just long enough to save him.  Swept
off his feet by the fury of the assault, he fell sideways
against the barrier and had the good

<pb n="106"/>
fortune to
seize his enemy by the leg.  Muffled in the sacking, it
was vain to cry out; but he held furiously to the limb he
had grasped and he and his attacker rolled together on
the footway.  Aubrey was a powerful man, and even despite
the surprise could probably have got the better of the
situation; but as he wrestled desperately and tried to
rid himself of his hood, a crashing blow fell upon his
head, half stunning him.  He lay sprawled out,
momentarily incapable of struggle, yet conscious enough
to expect, rather curiously, the dizzying sensation of a
drop through insupportable air into the icy water of the
East River.  Hands seized him&mdash;and then, passively, he
heard a shout, the sound of footsteps running on the
planks, and other footsteps hurrying away at top speed.
In a moment the sacking was torn from his head and a
friendly pedestrian was kneeling beside him.
</p><p>"Say, are you all right?" said the latter anxiously.
"Gee, those guys nearly got you."
</p><p>Aubrey was too faint and dizzy to speak for a moment.
His head was numb and he felt certain that several inches
of it had been caved in.  Putting up his hand, feebly, he
was surprised to find the contours of his skull much the
same as usual.  The stranger propped him against his knee
and wiped away a trickle of blood with his handkerchief.
</p><p>"Say, old man, I thought you was a goner," he


<pb n="107"/>
said sympathetically.  "I seen those fellows jump
you.  Too bad they got away.  Dirty work, I'll say so."
</p><p>Aubrey gulped the night air, and sat up.  The bridge
rocked under him; against the star-speckled sky he could
see the Woolworth Building bending and jazzing like a
poplar tree in a gale.  He felt very sick.
</p><p>"Ever so much obliged to you," he stammered.  "I'll
be all right in a minute."
</p><p>"D'you want me to go and ring up a nambulance?" said
his assistant.
</p><p>"No, no," said Aubrey; "I'll be all right."  He
staggered to his feet and clung to the rail of the
bridge, trying to collect his wits.  One phrase ran over
and over in his mind with damnable iteration&mdash;<hi rend="italic">"Mild, but
they satisfy!"</hi>
</p><p>"Where were you going?" said the other, supporting
him.
</p><p>"Madison Avenue and Thirty-Second&mdash;"
</p><p>"Maybe I can flag a jitney for you.  Here," he cried,
as another citizen approached afoot, "Give this fellow a
hand.  Someone beat him over the bean with a club.  I'm
going to get him a lift."
</p><p>The newcomer readily undertook the friendly task, and
tied Aubrey's handkerchief round his head, which was
bleeding freely.  After a few moments the first Samaritan
succeeded in stopping a tour

<pb n="108"/>
ing car which was
speeding over from Brooklyn.  The driver willingly agreed
to take Aubrey home, and the other two helped him in.
Barring a nasty gash on his scalp he was none the worse.
</p><p>"A fellow needs a tin hat if he's going to wander
round Long Island at night," said the motorist genially.
"Two fellows tried to hold me up coming in from Rockville
Centre the other evening.  Maybe they were the same two
that picked on you.  Did you get a look at them?"
</p><p>"No," said Aubrey.  "That piece of sacking might have
helped me trace them, but I forgot it."
</p><p>"Want to run back for it?"
</p><p>"Never mind," said Aubrey.  "I've got a hunch about
this."
</p><p>"Think you know who it is?  Maybe you're in politics,
hey?"
</p><p>The car ran swiftly up the dark channel of the
Bowery, into Fourth Avenue, and turned off at
Thirty-Second Street to deposit Aubrey in front of his
boarding house.  He thanked his convoy heartily, and
refused further assistance.  After several false shots he
got his latch key in the lock, climbed four creaking
flights, and stumbled into his room.  Groping his way to
the wash-basin, he bathed his throbbing head, tied a
towel round it, and fell into bed.

<lb/>
Titania Learns the Business</head>


<p>Although he kept late hours, Roger Mifflin was a prompt
riser.  It is only the very young who find satisfaction
in lying abed in the morning.  Those who approach the
term of the fifth decade are sensitively aware of the
fluency of life, and have no taste to squander it among
the blankets.
</p><p>The bookseller's morning routine was brisk and
habitual.  He was generally awakened about half-past
seven by the jangling bell that balanced on a coiled
spring at the foot of the stairs.  This ringing announced
the arrival of Becky, the old scrubwoman who came each
morning to sweep out the shop and clean the floors for
the day's traffic.  Roger, in his old dressing gown of
vermilion flannel, would scuffle down to let her in,
picking up the milk bottles and the paper bag of baker's
rolls at the same time.  As Becky propped the front door
wide, opened window transoms, and set about buffeting
dust and tobacco smoke, Roger would take the milk and
rolls back to the kitchen and



<pb n="110"/>
give Bock a
morning greeting.  Bock would emerge from his literary
kennel, and thrust out his forelegs in a genial
obeisance.  This was partly politeness, and partly to
straighten out his spine after its all-night curvature.
Then Roger would let him out into the back yard for a
run, himself standing on the kitchen steps to inhale the
bright freshness of the morning air.
</p><p>This Saturday morning was clear and crisp.  The plain
backs of the homes along Whittier Street, irregular in
profile as the margins of a free verse poem, offered
Roger an agreeable human panorama.  Thin strands of smoke
were rising from chimneys; a belated baker's wagon was
joggling down the alley; in bedroom bay-windows sheets
and pillows were already set to sun and air.  Brooklyn,
admirable borough of homes and hearty breakfasts, attacks
the morning hours in cheery, smiling spirit.  Bock
sniffed and rooted about the small back yard as though
the earth (every cubic inch of which he already knew by
rote) held some new entrancing flavour.  Roger watched
him with the amused and tender condescension one always
feels toward a happy dog&mdash;perhaps the same mood of
tolerant paternalism that Gott is said to have felt in
watching his boisterous Hohenzollerns.
</p><p>The nipping air began to infiltrate his dressing


<pb n="111"/>
gown, and Roger returned to the kitchen, his small,
lively face alight with zest.  He opened the draughts in
the range, set a kettle on to boil, and went down to
resuscitate the furnace.  As he came upstairs for his
bath, Mrs. Mifflin was descending, fresh and hearty in a
starchy morning apron.  Roger hummed a tune as he picked
up the hairpins on the bedroom floor, and wondered to
himself why women are always supposed to be more tidy
than men.
</p><p>Titania was awake early.  She smiled at the enigmatic
portrait of Samuel Butler, glanced at the row of books
over her bed, and dressed rapidly.  She ran downstairs,
eager to begin her experience as a bookseller.  The first
impression the Haunted Bookshop had made on her was one
of superfluous dinginess, and as Mrs. Mifflin refused to
let her help get breakfast&mdash;except set out the salt
cellars&mdash;she ran down Gissing Street to a little
florist's shop she had noticed the previous afternoon.
Here she spent at least a week's salary in buying
chrysanthemums and a large pot of white heather.  She was
distributing these about the shop when Roger found her.
</p><p>"Bless my soul!" he said.  "How are you going to live
on your wages if you do that sort of thing?  Pay-day
doesn't come until next Friday!"
</p><p>"Just one blow-out," she said cheerfully.  "I


<pb n="112"/>
thought it would be fun to brighten the place up a
bit.  Think how pleased your floorwalker will be when he
comes in!"
</p><p>"Dear me," said Roger.  "I hope you don't really
think we have floorwalkers in the second-hand book
business."
</p><p>After breakfast he set about initiating his new
employee into the routine of the shop.  As he moved
about, explaining the arrangement of his shelves, he kept
up a running commentary.
</p><p>"Of course all the miscellaneous information that a
bookseller has to have will only come to you gradually,"
he said.  "Such tags of bookshop lore as the difference
between Philo Gubb and Philip Gibbs, Mrs. Wilson Woodrow
and Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, and all that sort of thing.
Don't be frightened by all the ads you see for a book
called "Bell and Wing," because no one was ever heard to
ask for a copy.  That's one of the reasons why I tell Mr.
Gilbert I don't believe in advertising.  Someone may ask
you who wrote <hi rend="italic">The Winning of the Best,</hi> and you'll have to
know it wasn't Colonel Roosevelt but Mr. Ralph Waldo
Trine.  The beauty of being a bookseller is that you
don't have to be a literary critic: all you have to do to
books is enjoy them.  A literary critic is the kind of
fellow who will tell you that Wordsworth's <hi rend="italic">Happy Warrior</hi>
is a poem of 85 lines composed

<pb n="113"/>
entirely of two
sentences, one of 26 lines and one of 59.  What does it
matter if Wordsworth wrote sentences almost as long as
those of Walt Whitman or Mr. Will H. Hays, if only he
wrote a great poem?  Literary critics are queer birds.
There's Professor Phelps of Yale, for instance.  He
publishes a book in 1918 and calls it <hi rend="italic">The Advance of
English Poetry in the Twentieth Century.</hi>  To my way of
thinking a book of that title oughtn't to be published
until 2018.  Then somebody will come along and ask you
for a book of poems about a typewriter, and by and by
you'll learn that what they want is Stevenson's
<hi rend="italic">Underwoods.</hi>  Yes, it's a complicated life.  Never argue
with customers.  Just give them the book they ought to
have even if they don't know they want it."  They went
outside the front door, and Roger lit his pipe.  In the
little area in front of the shop windows stood large
empty boxes supported on trestles.  "The first thing I
always do&mdash;," he said.
</p><p>"The first thing you'll both do is catch your death
of cold," said Helen over his shoulder.  "Titania, you
run and get your fur.  Roger, go and find your cap.  With
your bald head, you ought to know better!"
</p><p>When they returned to the front door, Titania's blue
eyes were sparkling above her soft tippet.


<pb n="114"/>

</p><p>"I applaud your taste in furs," said Roger.  "That is
just the colour of tobacco smoke."  He blew a whiff
against it to prove the likeness.  He felt very
talkative, as most older men do when a young girl looks
as delightfully listenable as Titania.
</p><p>"What an adorable little place," said Titania,
looking round at the bookshop's space of private
pavement, which was sunk below the street level.  "You
could put tables out here and serve tea in summer time."
</p><p>"The first thing every morning," continued Roger, "I
set out the ten-cent stuff in these boxes.  I take it in
at night and stow it in these bins.  When it rains, I
shove out an awning, which is mighty good business.
Someone is sure to take shelter, and spend the time in
looking over the books.  A really heavy shower is often
worth fifty or sixty cents.  Once a week I change my
pavement stock.  This week I've got mostly fiction out
here.  That's the sort of thing that comes in in
unlimited numbers.  A good deal of it's tripe, but it
serves its purpose."
</p><p>"Aren't they rather dirty?" said Titania doubtfully,
looking at some little blue Rollo books, on which the
siftings of generations had accumulated.  "Would you mind
if I dusted them off a bit?"
</p><p>"It's almost unheard of in the second-hand


<pb n="115"/>
trade," said Roger; "but it might make them look
better."
</p><p>Titania ran inside, borrowed a duster from Helen, and
began housecleaning the grimy boxes, while Roger chatted
away in high spirits.  Bock already noticing the new
order of things, squatted on the doorstep with an air of
being a party to the conversation.  Morning pedestrians
on Gissing Street passed by, wondering who the
bookseller's engaging assistant might be.  "I wish _I_
could find a maid like that," thought a prosperous
Brooklyn housewife on her way to market.  "I must ring
her up some day and find out how much she gets."
</p><p>Roger brought out armfuls of books while Titania
dusted.
</p><p>"One of the reasons I'm awfully glad you've come here
to help me," he said, "is that I'll be able to get out
more.  I've been so tied down by the shop, I haven't had
a chance to scout round, buy up libraries, make bids on
collections that are being sold, and all that sort of
thing.  My stock is running a bit low.  If you just wait
for what comes in, you don't get much of the really good
stuff."
</p><p>Titania was polishing a copy of <hi rend="italic">The Late Mrs.
Null. </hi>
"It must be wonderful to have read so many books," she
said.  "I'm afraid I'm not a

<pb n="116"/>
very deep reader, but
at any rate Dad has taught me a respect for good books.
He gets so mad because when my friends come to the house,
and he asks them what they've been reading, the only
thing they seem to know about is <hi rend="italic">Dere Mable."</hi>
</p><p>Roger chuckled.  "I hope you don't think I'm a mere
highbrow," he said.  "As a customer said to me once,
without meaning to be funny, `I like both the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and
the <hi rend="italic">Argosy.'</hi> The only thing I can't stand is literature
that is unfairly and intentionally flavoured with
vanilla.  Confectionery soon disgusts the palate, whether
you find it in Marcus Aurelius or Doctor Crane.  There's
an odd aspect of the matter that sometimes strikes me:
Doc Crane's remarks are just as true as Lord Bacon's, so
how is it that the Doctor puts me to sleep in a
paragraph, while my Lord's essays keep me awake all
night?"
</p><p>Titania, being unacquainted with these philosophers,
pursued the characteristic feminine course of clinging to
the subject on which she was informed.  The undiscerning
have called this habit of mind irrelevant, but wrongly.
The feminine intellect leaps like a grasshopper; the
masculine plods as the ant.
</p><p>"I see there's a new Mable book coming," she said.
"It's called <hi rend="italic">That's Me All Over Mable, </hi>

<pb n="117"/>
and the newsstand clerk at the Octagon says he expects to sell a
thousand copies."
</p><p>"Well, there's a meaning in that," said Roger.
"People have a craving to be amused, and I'm sure I don't
blame 'em.  I'm afraid I haven't read <hi rend="italic">Dere Mable.</hi>  If
it's really amusing, I'm glad they read it.  I suspect it
isn't a very great book, because a Philadelphia
schoolgirl has written a reply to it called <hi rend="italic">Dere Bill,</hi>
which is said to be as good as the original.  Now you can
hardly imagine a Philadelphia flapper writing an
effective companion to Bacon's Essays.  But never mind,
if the stuff's amusing, it has its place.  The human
yearning for innocent pastime is a pathetic thing, come
to think about it.  It shows what a desperately grim
thing life has become.  One of the most significant
things I know is that breathless, expectant, adoring hush
that falls over a theatre at a Saturday matinee, when the
house goes dark and the footlights set the bottom of the
curtain in a glow, and the latecomers tank over your feet
climbing into their seats&mdash;"
</p><p>"Isn't it an adorable moment!" cried Titania.
</p><p>"Yes, it is," said Roger; "but it makes me sad to see
what tosh is handed out to that eager, expectant
audience, most of the time.  There they all are, ready to
be thrilled, eager to be worked upon, deliberately
putting themselves into that

<pb n="118"/>
glorious, rare,
receptive mood when they are clay in the artist's
hand&mdash;and Lord! what miserable substitutes for joy and
sorrow are put over on them!  Day after day I see people
streaming into theatres and movies, and I know that more
than half the time they are on a blind quest, thinking
they are satisfied when in truth they are fed on paltry
husks.  And the sad part about it is that if you let
yourself think you are satisfied with husks, you'll have
no appetite left for the real grain."
</p><p>Titania wondered, a little panic-stricken, whether
she had been permitting herself to be satisfied with
husks.  She remembered how greatly she had enjoyed a
Dorothy Gish film a few evenings before.  "But," she
ventured, "you said people want to be amused.  And if
they laugh and look happy, surely they're amused?"
</p><p>"They only think they are!" cried Mifflin.  "They
think they're amused because they don't know what real
amusement is!  Laughter and prayer are the two noblest
habits of man; they mark us off from the brutes.  To
laugh at cheap jests is as base as to pray to cheap gods.
To laugh at Fatty Arbuckle is to degrade the human
spirit."
</p><p>Titania thought she was getting in rather deep, but
she had the tenacious logic of every healthy girl.  She
said:


<pb n="119"/>

</p><p>"But a joke that seems cheap to you doesn't seem
cheap to the person who laughs at it, or he wouldn't
laugh."
</p><p>Her face brightened as a fresh idea flooded her mind:
</p><p>"The wooden image a savage prays to may seem cheap to
you, but it's the best god he knows, and it's all right
for him to pray to it."
</p><p>"Bully for you," said Roger.  "Perfectly true.  But
I've got away from the point I had in mind.  Humanity is
yearning now as it never did before for truth, for
beauty, for the things that comfort and console and make
life seem worth while.  I feel this all round me, every
day.  We've been through a frightful ordeal, and every
decent spirit is asking itself what we can do to pick up
the fragments and remould the world nearer to our heart's
desire.  Look here, here's something I found the other
day in John Masefield's preface to one of his plays:
<hi rend="italic">"The truth and rapture of man are holy things, not
lightly to be scorned.  A carelessness of life and beauty
marks the glutton, the idler, and the fool in their
deadly path across history."</hi>  "I tell you, I've done some
pretty sober thinking as I've sat here in my bookshop
during the past horrible years.  Walt Whitman wrote a
little poem during the Civil War&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Year that trembled and
reeled beneath me,</hi> said Walt,<hi rend="italic"> Must I learn to


<pb n="120"/>
chant the cold dirges of the baffled, and sullen
hymns of defeat?</hi>&mdash;I've sat here in my shop at night, and
looked round at my shelves, looked at all the brave books
that house the hopes and gentlenesses and dreams of men
and women, and wondered if they were all wrong,
discredited, defeated.  Wondered if the world were still
merely a jungle of fury.  I think I'd have gone balmy if
it weren't for Walt Whitman.  Talk about Mr.
Britling&mdash;Walt was the man who `saw it through.'
</p><p>"The glutton, the idler, and the fool in their deadly
path across history. . . .  Aye, a deadly path indeed.
The German military men weren't idlers, but they were
gluttons and fools to the nth power. Look at their deadly
path!  And look at other deadly paths, too. Look at our
slums, jails, insane asylums. . .
</p><p>"I used to wonder what I could do to justify my
comfortable existence here during such a time of horror.
What right had I to shirk in a quiet bookshop when so
many men were suffering and dying through no fault of
their own?  I tried to get into an ambulance unit, but
I've had no medical training and they said they didn't
want men of my age unless they were experienced doctors."
</p><p>"I know how you felt," said Titania, with a
surprising look of comprehension.  "Don't you suppose
that a great many girls, who couldn't do

<pb n="121"/>
anything
real to help, got tired of wearing neat little uniforms
with Sam Browne belts?"
</p><p>"Well," said Roger, "it was a bad time.  The war
contradicted and denied everything I had ever lived for.
Oh, I can't tell you how I felt about it.  I can't even
express it to myself.  Sometimes I used to feel as I
think that truly noble simpleton Henry Ford may have felt
when he organized his peace voyage&mdash;that I would do
anything, however stupid, to stop it all.  In a world
where everyone was so wise and cynical and cruel, it was
admirable to find a man so utterly simple and hopeful as
Henry.  A boob, they called him.  Well, I say bravo for
boobs!  I daresay most of the apostles were boobs&mdash;or
maybe they called them bolsheviks."
</p><p>Titania had only the vaguest notion about bolsheviks,
but she had seen a good many newspaper cartoons.
</p><p>"I guess Judas was a bolshevik," she said innocently.
</p><p>"Yes, and probably George the Third called Ben
Franklin a bolshevik," retorted Roger.  "The trouble is,
truth and falsehood don't come laid out in black and
white&mdash;Truth and Huntruth, as the wartime joke had it.
Sometimes I thought Truth had vanished from the earth,"
he cried bitterly.  "Like everything else, it was
rationed by the

<pb n="122"/>
governments.  I taught myself to
disbelieve half of what I read in the papers.  I saw the
world clawing itself to shreds in blind rage.  I saw
hardly any one brave enough to face the brutalizing
absurdity as it really was, and describe it.  I saw the
glutton, the idler, and the fool applauding, while brave
and simple men walked in the horrors of hell.  The
stay-at-home poets turned it to pretty lyrics of glory
and sacrifice.  Perhaps half a dozen of them have told
the truth.  Have you read Sassoon?  Or Latzko's <hi rend="italic">Men in
War,</hi> which was so damned true that the government
suppressed it?  Humph!  Putting Truth on rations!"
</p><p>He knocked out his pipe against his heel, and his
blue eyes shone with a kind of desperate earnestness.
</p><p>"But I tell you, the world is going to have the truth
about War. We're going to put an end to this madness.
It's not going to be easy.  Just now, in the intoxication
of the German collapse, we're all rejoicing in our new
happiness.  I tell you, the real Peace will be a long
time coming.  When you tear up all the fibres of
civilization it's a slow job to knit things together
again.  You see those children going down the street to
school?  Peace lies in their hands.  When they are taught
in school that War is the most loathsome scourge humanity

very lovely occupation of the mortal spirit, then there may be
some hope for the future.  But I'd like to bet they are
having it drilled into them that war is a glorious and
noble sacrifice.
</p><p>"The people who write poems about the divine frenzy
of going over the top are usually those who dipped their
pens a long, long way from the slimy duckboards of the
trenches.  It's funny how we hate to face realities.  I
knew a commuter once who rode in town every day on the
8.13.  But he used to call it the 7.73.  He said it made
him feel more virtuous."
</p><p>There was a pause, while Roger watched some belated
urchins hurrying toward school.
</p><p>"I think any man would be a traitor to humanity who
didn't pledge every effort of his waking life to an
attempt to make war impossible in future."
</p><p>"Surely no one would deny that," said Titania.  "But
I do think the war was very glorious as well as very
terrible.  I've known lots of men who went over, knowing
well what they were to face, and yet went gladly and
humbly in the thought they were going for a true cause."
</p><p>"A cause which is so true shouldn't need the
sacrifice of millions of fine lives," said Roger gravely.
"Don't imagine I don't see the dreadful nobility of it.
But poor humanity shouldn't be

<pb n="124"/>
asked to be noble at
such a cost.  That's the most pitiful tragedy of it all.
Don't you suppose the Germans thought they too were
marching off for a noble cause when they began it and
forced this misery on the world?  They had been educated
to believe so, for a generation. That's the terrible
hypnotism of war, the brute mass-impulse, the pride and
national spirit, the instinctive simplicity of men that
makes them worship what is their own above everything
else.  I've thrilled and shouted with patriotic pride,
like everyone.  Music and flags and men marching in step
have bewitched me, as they do all of us.  And then I've
gone home and sworn to root this evil instinct out of my
soul.  God help us&mdash;let's love the world, love
humanity&mdash;not just our own country!  That's why I'm so
keen about the part we're going to play at the Peace
Conference.  Our motto over there will be America Last!
Hurrah for us, I say, for we shall be the only nation
over there with absolutely no axe to grind.  Nothing but
a pax to grind!"
</p><p>It argued well for Titania's breadth of mind that she
was not dismayed nor alarmed at the poor bookseller's
anguished harangue. She surmised sagely that he was
cleansing his bosom of much perilous stuff.  In some
mysterious way she had learned the greatest and rarest of
the spirit's gifts&mdash;toleration.


<pb n="125"/>

</p><p>"You can't help loving your country," she said.
</p><p>"Let's go indoors," he answered.  "You'll catch cold
out here.  I want to show you my alcove of books on the
war."
</p><p>"Of course one can't help loving one's country," he
added.  "I love mine so much that I want to see her take
the lead in making a new era possible.  She has
sacrificed least for war, she should be ready to
sacrifice most for peace.  As for me," he said, smiling,
"I'd be willing to sacrifice the whole Republican party!"
</p><p>"I don't see why you call the war an absurdity," said
Titania. "We <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to beat Germany, or where would
civilization have been?"
</p><p>"We had to beat Germany, yes, but the absurdity lies
in the fact that we had to beat ourselves in doing it.
The first thing you'll find, when the Peace Conference
gets to work, will be that we shall have to help Germany
onto her feet again so that she can be punished in an
orderly way.  We shall have to feed her and admit her to
commerce so that she can pay her indemnities&mdash;we shall
have to police her cities to prevent revolution from
burning her up&mdash;and the upshot of it all will be that men
will have fought the most terrible war in history, and
endured nameless horrors, for the privilege of nursing
their enemy back to health.  If that isn't an absurdity,
what is?  That's

<pb n="126"/>
what happens when a great nation
like Germany goes insane.
</p><p>"Well, we're up against some terribly complicated
problems.  My only consolation is that I think the
bookseller can play as useful a part as any man in
rebuilding the world's sanity.  When I was fretting over
what I could do to help things along, I came across two
lines in my favourite poet that encouraged me.  Good old
George Herbert says:
</p>
 <lg type="poem">
<l>"A grain of glory mixed with humblenesse </l>
<l> Cures both a fever and lethargicknesse.</l>
 </lg>

<p>"Certainly running a second-hand bookstore is a
pretty humble calling, but I've mixed a grain of glory
with it, in my own imagination at any rate.  You see,
books contain the thoughts and dreams of men, their hopes
and strivings and all their immortal parts.  It's in
books that most of us learn how splendidly worth-while
life is.  I never realized the greatness of the human
spirit, the indomitable grandeur of man's mind, until I
read Milton's <hi rend="italic">Areopagitica.</hi>  To read that great outburst
of splendid anger ennobles the meanest of us simply
because we belong to the same species of animal as
Milton.  Books are the immortality of the race, the
father and mother of most that is worth while cherishing
in our hearts.  To spread

<pb n="127"/>
good books about, to sow
them on fertile minds, to propagate understanding and a
carefulness of life and beauty, isn't that high enough
mission for a man?  The bookseller is the real Mr.
Valiant-For-Truth.
</p><p>"Here's my War-alcove," he went on.  "I've stacked up
here most of the really good books the War has brought
out.  If humanity has sense enough to take these books to
heart, it will never get itself into this mess again.
Printer's ink has been running a race against gunpowder
these many, many years.  Ink is handicapped, in a way,
because you can blow up a man with gunpowder in half a
second, while it may take twenty years to blow him up
with a book. But the gunpowder destroys itself along with
its victim, while a book can keep on exploding for
centuries.  There's Hardy's <hi rend="italic">Dynasts</hi> for example.  When
you read that book you can feel it blowing up your mind.
It leaves you gasping, ill, nauseated&mdash;oh, it's not
pleasant to feel some really pure intellect filtered into
one's brain!  It hurts!  There's enough T. N. T. in that
book to blast war from the face of the globe.  But
there's a slow fuse attached to it.  It hasn't really
exploded yet.  Maybe it won't for another fifty years.
</p><p>"In regard to the War, think what books have
accomplished.  What was the first thing all the


<pb n="128"/>
governments started to do&mdash;publish books!  Blue
Books, Yellow Books, White Books, Red Books&mdash;everything
but Black Books, which would have been appropriate in
Berlin.  They knew that guns and troops were helpless
unless they could get the books on their side, too.
Books did as much as anything else to bring America into
the war.  Some German books helped to wipe the Kaiser off
his throne&mdash;<hi rend="italic">I Accuse,</hi> and Dr. Muehlon's magnificent
outburst <hi rend="italic">The Vandal of Europe,</hi> and Lichnowsky's private
memorandum, that shook Germany to her foundations, simply
because he told the truth.  Here's that book <hi rend="italic">Men in War,</hi>
written I believe by a Hungarian officer, with its noble
dedication "To Friend and Foe."  Here are some of the
French books&mdash;books in which the clear, passionate
intellect of that race, with its savage irony, burns like
a flame.  Romain Rolland's <hi rend="italic">Au-Dessus de la Melee,</hi> written
in exile in Switzerland; Barbusse's terrible <hi rend="italic">Le Feu;</hi>
Duhamel's bitter <hi rend="italic">Civilization;</hi> Bourget's strangely
fascinating novel The <hi rend="italic">Meaning of Death.</hi>  And the noble
books that have come out of England:  <hi rend="italic">A Student in Arms;
The Tree of Heaven; Why Men Fight,</hi> by Bertrand
Russell&mdash;I'm hoping he'll write one on <hi rend="italic">Why Men Are
Imprisoned:</hi>  you know he was locked up for his
sentiments!  And here's one of the most moving of
all&mdash;<hi rend="italic">The Letters

<pb n="129"/>
of Arthur Heath,</hi> a gentle,
sensitive young Oxford tutor who was killed on the
Western front.  You ought to read that book.  It shows
the entire lack of hatred on the part of the English.
Heath and his friends, the night before they enlisted,
sat up singing the German music they had loved, as a kind
of farewell to the old, friendly joyous life.  Yes,
that's the kind of thing War does&mdash;wipes out spirits like
Arthur Heath.  Please read it.  Then you'll have to read
Philip Gibbs, and Lowes Dickinson and all the young
poets.  Of course you've read Wells already.  Everybody
has."
</p><p>"How about the Americans?" said Titania.  "Haven't
they written anything about the war that's worth while?"
</p><p>"Here's One that I found a lot of meat in, streaked
with philosophical gristle," said Roger, relighting his
pipe.  He pulled out a copy of <hi rend="italic">Professor Latimer's
Progress.</hi>  "There was one passage that I remember
marking&mdash;let's see now, what was it?&mdash;Yes, here!
</p><p>"It is true that, if you made a poll of newspaper
editors, you might find a great many who think that war
is evil.  But if you were to take a census among pastors
of fashionable metropolitan churches&mdash;"

</p><p>"That's a bullseye hit!  The church has done for
itself with most thinking men. . .

<pb n="130"/>
There's another
good passage in <hi rend="italic">Professor Latimer,</hi> where he points out
the philosophical value of dishwashing.  Some of
Latimer's talk is so much in common with my ideas that
I've been rather hoping he'd drop in here some day.  I'd
like to meet him.  As for American poets, get wise to
Edwin Robinson&mdash;"
</p><p>There is no knowing how long the bookseller's
monologue might have continued, but at this moment Helen
appeared from the kitchen.
</p><p>"Good gracious, Roger!" she exclaimed, "I've heard
your voice piping away for I don't know how long.  What
are you doing, giving the poor child a Chautauqua
lecture?  You must want to frighten her out of the book
business."
</p><p>Roger looked a little sheepish.  "My dear," he said,
"I was only laying down a few of the principles
underlying the art of bookselling&mdash;"
</p><p>"It was very interesting, honestly it was," said
Titania brightly. Mrs. Mifflin, in a blue check apron and
with plump arms floury to the elbow, gave her a wink&mdash;or
as near a wink as a woman ever achieves (ask the man who
owns one).
</p><p>"Whenever Mr. Mifflin feels very low in his mind
about the business," she said, "he falls back on those
highly idealized sentiments.  He knows that next to being
a parson, he's got into the worst

<pb n="131"/>
line there is, and
he tries bravely to conceal it from himself."
</p><p>"I think it's too bad to give me away before Miss
Titania," said Roger, smiling, so Titania saw this was
merely a family joke.
</p><p>"Really truly," she protested, "I'm having a lovely
time.  I've been learning all about Professor Latimer who
wrote <hi rend="italic">The Handle of Europe,</hi> and all sorts of things.
I've been afraid every minute that some customer would
come in and interrupt us."
</p><p>"No fear of that," said Helen.  "They're scarce in
the early morning."  She went back to her kitchen.
</p><p>"Well, Miss Titania," resumed Roger.  "You see what
I'm driving at. I want to give people an entirely new
idea about bookshops.  The grain of glory that I hope
will cure both my fever and my lethargicness is my
conception of the bookstore as a power-house, a radiating
place for truth and beauty.  I insist books are not
absolutely dead things:  they are as lively as those
fabulous dragons' teeth, and being sown up and down, may
chance to spring up armed men.  How about Bernhardi?
Some of my Corn Cob friends tell me books are just
merchandise.  Pshaw!"
</p><p>"I haven't read much of Bernard Shaw" said Titania.


<pb n="132"/>

</p><p>"Did you ever notice how books track you down and
hunt you out?  They follow you like the hound in Francis
Thompson's poem.  They know their quarry!  Look at that
book <hi rend="italic">The Education of Henry Adams!</hi>  Just watch the way
it's hounding out thinking people this winter. And <hi rend="italic">The
Four Horsemen</hi>&mdash;you can see it racing in the veins of the
reading people.  It's one of the uncanniest things I know
to watch a real book on its career&mdash;it follows you and
follows you and drives you into a corner and <hi rend="italic">makes</hi> you
read it.  There's a queer old book that's been chasing me
for years:  <hi rend="italic">The Life and Opinions of John Buncle, Esq.,</hi>
it's called.  I've tried to escape it, but every now and
then it sticks up its head somewhere.  It'll get me some
day, and I'll be compelled to read it.  <hi rend="italic">Ten Thousand a
Year</hi> trailed me the same way until I surrendered.  Words
can't describe the cunning of some books.  You'll think
you've shaken them off your trail, and then one day some
innocent-looking customer will pop in and begin to talk,
and you'll know he's an unconscious agent of
book-destiny.  There's an old sea-captain who drops in
here now and then.  He's simply the novels of Captain
Marryat put into flesh.  He has me under a kind of spell:
I know I shall have to read <hi rend="italic">Peter Simple</hi> before I die,
just because the old fellow loves it so.  That's why I
call this place

<pb n="133"/>
the Haunted Bookshop.  Haunted by
the ghosts of the books I haven't read.  Poor uneasy
spirits, they walk and walk around me.  There's only one
way to lay the ghost of a book, and that is to read it."
</p><p>"I know what you mean," said Titania.  "I haven't
read much Bernard Shaw, but I feel I shall have to.  He
meets me at every turn, bullying me.  And I know lots of
people who are simply terrorized by H. G. Wells.  Every
time one of his books comes out, and that's pretty often,
they're in a perfect panic until they've read it."
</p><p>Roger chuckled.  "Some have even been stampeded into
subscribing to the <hi rend="italic">New Republic</hi> for that very purpose."
</p><p>"But speaking of the Haunted Bookshop, what's your
special interest in that Oliver Cromwell book?"
</p><p>"Oh, I'm glad you mentioned it," said Roger.  "I must
put it back in its place on the shelf."  He ran back to
the den to get it, and just then the bell clanged at the
door.  A customer came in, and the one-sided gossip was
over for the time being.

<head>CHAPTER VII
<lb/>
AUBREY TAKES LODGINGS</head>


<p>I am sensible that Mr. Aubrey Gilbert is by no means
ideal as the leading juvenile of our piece.  The time
still demands some explanation why the leading juvenile
wears no gold chevrons on his left sleeve.  As a matter
of fact, our young servant of the Grey-Matter Agency had
been declined by a recruiting station and a draft board
on account of flat feet; although I must protest that
their flatness detracts not at all from his outward
bearing nor from his physical capacity in the ordinary
concerns of amiable youth.  When the army "turned him
down flat," as he put it, he had entered the service of
the Committee on Public Information, and had carried on
mysterious activities in their behalf for over a year, up
to the time when the armistice was signed by the United
Press. Owing to a small error of judgment on his part,
now completely forgotten, but due to the regrettable
delay of the German envoys to synchronize with
overexuberant press correspondents, the last three




<pb n="135"/>
days of the war had been carried on without his
active assistance. After the natural recuperation
necessary on the 12th of November, he had been reabsorbed
by the Grey-Matter Advertising Agency, with whom he had
been connected for several years, and where his sound and
vivacious qualities were highly esteemed.  It was in the
course of drumming up post-war business that he had swung
so far out of his ordinary orbit as to call on Roger
Mifflin.  Perhaps these explanations should have been
made earlier.
</p><p>At any rate, Aubrey woke that Saturday morning, about
the time Titania began to dust the pavement-boxes, in no
very world-conquering humour.  As it was a half-holiday,
he felt no compunction in staying away from the office.
The landlady, a motherly soul, sent him up some coffee
and scrambled eggs, and insisted on having a doctor in to
look at his damage.  Several stitches were taken, after
which he had a nap.  He woke up at noon, feeling better,
though his head still ached abominably.  Putting on a
dressing gown, he sat down in his modest chamber, which
was furnished chiefly with a pipe-rack, ash trays, and a
set of O. Henry, and picked up one of his favourite
volumes for a bit of solace.  We have hinted that Mr.
Gilbert was not what is called "literary."  His reading
was mostly of the newsstand sort,

<pb n="136"/>
and Printer's Ink,
that naive journal of the publicity professions. His
favourite diversion was luncheon at the Advertising Club
where he would pore, fascinated, over displays of
advertising booklets, posters, and pamphlets with such
titles as <hi rend="italic">Tell Your Story in Bold-Face.</hi>  He was
accustomed to remark that "the fellow who writes the
Packard ads has Ralph Waldo Emerson skinned three ways
from the Jack."  Yet much must be forgiven this young man
for his love of O. Henry.  He knew, what many other happy
souls have found, that O. Henry is one of those rare and
gifted tellers of tales who can be read at all times.  No
matter how weary, how depressed, how shaken in morale,
one can always find enjoyment in that master romancer of
the Cabarabian Nights.  "Don't talk to me of Dickens'
<hi rend="italic">Christmas Stories,"</hi> Aubrey said to himself, recalling his
adventure in Brooklyn.  "I'll bet O. Henry's Gift of the
Magi beats anything Dick ever laid pen to.  What a shame
he died without finishing that Christmas story in <hi rend="italic">Rolling
Stones!</hi>  I wish some boss writer like Irvin Cobb or Edna
Ferber would take a hand at finishing it.  If I were an
editor I'd hire someone to wind up that yarn.  It's a
crime to have a good story like that lying around half
written."
</p><p>He was sitting in a soft wreath of cigarette


<pb n="137"/>
smoke when his landlady came in with the morning
paper.
</p><p>"Thought you might like to see the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> Mr.
Gilbert," she said. "I knew you'd been too sick to go out
and buy one.  I see the President's going to sail on
Wednesday."
</p><p>Aubrey threaded his way through the news with the
practiced eye of one who knows what interests him.  Then,
by force of habit, he carefully scanned the advertising
pages.  A notice in the HELP WANTED columns leaped out at
him.

</p><p>WANTED&mdash;For temporary employment at Hotel Octagon, 3
chefs, 3 experienced cooks, 20 waiters.  Apply chef's
office, 11 P.M. Tuesday.

</p><p>"Hum," he thought.  "I suppose, to take the place of
those fellows who are going to sail on the <hi rend="italic">George
Washington</hi> to cook for Mr. Wilson.  That's a grand ad for
the Octagon, having their kitchen staff chosen for the
President's trip.  Gee, I wonder why they don't play that
up in some real space?  Maybe I can place some copy for
them along that line."
</p><p>An idea suddenly occurred to him, and he went over to
the chair where he had thrown his overcoat the night
before.  From the pocket he took out the cover of
Carlyle's <hi rend="italic">Cromwell,</hi> and looked at it carefully.
</p><p>"I wonder what the jinx is on this book?" he


<pb n="137"/>
thought.  "It's a queer thing the way that fellow
trailed me last night&mdash;then my finding this in the drug
store, and getting that crack on the bean. I wonder if
that neighbourhood is a safe place for a girl to work
in?"
</p><p>He paced up and down the room, forgetting the pain in
his head.
</p><p>"Maybe I ought to tip the police off about this
business," he thought.  "It looks wrong to me.  But I
have a hankering to work the thing out on my own.  I'd
have a wonderful stand-in with old man Chapman if I saved
that girl from anything. . .  .  I've heard of gangs of
kidnappers. . . .  No, I don't like the looks of things
a little bit.  I think that bookseller is half cracked,
anyway.  He doesn't believe in advertising!  The idea of
Chapman trusting his daughter in a place like that&mdash;"
</p><p>The thought of playing knight errant to something
more personal and romantic than an advertising account
was irresistible.  "I'll slip over to Brooklyn as soon as
it gets dark this evening," he said to himself.  "I ought
to be able to get a room somewhere along that street,
where I can watch that bookshop without being seen, and
find out what's haunting it.  I've got that old .22
popgun of mine that I used to use up at camp.  I'll take
it along.  I'd like to know more about

<pb n="139"/>
Weintraub's
drug store, too.  I didn't fancy the map of Herr
Weintraub, not at all.  To tell the truth, I had no idea
old man Carlyle would get mixed up in anything as
interesting as this."
</p><p>He found a romantic exhilaration in packing a
handbag.  Pyjamas, hairbrushes, toothbrush,
toothpaste&mdash;("What an ad it would be for the Chinese
Paste people," he thought, "if they knew I was taking a
tube of their stuff on this adventure!") his .22
revolver, a small green box of cartridges of the size
commonly used for squirrel-shooting, a volume of O.
Henry, a safety razor and adjuncts, a pad of writing
paper. . . .  At least six nationally advertised
articles, he said to himself, enumerating his kit.  He
locked his bag, dressed, and went downstairs for lunch.
After lunch he lay down for a rest, as his head was still
very painful. But he was not able to sleep.  The thought
of Titania Chapman's blue eyes and gallant little figure
came between him and slumber. He could not shake off the
conviction that some peril was hanging over her.  Again
and again he looked at his watch, rebuking the lagging
dusk.  At half-past four he set off for the subway.
Half-way down Thirty-third Street a thought struck him.
He returned to his room, got out a pair of opera glasses
from his trunk, and put them in his bag.
</p><p>It was blue twilight when he reached Gissing


<pb n="140"/>
Street.  The block between Wordsworth Avenue and
Hazlitt Street is peculiar in that on one side&mdash;the side
where the Haunted Bookshop stands&mdash;the old brownstone
dwellings have mostly been replaced by small shops of a
bright, lively character.  At the Wordsworth Avenue
corner, where the L swings round in a lofty roaring
curve, stands Weintraub's drug store; below it, on the
western side, a succession of shining windows beacon
through the evening.  Delicatessen shops with their
appetizing medley of cooked and pickled meats, dried
fruits, cheeses, and bright coloured jars of preserves;
small modistes with generously contoured wax busts of
coiffured ladies; lunch rooms with the day's menu typed
and pasted on the outer pane; a French rotisserie where
chickens turn hissing on the spits before a tall oven of
rosy coals; florists, tobacconists, fruit-dealers, and a
Greek candy-shop with a long soda fountain shining with
onyx marble and coloured glass lamps and nickel tanks of
hot chocolate; a stationery shop, now stuffed for the
holiday trade with Christmas cards, toys, calendars, and
those queer little suede-bound volumes of Kipling,
Service, Oscar Wilde, and Omar Khayyam that appear every
year toward Christmas time&mdash;such modest and cheerful
merchandising makes the western pavement of Gissing
Street a jolly place when the

<pb n="141"/>
lights are lit.  All
the shops were decorated for the Christmas trade; the
Christmas issues of the magazines were just out and
brightened the newsstands with their glowing covers. This
section of Brooklyn has a tone and atmosphere peculiarly
French in some parts: one can quite imagine oneself in
some smaller Parisian boulevard frequented by the <hi rend="italic">petit
bourgeois.</hi>  Midway in this engaging and animated block
stands the Haunted Bookshop.  Aubrey could see its
windows lit, and the shelved masses of books within.  He
felt a severe temptation to enter, but a certain
bashfulness added itself to his desire to act in secret.
There was a privy exhilaration in his plan of putting the
bookshop under an unsuspected surveillance, and he had
the emotion of one walking on the frontiers of adventure.
</p><p>So he kept on the opposite side of the street, which
still maintains an unbroken row of quiet brown fronts,
save for the movie theatre at the upper corner, opposite
Weintraub's.  Some of the basements on this side are
occupied now by small tailors, laundries, and
lace-curtain cleaners (lace curtains are still a fetish
in Brooklyn), but most of the houses are still merely
dwellings.  Carrying his bag, Aubrey passed the bright
halo of the movie theatre.  Posters announcing THE RETURN
OF TARZAN showed a kind of third chapter

<pb n="142"/>
of Genesis
scene with an Eve in a sports suit.  ADDED ATTRACTION,
Mr. AND Mrs. SIDNEY DREW, he read.
</p><p>A little way down the block he saw a sign VACANCIES
in a parlour window.  The house was nearly opposite the
bookshop, and he at once mounted the tall steps to the
front door and rang.
</p><p>A fawn-tinted coloured girl, of the kind generally
called "Addie," arrived presently.  "Can I get a room
here?" he asked.  "I don't know, you'd better see Miz'
Schiller," she said, without rancor. Adopting the
customary compromise of untrained domestics, she did not
invite him inside, but departed, leaving the door open to
show that there was no ill will.
</p><p>Aubrey stepped into the hall and closed the door
behind him.  In an immense mirror the pale
cheese-coloured flutter of a gas jet was remotely
reflected.  He noticed the Landseer engraving hung
against wallpaper designed in facsimile of large
rectangles of gray stone, and the usual telephone
memorandum for the usual Mrs. J. F. Smith (who abides in
all lodging houses) tucked into the frame of the mirror.
<hi rend="italic">Will Mrs. Smith please call Stockton 6771,</hi> it said.  A
carpeted stair with a fine old mahogany balustrade rose
into the dimness.  Aubrey, who was thoroughly familiar
with lodgings, knew instinctively that the



<pb n="143"/>

fourth,
ninth, tenth, and fourteenth steps would be creakers.  A
soft musk sweetened the warm, torpid air: he divined that
someone was toasting marshmallows over a gas jet.  He
knew perfectly well that somewhere in the house would be
a placard over a bathtub with the legend:  <hi rend="italic">Please leave
this tub as you would wish to find it.</hi>  Roger Mifflin
would have said, after studying the hall, that someone in
the house was sure to be reading the poems of Rabbi
Tagore; but Aubrey was not so caustic.
</p><p>Mrs. Schiller came up the basement stairs, followed
by a small pug dog.  She was warm and stout, with a
tendency to burst just under the armpits.  She was
friendly.  The pug made merry over Aubrey's ankles.
</p><p>"Stop it, Treasure!" said Mrs. Schiller.
</p><p>"Can I get a room here?" asked Aubrey, with great
politeness.
</p><p>"Third floor front's the only thing I've got," she
said.  "You don't smoke in bed, do you?  The last young
man I had burned holes in three of my sheets&mdash;"
</p><p>Aubrey reassured her.
</p><p>"I don't give meals."
</p><p>"That's all right," said Aubrey.  "Suits me."
</p><p>"Five dollars a week," she said.
</p><p>"May I see it?"


<pb n="144"/>

</p><p>Mrs. Schiller brightened the gas and led the way
upstairs. Treasure skipped up the treads beside her.  The
sight of the six feet ascending together amused Aubrey.
The fourth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth steps creaked,
as he had guessed they would.  On the landing of the
second storey a transom gushed orange light.  Mrs.
Schiller was secretly pleased at not having to augment
the gas on that landing.  Under the transom and behind a
door Aubrey could hear someone having a bath, with a
great sloshing of water.  He wondered irreverently
whether it was Mrs. J. F. Smith.  At any rate (he felt
sure), it was some experienced habitue of lodgings, who
knew that about five thirty in the afternoon is the best
time for a bath&mdash;before cooking supper and the homecoming
ablutions of other tenants have exhausted the hot water
boiler.
</p><p>They climbed one more flight.  The room was small,
occupying half the third-floor frontage.  A large window
opened onto the street, giving a plain view of the
bookshop and the other houses across the way.  A
wash-stand stood modestly inside a large cupboard.  Over
the mantel was the familiar picture&mdash;usually, however,
reserved for the fourth floor back&mdash;of a young lady
having her shoes shined by a ribald small boy.
</p><p>Aubrey was delighted.  "This is fine," he said.
"Here's a week in advance."


<pb n="145"/>

</p><p>Mrs. Schiller was almost disconcerted by the rapidity
of the transaction.  She preferred to solemnize the
reception of a new lodger by a little more talk&mdash;remarks
about the weather, the difficulty of getting "help," the
young women guests who empty tea-leaves down wash-basin
pipes, and so on.  All this sort of gossip, apparently
aimless, has a very real purpose: it enables the
defenceless landlady to size up the stranger who comes to
prey upon her.  She had hardly had a good look at this
gentleman, nor even knew his name, and here he had paid
a week's rent and was already installed.
</p><p>Aubrey divined the cause of her hesitation, and gave
her his business card.
</p><p>"All right, Mr. Gilbert," she said.  "I'll send up
the girl with some clean towels and a latchkey."
</p><p>Aubrey sat down in a rocking chair by the window,
tucked the muslin curtain to one side, and looked out
upon the bright channel of Gissing Street.  He was full
of the exhilaration that springs from any change of
abode, but his romantic satisfaction in being so close to
the adorable Titania was somewhat marred by a sense of
absurdity, which is feared by young men more than wounds
and death. He could see the lighted windows of the
Haunted Bookshop quite plainly, but he could not think of
any adequate excuse for

<pb n="146"/>
going over there.  And
already he realized that to be near Miss Chapman was not
at all the consolation he had expected it would be.  He
had a powerful desire to see her.  He turned off the gas,
lit his pipe, opened the window, and focussed the opera
glasses on the door of the bookshop.  It brought the
place tantalizingly near.  He could see the table at the
front of the shop, Roger's bulletin board under the
electric light, and one or two nondescript customers
gleaning along the shelves.  Then something bounded
violently under the third button of his shirt.  There she
was!  In the bright, prismatic little circle of the
lenses he could see Titania. Heavenly creature, in her
white V-necked blouse and brown skirt, there she was
looking at a book.  He saw her put out one arm and caught
the twinkle of her wrist-watch.  In the startling
familiarity of the magnifying glass he could see her
bright, unconscious face, the merry profile of her cheek
and chin. . . . "The idea of that girl working in a
second-hand bookstore!" he exclaimed.  "It's positive
sacrilege!  Old man Chapman must be crazy."
</p><p>He took out his pyjamas and threw them on the bed;
put his toothbrush and razor on the wash-basin, laid
hairbrushes and O. Henry on the bureau.  Feeling rather
serio-comic he loaded his small revolver and hipped it.
It was six o'clock,

<pb n="147"/>
and he wound his watch.  He was
a little uncertain what to do: whether to keep a vigil at
the window with the opera glasses, or go down in the
street where he could watch the bookshop more nearly.  In
the excitement of the adventure he had forgotten all
about the cut on his scalp, and felt quite chipper.  In
leaving Madison Avenue he had attempted to excuse the
preposterousness of his excursion by thinking that a
quiet week-end in Brooklyn would give him an opportunity
to jot down some tentative ideas for Daintybits
advertising copy which he planned to submit to his chief
on Monday. But now that he was here he felt the
impossibility of attacking any such humdrum task.  How
could he sit down in cold blood to devise any
"attention-compelling" lay-outs for Daintybits Tapioca
and Chapman's Cherished Saratoga Chips, when the
daintiest bit of all was only a few yards away?  For the
first time was made plain to him the amazing power of
young women to interfere with the legitimate commerce of
the world.  He did get so far as to take out his pad of
writing paper and jot down
<lb/>
<lb/>   CHAPMAN'S CHERISHED CHIPS
<lb/></p>
<p>These delicate wafers, crisped by a secret process,
cherish in their unique tang and flavour all the
life-giving nutriment that has made the potato the King
of Vegetables&mdash;
</p>


<pb n="148"/>
<p>But the face of Miss Titania kept
coming between his hand and brain.  Of what avail to
flood the world with Chapman Chips if the girl herself
should come to any harm?  "Was this the face that
launched a thousand chips?" he murmured, and for an
instant wished he had brought <hi rend="italic">The Oxford Book of English
Verse</hi> instead of O. Henry.
</p><p>A tap sounded at his door, and Mrs. Schiller
appeared.  "Telephone for you, Mr. Gilbert," she said.
</p><p>"For <hi rend="italic">me?"</hi> said Aubrey in amazement.  How could it
be for him, he thought, for no one knew he was there.
</p><p>"The party on the wire asked to speak to the
gentleman who arrived about half an hour ago, and I guess
you must be the one he means."
</p><p>"Did he say who he is?" asked Aubrey.
</p><p>"No, sir."
</p><p>For a moment Aubrey thought of refusing to answer the
call.  Then it occurred to him that this would arouse
Mrs. Schiller's suspicions.  He ran down to the
telephone, which stood under the stairs in the front
hall.
</p><p>"Hello," he said.
</p><p>"Is this the new guest?" said a voice&mdash;a deep,
gargling kind of voice.
</p><p>"Yes," said Aubrey.


<pb n="149"/>

</p><p>"Is this the gentleman that arrived half an hour ago
with a handbag?"
</p><p>"Yes; who are you?"
</p><p>"I'm a friend," said the voice; "I wish you well."
</p><p>"How do you do, friend and wellwisher," said Aubrey
genially.
</p><p>"I schust want to warn you that Gissing Street is not
healthy for you," said the voice.
</p><p>"Is that so?" said Aubrey sharply.  "Who are you?"
</p><p>"I am a friend," buzzed the receiver.  There was a
harsh, bass note in the voice that made the diaphragm at
Aubrey's ear vibrate tinnily.  Aubrey grew angry.
</p><p>"Well, Herr Freund," he said, "if you're the
wellwisher I met on the Bridge last night, watch your
step.  I've got your number."
</p><p>There was a pause.  Then the other repeated,
ponderously, "I am a friend.  Gissing Street is not
healthy for you."  There was a click, and he had rung
off.
</p><p>Aubrey was a good deal perplexed.  He returned to his
room, and sat in the dark by the window, smoking a pipe
and thinking, with his eyes on the bookshop.
</p><p>There was no longer any doubt in his mind that
something sinister was afoot.  He reviewed in memory the
events of the past few days.


<pb n="150"/>

</p><p>It was on Monday that a bookloving friend had first
told him of the existence of the shop on Gissing Street.
On Tuesday evening he had gone round to visit the place,
and had stayed to supper with Mr. Mifflin.  On Wednesday
and Thursday he had been busy at the office, and the idea
of an intensive Daintybit campaign in Brooklyn had
occurred to him.  On Friday he had dined with Mr.
Chapman, and had run into a curious string of
coincidences.  He tabulated them:&mdash;
</p>

<list>
<item>(1)The Lost ad in the Times on Friday morning.
</item><item>(2) The chef in the elevator carrying the book that
was supposed to be lost&mdash;he being the same man Aubrey had
seen in the bookshop on Tuesday evening.
</item><item>(3) Seeing the chef again on Gissing Street.
</item><item>(4) The return of the book to the bookshop.
</item><item>(5) Mifflin had said that the book had been stolen
from him. Then why should it be either advertised or
returned?
</item><item>(6) The rebinding of the book.
</item><item>(7) Finding the original cover of the book in
Weintraub's drug store.
</item><item>(8) The affair on the Bridge.
</item><item>(9) The telephone message from "a friend"&mdash;a friend
with an obviously Teutonic voice.
</item>
</list>

<p>He remembered the face of anger and fear displayed by
the Octagon chef when he had spoken to him in the
elevator.  Until this oddly menacing telephone message,
he could have explained the

<pb n="151"/>
attack on the Bridge as
merely a haphazard foot-pad enterprise; but now he was
forced to conclude that it was in some way connected with
his visits to the bookshop.  He felt, too, that in some
unknown way Weintraub's drug store had something to do
with it.  Would he have been attacked if he had not taken
the book cover from the drug store?  He got the cover out
of his bag and looked at it again.  It was of plain blue
cloth, with the title stamped in gold on the back, and at
the bottom the lettering <hi rend="italic">London:  Chapman and Hall.</hi> From
the width of the backstrap it was evident that the book
had been a fat one.  Inside the front cover the figure 60
was written in red pencil&mdash;this he took to be Roger
Mifflin's price mark. Inside the back cover he found the
following notations&mdash;
<lb/>
<lb/>vol.  3&mdash;166, 174, 210, 329, 349 329 ff. cf. W. W.
<lb/>
</p>
<p>These references were written in black ink, in a
small, neat hand.  Below them, in quite a different
script and in pale violet ink, was written

<lb/>153 (3) 1, 2

</p><p>"I suppose these are page numbers," Aubrey thought.
"I think I'd better have a look at that book."


<pb n="152"/>

</p><p>He put the cover in his pocket and went out for a
bite of supper. "It's a puzzle with three sides to it,"
he thought, as he descended the crepitant stairs, "The
Bookshop, the Octagon, and Weintraub's; but that book
seems to be the clue to the whole business."

<hi rend="italic">AUBREY GOES TO THE MOVIES, AND WISHES HE KNEW MORE</hi>
GERMAN</head>


<p>A few doors from the bookshop was a small lunchroom named
after the great city of Milwaukee, one of those pleasant
refectories where the diner buys his food at the counter
and eats it sitting in a flat-armed chair.  Aubrey got a
bowl of soup, a cup of coffee, beef stew, and bran
muffins, and took them to an empty seat by the window.
He ate with one eye on the street.  From his place in the
corner he could command the strip of pavement in front of
Mifflin's shop.  Halfway through the stew he saw Roger
come out onto the pavement and begin to remove the books
from the boxes.
</p><p>After finishing his supper he lit one of his "mild
but they satisfy" cigarettes and sat in the comfortable
warmth of a near-by radiator.  A large black cat lay
sprawled on the next chair.  Up at the service counter
there was a pleasant clank of stout crockery as
occasional customers came in and ordered their victuals.
Aubrey began to feel a



<pb n="154"/>
relaxation swim through
his veins.  Gissing Street was very bright and orderly in
its Saturday evening bustle. Certainly it was grotesque
to imagine melodrama hanging about a second-hand bookshop
in Brooklyn.  The revolver felt absurdly lumpy and
uncomfortable in his hip pocket.  What a different aspect
a little hot supper gives to affairs!  The most resolute
idealist or assassin had better write his poems or plan
his atrocities before the evening meal.  After the
narcosis of that repast the spirit falls into a softer
mood, eager only to be amused.  Even Milton would hardly
have had the inhuman fortitude to sit down to the
manuscript of <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost</hi> right after supper.  Aubrey
began to wonder if his unpleasant suspicions had not been
overdrawn.  He thought how delightful it would be to stop
in at the bookshop and ask Titania to go to the movies
with him.
</p><p>Curious magic of thought!  The idea was still
sparkling in his mind when he saw Titania and Mrs.
Mifflin emerge from the bookshop and pass briskly in
front of the lunchroom.  They were talking and laughing
merrily.  Titania's face, shining with young vitality,
seemed to him more "attention-compelling" than any
ten-point Caslon type-arrangement he had ever seen.  He
admired the layout of her face from the standpoint of his


<pb n="155"/>
cherished technique.  "Just enough `white space,'"
he thought, "to set off her eyes as the `centre of
interest.' Her features aren't this modern bold-face
stuff, set solid," he said to himself, thinking
typographically.  "They're rather French old-style
italic, slightly leaded.  Set on 22-point body, I guess.
Old man Chapman's a pretty good typefounder, you have to
hand it to him."
</p><p>He smiled at this conceit, seized hat and coat, and
dashed out of the lunchroom.
</p><p>Mrs. Mifflin and Titania had halted a few yards up
the street, and were looking at some pert little bonnets
in a window.  Aubrey hurried across the street, ran up to
the next corner, recrossed, and walked down the eastern
pavement.  In this way he would meet them as though he
were coming from the subway.  He felt rather more excited
than King Albert re-entering Brussels.  He saw them
coming, chattering together in the delightful fashion of
women out on a spree.  Helen seemed much younger in the
company of her companion. "A lining of pussy-willow
taffeta and an embroidered slip-on," she was saying.
</p><p>Aubrey steered onto them with an admirable gesture of
surprise.
</p><p>"Well, I never!" said Mrs. Mifflin.  "Here's Mr.
Gilbert.  Were you coming to see Roger?"

<pb n="156"/>
she added,
rather enjoying the young man's predicament.
</p><p>Titania shook hands cordially.  Aubrey, searching the
old-style italics with the desperate intensity of a
proofreader, saw no evidence of chagrin at seeing him
again so soon.
</p><p>"Why," he said rather lamely, "I was coming to see
you all.  I&mdash;I wondered how you were getting along."
</p><p>Mrs. Mifflin had pity on him.  "We've left Mr.
Mifflin to look after the shop," she said.  "He's busy
with some of his old crony customers.  Why don't you come
with us to the movies?"
</p><p>"Yes, do," said Titania.  "It's Mr. and Mrs. Sidney
Drew, you know how adorable they are!"
</p><p>No one needs to be told how quickly Aubrey assented.
Pleasure coincided with duty in that the outer wing of
the party placed him next to Titania.
</p><p>"Well, how do you like bookselling?" he asked.
</p><p>"Oh, it's the greatest fun!" she cried.  "But it'll
take me ever and ever so long to learn about all the
books.  People ask such questions!  A woman came in this
afternoon looking for a copy of <hi rend="italic">Blase Tales.</hi>  How was I
to know she wanted The <hi rend="italic">Blazed Trail?"</hi>
</p><p>"You'll get used to that," said Mrs. Mifflin.


<pb n="157"/>
"Just a minute, people, I want to stop in at the
drug store."
</p><p>They went into Weintraub's pharmacy.  Entranced as he
was by the proximity of Miss Chapman, Aubrey noticed that
the druggist eyed him rather queerly.  And being of a
noticing habit, he also observed that when Weintraub had
occasion to write out a label for a box of powdered alum
Mrs. Mifflin was buying, he did so with a pale violet
ink.
</p><p>At the glass sentry-box in front of the theatre
Aubrey insisted on buying the tickets.
</p><p>"We came out right after supper," said Titania as
they entered, "so as to get in before the crowd."
</p><p>It is not so easy, however, to get ahead of Brooklyn
movie fans. They had to stand for several minutes in a
packed lobby while a stern young man held the waiting
crowd in check with a velvet rope. Aubrey sustained
delightful spasms of the protective instinct in trying to
shelter Titania from buffets and pushings.  Unknown to
her, his arm extended behind her like an iron rod to
absorb the onward impulses of the eager throng.  A
rustling groan ran through these enthusiasts as they saw
the preliminary footage of the great Tarzan flash onto
the screen, and realized they were missing something.  At
last, however, the trio got through the barrier and found
three seats

<pb n="158"/>
well in front, at one side.  From this
angle the flying pictures were strangely distorted, but
Aubrey did not mind.
</p><p>"Isn't it lucky I got here when I did," whispered
Titania.  "Mr. Mifflin has just had a telephone call from
Philadelphia asking him to go over on Monday to make an
estimate on a library that's going to be sold so I'll be
able to look after the shop for him while he's gone."
</p><p>"Is that so?" said Aubrey.  "Well, now, I've got to
be in Brooklyn on Monday, on business.  Maybe Mrs.
Mifflin would let me come in and buy some books from
you."
</p><p>"Customers always welcome," said Mrs. Mifflin.
</p><p>"I've taken a fancy to that Cromwell book," said
Aubrey.  "What do you suppose Mr. Mifflin would sell it
for?"
</p><p>"I think that book must be valuable," said Titania.
"Somebody came in this afternoon and wanted to buy it,
but Mr. Mifflin wouldn't part with it.  He says it's one
of his favourites.  Gracious, what a weird film this is!"
</p><p>The fantastic absurdities of Tarzan proceeded on the
screen, tearing celluloid passions to tatters, but Aubrey
found the strong man of the jungle coming almost too
close to his own imperious instincts.  Was not he,
too&mdash;he thought naively&mdash;a poor Tarzan of the advertising
jungle, lost among

<pb n="159"/>
the elephants and alligators of
commerce, and sighing for this dainty and unattainable
vision of girlhood that had burst upon his burning gaze!
He stole a perilous side-glance at her profile, and saw
the racing flicker of the screen reflected in tiny
spangles of light that danced in her eyes. He was even so
unknowing as to imagine that she was not aware of his
contemplation.  And then the lights went up.
</p><p>"What nonsense, wasn't it?" said Titania.  "I'm so
glad it's over! I was quite afraid one of those elephants
would walk off the screen and tread on us."
</p><p>"I never can understand," said Helen, "why they don't
film some of the really good books&mdash;think of Frank
Stockton's stuff, how delightful that would be.  Can't
you imagine Mr. and Mrs. Drew playing in <hi rend="italic">Rudder Grange!"</hi>
</p><p>"Thank goodness!" said Titania.  "Since I entered the
book business, that's the first time anybody's mentioned
a book that I've read.  Yes&mdash;do you remember when Pomona
and Jonas visit an insane asylum on their honeymoon?  Do
you know, you and Mr. Mifflin remind me a little of Mr.
and Mrs. Drew."
</p><p>Helen and Aubrey chuckled at this innocent
correlation of ideas. Then the organ began to play "O How
I Hate To Get Up in the Morning"

<pb n="160"/>
and the
ever-delightful Mr. and Mrs. Drew appeared on the screen
in one of their domestic comedies.  Lovers of the movies
may well date a new screen era from the day those
whimsical pantomimers set their wholesome and humane
talent at the service of the arc light and the lens.
Aubrey felt a serene and intimate pleasure in watching
them from a seat beside Titania.  He knew that the
breakfast table scene shadowed before them was only a
makeshift section of lath propped up in some barnlike
motion picture studio; yet his rocketing fancy imagined
it as some arcadian suburb where he and Titania, by a
jugglery of benign fate, were bungalowed together.  Young
men have a pioneering imagination: it is doubtful whether
any young Orlando ever found himself side by side with
Rosalind without dreaming himself wedded to her.  If men
die a thousand deaths before this mortal coil is
shuffled, even so surely do youths contract a thousand
marriages before they go to the City Hall for a license.
</p><p>Aubrey remembered the opera glasses, which were still
in his pocket, and brought them out.  The trio amused
themselves by watching Sidney Drew's face through the
magnifying lenses.  They were disappointed in the result,
however, as the pictures, when so enlarged, revealed all
the cobweb of fine cracks on the film.  Mr. Drew's nose,


<pb n="161"/>
the most amusing feature known to the movies, lost
its quaintness when so augmented.
</p><p>"Why," cried Titania, "it makes his lovely nose look
like the map of Florida."
</p><p>"How on earth did you happen to have these in your
pocket?" asked Mrs. Mifflin, returning the glasses.
</p><p>Aubrey was hard pressed for a prompt and reasonable
fib, but advertising men are resourceful.
</p><p>"Oh," he said, "I sometimes carry them with me at
night to study the advertising sky-signs.  I'm a little
short sighted.  You see, it's part of my business to
study the technique of the electric signs."
</p><p>After some current event pictures the programme
prepared to repeat itself, and they went out.  "Will you
come in and have some cocoa with us?" said Helen as they
reached the door of the bookshop. Aubrey was eager enough
to accept, but feared to overplay his hand. "I'm sorry,"
he said, "but I think I'd better not.  I've got some work
to do to-night.  Perhaps I can drop in on Monday when Mr.
Mifflin's away, and put coal on the furnace for you, or
something of that sort?"
</p><p>Mrs. Mifflin laughed.  "Surely!" she said.  "You're
welcome any time."  The door closed behind them, and
Aubrey fell into a profound melancholy.  Deprived of the
heavenly rhetoric of her eye, Gissing Street seemed flat
and dull.


<pb n="162"/>

</p><p>It was still early&mdash;not quite ten o'clock&mdash;and it
occurred to Aubrey that if he was going to patrol the
neighbourhood he had better fix its details in his head.
Hazlitt, the next street below the bookshop, proved to be
a quiet little byway, cheerfully lit with modest
dwellings.  A few paces down Hazlitt Street a narrow
cobbled alley ran through to Wordsworth Avenue, passing
between the back yards of Gissing Street and Whittier
Street.  The alley was totally dark, but by counting off
the correct number of houses Aubrey identified the rear
entrance of the bookshop.  He tried the yard gate
cautiously, and found it unlocked.  Glancing in he could
see a light in the kitchen window and assumed that the
cocoa was being brewed.  Then a window glowed upstairs,
and he was thrilled to see Titania shining in the
lamplight.  She moved to the window and pulled down the
blind.  For a moment he saw her head and shoulders
silhouetted against the curtain; then the light went out.
</p><p>Aubrey stood briefly in sentimental thought.  If he
only had a couple of blankets, he mused, he could camp
out here in Roger's back yard all night.  Surely no harm
could come to the girl while he kept watch beneath her
casement!  The idea was just fantastic enough to appeal
to him.  Then, as he stood in the open gateway, he heard
distant

<pb n="163"/>
footfalls coming down the alley, and a
grumble of voices.  Perhaps two policemen on their
rounds, he thought: it would be awkward to be surprised
skulking about back doors at this time of night.  He
slipped inside the gate and closed it gently behind him,
taking the precaution to slip the bolt.
</p><p>The footsteps came nearer, stumbling down the uneven
cobbles in the darkness.  He stood still against the back
fence.  To his amazement the men halted outside Mifflin's
gate, and he heard the latch quietly lifted.
</p><p>"It's no use," said a voice&mdash;"the gate is locked.  We
must find some other way, my friend."
</p><p>Aubrey tingled to hear the rolling, throaty "r" in
the last word. There was no mistaking&mdash;this was the voice
of his "friend and wellwisher" over the telephone.
</p><p>The other said something in German in a hoarse
whisper.  Having studied that language in college, Aubrey
caught only two words&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Thur</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Schlussel,</hi>
which he knew meant <hi rend="italic">door</hi> and <hi rend="italic">key.</hi>
</p><p>"Very well," said the first voice.  "That will be all
right, but we must act to-night.  The damned thing must
be finished to-morrow. Your idiotic stupidity&mdash;"
</p><p>Again followed some gargling in German, in a rapid
undertone too fluent for Aubrey's grasp.  The latch of
the alley gate clicked once more, and

<pb n="164"/>
his hand was
on his revolver; but in a moment the two had passed on
down the alley.
</p><p>The young advertising agent stood against the fence
in silent horror, his heart bumping heavily.  His hands
were clammy, his feet seemed to have grown larger and
taken root.  What damnable complot was this?  A sultry
wave of anger passed over him.  This bland, slick,
talkative bookseller, was he arranging some blackmailing
scheme to kidnap the girl and wring blood-money out of
her father? And in league with Germans, too, the
scoundrel!  What an asinine thing for old Chapman to send
an unprotected girl over here into the wilds of Brooklyn
. . .  and in the meantime, what was he to do?  Patrol
the back yard all night?  No, the friend and wellwisher
had said "We must find some other way."  Besides, Aubrey
remembered something having been said about the old
terrier sleeping in the kitchen.  He felt sure Bock would
not let any German in at night without raising the roof.
Probably the best way would be to watch the front of the
shop.  In miserable perplexity he waited several minutes
until the two Germans would be well out of earshot.  Then
he unbolted the gate and stole up the alley on tiptoe, in
the opposite direction.  It led into Wordsworth Avenue
just behind Weintraub's drug store, over the rear of
which hung the great

<pb n="165"/>
girders and trestles of the "L"
station, a kind of Swiss chalet straddling the street on
stilts.  He thought it prudent to make a detour, so he
turned east on Wordsworth Avenue until he reached
Whittier Street, then sauntered easily down Whittier for
a block, spying sharply for evidences of pursuit.
Brooklyn was putting out its lights for the night, and
all was quiet.  He turned into Hazlitt Street and so back
onto Gissing, noticing now that the Haunted Bookshop
lights were off.  It was nearly eleven o'clock: the last
audience was filing out of the movie theatre, where two
workmen were already perched on ladders taking down the
Tarzan electric light sign, to substitute the illuminated
lettering for the next feature.
</p><p>After some debate he decided that the best thing to
do was to return to his room at Mrs. Schiller's, from
which he could keep a sharp watch on the front door of
the bookshop.  By good fortune there was a lamp post
almost directly in front of Mifflin's house, which cast
plenty of light on the little sunken area before the
door.  With his opera glasses he could see from his
bedroom whatever went on.  As he crossed the street he
cast his eyes upward at the facade of Mrs. Schiller's
house.  Two windows in the fourth storey were lit, and
the gas burned minutely in the downstairs hall, elsewhere
all was dark.  And then, as he glanced

<pb n="166"/>
at the window
of his own chamber, where the curtain was still tucked
back behind the pane, he noticed a curious thing.  A
small point of rosy light glowed, faded, and glowed again
by the window.  Someone was smoking a cigar in his room.
</p><p>Aubrey continued walking in even stride, as though he
had seen nothing.  Returning down the street, on the
opposite side, he verified his first glance.  The light
was still there, and he judged himself not far out in
assuming the smoker to be the friend and wellwisher or
one of his gang.  He had suspected the other man in the
alley of being Weintraub, but he could not be sure.  A
cautious glance through the window of the drug store
revealed Weintraub at his prescription counter.  Aubrey
determined to get even with the guttural gentleman who
was waiting for him, certainly with no affectionate
intent.  He thanked the good fortune that had led him to
stick the book cover in his overcoat pocket when leaving
Mrs. Schiller's.  Evidently, for reasons unknown, someone
was very anxious to get hold of it.
</p><p>An idea occurred to him as he passed the little
florist's shop, which was just closing.  He entered and
bought a dozen white carnations, and then, as if by an
afterthought, asked "Have you any wire?"
</p><p>The florist produced a spool of the slender,


<pb n="167"/>
tough wire that is sometimes used to nip the buds of
expensive roses, to prevent them from blossoming too
quickly.
</p><p>"Let me have about eight feet," said Aubrey.  "I need
some to-night and I guess the hardware stores are all
closed."
</p><p>With this he returned to Mrs. Schiller's, picking his
way carefully and close to the houses so as to be out of
sight from the upstairs windows.  He climbed the steps
and unlatched the door with bated breath.  It was
half-past eleven, and he wondered how long he would have
to wait for the wellwisher to descend.
</p><p>He could not help chuckling as he made his
preparations, remembering an occasion at college somewhat
similar in setting though far less serious in purpose.
First he took off his shoes, laying them carefully to one
side where he could find them again in a hurry.  Then,
choosing a banister about six feet from the bottom of the
stairs he attached one end of the wire tightly to its
base and spread the slack in a large loop over two of the
stair treads. The remaining end of the wire he passed out
through the banisters, twisting it into a small loop so
that he could pull it easily.  Then he turned out the
hall gas and sat down in the dark to wait events.
</p><p>He sat for a long time, in some nervousness lest


<pb n="168"/>
the pug dog might come prowling and find him.  He
was startled by a lady in a dressing gown&mdash;perhaps Mrs.
J. F. Smith&mdash;who emerged from a ground-floor room passed
very close to him in the dark, and muttered upstairs.  He
twitched his noose out of the way just in time.
Presently, however, his patience was rewarded.  He heard
a door squeak above, and then the groaning of the
staircase as someone descended slowly.  He relaid his
trap and waited, smiling to himself.  A clock somewhere
in the house was chiming twelve as the man came groping
down the last flight, feeling his way in the dark.
Aubrey heard him swearing under his breath.
</p><p>At the precise moment, when both his victim's feet
were within the loop, Aubrey gave the wire a gigantic
tug.  The man fell like a safe, crashing against the
banisters and landing in a sprawl on the floor.  It was
a terrific fall, and shook the house.  He lay there
groaning and cursing.
</p><p>Barely retaining his laughter, Aubrey struck a match
and held it over the sprawling figure.  The man lay with
his face twisted against one out-spread arm, but the
beard was unmistakable.  It was the assistant chef again,
and he seemed partly unconscious.  "Burnt hair is a grand
restorative," said Aubrey to himself, and applied the
match to the bush of beard.  He singed off a couple


<pb n="169"/>
of inches of it with intense delight, and laid his
carnations on the head of the stricken one.  Then,
hearing stirrings in the basement, he gathered up his
wire and shoes and fled upstairs.  He gained his room
roaring with inward mirth, but entered cautiously,
fearing some trap.  Save for a strong tincture of cigar
smoke, everything seemed correct.  Listening at his door
he heard Mrs. Schiller exclaiming shrilly in the hall,
assisted by yappings from the pug. Doors upstairs were
opened, and questions were called out.  He heard guttural
groans from the bearded one, mingled with oaths and some
angry remark about having fallen downstairs.  The pug,
frenzied with excitement, yelled insanely.  A female
voice&mdash;possibly Mrs. J. F. Smith&mdash;cried out "What's that
smell of burning?" Someone else said, "They're burning
feathers under his nose to bring him to."
</p><p>"Yes, Hun's feathers," chuckled Aubrey to himself.
He locked his door, and sat down by the window with his
opera glasses.

<head>CHAPTER IX
<lb/> AGAIN THE NARRATIVE IS RETARDED</head>

<div2 type="section" id="d18">

<p>Roger had spent a quiet evening in the bookshop.  Sitting
at his desk under a fog of tobacco, he had honestly
intended to do some writing on the twelfth chapter of his
great work on bookselling. This chapter was to be an
(alas, entirely conjectural) "Address Delivered by a
Bookseller on Being Conferred the Honorary Degree of
Doctor of Letters by a Leading University," and it
presented so many alluring possibilities that Roger's
mind always wandered from the paper into entranced
visions of his imagined scene.  He loved to build up in
fancy the flattering details of that fine ceremony when
bookselling would at last be properly recognized as one
of the learned professions.  He could see the great
auditorium, filled with cultivated people:  men with
Emersonian profiles, ladies whispering behind their
fluttering programmes.  He could see the academic beadle,
proctor, dean (or whatever he is, Roger was a little
doubtful) pronouncing the august words of
presentation&mdash;


<pb n="171"/>
</p><p>A man who, in season and out of season, forgetting
private gain for public weal, has laboured with
Promethean and sacrificial ardour to instil the love of
reasonable letters into countless thousands; to whom, and
to whose colleagues, amid the perishable caducity of
human affairs, is largely due the pullulation of literary
taste; in honouring whom we seek to honour the noble and
self-effacing profession of which he is so representative
a member&mdash;


</p><p>Then he could see the modest bookseller, somewhat clammy
in his extremities and lost within his academic robe and
hood, nervously fidgeting his mortar-board, haled forward
by ushers, and tottering rubescent before the chancellor,
provost, president (or whoever it might be) who hands out
the diploma.  Then (in Roger's vision) he could see the
garlanded bibliopole turning to the expectant audience,
giving his trailing gown a deft rearward kick as the
ladies do on the stage, and uttering, without hesitation
or embarrassment, with due interpolation of graceful
pleasantry, that learned and unlaboured discourse on the
delights of bookishness that he had often dreamed of.
Then he could see the ensuing reception: the
distinguished savants crowding round; the plates of
macaroons, the cups of untasted tea; the ladies
twittering, "Now there's something I want to ask you&mdash;why
are there so many statues to generals, admirals, parsons,
doctors, statesmen, scientists,

<pb n="172"/>
artists, and authors, but no statues to booksellers?"
</p><p>Contemplation of this glittering scene always lured
Roger into fantastic dreams.  Ever since he had travelled
country roads, some years before, selling books from a
van drawn by a fat white horse, he had nourished a secret
hope of some day founding a Parnassus on Wheels
Corporation which would own a fleet of these vans and
send them out into the rural byways where bookstores are
unknown.  He loved to imagine a great map of New York
State, with the daily location of each travelling
Parnassus marked by a coloured pin.  He dreamed of
himself, sitting in some vast central warehouse of
second-hand books, poring over his map like a military
chief of staff and forwarding cases of literary
ammunition to various bases where his vans would
re-stock.  His idea was that his travelling salesmen
could be recruited largely from college professors,
parsons, and newspaper men, who were weary of their
thankless tasks, and would welcome an opportunity to get
out on the road. One of his hopes was that he might
interest Mr. Chapman in this superb scheme, and he had a
vision of the day when the shares of the Parnassus on
Wheels Corporation would pay a handsome dividend and be
much sought after by serious investors.


<pb n="173"/>

</p><p>These thoughts turned his mind toward his
brother-in-law Andrew McGill, the author of several
engaging books on the joys of country living, who dwells
at the Sabine Farm in the green elbow of a Connecticut
valley.  The original Parnassus, a quaint old blue wagon
in which Roger had lived and journeyed and sold books
over several thousand miles of country roads in the days
before his marriage, was now housed in Andrew's barn.
Peg, his fat white horse, had lodging there also.  It
occurred to Roger that he owed Andrew a letter, and
putting aside his notes for the bookseller's collegiate
oration, he began to write:

</addrLine></address>

<salute>MY DEAR ANDREW:</salute>
</opener>

<p>It is scandalous not to have thanked you sooner for
the annual cask of cider, which has given us even more
than the customary pleasure. This has been an autumn when
I have been hard put to it to keep up with my own
thoughts, and I've written no letters at all.  Like
everyone else I am thinking constantly of this new peace
that has marvellously come upon us.  I trust we may have
statesmen who will be able to turn it to the benefit


<pb n="174"/>
of humanity.  I wish there could be an international
peace conference of booksellers, for (you will smile at
this) my own conviction is that the future happiness of
the world depends in no small measure on them and on the
librarians.  I wonder what a German bookseller is like?
</p><p>I've been reading <hi rend="italic">The Education of Henry Adams</hi>
and wish he might have lived long enough to give us his
thoughts on the War.  I fear it would have bowled him
over.  He thought that this is not a world "that
sensitive and timid natures can regard without a
shudder."  What would he have said of the four-year
shambles we have watched with sickened hearts?
</p><p>You remember my favourite poem&mdash;old George Herbert's
Church Porch&mdash;where he says&mdash;
</p>
<lg type="poem">
<l>By all means use sometimes to be alone;
</l><l>Salute thyself; see what they soul doth wear;
</l><l>Dare to look in thy chest, for 'tis thine own,
</l><l>And tumble up and down what thou find'st there&mdash;
</l>
</lg>
 <p>
Well, I've been tumbling my thoughts up and down a good
deal. Melancholy, I suppose, is the curse of the thinking
classes; but I confess my soul wears a great uneasiness
these days!  The sudden and amazing turnover in human
affairs, dramatic beyond anything in history, already
seems to be taken as a matter of course.  My great


<pb n="175"/>
fear is that humanity will forget the atrocious
sufferings of the war, which have never been told.  I am
hoping and praying that men like Philip Gibbs may tell us
what they really saw.
</p><p>You will not agree with me on what I am about to say,
for I know you as a stubborn Republican; but I thank
fortune that Wilson is going to the Peace Conference.
I've been mulling over one of my favourite books&mdash;it lies
beside me as I write&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Cromwell's Letters and Speeches,</hi>
edited by Carlyle, with what Carlyle amusingly calls
"Elucidations."  (Carlyle is not very good at
"elucidating" anything!) I have heard somewhere or other
that this is one of Wilson's favourite books, and indeed,
there is much of the Cromwell in him.  With what a grim,
covenanting zeal he took up the sword when at last it was
forced into his hand!  And I have been thinking that what
he will say to the Peace Conference will smack strongly
of what old Oliver used to say to Parliament in 1657 and
1658&mdash;"If we will have Peace without a worm in it, lay we
foundations of Justice and Righteousness."  What makes
Wilson so irritating to the unthoughtful is that he
operates exclusively upon reason, not upon passion.  He
contradicts Kipling's famous lines, which apply to most
men&mdash;</p>

<p>Very rarely will he squarely push the logic of a fact
To its ultimate conclusion in unmitigated act.
</p>


<pb n="176"/>

<p>In this instance, I think, Reason is going to win.
I feel the whole current of the world setting in that
direction.
</p><p>It's quaint to think of old Woodrow, a kind of
Cromwell-Wordsworth, going over to do his bit among the
diplomatic shell-craters.  What I'm waiting for is the
day when he'll get back into private life and write a
book about it.  There's a job, if you like, for a man who
might reasonably be supposed to be pretty tired in body
and soul!  When that book comes out I'll spend the rest
of my life in selling it.  I ask nothing better!
Speaking of Wordsworth, I've often wondered whether
Woodrow hasn't got some poems concealed somewhere among
his papers!  I've always imagined that he may have
written poems on the sly.  And by the way, you needn't
make fun of me for being so devoted to George Herbert.
Do you realize that two of the most familiar quotations
in our language come from his pen, viz.:
</p>

<p> Wouldst thou both eat thy cake, and have it?

<lb/>and

Dare to be true: nothing can need a ly;
A fault, which needs it most, grows two thereby.
</p>

<p>Forgive this tedious sermon!  My mind has been so
tumbled up and down this autumn that I

<pb n="177"/>
am in a queer
state of mingled melancholy and exaltation.  You know how
much I live in and for books.  Well, I have a curious
feeling, a kind of premonition that there are great books
coming out of this welter of human hopes and anguishes,
perhaps A book in which the tempest-shaken soul of the
race will speak out as it never has before.  The Bible,
you know, is rather a disappointment: it has never done
for humanity what it should have done.  I wonder why?
Walt Whitman is going to do a great deal, but he is not
quite what I mean.  There is something coming&mdash;I don't
know just what!  I thank God I am a bookseller,
trafficking in the dreams and beauties and curiosities of
humanity rather than some mere huckster of merchandise.
But how helpless we all are when we try to tell what goes
on within us!  I found this in one of Lafcadio Hearn's
letters the other day&mdash;I marked the passage for you&mdash;
</p>


<p>Baudelaire has a touching poem about an albatross,
which you would like&mdash;describing the poet's soul superb
in its own free azure&mdash;but helpless, insulted, ugly,
clumsy when striving to walk on common earth&mdash;or rather,
on a deck, where sailors torment it with tobacco pipes,
etc.</p>


<p>You can imagine what evenings I have here among my
shelves, now the long dark nights are come!  Of course
until ten o'clock, when I shut

<pb n="178"/>

up shop, I am
constantly interrupted&mdash;as I have been during this
letter, once to sell a copy of <hi rend="italic">Helen's Babies</hi> and once to
sell <hi rend="italic">The Ballad of Reading Gaol,</hi> so you can see how
varied are my clients' tastes!  But later on, after we
have had our evening cocoa and Helen has gone to bed, I
prowl about the place, dipping into this and that,
fuddling myself with speculation.  How clear and bright
the stream of the mind flows in those late hours, after
all the sediment and floating trash of the day has
drained off! Sometimes I seem to coast the very shore of
Beauty or Truth, and hear the surf breaking on those
shining sands.  Then some offshore wind of weariness or
prejudice bears me away again.  Have you ever come across
Andreyev's <hi rend="italic">Confessions of a Little Man During Great Days?</hi>
One of the honest books of the War.  The Little Man ends
his confession thus&mdash;
</p>

<p>My anger has left me, my sadness returned, and once
more the tears flow.  Whom can I curse, whom can I judge,
when we are all alike unfortunate?  Suffering is
universal; hands are outstretched to each other, and when
they touch . . . the great solution will come.  My heart
is aglow, and I stretch out my hand and cry, "Come, let
us join hands!  I love you, I love you!"
</p>

<p>And of course, as soon as one puts one's self in that
frame of mind someone comes along and picks

<pb n="179"/>
your pocket. . . .  I suppose we must teach ourselves to be
too proud to mind having our pockets picked!
</p><p>Did it ever occur to you that the world is really
governed by <hi rend="italic">books?</hi> The course of this country in the
War, for instance, has been largely determined by the
books Wilson has read since he first began to think!  If
we could have a list of the principal books he has read
since the War began, how interesting it would be.
</p><p>Here's something I'm just copying out to put up on my
bulletin board for my customers to ponder.  It was
written by Charles Sorley, a young Englishman who was
killed in France in 1915.  He was only twenty years old&mdash;
 </p>
<lg type="poem">
<head>TO GERMANY</head>

<l>You are blind like us.  Your hurt no man designed,
</l><l>And no man claimed the conquest of your land.
</l><l>But gropers both through fields of thought confined
</l><l>We stumble and we do not understand.
</l><l>You only saw your future bigly planned,
</l><l>And we, the tapering paths of our own mind,
</l><l>And in each other's dearest ways we stand,
</l><l>And hiss and hate.  And the blind fight the blind.
</l>
</lg>
<lg type="poem">
<l>When it is peace, then we may view again
</l><l>With new-won eyes each other's truer form
</l><l>And wonder.  Grown more loving-kind and warm
</l>
</lg>

<pb n="180"/>

<lg type="poem">
<l>We'll grasp firm hands and laugh at the old pain,
</l><l>When it is peace.  But until peace, the storm
</l><l>The darkness and the thunder and the rain.
</l>
</lg>
<p>
Isn't that noble?  You see what I am dumbly groping
for&mdash;some way of thinking about the War that will make it
seem (to future ages) a purification for humanity rather
than a mere blackness of stinking cinders and tortured
flesh and men shot to ribbons in marshes of blood and
sewage.  Out of such unspeakable desolation men <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
rise to some new conception of national neighbourhood. I
hear so much apprehension that Germany won't be punished
sufficiently for her crime.  But how can any punishment
be devised or imposed for such a huge panorama of sorrow?
I think she has already punished herself horribly, and
will continue to do so.  My prayer is that what we have
gone through will startle the world into some new
realization of the sanctity of life&mdash;all life, animal as
well as human.  Don't you find that a visit to a zoo can
humble and astound you with all that amazing and
grotesque variety of living energy?
</p><p>What is it that we find in every form of life?
Desire of some sort&mdash;some unexplained motive power that
impels even the smallest insect on its queer travels.
You must have watched some infinitesimal red spider on a
fence rail, bustling along&mdash;why and whither?  Who knows?
And

<pb n="181"/>
when you come to man, what a chaos of hungers
and impulses keep thrusting him through his cycle of
quaint tasks!  And in every human heart you find some
sorrow, some frustration, some lurking pang.  I often
think of Lafcadio Hearn's story of his Japanese cook.
Hearn was talking of the Japanese habit of not showing
their emotions on their faces.  His cook was a smiling,
healthy, agreeable-looking young fellow whose face was
always cheerful.  Then one day, by chance, Hearn happened
to look through a hole in the wall and saw his cook
alone.  His face was not the same face.  It was thin and
drawn and showed strange lines worn by old hardships or
sufferings.  Hearn thought to himself, "He will look just
like that when he is dead."  He went into the kitchen to
see him, and instantly the cook was all changed, young
and happy again.  Never again did Hearn see that face of
trouble; but he knew the man wore it when he was alone.
</p><p>Don't you think there is a kind of parable there for
the race as a whole?  Have you ever met a man without
wondering what shining sorrows he hides from the world,
what contrast between vision and accomplishment torments
him?  Behind every smiling mask is there not some cryptic
grimace of pain?  Henry Adams puts it tersely.  He says
the human mind appears suddenly and inexplicably

<pb n="182"/>
out of some unknown and unimaginable void.  It passes half
its known life in the mental chaos of sleep.  Even when
awake it is a victim of its own ill-adjustment, of
disease, of age, of external suggestion, of nature's
compulsions; it doubts its own sensations and trusts only
in instruments and averages.  After sixty years or so of
growing astonishment the mind wakes to find itself
looking blankly into the void of death.  And, as Adams
says, that it should profess itself pleased by this
performance is all that the highest rules of good
breeding can ask.  That the mind should actually be
satisfied would prove that it exists only as idiocy!
</p><p>I hope that you will write to tell me along what
curves your mind is moving.  For my own part I feel that
we are on the verge of amazing things.  Long ago I fell
back on books as the only permanent consolers.  They are
the one stainless and unimpeachable achievement of the
human race.  It saddens me to think that I shall have to
die with thousands of books unread that would have given
me noble and unblemished happiness.  I will tell you a
secret.  I have never read King Lear, and have purposely
refrained from doing so. If I were ever very ill I would
only need to say to myself "You can't die yet, you
haven't read Lear."  That would bring me round, I know it
would.


<pb n="183"/>

</p><p>You see, books are the answer to all our
perplexities!  Henry Adams grinds his teeth at his
inability to understand the universe.  The best he can do
is to suggest a "law of acceleration," which seems to
mean that Nature is hustling man along at an
ever-increasing rate so that he will either solve all her
problems or else die of fever in the effort.  But Adams'
candid portrait of a mind grappling helplessly with its
riddles is so triumphantly delightful that one forgets
the futility of the struggle in the accuracy of the
picture.  Man is unconquerable because he can make even
his helplessness so entertaining.  His motto seems to be
"Even though He slay me, yet will I make fun of Him!"
</p><p>Yes, books are man's supreme triumph, for they gather
up and transmit all other triumphs.  As Walter de la Mare
writes, "How uncomprehendingly must an angel from heaven
smile on a poor human sitting engrossed in a romance:
angled upon his hams, motionless in his chair, spectacles
on nose, his two feet as close together as the flukes of
a merman's tail, only his strange eyes stirring in his
time-worn face."
</p><p>Well, I've been scribbling away all this time and
haven't given you any news whatever.  Helen came back the
other day from a visit to Boston where she enjoyed
herself greatly.  To-night she

<pb n="184"/>
has gone out to the
movies with a young protegee of ours, Miss Titania
Chapman, an engaging damsel whom we have taken in as an
apprentice bookseller.  It's a quaint idea, done at the
request of her father, Mr. Chapman, the proprietor of
Chapman's Daintybits which you see advertised everywhere.
He is a great booklover, and is very eager to have the
zeal transmitted to his daughter.  So you can imagine my
glee to have a neophyte of my own to preach books at!
Also it will enable me to get away from the shop a little
more.  I had a telephone call from Philadelphia this
afternoon asking me to go over there on Monday evening to
make an estimate of the value of a private collection
that is to be sold.  I was rather flattered because I
can't imagine how they got hold of my name.
</p><p>Forgive this long, incoherent scrawl.  How did you
like Erewhon? It's pretty near closing time and I must
say grace over the day's accounts.

<hi rend="italic">ROGER RAIDS THE ICE-BOX</hi></head>


<p>Roger had just put Carlyle's <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> back in its
proper
place in the History alcove when Helen and Titania
returned from the movies. Bock, who had been dozing under
his master's chair, rose politely and wagged a
deferential tail.
</p><p>"I do think Bock has the darlingest manners," said
Titania.
</p><p>"Yes," said Helen, "it's really a marvel that his
wagging muscles aren't all worn out, he has abused them
so."
</p><p>"Well," said Roger, "did you have a good time?"
</p><p>"An adorable time!" cried Titania, with a face and
voice so sparkling that two musty habitues of the shop
popped their heads out of the alcoves marked ESSAYS and
THEOLOGY and peered in amazement.  One of these even went
so far as to purchase the copy of Leigh Hunt's <hi rend="italic">Wishing
Cap Papers</hi> he had been munching through, in order to have
an excuse to approach the group and


<pb n="186"/>
satisfy his bewildered eyes.  When Miss Chapman took the book and

wrapped it up for him, his astonishment was made
complete.
</p><p>Unconscious that she was actually creating business,
Titania resumed.
</p><p>"We met your friend Mr. Gilbert on the street," she
said, "and he went to the movies with us.  He says he's
coming in on Monday to fix the furnace while you're
away."
</p><p>"Well," said Roger, "these advertising agencies are
certainly enterprising, aren't they?  Think of sending a
man over to attend to my furnace, just on the slim chance
of getting my advertising account."
</p><p>"Did you have a quiet evening?" said Helen.
</p><p>"I spent most of the time writing to Andrew," said
Roger.  "One amusing thing happened, though.  I actually
sold that copy of <hi rend="italic">Philip Dru."</hi>
</p><p>"No!" cried Helen.
</p><p>"A fact," said Roger.  "A man was looking at it, and
I told him it was supposed to be written by Colonel
House.  He insisted on buying it.  But what a sell when
he tries to read it!"
</p><p>"Did Colonel House really write it?" asked Titania.
</p><p>"I don't know," said Roger.  "I hope not, because I
find in myself a secret tendency to believe

<pb n="187"/>
that Mr. House is an able man.  If he did write it, I devoutly
hope none of the foreign statesmen in Paris will learn of
that fact."
</p><p>While Helen and Titania took off their wraps, Roger
was busy closing up the shop.  He went down to the corner
with Bock to mail his letter, and when he returned to the
den Helen had prepared a large jug of cocoa.  They sat
down by the fire to enjoy it.
</p><p>"Chesterton has written a very savage poem against
cocoa," said Roger, "which you will find in <hi rend="italic">The Flying
Inn;</hi> but for my part I find it the ideal evening drink.
It lets the mind down gently, and paves the way for
slumber.  I have often noticed that the most terrific
philosophical agonies can be allayed by three cups of
Mrs. Mifflin's cocoa.  A man can safely read Schopenhauer
all evening if he has a tablespoonful of cocoa and a tin
of condensed milk available.  Of course it should be made
with condensed milk, which is the only way."
</p><p>"I had no idea anything could be so good," said
Titania.  "Of course, Daddy makes condensed milk in one
of his factories, but I never dreamed of trying it.  I
thought it was only used by explorers, people at the
North Pole, you know."
</p><p>"How stupid of me!" exclaimed Roger.  "I quite forgot
to tell you! Your father called up just

<pb n="188"/>
after you had gone out this evening, and wanted to know how you
were getting on."
</p><p>"Oh, dear," said Titania.  "He must have been
delighted to hear I was at the movies, on the second day
of my first job!  He probably said it was just like me."
</p><p>"I explained that I had insisted on your going with
Mrs. Mifflin, because I felt she needed the change."
</p><p>"I do hope," said Titania, "you won't let Daddy
poison your mind about me.  He thinks I'm dreadfully
frivolous, just because I <hi rend="italic">look</hi> frivolous.  But I'm so
keen to make good in this job.  I've been practicing
doing up parcels all afternoon, so as to learn how to tie
the string nicely and not cut it until after the knot's
tied. I found that when you cut it beforehand either you
get it too short and it won't go round, or else too long
and you waste some.  Also I've learned how to make
wrapping paper cuffs to keep my sleeves clean."
</p><p>"Well, I haven't finished yet," continued Roger.
"Your father wants us all to spend to-morrow out at your
home.  He wants to show us some books he has just bought,
and besides he thinks maybe you're feeling homesick."
</p><p>"What, with all these lovely books to read?
Nonsense!  I don't want to go home for six months!"

</p><p>"He wouldn't take No for an answer.  He's going to
send Edwards round with the car the first thing tomorrow
morning."
</p><p>"What fun!" said Helen.  "It'll be delightful."
</p><p>"Goodness," said Titania.  "Imagine leaving this
adorable bookshop to spend Sunday in Larchmont.
</p><p>Well, I'll be able to get that georgette blouse I
forgot."
</p><p>"What time will the car be here?" asked Helen.
</p><p>"Mr. Chapman said about nine o'clock.  He begs us to
get out there as early as possible, as he wants to spend
the day showing us his books."
</p><p>As they sat round the fading bed of coals, Roger
began hunting along his private shelves.  "Have you ever
read any Gissing?" he said.
</p><p>Titania made a pathetic gesture to Mrs. Mifflin.
"It's awfully embarrassing to be asked these things!  No,
I never heard of him."
</p><p>"Well, as the street we live on is named after him,
I think you ought to," he said.  He pulled down his copy
of <hi rend="italic">The House of Cobwebs.</hi>  "I'm going to read you one of
the most delightful short stories I know.  It's called `A
Charming Family.'"
</p><p>"No, Roger," said Mrs. Mifflin firmly.  "Not
to-night.  It's eleven o'clock, and I can see Titania's
tired.  Even Bock has left us and gone in to his kennel.
He's got more sense than you have."


<pb n="190"/>

</p><p>"All right," said the bookseller amiably.  "Miss
Chapman, you take the book up with you and read it in bed
if you want to.  Are you a librocubicularist?"
</p><p>Titania looked a little scandalized.
</p><p>"It's all right, my dear," said Helen.  "He only
means are you fond of reading in bed.  I've been waiting
to hear him work that word into the conversation.  He
made it up, and he's immensely proud of it."
</p><p>"Reading in bed?" said Titania.  "What a quaint idea!
Does any one do it?  It never occurred to me.  I'm sure
when I go to bed I'm far too sleepy to think of such a
thing."
</p><p>"Run along then, both of you," said Roger.  "Get your
beauty sleep. I shan't be very late."
</p><p>He meant it when he said it, but returning to his
desk at the back of the shop his eye fell upon his
private shelf of books which he kept there "to rectify
perturbations" as Burton puts it.  On this shelf there
stood <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim's Progress, Shakespeare, The Anatomy of
Melancholy, The Home Book of Verse, George Herbert's
Poems, The Notebooks of Samuel Butler, and Leaves of
Grass.</hi>  He took down <hi rend="italic">?The Anatomy of Melancholy,</hi>
that most delightful of all books for midnight browsing.
Turning to one of his favourite passages&mdash;"A Consolatory
Digression, Containing the Remedies of All Manner

<pb n="191"/>
of Discontents"&mdash;he was happily lost to all ticking of the
clock, retaining only such bodily consciousness as was
needful to dump, fill, and relight his pipe from time to
time.  Solitude is a dear jewel for men whose days are
spent in the tedious this-and-that of trade.  Roger was
a glutton for his midnight musings.  To such tried
companions as Robert Burton and George Herbert he was
wont to exonerate his spirit.  It used to amuse him to
think of Burton, the lonely Oxford scholar, writing that
vast book to "rectify" his own melancholy.
</p><p>By and by, turning over the musty old pages, he came
to the following, on Sleep&mdash;
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">The fittest time is two or three hours after supper,
whenas the meat is now settled at the bottom of the
stomach, and 'tis good to lie on the right side first,
because at that site the liver doth rest under the
stomach, not molesting any way, but heating him as a fire
doth a kettle, that is put to it.  After the first sleep
'tis not amiss to lie on the left side, that the meat may
the better descend, and sometimes again on the belly, but
never on the back.  Seven or eight hours is a competent
time for a melancholy man to rest&mdash;</hi>
</p>

<p>In that case, thought Roger, it's time for me to be
turning in.  He looked at his watch, and found it was
half-past twelve.  He switched off his light and went
back to the kitchen quarters to tend the furnace.
</p>


<pb n="192"/>
<p>I hesitate to touch upon a topic of domestic
bitterness, but candor compels me to say that Roger's
evening vigils invariably ended at the ice-box.  There
are two theories as to this subject of ice-box
plundering, one of the husband and the other of the wife.
Husbands are prone to think (in their simplicity) that if
they take a little of everything palatable they find in
the refrigerator, but thus distributing their forage over
the viands the general effect of the depradation will be
almost unnoticeable.  Whereas wives say (and Mrs. Mifflin
had often explained to Roger) that it is far better to
take all of any one dish than a little of each; for the
latter course is likely to diminish each item below the
bulk at which it is still useful as a left-over.  Roger,
however, had the obstinate viciousness of all good
husbands, and he knew the delights of cold provender by
heart.  Many a stewed prune, many a mess of string beans
or naked cold boiled potato, many a chicken leg, half
apple pie, or sector of rice pudding, had perished in
these midnight festivals.  He made it a point of honour
never to eat quite all of the dish in question, but would
pass with unabated zest from one to another.  This habit
he had sternly repressed during the war, but Mrs. Mifflin
had noticed that since the armistice he had resumed it
with hearty violence.  This is a custom which

<pb n="193"/>
causes
the housewife to be confronted the next morning with a
tragical vista of pathetic scraps.  Two slices of beet in
a little earthenware cup, a sliver of apple pie one inch
wide, three prunes lowly nestling in a mere trickle of
their own syrup, and a tablespoonful of stewed rhubarb
where had been one of those yellow basins nearly
full&mdash;what can the most resourceful kitcheneer do with
these oddments?  This atrocious practice cannot be too
bitterly condemned.
</p><p>But we are what we are, and Roger was even more so.
<hi rend="italic">The Anatomy of Melancholy</hi> always made him hungry, and he
dipped discreetly into various vessels of refreshment,
sharing a few scraps with Bock whose pleading brown eye
at these secret suppers always showed a comical
realization of their shameful and furtive nature.  Bock
knew very well that Roger had no business at the ice-box,
for the larger outlines of social law upon which every
home depends are clearly understood by dogs.  But Bock's
face always showed his tremulous eagerness to participate
in the sin, and rather than have him stand by as a silent
and damning critic, Roger used to give him most of the
cold potato.  The censure of a dog is something no man
can stand.  But I rove, as Burton would say.
</p><p>After the ice-box, the cellar.  Like all true
householders, Roger was fond of his cellar.  It was
some

<pb n="194"/>
thing mouldy of smell, but it harboured a
well-stocked little bin of liquors, and the florid glow
of the furnace mouth upon the concrete floor was a great
pleasure to the bookseller.  He loved to peer in at the
dancing flicker of small blue flames that played above
the ruddy mound of coals in the firebox&mdash;tenuous, airy
little flames that were as blue as violets and hovered up
and down in the ascending gases.  Before blackening the
fire with a stoking of coal he pulled up a wooden
Bushmills box, turned off the electric bulb overhead, and
sat there for a final pipe, watching the rosy shine of
the grate.  The tobacco smoke, drawn inward by the hot
inhaling fire, seemed dry and gray in the golden
brightness.  Bock, who had pattered down the steps after
him, nosed and snooped about the cellar.  Roger was
thinking of Burton's words on the immortal weed&mdash;
</p>

<p>Tobacco, divine, rare, superexcellent tobacco, which
goes far beyond all the panaceas, potable gold, and
philosopher's stones, a sovereign remedy to all diseases.
. . .  a virtuous herb, if it be well qualified,
opportunely taken, and medicinally used; but as it is
commonly abused by most men, which take it as tinkers do
ale, 'tis a plague, a mischief, a violent purger of
goods, lands, health, hellish, devilish, and damned
tobacco, the ruin and overthrow of body and soul&mdash;
</p>

<p>Bock was standing on his hind legs, looking up at the
front wall of the cellar, in which two small


<pb n="195"/>
iron-grated windows opened onto the sunken area by
the front door of the shop.  He gave a low growl, and
seemed uneasy.
</p><p>"What is it, Bock?" said Roger placidly, finishing
his pipe.
</p><p>Bock gave a short, sharp bark, with a curious note of
protest in it.  But Roger's mind was still with Burton.
</p><p>"Rats?" he said.  "Aye, very likely!  This is
Ratisbon, old man, but don't bark about it.  <hi rend="italic">Incident of
the French Camp:</hi>  `Smiling, the rat fell dead.'"
</p><p>Bock paid no heed to this persiflage, but prowled the
front end of the cellar, looking upward in curious
agitation.  He growled again, softly.
</p><p>"Shhh," said Roger gently.  "Never mind the rats,
Bock.  Come on, we'll stoke up the fire and go to bed.
Lord, it's one o'clock."
</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI
<lb/>
TITANIA TRIES READING IN BED</head>

<p>Aubrey, sitting at his window with the opera glasses,
soon realized that he was blind weary.  Even the exalted
heroics of romance are not proof against fatigue, most
potent enemy of all who do and dream.  He had had a long
day, coming after the skull-smiting of the night before;
it was only the frosty air at the lifted sash that kept
him at all awake.  He had fallen into a half drowse when
he heard footsteps coming down the opposite side of the
street.
</p><p>He had forced himself awake several times before, to
watch the passage of some harmless strollers through the
innocent blackness of the Brooklyn night, but this time
it was what he sought.  The man stepped stealthily, with
a certain blend of wariness and assurance.  He halted
under the lamp by the bookshop door, and the glasses gave
him enlarged to Aubrey's eye.  It was Weintraub, the
druggist.
</p><p>The front of the bookshop was now entirely dark save
for a curious little glimmer down below


<pb n="197"/>
the pavement level.  This puzzled Aubrey, but he focussed his
glasses
on the door of the shop.  He saw Weintraub pull a key out
of his pocket, insert it very carefully in the lock, and
open the door stealthily.  Leaving the door ajar behind
him, the druggist slipped into the shop.
</p><p>"What devil's business is this?" thought Aubrey
angrily.  "The swine has even got a key of his own.
There's no doubt about it. He and Mifflin are working
together on this job."
</p><p>For a moment he was uncertain what to do.  Should he
run downstairs and across the street?  Then, as he
hesitated, he saw a pale beam of light over in the front
left-hand corner of the shop.  Through the glasses he
could

<pb n="198"/>
see the yellow circle of a flashlight
splotched upon dim shelves of books.  He saw Weintraub
pull a volume out of the case, and the light vanished.
Another instant and the man reappeared in the doorway,
closed the door behind him with a gesture of careful
silence, and was off up the street quietly and swiftly.
It was all over in a minute.  Two yellow oblongs shone
for a minute or two down in the area underneath the door.
Through the glasses he now made out these patches as the
cellar windows.  Then they disappeared also, and all was
placid gloom.  In the quivering light of the street lamps
he could see the bookseller's sign gleaming whitely, with
its lettering THIS SHOP IS HAUNTED.
</p><p>Aubrey sat back in his chair.  "Well," he said to
himself, "that guy certainly gave his shop the right
name.  This is by me.  I do believe it's only some
book-stealing game after all.  I wonder if he and
Weintraub go in for some first-edition faking, or some
such stunt as that?  I'd give a lot to know what it's all
about."
</p><p>He stayed by the window on the qui vive, but no sound
broke the stillness of Gissing Street.  In the distance
he could hear the occasional rumble of the Elevated
trains rasping round the curve on Wordsworth Avenue.  He
wondered whether he ought to go over and break into the
shop to see if all was well.  But, like every healthy
young man, he had a horror of appearing absurd.  Little
by little weariness numbed his apprehensions.  Two
o'clock clanged and echoed from distant steeples.  He
threw off his clothes and crawled into bed.

</p><p>It was ten o'clock on Sunday morning when he awoke.
A broad swath of sunlight cut the room in half: the white
muslin curtain at the window rippled outward like a flag.
Aubrey exclaimed when he saw his watch.  He had a sudden
feeling of having been false to his trust.  What had been
happening across the way?


<pb n="199"/>

</p><p>He gazed out at the bookshop.  Gissing Street was
bright and demure in the crisp quietness of the forenoon.
Mifflin's house showed no sign of life.  It was as he had
last seen it, save that broad green shades had been drawn
down inside the big front windows, making it impossible
to look through into the book-filled alcoves.
</p><p>Aubrey put on his overcoat in lieu of a dressing
gown, and went in search of a bathtub.  He found the
bathroom on his floor locked, with sounds of leisurely
splashing within.  "Damn Mrs. J. F. Smith," he said.  He
was about to descend to the storey below, bashfully
conscious of bare feet and pyjamaed shins, but looking
over the banisters he saw Mrs. Schiller and the
treasure-dog engaged in some household manoeuvres.  The
pug caught sight of his pyjama legs and began to yap.
Aubrey retreated in the irritation of a man baulked of a
cold tub.  He shaved and dressed rapidly.
</p><p>On his way downstairs he met Mrs. Schiller.  He
thought that her gaze was disapproving.
</p><p>"A gentleman called to see you last night, sir," she
said. "He said he was very sorry to miss you."
</p><p>"I was rather late in getting in," said Aubrey.  "Did
he leave his name?"
</p><p>"No, he said he'd see you some other time.  He


<pb n="200"/>
woke the whole house up by falling downstairs," she
added sourly.
</p><p>He left the lodging house swiftly, fearing to be seen
from the bookshop.  He was very eager to learn if
everything was all right, but he did not want the
Mifflins to know he was lodging just opposite.  Hastening
diagonally across the street, he found that the Milwaukee
Lunch, where he had eaten the night before, was open. He
went in and had breakfast, rejoicing in grapefruit, ham
and eggs, coffee, and doughnuts.  He lit a pipe and sat
by the window wondering what to do next.  "It's damned
perplexing," he said to himself.  "I stand to lose either
way.  If I don't do anything, something may happen to the
girl; if I butt in too soon I'll get in dutch with her.
I wish I knew what Weintraub and that chef are up to."
</p><p>The lunchroom was practically empty, and in two
chairs near him the proprietor and his assistant were
sitting talking.  Aubrey was suddenly struck by what they
said.
</p><p>"Say, this here, now, bookseller guy must have struck
it rich."
</p><p>"Who, Mifflin?"
</p><p>"Yeh; did ya see that car in front of his place this
morning?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Believe me, some boat."


<pb n="201"/>

</p><p>"Musta hired it, hey?  Where'd he go at?"
</p><p>"I didn't see.  I just saw the bus standing front the
door."
</p><p>"Say, did you see that swell dame he's got clerking
for him?"
</p><p>"I sure did.  What's he doing, taking her
joy-riding?"
</p><p>"Shouldn't wonder.  I wouldn't blame him&mdash;"
</p><p>Aubrey gave no sign of having heard, but got up and
left the lunchroom.  Had the girl been kidnapped while he
overslept?  He burned with shame to think what a pitiful
failure his knight-errantry had been.  His first idea was
to beard Weintraub and compel him to explain his
connection with the bookshop.  His next thought was to
call up Mr. Chapman and warn him of what had been going
on.  Then he decided it would be futile to do either of
these before he really knew what had happened.  He
determined to get into the bookshop itself, and burst
open its sinister secret.
</p><p>He walked hurriedly round to the rear alley, and
surveyed the domestic apartments of the shop.  Two
windows in the second storey stood slightly open, but he
could discern no signs of life.  The back gate was still
unlocked, and he walked boldly into the yard.
</p><p>The little enclosure was serene in the pale winter


<pb n="202"/>
sunlight.  Along one fence ran a line of bushes and
perennials, their roots wrapped in straw.  The grass plot
was lumpy, the sod withered to a tawny yellow and
granulated with a sprinkle of frost.  Below the kitchen
door&mdash;which stood at the head of a flight of steps&mdash;was
a little grape arbour with a rustic bench where Roger
used to smoke his pipe on summer evenings.  At the back
of this arbour was the cellar door.  Aubrey tried it, and
found it locked.
</p><p>He was in no mood to stick at trifles.  He was
determined to unriddle the mystery of the bookshop.  At
the right of the door was a low window, level with the
brick pavement.  Through the dusty pane he could see it
was fastened only by a hook on the inside.  He thrust his
heel through the pane.  As the glass tinkled onto the
cellar floor he heard a low growl.  He unhooked the
catch, lifted the frame of the broken window, and looked
in.  There was Bock, with head quizzically tilted,
uttering a rumbling guttural vibration that seemed to
proceed automatically from his interior.
</p><p>Aubrey was a little dashed, but he said cheerily
"Hullo, Bock! Good old man!  Well, well, nice old
fellow!" To his surprise, Bock recognized him as a friend
and wagged his tail slightly, but still continued to
growl.


<pb n="203"/>

</p><p>"I wish dogs weren't such sticklers for form,"
thought Aubrey. "Now if I went in by the front door, Bock
wouldn't say anything. It's just because he sees me
coming in this way that he's annoyed. Well, I'll have to
take a chance."
</p><p>He thrust his legs in through the window, carefully
holding up the sash with its jagged triangles of glass.
It will never be known how severely Bock was tempted by
the extremities thus exposed to him, but he was an old
dog and his martial instincts had been undermined by
years of kindness.  Moreover, he remembered Aubrey
perfectly well, and the smell of his trousers did not
seem at all hostile.  So he contented himself with a
small grumbling of protest.  He was an Irish terrier, but
there was nothing Sinn Fein about him.
</p><p>Aubrey dropped to the floor, and patted the dog,
thanking his good fortune.  He glanced about the cellar
as though expecting to find some lurking horror.  Nothing
more appalling than several cases of beer bottles met his
eyes.  He started quietly to go up the cellar stairs, and
Bock, evidently consumed with legitimate curiosity, kept
at his heels.
</p><p>"Look here," thought Aubrey.  "I don't want the dog
following me all through the house.  If I touch anything
he'll probably take a hunk out of my shin."


<pb n="204"/>

</p><p>He unlocked the door into the yard, and Bock obeying
the Irish terrier's natural impulse to get into the open
air, ran outside. Aubrey quickly closed the door again.
Bock's face appeared at the broken window, looking in
with so quaint an expression of indignant surprise that
Aubrey almost laughed.  "There, old man," he said, "it's
all right.  I'm just going to look around a bit."
</p><p>He ascended the stairs on tiptoe and found himself in
the kitchen. All was quiet.  An alarm clock ticked with
a stumbling, headlong hurry.  Pots of geraniums stood on
the window sill.  The range, with its lids off and the
fire carefully nourished, radiated a mild warmth.
Through a dark little pantry he entered the dining room.
Still no sign of anything amiss.  A pot of white heather
stood on the table, and a corncob pipe lay on the
sideboard.  "This is the most innocent-looking
kidnapper's den I ever heard of," he thought. "Any
moving-picture director would be ashamed not to provide
a better stage-set."
</p><p>At that instant he heard footsteps overhead.
Curiously soft, muffled footsteps.  Instantly he was on
the alert.  Now he would know the worst.
</p><p>A window upstairs was thrown open.  "Bock, what are
you doing in the yard?" floated a voice&mdash;a very clear,
imperious voice that somehow made

<pb n="205"/>
him think of the
thin ringing of a fine glass tumbler. It was Titania.
</p><p>He stood aghast.  Then he heard a door open, and
steps on the stair.  Merciful heaven, the girl must not
find him here.  What <hi rend="italic">would</hi> she think?  He skipped back
into the pantry, and shrank into a corner.  He heard the
footfalls reach the bottom of the stairs. There was a
door into the kitchen from the central hall: it was not
necessary for her to pass through the pantry, he thought.
He heard her enter the kitchen.
</p><p>In his anxiety he crouched down beneath the sink, and
his foot, bent beneath him, touched a large tin tray
leaning against the wall.  It fell over with a terrible
clang.
</p><p>"Bock!" said Titania sharply, "what are you doing?"
</p><p>Aubrey was wondering miserably whether he ought to
counterfeit a bark, but it was too late to do anything.
The pantry door opened, and Titania looked in.
</p><p>They gazed at each other for several seconds in
mutual horror. Even in his abasement, crouching under a
shelf in the corner, Aubrey's stricken senses told him
that he had never seen so fair a spectacle.  Titania wore
a blue kimono and a curious fragile lacy bonnet which he
did not understand.  Her dark, gold-spangled hair came


<pb n="206"/>
down in two thick braids across her shoulders.  Her
blue eyes were very much alive with amazement and alarm
which rapidly changed into anger.
</p><p>"Mr. Gilbert!" she cried.  For an instant he thought
she was going to laugh.  Then a new expression came into
her face.  Without another word she turned and fled.  He
heard her run upstairs.  A door banged, and was locked.
A window was hastily closed.  Again all was silent.
</p><p>Stupefied with chagrin, he rose from his cramped
position.  What on earth was he to do?  How could he
explain?  He stood by the pantry sink in painful
indecision.  Should he slink out of the house?  No, he
couldn't do that without attempting to explain.  And he
was still convinced that some strange peril hung about
this place.  He must put Titania on her guard, no matter
how embarrassing it proved.  If only she hadn't been
wearing a kimono&mdash;how much easier it would have been.
</p><p>He stepped out into the hall, and stood at the bottom
of the stairs in the throes of doubt.  After waiting some
time in silence he cleared the huskiness from his throat
and called out:
</p><p>"Miss Chapman!"
</p><p>There was no answer, but he heard light, rapid
movements above.
</p><p>"Miss Chapman!" he called again.


<pb n="207"/>

</p><p>He heard the door opened, and clear words edged with
frost came downward.  This time he thought of a thin
tumbler with ice in it.
</p><p>"Mr. Gilbert!"
</p><p>"Yes?" he said miserably.
</p><p>"Will you please call me a taxi?"
</p><p>Something in the calm, mandatory tone nettled him.
After all, he had acted in pure good faith.
</p><p>"With pleasure," he said, "but not until I have told
you something. It's very important.  I beg your pardon
most awfully for frightening you, but it's really very
urgent."
</p><p>There was a brief silence.  Then she said:
</p><p>"Brooklyn's a queer place.  Wait a few minutes,
please."
</p><p>Aubrey stood absently fingering the pattern on the
wallpaper.  He suddenly experienced a great craving for
a pipe, but felt that the etiquette of the situation
hardly permitted him to smoke.
</p><p>In a few moments Titania appeared at the head of the
stairs in her customary garb.  She sat down on the
landing.  Aubrey felt that everything was as bad as it
could possibly be.  If he could have seen her face his
embarrassment would at least have had some compensation.
But the light from a stair window shone behind her, and
her features were in shadow.  She sat clasping her hands
round her knees.  The light fell crosswise down the
stair

<pb n="208"/>
way, and he could see only a gleam of
brightness upon her ankle.  His mind unconsciously
followed its beaten paths.  "What a corking pose for a
silk stocking ad!" he thought.  "Wouldn't it make a
stunning full-page layout.  I must suggest it to the
Ankleshimmer people."
</p><p>"Well?" she said.  Then she could not refrain from
laughter, he looked so hapless.  She burst into an
engaging trill.  "Why don't you light your pipe?" she
said.  "You look as doleful as the Kaiser."
</p><p>"Miss Chapman," he said, "I'm afraid you think&mdash;I
don't know what you must think.  But I broke in here this
morning because I&mdash;well, I don't think this is a safe
place for you to be."
</p><p>"So it seems.  That's why I asked you to get me a
taxi."
</p><p>"There's something queer going on round this shop.
It's not right for you to be here alone this way.  I was
afraid something had happened to you.  Of course, I
didn't know you were&mdash;were&mdash;"
</p><p>Faint almond blossoms grew in her cheeks.  "I was
reading," she said.  "Mr. Mifflin talks so much about
reading in bed, I thought I'd try it.  They wanted me to
go with them to-day but I wouldn't. You see, if I'm going
to be a bookseller I've got to catch up with some of this
literature

<pb n="209"/>
that's been accumulating.  After they
left I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I wanted to see if this reading in bed
is what it's cracked up to be."
</p><p>"Where has Mifflin gone?" asked Aubrey.  "What
business has he got to leave you here all alone?"
</p><p>"I had Bock," said Titania.  "Gracious, Brooklyn on
Sunday morning doesn't seem very perilous to me.  If you
must know, he and Mrs. Mifflin have gone over to spend
the day with father.  I was to have gone, too, but I
wouldn't.  What business is it of yours?  You're as bad
as Morris Finsbury in <hi rend="italic">The Wrong Box.</hi>  That's what I was
reading when I heard the dog barking."
</p><p>Aubrey began to grow nettled.  "You seem to think
this was a mere impertinence on my part," he said.  "Let
me tell you a thing or two."  And he briefly described to
her the course of his experiences since leaving the shop
on Friday evening, but omitting the fact that he was
lodging just across the street.
</p><p>"There's something mighty unpalatable going on," he
said.  "At first I thought Mifflin was the goat.  I
thought it might be some frame-up for swiping valuable
books from his shop.  But when I saw Weintraub come in
here with his own latch-key, I got wise.  He and Mifflin
are in cahoots, that's what.  I don't know what they're
pulling



<pb n="210"/>

off, but I don't like the looks of it.  You
say Mifflin has gone out to see your father?  I bet
that's just camouflage, to stall you.  I've got a great
mind to ring Mr. Chapman up and tell him he ought to get
you out of here."
</p><p>"I won't hear a word said against Mr. Mifflin," said
Titania angrily.  "He's one of my father's oldest
friends.  What would Mr. Mifflin say if he knew you had
been breaking into his house and frightening me half to
death?  I'm sorry you got that knock on the head, because
it seems that's your weak spot.  I'm quite able to take
care of myself, thank you.  This isn't a movie."
</p><p>"Well, how do you explain the actions of this man
Weintraub?" said Aubrey.  "Do you like to have a man
popping in and out of the shop at all hours of the night,
stealing books?"
</p><p>"I don't have to explain it at all," said Titania.
"I think it's up to you to do the explaining.  Weintraub
is a harmless old thing and he keeps delicious chocolates
that cost only half as much as what you get on Fifth
Avenue.  Mr. Mifflin told me that he's a very good
customer.  Perhaps his business won't let him read in the
daytime, and he comes in here late at night to borrow
books.  He probably reads in bed."
</p><p>"I don't think anybody who talks German round back
alleys at night is a harmless old thing,"

<pb n="211"/>
said
Aubrey.  "I tell you, your Haunted Bookshop is haunted by
something worse than the ghost of Thomas Carlyle.  Let me
show you something."  He pulled the book cover out of his
pocket, and pointed to the annotations in it.
</p><p>"That's Mifflin's handwriting," said Titania,
pointing to the upper row of figures.  "He puts notes
like that in all his favourite books.  They refer to
pages where he has found interesting things."
</p><p>"Yes, and that's Weintraub's," said Aubrey,
indicating the numbers in violet ink.  "If that isn't a
proof of their complicity, I'd like to know what is.  If
that Cromwell book is here, I'd like to have a look at
it."
</p><p>They went into the shop.  Titania preceded him down
the musty aisle, and it made Aubrey angry to see the
obstinate assurance of her small shoulders.  He was
horribly tempted to seize her and shake her.  It annoyed
him to see her bright, unconscious girlhood in that dingy
vault of books.  "She's as out of place here as&mdash;as a
Packard ad in the Liberator" he said to himself.
</p><p>They stood in the History alcove.  "Here it is," she
said.  "No, it isn't&mdash;that's the <hi rend="italic">History of Frederick the
Great."</hi>
</p><p>There was a two-inch gap in the shelf.  <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>
was
gone.


<pb n="212"/>

</p><p>"Probably Mr. Mifflin has it somewhere around," said
Titania.  "It was there last night."
</p><p>"Probably nothing," said Aubrey.  "I tell you,
Weintraub came in and took it.  I saw him.  Look here, if
you really want to know what I think, I'll tell you.  The
war's not over by a long sight. Weintraub's a German.
Carlyle was pro-German&mdash;I remember that much from
college.  I believe your friend Mifflin is pro-German,
too. I've heard some of his talk!"
</p><p>Titania faced him with cheeks aflame.
</p><p>"That'll do for you!" she cried.  "Next thing I
suppose you'll say Daddy's pro-German, and me, too!  I'd
like to see you say that to Mr. Mifflin himself."
</p><p>"I will, don't worry," said Aubrey grimly.  He knew
now that he had put himself hopelessly in the wrong in
Titania's mind, but he refused to abate his own
convictions.  With sinking heart he saw her face relieved
against the shelves of faded bindings.  Her eyes shone
with a deep and sultry blue, her chin quivered with
anger.
</p><p>"Look here," she said furiously.  "Either you or I
must leave this place.  If you intend to stay, please
call me a taxi."
</p><p>Aubrey was as angry as she was.
</p><p>"I'm going," he said.  "But you've got to play fair
with me.  I tell you on my oath, these

<pb n="213"/>
two men,
Mifflin and Weintraub, are framing something up.  I'm
going to get the goods on them and show you.  But you
mustn't put them wise that I'm on their track.  If you
do, of course, they'll call it off.  I don't care what
you think of me.  You've got to promise me that."
</p><p>"I won't promise you <hi rend="italic">anything,"</hi> she said, "except
never to speak to you again.  I never saw a man like you
before&mdash;and I've seen a good many."
</p><p>"I won't leave here until you promise me not to warn
them," he retorted.  "What I told you, I said in
confidence.  They've already found out where I'm lodging.
Do you think this is a joke?  They've tried to put me out
of the way twice.  If you breathe a word of this to
Mifflin he'll warn the other two."
</p><p>"You're afraid to have Mr. Mifflin know you broke
into his shop," she taunted.
</p><p>"You can think what you like."
</p><p>"I won't promise you anything!" she burst out.  Then
her face altered.  The defiant little line of her mouth
bent and her strength seemed to run out at each end of
that pathetic curve. "Yes, I will," she said.  "I suppose
that's fair.  I couldn't tell Mr. Mifflin, anyway.  I'd
be ashamed to tell him how you frightened me.  I think
you're hateful.  I came over here thinking I was going


<pb n="214"/>
to have such a good time, and you've spoilt it all!"
</p><p>For one terrible moment he thought she was going to
cry.  But he remembered having seen heroines cry in the
movies, and knew it was only done when there was a table
and chair handy.
</p><p>"Miss Chapman," he said, "I'm as sorry as a man can
be.  But I swear I did what I did in all honesty.  If I'm
wrong in this, you need never speak to me again.  If I'm
wrong, you&mdash;you can tell your father to take his
advertising away from the Grey-Matter Company. I can't
say more than that."
</p><p>And, to do him justice, he couldn't.  It was the
supreme sacrifice.
</p><p>She let him out of the front door without another
word.

<lb/>
AUBREY DETERMINES TO GIVE SERVICE THAT'S DIFFERENT</head>


<p>Seldom has a young man spent a more desolate afternoon
than Aubrey on that Sunday.  His only consolation was
that twenty minutes after he had left the bookshop he saw
a taxi drive up (he was then sitting gloomily at his
bedroom window) and Titania enter it and drive away.  He
supposed that she had gone to join the party in
Larchmont, and was glad to know that she was out of what
he now called the war zone.  For the first time on
record, O. Henry failed to solace him.  His pipe tasted
bitter and brackish.  He was eager to know what Weintraub
was doing, but did not dare make any investigations in
broad daylight.  His idea was to wait until dark.
Observing the Sabbath calm of the streets, and the
pageant of baby carriages wheeling toward Thackeray
Boulevard, he wondered again whether he had thrown away
this girl's friendship for a merely imaginary suspicion.
</p><p>At last he could endure his cramped bedroom no




<pb n="216"/>
longer.  Downstairs someone was dolefully playing a
flute, most horrible of all tortures to tightened nerves.
While her lodgers were at church the tireless Mrs.
Schiller was doing a little housecleaning: he could hear
the monotonous rasp of a carpet-sweeper passing back and
forth in an adjoining room.  He creaked irritably
downstairs, and heard the usual splashing behind the
bathroom door.  In the frame of the hall mirror he saw a
pencilled note:  <hi rend="italic">Will Mrs. Smith please call Tarkington
1565,</hi> it said.  Unreasonably annoyed, he tore a piece of
paper out of his notebook and wrote on it <hi rend="italic">Will Mrs. Smith
please call Bath 4200.</hi>  Mounting to the second floor he
tapped on the bathroom door.  "Don't come in!" cried an
agitated female voice. He thrust the memorandum under the
door, and left the house.
</p><p>Walking the windy paths of Prospect Park he condemned
himself to relentless self-scrutiny.  "I've damned myself
forever with her," he groaned, "unless I can prove
something."  The vision of Titania's face silhouetted
against the shelves of books came maddeningly to his
mind.  "I was going to have such a good time, and you've
spoilt it all!" With what angry conviction she had said:
"I never saw a man like you before&mdash;and I've seen a good
many!"
</p><p>Even in his disturbance of soul the familiar


<pb n="217"/>
jargon of his profession came naturally to
utterance.  "At least she admits I'm <hi rend="italic">different,"</hi> he said
dolefully.  He remembered the first item in the
Grey-Matter Code, a neat little booklet issued by his
employers for the information of their representatives:


</p><p>Business is built upon <hi rend="italic">confidence.</hi>
Before you can sell Grey-Matter Service to a Client, you must
sell <hi rend="italic">Yourself.</hi>

</p><p>"How am I going to sell myself to her?" he wondered.
"I've simply got to deliver, that's all.  I've got to
give her service that's <hi rend="italic">different.</hi> If I fall down on
this, she'll never speak to me again.  Not only that, the
firm will lose the old man's account. It's simply
unthinkable."
</p><p>Nevertheless, he thought about it a good deal,
stimulated from time to time as in the course of his walk
(which led him out toward the faubourgs of Flatbush) he
passed long vistas of signboards, which he imagined
placarded with vivid lithographs in behalf of the Chapman
prunes.  "Adam and Eve Ate Prunes On Their Honeymoon" was
a slogan that flashed into his head, and he imagined a
magnificent painting illustrating this text.  Thus, in
hours of stress, do all men turn for comfort to their
chosen art.  The poet, battered by fate, heals himself in
the niceties of rhyme.  The prohibitionist

<pb n="218"/>
can weather the blackest melancholia by meditating the
contortions of other people's abstinence.  The most
embittered citizen of Detroit will never perish by his
own hand while he has an automobile to tinker.
</p><p>Aubrey walked many miles, gradually throwing his
despair to the winds.  The bright spirits of Orison Swett
Marden and Ralph Waldo Trine, Dioscuri of Good Cheer,
seemed to be with him reminding him that nothing is
impossible.  In a small restaurant he found sausages,
griddle cakes and syrup.  When he got back to Gissing
Street it was dark, and he girded his soul for further
endeavour.
</p><p>About nine o'clock he walked up the alley.  He had
left his overcoat in his room at Mrs. Schiller's and also
the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> bookcover&mdash;having taken the precaution,
however, to copy the inscriptions into his pocket
memorandum-book.  He noticed lights in the rear of the
bookshop, and concluded that the Mifflins and their
employee had got home safely.  Arrived at the back of
Weintraub's pharmacy, he studied the contours of the
building carefully.
</p><p>The drug store lay, as we have explained before, at
the corner of Gissing Street and Wordsworth Avenue, just
where the Elevated railway swings in a long curve.  The
course of this curve brought the

<pb n="219"/>
scaffolding of the
viaduct out over the back roof of the building, and this
fact had impressed itself on Aubrey's observant eye the
day before.  The front of the drug store stood three
storeys, but in the rear it dropped to two, with a flat
roof over the hinder portion.  Two windows looked out
upon this roof. Weintraub's back yard opened onto the
alley, but the gate, he found, was locked.  The fence
would not be hard to scale, but he hesitated to make so
direct an approach.
</p><p>He ascended the stairs of the "L" station, on the
near side, and paying a nickel passed through a turnstile
onto the platform. Waiting until just after a train had
left, and the long, windy sweep of planking was solitary,
he dropped onto the narrow footway that runs beside the
track.  This required watchful walking, for the charged
third rail was very near, but hugging the outer side of
the path he proceeded without trouble.  Every fifteen
feet or so a girder ran sideways from the track, resting
upon an upright from the street below.  The fourth of
these overhung the back corner of Weintraub's house, and
he crawled cautiously along it.  People were passing on
the pavement underneath, and he greatly feared being
discovered.  But he reached the end of the beam without
mishap. From here a drop of about twelve feet would bring
him onto Weintraub's

<pb n="220"/>
back roof.  For a moment he
reflected that, once down there, it would be impossible
to return the same way.  However, he decided to risk it.
Where he was, with his legs swinging astride the girder,
he was in serious danger of attracting attention.
</p><p>He would have given a great deal, just then, to have
his overcoat with him, for by lowering it first he could
have jumped onto it and muffled the noise of his fall.
He took off his coat and carefully dropped it on the
corner of the roof.  Then cannily waiting until a train
passed overhead, drowning all other sounds with its roar,
he lowered himself as far as he could hang by his hands,
and let go.
</p><p>For some minutes he lay prone on the tin roof, and
during that time a number of distressing ideas occurred
to him.  If he really expected to get into Weintraub's
house, why had he not laid his plans more carefully?  Why
(for instance) had he not made some attempt to find out
how many there were in the household?  Why had he not
arranged with one of his friends to call Weintraub to the
telephone at a given moment, so that he could be more
sure of making an entry unnoticed?  And what did he
expect to see or do if he got inside the house?  He found
no answer to any of these questions.


<pb n="221"/>

</p><p>It was unpleasantly cold, and he was glad to slip his
coat on again.  The small revolver was still in his hip
pocket.  Another thought occurred to him&mdash;that he should
have provided himself with tennis shoes.  However, it was
some comfort to know that rubber heels of a nationally
advertised brand were under him.  He crawled quietly up
to the sill of one of the windows.  It was closed, and
the room inside was dark.  A blind was pulled most of the
way down, leaving a gap of about four inches.  Peeping
cautiously over the sill, he could see farther inside the
house a brightly lit door and a passageway.
</p><p>"One thing I've got to look out for," he thought, "is
children. There are bound to be some&mdash;who ever heard of
a German without offspring?  If I wake them, they'll
bawl.  This room is very likely a nursery, as it's on the
southeastern side.  Also, the window is shut tight, which
is probably the German idea of bedroom ventilation."
</p><p>His guess may not have been a bad one, for after his
eyes became accustomed to the dimness of the room he
thought he could perceive two cot beds.  He then crawled
over to the other window.  Here the blind was pulled down
flush with the bottom of the sash.  Trying the window
very cautiously, he found it locked.  Not knowing just
what to do, he returned to the first window,

<pb n="222"/>
and lay
there peering in.  The sill was just high enough above
the roof level to make it necessary to raise himself a
little on his hands to see inside, and the position was
very trying.  Moreover, the tin roof had a tendency to
crumple noisily when he moved.  He lay for some time,
shivering in the chill, and wondering whether it would be
safe to light a pipe.
</p><p>"There's another thing I'd better look out for," he
thought, "and that's a dog.  Who ever heard of a German
without a dachshund?"
</p><p>He had watched the lighted doorway for a long while
without seeing anything, and was beginning to think he
was losing time to no profit when a stout and not
ill-natured looking woman appeared in the hallway.  She
came into the room he was studying, and closed the door.
She switched on the light, and to his horror began to
disrobe.  This was not what he had counted on at all, and
he retreated rapidly.  It was plain that nothing was to
be gained where he was.  He sat timidly at one edge of
the roof and wondered what to do next.
</p><p>As he sat there, the back door opened almost directly
below him, and he heard the clang of a garbage can set
out by the stoop.  The door stood open for perhaps half
a minute, and he heard a male voice&mdash;Weintraub's, he
thought&mdash;speaking

<pb n="223"/>
in German.  For the first time in
his life he yearned for the society of his German
instructor at college, and also wondered&mdash;in the rapid
irrelevance of thought&mdash;what that worthy man was now
doing to earn a living. In a rather long and poorly
lubricated sentence, heavily verbed at the end, he
distinguished one phrase that seemed important.  <hi rend="italic">"Nach
Philadelphia gehen"</hi>&mdash;"Go to Philadelphia."
</p><p>Did that refer to Mifflin?  he wondered.
</p><p>The door closed again.  Leaning over the rain-gutter,
he saw the light go out in the kitchen.  He tried to look
through the upper portion of the window just below him,
but leaning out too far, the tin spout gave beneath his
hands.  Without knowing just how he did it, he slithered
down the side of the wall, and found his feet on a
window-sill.  His hands still clung to the tin gutter
above.  He made haste to climb down from his position,
and found himself outside the back door.  He had managed
the descent rather more quietly than if it had been
carefully planned.  But he was badly startled, and
retreated to the bottom of the yard to see if he had
aroused notice.
</p><p>A wait of several minutes brought no alarm, and he
plucked up courage.  On the inner side of the house&mdash;away
from Wordsworth Avenue&mdash;a narrow paved passage led to an
outside cellar-way

<pb n="224"/>
with old-fashioned slanting
doors.  He reconnoitred this warily.  A bright light was
shining from a window in this alley.  He crept below it
on hands and knees fearing to look in until he had
investigated a little.  He found that one flap of the
cellar door was open, and poked his nose into the
aperture.  All was dark below, but a strong, damp stench
of paints and chemicals arose.  He sniffed gingerly.  "I
suppose he stores drugs down there," he thought.
</p><p>Very carefully he crawled back, on hands and knees,
toward the lighted window.  Lifting his head a few inches
at a time, finally he got his eyes above the level of the
sill.  To his disappointment he found the lower half of
the window frosted.  As he knelt there, a pipe set in the
wall suddenly vomited liquid which gushed out upon his
knees.  He sniffed it, and again smelled a strong aroma
of acids.  With great care, leaning against the brick
wall of the house, he rose to his feet and peeped through
the upper half of the pane.
</p><p>It seemed to be the room where prescriptions were
compounded.  As it was empty, he allowed himself a hasty
survey.  All manner of bottles were ranged along the
walls; there was a high counter with scales, a desk, and
a sink.  At the back he could see the bamboo curtain
which he remembered having noticed from the shop.  The


<pb n="225"/>
whole place was in the utmost disorder: mortars,
glass beakers, a typewriter, cabinets of labels, dusty
piles of old prescriptions strung on filing hooks, papers
of pills and capsules, all strewn in an indescribable
litter.  Some infusion was heating in a glass bowl
propped on a tripod over a blue gas flame.  Aubrey
noticed particularly a heap of old books several feet
high piled carelessly at one end of the counter.
</p><p>Looking more carefully, he saw that what he had taken
for a mirror over the prescription counter was an
aperture looking into the shop.  Through this he could
see Weintraub, behind the cigar case, waiting upon some
belated customer with his shop-worn air of affability.
The visitor departed, and Weintraub locked the door after
him and pulled down the blinds.  Then he returned toward
the prescription room, and Aubrey ducked out of view.
</p><p>Presently he risked looking again, and was just in
time to see a curious sight.  The druggist was bending
over the counter, pouring some liquid into a glass
vessel.  His face was directly under a hanging bulb, and
Aubrey was amazed at the transformation.  The apparently
genial apothecary of cigarstand and soda fountain was
gone.  He saw instead a heavy, cruel, jowlish face, with
eyelids hooded down over the eyes, and a square


<pb n="226"/>
thrusting chin buttressed on a mass of jaw and
suetty cheek that glistened with an oily shimmer.  The
jaw quivered a little as though with some intense
suppressed emotion.  The man was completely absorbed in
his task. The thick lower lip lapped upward over the
mouth.  On the cheekbone was a deep red scar.  Aubrey
felt a pang of fascinated amazement at the gross energy
and power of that abominable relentless mask.
</p><p>"So this is the harmless old thing!" he thought.
</p><p>Just then the bamboo curtain parted, and the woman
whom he had seen upstairs appeared.  Forgetting his own
situation, Aubrey still stared.  She wore a faded
dressing gown and her hair was braided as though for the
night.  She looked frightened, and must have spoken, for
Aubrey saw her lips move.  The man remained bent over his
counter until the last drops of liquid had run out.  His
jaw tightened, he straightened suddenly and took one step
toward her, with outstretched hand imperiously pointed.
Aubrey could see his face plainly: it had a savagery more
than bestial.  The woman's face, which had borne a timid,
pleading expression, appealed in vain against that fierce
gesture.  She turned and vanished.  Aubrey saw the
druggist's pointing finger tremble.  Again he ducked out
of sight.  "That man's face would be lonely in a crowd,"


<pb n="227"/>
he said to himself.  "And I used to think the movies
exaggerated things.  Say, he ought to play opposite Theda
Bara."
</p><p>He lay at full length in the paved alley and thought
that a little acquaintance with Weintraub would go a long
way.  Then the light in the window above him went out,
and he gathered himself together for quick motion if
necessary.  Perhaps the man would come out to close the
cellar door&mdash;
</p><p>The thought was in his mind when a light flashed on
farther down the passage, between him and the kitchen.
It came from a small barred window on the ground level.
Evidently the druggist had gone down into the cellar.
Aubrey crawled silently along toward the yard.  Reaching
the lit pane he lay against the wall and looked in.
</p><p>The window was too grimed for him to see clearly, but
what he could make out had the appearance of a chemical
laboratory and machine shop combined.  A long work bench
was lit by several electrics.  On it he saw glass vials
of odd shapes, and a medley of tools.  Sheets of tin,
lengths of lead pipe, gas burners, a vise, boilers and
cylinders, tall jars of coloured fluids.  He could hear
a dull humming sound, which he surmised came from some
sort of revolving tool which he could see was run by a
belt from a motor.

<pb n="228"/>
On trying to spy more clearly he
found that what he had taken for dirt was a coat of
whitewash which had been applied to the window on the
inside, but the coating had worn away in one spot which
gave him a loophole.  What surprised him most was to spy
the covers of a number of books strewn about the work
table.  One, he was ready to swear, was the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell.</hi> He
knew that bright blue cloth by this time.
</p><p>For the second time that evening Aubrey wished for
the presence of one of his former instructors.  "I wish
I had my old chemistry professor here," he thought.  "I'd
like to know what this bird is up to.  I'd hate to
swallow one of his prescriptions."
</p><p>His teeth were chattering after the long exposure and
he was wet through from lying in the little gutter that
apparently drained off from the sink in Weintraub's
prescription laboratory.  He could not see what the
druggist was doing in the cellar, for the man's broad
back was turned toward him.  He felt as though he had had
quite enough thrills for one evening.  Creeping along he
found his way back to the yard, and stepped cautiously
among the empty boxes with which it was strewn.  An
elevated train rumbled overhead, and he watched the
brightly lighted cars swing by.  While the train roared
above him, he scrambled up the fence and dropped down
into the alley.


<pb n="229"/>

</p><p>"Well," he thought, "I'd give full-page space,
preferred position, in the magazine Ben Franklin founded
to the guy that'd tell me what's going on at this grand
bolshevik headquarters.  It looks to me as though they're
getting ready to blow the Octagon Hotel off the map."
</p><p>He found a little confectionery shop on Wordsworth
Avenue that was still open, and went in for a cup of hot
chocolate to warm himself. "The expense account on this
business is going to be rather heavy," he said to
himself.  "I think I'll have to charge it up to the
Daintybits account.  Say, old Grey Matter gives service
that's <hi rend="italic">different,</hi> don't she!  We not only keep Chapman's
goods in the public eye, but we face all the horrors of
Brooklyn to preserve his family from unlawful occasions.
No, I don't like the company that bookseller runs with.
If <hi rend="italic">`nach Philadelphia'</hi> is the word, I think I'll tag
along.  I guess it's off for Philadelphia in the
morning!"
 </p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII
<lb/>
THE BATTLE OF LUDLOW STREET</head>

<p>Rarely was a more genuine tribute paid to entrancing
girlhood than when Aubrey compelled himself, by sheer
force of will and the ticking of his subconscious
time-sense, to wake at six o'clock the next morning.  For
this young man took sleep seriously and with a primitive
zest.  It was to him almost a religious function.  As a
minor poet has said, he "made sleep a career."
</p><p>But he did not know what train Roger might be taking,
and he was determined not to miss him.  By a quarter
after six he was seated in the Milwaukee Lunch (which is
never closed&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Open from Now Till the Judgment Day.
Tables for Ladies,</hi> as its sign says) with a cup of coffee
and corned beef hash.  In the mood of tender melancholy
common to unaccustomed early rising he dwelt fondly on
the thought of Titania, so near and yet so far away.  He
had leisure to give free rein to these musings, for it
was ten past seven before Roger appeared, hurrying toward
the subway.  Aubrey

<pb n="231"/>
followed at a discreet
distance, taking care not to be observed.
</p><p>The bookseller and his pursuer both boarded the eight
o'clock train at the Pennsylvania Station, but in very
different moods.  To Roger, this expedition was a frolic,
pure and simple.  He had been tied down to the bookshop
so long that a day's excursion seemed too good to be
true.  He bought two cigars&mdash;an unusual luxury&mdash;and let
the morning paper lie unheeded in his lap as the train
drummed over the Hackensack marshes.  He felt a good deal
of pride in having been summoned to appraise the Oldham
library.  Mr. Oldham was a very distinguished collector,
a wealthy Philadelphia merchant whose choice Johnson,
Lamb, Keats, and Blake items were the envy of
connoisseurs all over the world.  Roger knew very well
that there were many better-known dealers who would have
jumped at the chance to examine the collection and pocket
the appraiser's fee.  The word that Roger had had by long
distance telephone was that Mr. Oldham had decided to
sell his collection, and before putting it to auction
desired the advices of an expert as to the prices his
items should command in the present state of the market.
And as Roger was not particularly conversant with current
events in the world of rare books and manuscripts, he
spent most of the

<pb n="232"/>
trip in turning over some
annotated catalogues of recent sales which Mr. Chapman
had lent him.  "This invitation," he said to himself,
"confirms what I have always said, that the artist, in
any line of work, will eventually be recognized above the
mere tradesman.  Somehow or other Mr. Oldham has heard
that I am not only a seller of old books but a lover of
them.  He prefers to have me go over his treasures with
him, rather than one of those who peddle these things
like so much tallow."
</p><p>Aubrey's humour was far removed from that of the
happy bookseller. In the first place, Roger was sitting
in the smoker, and as Aubrey feared to enter the same car
for fear of being observed, he had to do without his
pipe.  He took the foremost seat in the second coach, and
peering occasionally through the glass doors he could see
the bald poll of his quarry wreathed with exhalements of
cheap havana.  Secondly, he had hoped to see Weintraub on
the same train, but though he had tarried at the
train-gate until the last moment, the German had not
appeared.  He had concluded from Weintraub's words the
night before that druggist and bookseller were bound on
a joint errand.  Apparently he was mistaken.  He bit his
nails, glowered at the flying landscape, and revolved
many grievous fancies in his prickling bosom.

<pb n="233"/>
Among
other discontents was the knowledge that he did not have
enough money with him to pay his fare back to New York,
and he would either have to borrow from someone in
Philadelphia or wire to his office for funds.  He had not
anticipated, when setting out upon this series of
adventures, that it would prove so costly.
</p><p>The train drew into Broad Street station at ten
o'clock, and Aubrey followed the bookseller through the
bustling terminus and round the City Hall plaza.  Mifflin
seemed to know his way, but Philadelphia was
comparatively strange to the Grey-Matter solicitor.  He
was quite surprised at the impressive vista of South
Broad Street, and chagrined to find people jostling him
on the crowded pavement as though they did not know he
had just come from New York.
</p><p>Roger turned in at a huge office building on Broad
Street and took an express elevator.  Aubrey did not dare
follow him into the car, so he waited in the lobby.  He
learned from the starter that there was a second tier of
elevators on the other side of the building, so he tipped
a boy a quarter to watch them for him, describing Mifflin
so accurately that he could not be missed.  By this time
Aubrey was in a thoroughly ill temper, and enjoyed
quarrelling with the starter on the subject of indicators
for showing the position of

<pb n="234"/>
the elevators.
Observing that in this building the indicators were glass
tubes in which the movement of the car was traced by a
rising or falling column of coloured fluid, Aubrey
remarked testily that that old-fashioned stunt had long
been abandoned in New York. The starter retorted that New
York was only two hours away if he liked it better.  This
argument helped to fleet the time rapidly.
</p><p>Meanwhile Roger, with the pleasurable sensation of
one who expects to be received as a distinguished visitor
from out of town, had entered the luxurious suite of Mr.
Oldham.  A young lady, rather too transparently
shirtwaisted but fair to look upon, asked what she could
do for him.
</p><p>"I want to see Mr. Oldham."
</p><p>"What name shall I say?"
</p><p>"Mr. Mifflin&mdash;Mr. Mifflin of Brooklyn."
</p><p>"Have you an appointment?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>Roger sat down with agreeable anticipation.  He
noticed the shining mahogany of the office furniture, the
sparkling green jar of drinking water, the hushed and
efficient activity of the young ladies.  "Philadelphia
girls are amazingly comely," he said to himself, "but
none of these can hold a candle to Miss Titania."
</p><p>The young lady returned from the private office
looking a little perplexed.


<pb n="235"/>

</p><p>"Did you have an appointment with Mr. Oldham?" she
said. "He doesn't seem to recall it."
</p><p>"Why, certainly," said Roger.  "It was arranged by
telephone on Saturday afternoon.  Mr. Oldham's secretary
called me up."
</p><p>"Have I got your name right?" she asked, showing a
slip on which she had written Mr. Miflin.
</p><p>"Two f's," said Roger.  "Mr. Roger Mifflin, the
bookseller."
</p><p>The girl retired, and came back a moment later.
</p><p>"Mr. Oldham's very busy," she said, "but he can see
you for a moment."
</p><p>Roger was ushered into the private office, a large,
airy room lined with bookshelves.  Mr. Oldham, a tall,
thin man with short gray hair and lively black eyes, rose
courteously from his desk.
</p><p>"How do you do, sir," he said.  "I'm sorry, I had
forgotten our appointment."
</p><p>"He must be very absent minded," thought Roger.
"Arranges to sell a collection worth half a million, and
forgets all about it."
</p><p>"I came over in response to your message," he said.
"About selling your collection."
</p><p>Mr. Oldham looked at him, rather intently, Roger
thought.
</p><p>"Do you want to buy it?" he said.
</p><p>"To buy it?" said Roger, a little peevishly.


<pb n="236"/>
"Why, no.  I came over to appraise it for you.  Your
secretary telephoned me on Saturday."
</p><p>"My dear sir," replied the other, "there must be some
mistake.  I have no intention of selling my collection.
I never sent you a message."
</p><p>Roger was aghast.
</p><p>"Why," he exclaimed, "your secretary called me up on
Saturday and said you particularly wanted me to come over
this morning, to examine your books with you.  I've made
the trip from Brooklyn for that purpose."
</p><p>Mr. Oldham touched a buzzer, and a middle-aged woman
came into the office.  "Miss Patterson," he said, "did
you telephone to Mr. Mifflin of Brooklyn on Saturday,
asking him&mdash;"
</p><p>"It was a man that telephoned," said Roger.
</p><p>"I'm exceedingly sorry, Mr. Mifflin," said Mr.
Oldham.  "More sorry than I can tell you&mdash;I'm afraid
someone has played a trick on you. As I told you, and
Miss Patterson will bear me out, I have no idea of
selling my books, and have never authorized any one even
to suggest such a thing."
</p><p>Roger was filled with confusion and anger.  A hoax on
the part of some of the Corn Cob Club, he thought to
himself.  He flushed painfully to recall the simplicity
of his glee.
</p><p>"Please don't be embarrassed," said Mr. Oldham,
seeing the little man's vexation.  "Don't

<pb n="237"/>
let's
consider the trip wasted.  Won't you come out and dine
with me in the country this evening, and see my things?"
</p><p>But Roger was too proud to accept this balm,
courteous as it was.
</p><p>"I'm sorry," he said, "but I'm afraid I can't do it.
I'm rather busy at home, and only came over because I
believed this to be urgent."
</p><p>"Some other time, perhaps," said Mr. Oldham.  "Look
here, you're a bookseller?  I don't believe I know your
shop.  Give me your card. The next time I'm in New York
I'd like to stop in."
</p><p>Roger got away as quickly as the other's politeness
would let him. He chafed savagely at the awkwardness of
his position.  Not until he reached the street again did
he breathe freely.
</p><p>"Some of Jerry Gladfist's tomfoolery, I'll bet a
hat," he muttered. "By the bones of Fanny Kelly, I'll
make him smart for it."
</p><p>Even Aubrey, picking up the trail again, could see
that Roger was angry.
</p><p>"Something's got his goat," he reflected.  "I wonder
what he's peeved about?"
</p><p>They crossed Broad Street and Roger started off down
Chestnut. Aubrey saw the bookseller halt in a doorway to
light his pipe, and stopped some yards behind him to look
up at the statue of William Penn on the City Hall.  It
was a blustery

<pb n="238"/>
day, and at that moment a gust of
wind whipped off his hat and sent it spinning down Broad
Street.  He ran half a block before he recaptured it.
When he got back to Chestnut, Roger had disappeared.  He
hurried down Chestnut Street, bumping pedestrians in his
eagerness, but at Thirteenth he halted in dismay.
Nowhere could he see a sign of the little bookseller.  He
appealed to the policeman at that corner, but learned
nothing.  Vainly he scoured the block and up and down
Juniper Street.  It was eleven o'clock, and the streets
were thronged.
</p><p>He cursed the book business in both hemispheres,
cursed himself, and cursed Philadelphia.  Then he went
into a tobacconist's and bought a packet of cigarettes.
</p><p>For an hour he patrolled up and down Chestnut Street,
on both sides of the way, thinking he might possibly
encounter Roger.  At the end of this time he found
himself in front of a newspaper office, and remembered
that an old friend of his was an editorial writer on the
staff.  He entered, and went up in the elevator.
</p><p>He found his friend in a small grimy den, surrounded
by a sea of papers, smoking a pipe with his feet on the
table.  They greeted each other joyfully.
</p><p>"Well, look who's here!" cried the facetious


<pb n="239"/>
journalist. "Tamburlaine the Great, and none other!
What brings you to this distant outpost?"
</p><p>Aubrey grinned at the use of his old college
nickname.
</p><p>"I've come to lunch with you, and borrow enough money
to get home with."
</p><p>"On Monday?" cried the other.  "Tuesday being the day
of stipend in these quarters?  Nay, say not so!"
</p><p>They lunched together at a quiet Italian restaurant,
and Aubrey narrated tersely the adventures of the past
few days.  The newspaper man smoked pensively when the
story was concluded.
</p><p>"I'd like to see the girl," he said.  "Tambo, your
tale hath the ring of sincerity.  It is full of sound and
fury, but it signifieth something.  You say your man is
a second-hand bookseller?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Then I know where you'll find him."
</p><p>"Nonsense!"
</p><p>"It's worth trying.  Go up to Leary's, 9 South Ninth.
It's right on this street.  I'll show you."
</p><p>"Let's go," said Aubrey promptly.
</p><p>"Not only that," said the other, "but I'll lend you
my last V.  Not for your sake, but on behalf of the girl.
Just mention my name to her, will you?
</p><p>"Right up the block," he pointed as they reached
Chestnut Street. "No, I won't come with you,


<pb n="240"/>
Wilson's speaking to Congress to-day, and there's
big stuff coming over the wire.  So long, old man. Invite
me to the wedding!"
</p><p>Aubrey had no idea what Leary's was, and rather
expected it to be a tavern of some sort.  When he reached
the place, however, he saw why his friend had suggested
it as a likely lurking ground for Roger.  It would be as
impossible for any bibliophile to pass this famous
second-hand bookstore as for a woman to go by a wedding
party without trying to see the bride.  Although it was
a bleak day, and a snell wind blew down the street, the
pavement counters were lined with people turning over
disordered piles of volumes. Within, he could see a vista
of white shelves, and the many-coloured tapestry of
bindings stretching far away to the rear of the building.
</p><p>He entered eagerly, and looked about.  The shop was
comfortably busy, with a number of people browsing.  They
seemed normal enough from behind, but in their eyes he
detected the wild, peering glitter of the bibliomaniac.
Here and there stood members of the staff.  Upon their
features Aubrey discerned the placid and philosophic
tranquillity which he associated with second-hand
booksellers&mdash;all save Mifflin.
</p><p>He paced through the narrow aisles, scanning the
blissful throng of seekers.  He went down to

<pb n="241"/>
the
educational department in the basement, up to the medical
books in the gallery, even back to the sections of Drama
and Pennsylvania History in the raised quarterdeck at the
rear.  There was no trace of Roger.
</p><p>At a desk under the stairway he saw a lean, studious,
and kindly-looking bibliosoph, who was poring over an
immense catalogue.  An idea struck him.
</p><p>"Have you a copy of Carlyle's <hi rend="italic">Letters and Speeches of
Oliver Cromwell?"</hi> he asked.
</p><p>The other looked up.
</p><p>"I'm afraid we haven't," he said.  "Another gentleman
was in here asking for it just a few minutes ago."
</p><p>"Good God!" cried Aubrey.  "Did he get it?"
</p><p>This emphasis brought no surprise to the bookseller,
who was accustomed to the oddities of edition hunters.
</p><p>"No," he said.  "We didn't have a copy.  We haven't
seen one for a long time."
</p><p>"Was he a little bald man with a red beard and bright
blue eyes?" asked Aubrey hoarsely.
</p><p>"Yes&mdash;Mr. Mifflin of Brooklyn.  Do you know him?"
</p><p>"I should say I do!" cried Aubrey.  "Where has he
gone?  I've been hunting him all over town, the
scoundrel!"


<pb n="242"/>

</p><p>The bookseller, douce man, had seen too many
eccentric customers to be shocked by the vehemence of his
questioner.
</p><p>"He was here a moment ago," he said gently, and gazed
with a mild interest upon the excited young advertising
man.  "I daresay you'll find him just outside, in Ludlow
Street."
</p><p>"Where's that?"
</p><p>The tall man&mdash;and I don't see why I should scruple to
name him, for it was Philip Warner&mdash;explained that Ludlow
Street was the narrow alley that runs along one side of
Leary's and elbows at right angles behind the shop.  Down
the flank of the store, along this narrow little street,
run shelves of books under a penthouse.  It is here that
Leary's displays its stock of ragamuffin
ten-centers&mdash;queer dingy volumes that call to the hearts
of gentle questers.  Along these historic shelves many
troubled spirits have come as near happiness as they are
like to get . . .  for after all, happiness (as the
mathematicians might say) lies on a curve, and we
approach it only by asymptote. . . .  The frequenters of
this alley call themselves whimsically The Ludlow Street
Business Men's Association, and Charles Lamb or Eugene
Field would have been proud to preside at their annual
dinners, at which the members recount their happiest
book-finds of the year.


<pb n="243"/>

</p><p>Aubrey rushed out of the shop and looked down the
alley.  Half a dozen Ludlow Street Business Men were
groping among the shelves. Then, down at the far end, his
small face poked into an open volume, he saw Roger.  He
approached with a rapid stride.
</p><p>"Well," he said angrily, "here you are!"
</p><p>Roger looked up from his book good-humouredly.
Apparently, in the zeal of his favourite pastime, he had
forgotten where he was.
</p><p>"Hullo!" he said.  "What are you doing in Brooklyn?
Look here, here's a copy of Tooke's <hi rend="italic">Pantheon&mdash;"</hi>
</p><p>"What's the idea?" cried Aubrey harshly.  "Are you
trying to kid me?  What are you and Weintraub framing up
here in Philadelphia?"
</p><p>Roger's mind came back to Ludlow Street.  He looked
with some surprise at the flushed face of the young man,
and put the book back in its place on the shelf, making
a mental note of its location.  His disappointment of the
morning came back to him with some irritation.
</p><p>"What are you talking about?" he said.  "What the
deuce business is it of yours?"
</p><p>"I'll make it my business," said Aubrey, and shook
his fist in the bookseller's face.  "I've been trailing
you, you scoundrel, and I want to know what kind of a
game you're playing."


<pb n="244"/>

</p><p>A spot of red spread on Roger's cheekbones.  In spite
of his apparent demureness he had a pugnacious spirit and
a quick fist.
</p><p>"By the bones of Charles Lamb!" he said.  "Young man,
your manners need mending.  If you're looking for display
advertising, I'll give you one on each eye."
</p><p>Aubrey had expected to find a cringing culprit, and
this back talk infuriated him beyond control.
</p><p>"You damned little bolshevik," he said, "if you were
my size I'd give you a hiding.  You tell me what you and
your pro-German pals are up to or I'll put the police on
you!"
</p><p>Roger stiffened.  His beard bristled, and his blue
eyes glittered.
</p><p>"You impudent dog," he said quietly, "you come round
the corner where these people can't see us and I'll give
you some private tutoring."
</p><p>He led the way round the corner of the alley.  In
this narrow channel, between blank walls, they confronted
each other.
</p><p>"In the name of Gutenberg," said Roger, calling upon
his patron saint, "explain yourself or I'll hit you."
</p><p>"Who's he?" sneered Aubrey.  "Another one of your
Huns?"
</p><p>That instant he received a smart blow on the chin,
which would have been much harder but

<pb n="245"/>
that Roger
misgauged his footing on the uneven cobbles, and hardly
reached the face of his opponent, who topped him by many
inches.
</p><p>Aubrey forgot his resolution not to hit a smaller
man, and also calling upon his patron saints&mdash;the
Associated Advertising Clubs of the World&mdash;he delivered
a smashing slog which hit the bookseller in the chest and
jolted him half across the alley.
</p><p>Both men were furiously angry&mdash;Aubrey with the
accumulated bitterness of several days' anxiety and
suspicion, and Roger with the quick-flaming indignation
of a hot-tempered man unwarrantably outraged.  Aubrey had
the better of the encounter in height, weight, and more
than twenty years juniority, but fortune played for the
bookseller.  Aubrey's terrific punch sent the latter
staggering across the alley onto the opposite curb.
Aubrey followed him up with a rush, intending to crush
the other with one fearful smite.  But Roger, keeping
cool, now had the advantage of position.  Standing on the
curb, he had a little the better in height.  As Aubrey
leaped at him, his face grim with hatred, Roger met him
with a savage buffet on the jaw.  Aubrey's foot struck
against the curb, and he fell backward onto the stones.
His head crashed violently on the cobbles, and the old
cut on his scalp broke out afresh.  Dazed and shaken,
there was, for the moment, no more fight in him.


<pb n="246"/>

</p><p>"You insolent pup," panted Roger, "do you want any
more?" Then he saw that Aubrey was really hurt.  With
horror he observed a trickle of blood run down the side
of the young man's face.
</p><p>"Good Lord," he said.  "Maybe I've killed him!"
</p><p>In a panic he ran round the corner to get Leary's
outside man, who stands in a little sentry box at the
front angle of the store and sells the outdoor books.
</p><p>"Quick," he said.  "There's a fellow back here badly
hurt."
</p><p>They ran back around the corner, and found Aubrey
walking rather shakily toward them.  Immense relief swam
through Roger's brain.
</p><p>"Look here," he said, "I'm awfully sorry&mdash;are you
hurt?"
</p><p>Aubrey glared whitely at him, but was too stunned to
speak.  He grunted, and the others took him one on each
side and supported him.  Leary's man ran inside the store
and opened the little door of the freight elevator at the
back of the shop.  In this way, avoiding notice save by
a few book-prowlers, Aubrey was carted into the shop as
though he had been a parcel of second-hand books.
</p><p>Mr. Warner greeted them at the back of the shop, a
little surprised, but gentle as ever.
</p><p>"What's wrong?" he said.


<pb n="247"/>

</p><p>"Oh, we've been fighting over a copy of Tooke's
Pantheon," said Roger.
</p><p>They led Aubrey into the little private office at the
rear.  Here they made him sit down in a chair and bathed
his bleeding head with cold water.  Philip Warner, always
resourceful, produced some surgical plaster.  Roger
wanted to telephone for a doctor.
</p><p>"Not on your life," said Aubrey, pulling himself
together.  "See here, Mr. Mifflin, don't flatter yourself
you gave me this cut on the skull.  I got that the other
evening on Brooklyn Bridge, going home from your damned
bookshop.  Now if you and I can be alone for a few
minutes, we've got to have a talk."

THE "CROMWELL" MAKES ITS LAST APPEARANCE</head>

<p>You utter idiot," said Roger, half an hour later.  "Why
didn't you tell me all this sooner?  Good Lord, man,
there's some devil's work going on!"
</p><p>"How the deuce was I to know you knew nothing about
it?" said Aubrey impatiently.  "You'll grant everything
pointed against you?  When I saw that guy go into the
shop with his own key, what could I think but that you
were in league with him?  Gracious, man, are you so
befuddled in your old books that you don't see what's
going on round you?"
</p><p>"What time did you say that was?" said Roger shortly.
</p><p>"One o'clock Sunday morning."
</p><p>Roger thought a minute.  "Yes, I was in the cellar
with Bock," he said.  "Bock barked, and I thought it was
rats.  That fellow must have taken an impression of the
lock and made himself a key.  He's been in the shop
hundreds of times, and could

<pb n="248"/>


<pb n="249"/>
easily do it.
That explains the disappearing Cromwell.  But <hi rend="italic">why?</hi>
What's the idea?"
</p><p>"For the love of heaven," said Aubrey.  "Let's get
back to Brooklyn as soon as we can.  God only knows what
may have happened.  Fool that I was, to go away and leave
those women all alone. Triple-distilled lunacy!"
</p><p>"My dear fellow," said Roger, "I was the fool to be
lured off by a fake telephone call.  Judging by what you
say, Weintraub must have worked that also."
</p><p>Aubrey looked at his watch.  "Just after three," he
said.
</p><p>"We can't get a train till four," said Roger.  "That
means we can't get back to Gissing Street until nearly
seven."
</p><p>"Call them up," said Aubrey.
</p><p>They were still in the private office at the rear of
Leary's. Roger was well-known in the shop, and had no
hesitation in using the telephone.  He lifted the
receiver.
</p><p>"Long Distance, please," he said.  "Hullo?  I want to
get Brooklyn, Wordsworth 1617-W."
</p><p>They spent a sour twenty-five minutes waiting for the
connection. Roger went out to talk with Warner, while
Aubrey fumed in the back office.  He could not sit still,
and paced the little room in a fidget of impatience,
tearing his watch out of his

<pb n="250"/>
pocket every few
minutes.  He felt dull and sick with vague fear.  To his
mind recurred the spiteful buzz of that voice over the
wire&mdash;"Gissing Street is not healthy for you."  He
remembered the scuffle on the Bridge, the whispering in
the alley, and the sinister face of the druggist at his
prescription counter.  The whole series of events seemed
a grossly fantastic nightmare, yet it frightened him.
"If only I were in Brooklyn," he groaned, "it wouldn't be
so bad.  But to be over here, a hundred miles away, in
another cursed bookshop, while that girl may be in
trouble&mdash;Gosh!" he muttered.  "If I get through this
business all right I'll lay off bookshops for the rest of
my life!"
</p><p>The telephone rang, and Aubrey frantically beckoned
to Roger, who was outside, talking.
</p><p>"Answer it, you chump!" said Roger.  "We'll lose the
connection!"
</p><p>"Nix," said Aubrey.  "If Titania hears my voice
she'll ring off. She's sore at me."
</p><p>Roger ran to the instrument.  "Hullo, hullo?" he
said, irritably. "Hullo, is that Wordsworth&mdash;?  Yes,
I'm calling Brooklyn&mdash;Hullo!"
</p><p>Aubrey, leaning over Roger's shoulder, could hear a
clucking in the receiver, and then, incredibly clear, a
thin, silver, distant voice.  How well he knew it!  It
seemed to vibrate in the air all about him.  He could
hear every syllable distinctly.  A

<pb n="251"/>
hot perspiration
burst out on his forehead and in the palms of his hands.
</p><p>"Hullo," said Roger.  "Is that Mifflin's Bookshop?"
</p><p>"Yes," said Titania.  "Is that you, Mr. Mifflin?
Where are you?"
</p><p>"In Philadelphia," said Roger.  "Tell me, is
everything all right?"
</p><p>"Everything's dandy," said Titania.  "I'm selling
loads of books. Mrs. Mifflin's gone out to do some
shopping."
</p><p>Aubrey shook to hear the tiny, airy voice, like a
trill of birdsong, like a tinkling from some distant
star.  He could imagine her standing at the phone in the
back of the shadowy bookshop, and seemed to see her as
though through an inverted telescope, very minute and
very perfect.  How brave and exquisite she was!
</p><p>"When are you coming home?" she was saying.
</p><p>"About seven o'clock," said Roger.  "Listen, is
everything absolutely O. K.?"
</p><p>"Why, yes," said Titania.  "I've been having lots of
fun.  I went down just now and put some coal on the
furnace.  Oh, yes.  Mr. Weintraub came in a little while
ago and left a suitcase of books. He said you wouldn't
mind.  A friend of his is going to call for them this
afternoon."


<pb n="252"/>

</p><p>"Hold the wire a moment," said Roger, and clapped his
hand over the mouthpiece.  "She says Weintraub left a
suitcase of books there to be called for.  What do you
make of that?"
</p><p>"For the love of God, tell her not to touch those
books."
</p><p>"Hullo?" said Roger.  Aubrey, leaning over him,
noticed that the little bookseller's naked pate was
ringed with crystal beads.
</p><p>"Hullo?" replied Titania's elfin voice promptly.
</p><p>"Did you open the suitcase?"
</p><p>"No.  It's locked.  Mr. Weintraub said there were a
lot of old books in it for a friend of his.  It's very
heavy."
</p><p>"Look here," said Roger, and his voice rang sharply.
"This is important.  I don't want you to touch that
suitcase.  Leave it wherever it is, and <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> touch it.
Promise me."
</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Mifflin.  Had I better put it in a safe
place?"
</p><p><hi rend="italic">"Don't touch it!"</hi>
</p><p>"Bock's sniffing at it now."
</p><p>"Don't touch it, and don't let Bock touch it.
It&mdash;it's got valuable papers in it."
</p><p>"I'll be careful of it," said Titania.
</p><p>"Promise me not to touch it.  And another thing&mdash;if
any one calls for it, don't let them take it until I get
home."


<pb n="253"/>

</p><p>Aubrey held out his watch in front of Roger.  The
latter nodded.
</p><p>"Do you understand?" he said.  "Do you hear me all
right?"
</p><p>"Yes, splendidly.  I think it's wonderful!  You know
I never talked on long distance before&mdash;"
</p><p>"Don't touch the bag," repeated Roger doggedly, "and
don't let any one take it until we&mdash;until I get back."
</p><p>"I promise," said Titania blithely.
</p><p>"Good-bye," said Roger, and set down the receiver.
His face looked curiously pinched, and there was
perspiration in the hollows under his eyes.  Aubrey held
out his watch impatiently.
</p><p>"We've just time to make it," cried Roger, and they
rushed from the shop.

</p><p>It was not a sprightly journey.  The train made its
accustomed detour through West Philadelphia and North
Philadelphia before getting down to business, and the two
voyagers felt a personal hatred of the brakemen who
permitted passengers from these suburbs to straggle
leisurely aboard instead of flogging them in with knotted
whips.  When the express stopped at Trenton, Aubrey could
easily have turned a howitzer upon that innocent city and
blasted it into rubble.  An unexpected stop at Princeton
Junction was the last

<pb n="254"/>
straw.  Aubrey addressed the
conductor in terms that were highly treasonable,
considering that this official was a government servant.
</p><p>The winter twilight drew in, gray and dreary, with a
threat of snow.  For some time they sat in silence, Roger
buried in a Philadelphia afternoon paper containing the
text of the President's speech announcing his trip to
Europe, and Aubrey gloomily recapitulating the schedule
of his past week.  His head throbbed, his hands were wet
with nervousness so that crumbs of tobacco adhered to
them annoyingly.
</p><p>"It's a funny thing," he said at last.  "You know I
never heard of your shop until a week ago to-day, and now
it seems like the most important place on earth.  It was
only last Tuesday that we had supper together, and since
then I've had my scalp laid open twice, had a desperado
lie in wait for me in my own bedroom, spent two night
vigils on Gissing Street, and endangered the biggest
advertising account our agency handles.  I don't wonder
you call the place haunted!"
</p><p>"I suppose it would all make good advertising copy?"
said Roger peevishly.
</p><p>"Well, I don't know" said Aubrey.  "It's a bit too
rough, I'm afraid.  How do you dope it out?"
</p><p>"I don't know what to think.  Weintraub has

<pb n="255"/>
run
that drug store for twenty years or more.  Years ago,
before I ever got into the book business, I used to know
his shop.  He was always rather interested in books,
especially scientific books, and we got quite friendly
when I opened up on Gissing Street.  I never fell for his
face very hard, but he always seemed quiet and
well-disposed.  It sounds to me like some kind of trade
in illicit drugs, or German incendiary bombs.  You know
what a lot of fires there were during the war&mdash;those big
grain elevators in Brooklyn, and so on."
</p><p>"I thought at first it was a kidnapping stunt," said
Aubrey.  "I thought you had got Miss Chapman planted in
your shop so that these other guys could smuggle her
away."
</p><p>"You seem to have done me the honour of thinking me
a very complete rascal," said Roger.
</p><p>Aubrey's lips trembled with irritable retort, but he
checked himself heroically.
</p><p>"What was your particular interest in the Cromwell
book?" he asked after a pause.
</p><p>"Oh, I read somewhere&mdash;two or three years ago&mdash;that
it was one of Woodrow Wilson's favourite books.  That
interested me, and I looked it up."
</p><p>"By the way," cried Aubrey excitedly, "I forgot to
show you those numbers that were written in the cover."
He pulled out his memorandum book, and showed the
transcript he had made.


<pb n="256"/>

</p><p>"Well, one of these is perfectly understandable,"
said Roger. "Here, where it says <hi rend="italic">329 ff. cf. W. W.</hi>  That
simply means `pages 329 and following, compare Woodrow
Wilson.' I remember jotting that down not long ago,
because that passage in the book reminded me of some of
Wilson's ideas.  I generally note down in the back of a
book the numbers of any pages that interest me specially.
These other page numbers convey nothing unless I had the
book before me."
</p><p>"The first bunch of numbers was in your handwriting,
then; but underneath were these others, in
Weintraub's&mdash;or at any rate in his ink.  When I saw that
he was jotting down what I took to be code stuff in the
backs of your books I naturally assumed you and he were
working together&mdash;"
</p><p>"And you found the cover in his drug store?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>Roger scowled.  "I don't make it out," he said.
"Well, there's nothing we can do till we get there.  Do
you want to look at the paper?  There's the text of
Wilson's speech to Congress this morning."
</p><p>Aubrey shook his head dismally, and leaned his hot
forehead against the pane.  Neither of them spoke again
until they reached Manhattan Transfer, where they changed
for the Hudson Terminal.
</p><p>It was seven o'clock when they hurried out of the
subway terminus at Atlantic Avenue.  It was a

<pb n="257"/>
raw,
damp evening, but the streets had already begun to bustle
with their nightly exuberance of light and colour.  The
yellow glitter of a pawnshop window reminded Aubrey of
the small revolver in his pocket.  As they passed a dark
alley, he stepped aside to load the weapon.
</p><p>"Have you anything of this sort with you?" he said,
showing it to Roger.
</p><p>"Good Lord, no," said the bookseller.  "What do you
think I am, a moving-picture hero?"
</p><p>Down Gissing Street the younger man set so rapid a
pace that his companion had to trot to keep abreast.  The
placid vista of the little street was reassuring.  Under
the glowing effusion of the shop windows the pavement was
a path of checkered brightness.  In Weintraub's pharmacy
they could see the pasty-faced assistant in his stained
white coat serving a beaker of hot chocolate.  In the
stationer's shop people were looking over trays of
Christmas cards. In the Milwaukee Lunch Aubrey saw (and
envied) a sturdy citizen peacefully dipping a doughnut
into a cup of coffee.
</p><p>"This all seems very unreal," said Roger.
</p><p>As they neared the bookshop, Aubrey's heart gave a
jerk of apprehension.  The blinds in the front windows
had been drawn down. A dull shining came through them,
showing that the lights were turned on inside.  But why
should the

<pb n="258"/>
shades be lowered with closing time three
hours away?
</p><p>They reached the front door, and Aubrey was about to
seize the handle when Roger halted him.
</p><p>"Wait a moment," he said.  "Let's go in quietly.
There may be something queer going on."
</p><p>Aubrey turned the knob gently.  The door was locked.
</p><p>Roger pulled out his latchkey and cautiously released
the bolt. Then he opened the door slightly&mdash;about an
inch.
</p><p>"You're taller than I am," he whispered.  "Reach up
and muffle the bell above the door while I open it."
</p><p>Aubrey thrust three fingers through the aperture and
blocked the trigger of the gong.  Then Roger pushed the
door wide, and they tiptoed in.
</p><p>The shop was empty, and apparently normal.  They
stood for an instant with pounding pulses.
</p><p>From the back of the house came a clear voice, a
little tremulous:
</p><p>"You can do what you like, I shan't tell you where it
is.  Mr. Mifflin said&mdash;"
</p><p>There followed the bang of a falling chair, and a
sound of rapid movement.
</p><p>Aubrey was down the aisle in a flash, followed by
Roger, who had delayed just long enough to

<pb n="259"/>
close the
door.  He tiptoed up the steps at the back of the shop
and looked into the dining room.  At the instant his eyes
took in the scene it seemed as though the whole room was
in motion.
</p><p>The cloth was spread for supper and shone white under
the drop lamp.  In the far corner of the room Titania was
struggling in the grasp of a bearded man whom Aubrey
instantly recognized as the chef.  On the near side of
the table, holding a revolver levelled at the girl, stood
Weintraub.  His back was toward the door.  Aubrey could
see the druggist's sullen jaw crease and shake with
anger.
</p><p>Two strides took him into the room.  He jammed the
muzzle of his pistol against the oily cheek.  "Drop it!"
he said hoarsely.  "You Hun!" With his left hand he
seized the man's shirt collar and drew it tight against
the throat.  In his tremor of rage and excitement his
arms felt curiously weak, and his first thought was how
impossible it would be to strangle that swinish neck.
</p><p>For an instant there was a breathless tableau.  The
bearded man still had his hands on Titania's shoulders.
She, very pale but with brilliant eyes, gazed at Aubrey
in unbelieving amazement. Weintraub stood quite
motionless with both hands on the dining table, as though
thinking.  He felt the cold bruise of metal against the
hollow of his cheek.

<pb n="260"/>
Slowly he opened his right
hand and his revolver fell on the linen cloth.  Then
Roger burst into the room.
</p><p>Titania wrenched herself away from the chef.
</p><p>"I wouldn't give them the suitcase!" she cried.
</p><p>Aubrey kept his pistol pinned against Weintraub's
face.  With his left hand he picked up the druggist's
revolver.  Roger was about to seize the chef, who was
standing uncertainly on the other side of the table.
</p><p>"Here," said Aubrey, "take this gun.  Cover this
fellow and leave that one to me.  I've got a score to
settle with him."
</p><p>The chef made a movement as though to jump through
the window behind him, but Aubrey flung himself upon him.
He hit the man square on the nose and felt a delicious
throb of satisfaction as the rubbery flesh flattened
beneath his knuckles.  He seized the man's hairy throat
and sank his fingers into it.  The other tried to snatch
the bread knife on the table, but was too late.  He fell
to the floor, and Aubrey throttled him savagely.
</p><p>"You blasted Hun," he grunted.  "Go wrestling with
girls, will you?"
</p><p>Titania ran from the room, through the pantry.
</p><p>Roger was holding Weintraub's revolver in front of
the German's face.
</p><p>"Look here," he said, "what does this mean?"


<pb n="261"/>

</p><p>"It's all a mistake," said the druggist suavely,
though his eyes slid uneasily to and fro.  "I just came
in to get some books I left here earlier in the
afternoon."
</p><p>"With a revolver, eh?" said Roger.  "Speak up,
Hindenburg, what's the big idea?"
</p><p>"It's not my revolver," said Weintraub.  "It's
Metzger's."
</p><p>"Where's this suitcase of yours?" said Roger.  "We're
going to have a look at it."
</p><p>"It's all a stupid mistake," said Weintraub.  "I left
a suitcase of old books here for Metzger, because I
expected to go out of town this afternoon.  He called for
it, and your young woman wouldn't give it to him.  He
came to me, and I came down here to tell her it was all
right."
</p><p>"Is that Metzger?" said Roger, pointing to the
bearded man who was trying to break Aubrey's grip.
"Gilbert, don't choke that man, we want him to do some
explaining."
</p><p>Aubrey got up, picked his revolver from the floor
where he had dropped it, and prodded the chef to his
feet.
</p><p>"Well, you swine," he said, "how did you enjoy
falling downstairs the other evening?  As for you, Herr
Weintraub, I'd like to know what kind of prescriptions
you make up in that cellar of yours."


<pb n="262"/>

</p><p>Weintraub's face shone damply in the lamplight.
Perspiration was thick on his forehead.
</p><p>"My dear Mifflin," he said, "this is awfully stupid.
In my eagerness, I'm afraid&mdash;"
</p><p>Titania ran back into the room, followed by Helen,
whose face was crimson.
</p><p>"Thank God you're back, Roger," she said.  "These
brutes tied me up in the kitchen and gagged me with a
roller-towel.  They threatened to shoot Titania if she
wouldn't give them the suitcase."
</p><p>Weintraub began to say something, but Roger thrust
the revolver between his eyes.
</p><p>"Hold your tongue!" he said.  "We're going to have a
look at those books of yours."
</p><p>"I'll get the suitcase," said Titania.  "I hid it.
When Mr. Weintraub came in and asked for it, at first I
was going to give it to him, but he looked so queer I
thought something must be wrong."
</p><p>"Don't you get it," said Aubrey, and their eyes met
for the first time.  "Show me where it is, and we'll let
friend Hun bring it."
</p><p>Titania flushed a little.  "It's in my bedroom
cupboard," she said.
</p><p>She led the way upstairs, Metzger following, and
Aubrey behind Metzger with his pistol ready.  Outside the
bedroom door Aubrey halted.  "Show him the suitcase and
let him pick it up," he said.

<pb n="263"/>
"If he makes a wrong
movement, call me, and I'll shoot him."
</p><p>Titania pointed out the suitcase, which she had
stowed at the back of her cupboard behind some clothes.
The chef showed no insubordination, and the three
returned downstairs.
</p><p>"Very well," said Roger.  "We'll go down in the shop
where we can see better.  Perhaps he's got a first folio
Shakespeare in here. Helen, you go to the phone and ring
up the McFee Street police station.  Ask them to send a
couple of men round here at once."
</p><p>"My dear Mifflin," said Weintraub, "this is very
absurd.  Only a few old books that I had collected from
time to time."
</p><p>"I don't call it absurd when a man comes into my
house and ties my wife up with clothesline and threatens
to shoot a young girl," said Roger.  "We'll see what the
police have to say about this, Weintraub.  Don't make any
mistake: if you try to bolt I'll blow your brains out."
</p><p>Aubrey led the way down into the shop while Metzger
carried the suitcase.  Roger and Weintraub followed, and
Titania brought up the rear.  Under a bright light in the
Essay alcove Aubrey made the chef lay the bag on the
table.
</p><p>"Open her up," he said curtly.
</p><p>"It's nothing but some old books," said Metzger.


<pb n="264"/>

</p><p>"If they're old enough they may be valuable," said
Roger.  "I'm interested in old books.  Look sharp!"
</p><p>Metzger drew a key from his pocket and unlocked the
bag.  Aubrey held the pistol at his head as he threw back
the lid.
</p><p>The suitcase was full of second-hand books closely
packed together. Roger, with great presence of mind, was
keeping his eyes on Weintraub.
</p><p>"Tell me what's in it," he said.
</p><p>"Why, it's only a lot of books, after all, " cried
Titania.
</p><p>"You see," said Weintraub surlily, "there's no
mystery about it. I'm sorry I was so&mdash;"
</p><p>"Oh, look!" said Titania; "There's the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>
book!"
</p><p>For an instant Roger forgot himself.  He looked
instinctively at the suitcase, and in that moment the
druggist broke away, ran down the aisle, and flew out of
the door.  Roger dashed after him, but was too late.
Aubrey was holding Metzger by the collar with the pistol
at his head.
</p><p>"Good God," he said, "why didn't you shoot?"


"I don't know" said Roger in confusion.  "I was afraid of
hitting him.  Never mind, we can fix him later."
</p><p>"The police will be here in a minute," said


<pb n="265"/>
Helen, calling from the telephone.  "I'm going to
let Bock in.  He's in the back yard."
</p><p>"I think they're both crazy," said Titania.  "Let's
put the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> back on the shelf and let this creature
go."  She put out her hand for the book.
</p><p>"Stop!" cried Aubrey, and seized her arm.  "Don't
touch that book!"
</p><p>Titania shrank back, frightened by his voice.  Had
everyone gone insane?
</p><p>"Here, Mr. Metzger," said Aubrey, "you put that book
back on the shelf where it belongs.  Don't try to get
away.  I've got this revolver pointed at you."
</p><p>He and Roger were both startled by the chef's face.
Above the unkempt beard his eyes shone with a half-crazed
lustre, and his hands shook.
</p><p>"Very well," he said.  "Show me where it goes."
</p><p>"I'll show you," said Titania.
</p><p>Aubrey put out his arm in front of the girl.  "Stay
where you are," he said angrily.
</p><p>"Down in the History alcove," said Roger.  "The front
alcove on the other side of the shop.  We've both got you
covered."
</p><p>Instead of taking the volume from the suitcase,
Metzger picked up the whole bag, holding it flat.  He
carried it to the alcove they indicated.  He

<pb n="266"/>
placed
the case carefully on the floor, and picked the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi>
volume out of it.
</p><p>"Where would you want it to go?" he said in an odd
voice.  "This is a valuable book."
</p><p>"On the fifth shelf," said Roger.  "Over there&mdash;"
</p><p>"For God's sake stand back," said Aubrey.  "Don't go
near him. There's something damnable about this."
</p><p>"You poor fools!" cried Metzger harshly.  "To hell
with you and your old books."  He drew his hand back as
though to throw the volume at them.
</p><p>There was a quick patter of feet, and Bock, growling,
ran down the aisle.  In the same instant, Aubrey, obeying
some unexplained impulse, gave Roger a violent push back
into the Fiction alcove, seized Titania roughly in his
arms, and ran with her toward the back of the shop.
</p><p>Metzger's arm was raised, about to throw the book,
when Bock darted at him and buried his teeth in the man's
leg.  The <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> fell from his hand.
</p><p>There was a shattering explosion, a dull roar, and
for an instant Aubrey thought the whole bookshop had
turned into a vast spinning top.  The floor rocked and
sagged, shelves of books were hurled in every direction.
Carrying Titania, he had just reached the steps leading
to the domestic

<pb n="267"/>
quarters when they were flung
sideways into the corner behind Roger's desk.  The air
was full of flying books.  A row of encyclopedias crashed
down upon his shoulders, narrowly missing Titania's head.
The front windows were shivered into flying streamers of
broken glass.  The table near the door was hurled into
the opposite gallery.  With a splintering crash the
corner of the gallery above the History alcove collapsed,
and hundreds of volumes cascaded heavily on to the floor.
The lights went out, and for an instant all was silence.
</p><p>"Are you all right?" said Aubrey hastily.  He and
Titania had fallen sprawling against the bookseller's
desk.
</p><p>"I think so," she said faintly.  "Where's Mr.
Mifflin?"
</p><p>Aubrey put out his hand to help her, and touched
something wet on the floor.  "Good heavens," he thought.
"She's dying!"  He struggled to his feet in the darkness.
"Hullo, Mr. Mifflin," he called, "where are you?"
</p><p>There was no answer.
</p><p>A beam of light gushed out from the passageway behind
the shop, and picking his way over fallen litter he found
Mrs. Mifflin standing dazed by the dining-room door.  In
the back of the house the lights were still burning.


<pb n="268"/>

</p><p>"For heaven's sake, have you a candle?" he said.
</p><p>"Where's Roger?" she cried piteously, and stumbled
into the kitchen.
</p><p>With a candle Aubrey found Titania sitting on the
floor, very faint, but unhurt.  What he had thought was
blood proved to be a pool of ink from a quart bottle that
had stood over Roger's desk. He picked her up like a
child and carried her into the kitchen. "Stay here and
don't stir," he said.
</p><p>By this time a crowd was already gathering on the
pavement.  Someone came in with a lantern.  Three
policemen appeared at the door.
</p><p>"For God's sake," cried Aubrey, "get a light in here
so we can see what's happened.  Mifflin's buried in this
mess somewhere.  Someone ring for an ambulance."
</p><p>The whole front of the Haunted Bookshop was a wreck.
In the pale glimmer of the lantern it was a disastrous
sight.  Helen groped her way down the shattered aisle.
</p><p>"Where was he?" she cried wildly.
</p><p>"Thanks to that set of Trollope," said a voice in the
remains of the Fiction alcove, "I think I'm all right.
Books make good shock-absorbers.  Is any one hurt?"
</p><p>It was Roger, half stunned, but undamaged.

<pb n="269"/>
He
crawled out from under a case of shelves that had
crumpled down upon him.
</p><p>"Bring that lantern over here," said Aubrey, pointing
to a dark heap lying on the floor under the broken
fragments of Roger's bulletin board.
</p><p>It was the chef.  He was dead.  And clinging to his
leg was all that was left of Bock.

<head>CHAPTER XV
<lb/>
MR. CHAPMAN WAVES HIS WAND</head>


<p>Gissing Street will not soon forget the explosion at the
Haunted Bookshop.  When it was learned that the cellar of
Weintraub's pharmacy contained just the information for
which the Department of Justice had been looking for four
years, and that the inoffensive German-American druggist
had been the artisan of hundreds of incendiary bombs that
had been placed on American and Allied shipping and in
ammunition plants&mdash;and that this same Weintraub had
committed suicide when arrested on Bromfield Street in
Boston the next day&mdash;Gissing Street hummed with
excitement.  The Milwaukee Lunch did a roaring business
among the sensation seekers who came to view the ruins of
the bookshop.  When it became known that fragments of a
cabin plan of the <hi rend="italic">George Washington</hi> had been found in
Metzger's pocket, and the confession of an accomplice on
the kitchen staff of the Octagon Hotel showed that the
bomb, disguised as a copy of one of Woodrow Wilson's
favourite books, was



<pb n="271"/>
to have been placed in the
Presidential suite of the steamship, indignation knew no
bounds.  Mrs. J. F. Smith left Mrs. Schiller's lodgings,
declaring that she would stay no longer in a pro-German
colony; and Aubrey was able at last to get a much-needed
bath.
</p><p>For the next three days he was too busy with agents
of the Department of Justice to be able to carry on an
investigation of his own that greatly occupied his mind.
But late on Friday afternoon he called at the bookshop to
talk things over.
</p><p>The debris had all been neatly cleared away, and the
shattered front of the building boarded up.  Inside,
Aubrey found Roger seated on the floor, looking over
piles of volumes that were heaped pell-mell around him.
Through Mr. Chapman's influence with a well-known firm of
builders, the bookseller had been able to get men to work
at once in making repairs, but even so it would be at
least ten days, he said, before he could reopen for
business.  "I hate to lose the value of all this
advertising," he lamented.  "It isn't often that a
second-hand bookstore gets onto the front pages of the
newspapers."
</p><p>"I thought you didn't believe in advertising," said
Aubrey.
</p><p>"The kind of advertising I believe in," said


<pb n="272"/>
Roger, "is the kind that doesn't cost you anything."
</p><p>Aubrey smiled as he looked round at the dismantled
shop.  "It seems to me that this'll cost you a tidy bit
when the bill comes in."
</p><p>"My dear fellow," said Roger, "This is just what I
needed.  I was getting into a rut.  The explosion has
blown out a whole lot of books I had forgotten about and
didn't even know I had.  Look, here's an old copy of <hi rend="italic">How
to Be Happy Though Married,</hi> which I see the publisher
lists as `Fiction.' Here's <hi rend="italic">Urn Burial,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Love
Affairs of a Bibliomaniac,</hi> and Mistletoe's <hi rend="italic">Book of
Deplorable Facts.</hi>  I'm going to have a thorough
house-cleaning.  I'm thinking seriously of putting in a
vacuum cleaner and a cash register. Titania was quite
right, the place was too dirty.  That girl has given me
a lot of ideas."
</p><p>Aubrey wanted to ask where she was, but didn't like
to say so point-blank.
</p><p>"There's no question about it," said Roger, "an
explosion now and then does one good.  Since the
reporters got here and dragged the whole yarn out of us,
I've had half a dozen offers from publishers for my book,
a lyceum bureau wants me to lecture on Bookselling as a
Form of Public Service, I've had five hundred letters
from people asking when the shop will reopen for
business, and the

<pb n="273"/>
American Booksellers' Association
has invited me to give an address at its convention next
spring.  It's the first recognition I've ever had. If it
weren't for poor dear old Bock&mdash;Come, we've buried him
in the back yard.  I want to show you his grave."
</p><p>Over a pathetically small mound near the fence a
bunch of big yellow chrysanthemums were standing in a
vase.
</p><p>"Titania put those there," said Roger.  "She says
she's going to plant a dogwood tree there in the spring.
We intend to put up a little stone for him, and I'm
trying to think of an inscription, I thought of <hi rend="italic">De
Mortuis Nil Nisi Bonum,</hi> but that's a bit too flippant."
</p><p>The living quarters of the house had not been damaged
by the explosion, and Roger took Aubrey back to the den.
"You've come just at the right time," he said.  "Mr.
Chapman's coming to dinner this evening, and we'll all
have a good talk.  There's a lot about this business I
don't understand yet."
</p><p>Aubrey was still keeping his eye open for a sign of
Titania's presence, and Roger noticed his wandering gaze.
</p><p>"This is Miss Chapman's afternoon off," he said.
"She got her first salary to-day, and was so much
exhilarated that she went to New York to

<pb n="274"/>
blow it in. She's out with her father.  Excuse me, please, I'm
going to help Helen get dinner ready."
</p><p>Aubrey sat down by the fire, and lit his pipe.  The
burden of his meditation was that it was just a week
since he had first met Titania, and in all that week
there had been no waking moment when he had not thought
of her.  He was wondering how long it might take for a
girl to fall in love?  A man&mdash;he knew now&mdash;could fall in
love in five minutes, but how did it work with girls?  He
was also thinking what unique Daintybits advertising copy
he could build (like all ad men he always spoke of
<hi rend="italic">building</hi> an ad, never of <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> one out
of this affair if he could only use the inside stuff.
</p><p>He heard a rustle behind him, and there she was.  She
had on a gray fur coat and a lively little hat.  Her
cheeks were delicately tinted by the winter air.  Aubrey
rose.
</p><p>"Why, Mr. Gilbert!" she said.  "Where have you been
keeping yourself when I wanted to see you so badly?  I
haven't seen you, not to talk to, since last Sunday."
</p><p>He found it impossible to say anything intelligible.
She threw off her coat, and went on, with a wistful
gravity that became her even more than smiles:


<pb n="275"/>

</p><p>"Mr. Mifflin has told me some more about what you did
last week&mdash;I mean, how you took a room across the street
and spied upon that hateful man and saw through the whole
thing when we were too blind to know what was going on.
And I want to apologize for the silly things I said that
Sunday morning.  Will you forgive me?"
</p><p>Aubrey had never felt his self-salesmanship ability
at such a low ebb.  To his unspeakable horror, he felt
his eyes betray him.  They grew moist.
</p><p>"Please don't talk like that," he said.  "I had no
right to do what I did, anyway.  And I was wrong in what
I said about Mr. Mifflin. I don't wonder you were angry."
</p><p>"Now surely you're not going to deprive me of the
pleasure of thanking you," she said.  "You know as well
as I do that you saved my life&mdash;all our lives, that
night.  I guess you'd have saved poor Bock's, too, if you
could."  Her eyes filled with tears.
</p><p>"If anybody deserves credit, it's you," he said.
"Why, if it hadn't been for you they'd have been away
with that suitcase and probably Metzger would have got
his bomb on board the ship and blown up the
President&mdash;"
</p><p>"I'm not arguing with you," she said.  "I'm just
thanking you."


<pb n="276"/>

</p><p>It was a happy little party that sat down in Roger's
dining room that evening.  Helen had prepared Eggs Samuel
Butler in Aubrey's honour, and Mr. Chapman had brought
two bottles of champagne to pledge the future success of
the bookshop.  Aubrey was called upon to announce the
result of his conferences with the secret service men who
had been looking up Weintraub's record.
</p><p>"It all seems so simple now," he said, "that I wonder
we didn't see through it at once.  You see, we all made
the mistake of assuming that German plotting would stop
automatically when the armistice was signed.  It seems
that this man Weintraub was one of the most dangerous
spies Germany had in this country.  Thirty or forty fires
and explosions on our ships at sea are said to have been
due to his work.  As he had lived here so long and taken
out citizen's papers, no one suspected him.  But after
his death, his wife, whom he had treated very brutally,
gave way and told a great deal about his activities.
According to her, as soon as it was announced that the
President would go to the Peace Conference, Weintraub
made up his mind to get a bomb into the President's cabin
on board the <hi rend="italic">George Washington.</hi>  Mrs. Weintraub tried to
dissuade him from it, as she was in secret opposed to
these murderous

<pb n="277"/>
plots of his, but he threatened to
kill her if she thwarted him.  She lived in terror of her
life.  I can believe it, for I remember her face when her
husband looked at her.
</p><p>"Of course to make the bomb was simple enough for
Weintraub.  He had an infernally complete laboratory in
the cellar of his house, where he had made hundreds.  The
problem was, how to make a bomb that would not look
suspicious, and how to get it into the President's
private cabin.  He hit on the idea of binding it into the
cover of a book.  How he came to choose that particular
volume, I don't know."
</p><p>"I think probably I gave him the idea quite
innocently," said Roger.  "He used to come in here a good
deal and one day he asked me whether Mr. Wilson was a
great reader.  I said that I believed he was, and then
mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell,</hi> which I had heard was one of
Wilson's favourite books.  Weintraub was much interested
and said he must read the book some day.  I remember now
that he stood in that alcove for some time, looking over
it."
</p><p>"Well," said Aubrey, "it must have seemed to him that
luck was playing into his hands.  This man Metzger, who
had been an assistant chef at the Octagon for years, was
slated to go on board the <hi rend="italic">George Washington</hi> with the
party of cooks

<pb n="278"/>
from that hotel who were to prepare
the President's meals.  Weintraub was informed of all
this from someone higher up in the German spy
organization. Metzger, who was known as Messier at the
hotel, was a very clever chef, and had fake passports as
a Swiss citizen.  He was another tool of the
organization.  By the original scheme there would have
been no direct communication between Weintraub and
Metzger, but the go-between was spotted by the Department
of Justice on another count, and is now behind bars at
Atlanta.
</p><p>"It seems that Weintraub had conceived the idea that
the least suspicious way of passing his messages to
Metzger would be to slip them into a copy of some book&mdash;a
book little likely to be purchased&mdash;in a second-hand
bookshop.  Metzger had been informed what the book was,
but&mdash;perhaps owing to the unexpected removal of the
go-between&mdash;did not know in which shop he was to find it.
That explains why so many booksellers had inquiries from
him recently for a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> volume.
</p><p>"Weintraub, of course, was not at all anxious to have
any direct dealings with Metzger, as the druggist had a
high regard for his own skin.  When the chef was finally
informed where the bookshop was in which he was to see
the book, he hurried over here. Weintraub had picked out
this shop

<pb n="279"/>
not only because it was as unlikely as any
place on earth to be suspected as a channel of spy codes,
but also because he had your confidence and could drop in
frequently without arousing surprise.  The first time
Metzger came here happened to be the night I dined with
you, as you remember."
</p><p>Roger nodded.  "He asked for the book, and to my
surprise, it wasn't there."
</p><p>"No: for the excellent reason that Weintraub had
taken it some days before, to measure it so he could
build his infernal machine to fit, and also to have it
rebound.  He needed the original binding as a case for
his bomb.  The following night, as you told me, it came
back.  He brought it himself, having provided himself
with a key to your front door."
</p><p>"It was gone again on Thursday night, when the Corn
Cob Club met here," said Mr. Chapman.
</p><p>"Yes, that time Metzger had taken it," said Aubrey.
"He misunderstood his instructions, and thought he was to
steal the book.  You see, owing to the absence of their
third man, they were working at cross purposes.  Metzger,
I think, was only intended to get his information out of
the book, and leave it where it was.  At any rate, he was
puzzled, and inserted that ad in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> the next
morning&mdash;that LOST ad, you remember.  By that, I imagine,
he intended to convey the idea

<pb n="280"/>
that he had located
the bookshop, but didn't know what to do next.  And the
date he mentioned in the ad, midnight on Tuesday,
December third, was to inform Weintraub (of whose
identity he was still ignorant) when Metzger was to go on
board the ship.  Weintraub had been instructed by their
spy organization to watch the LOST and FOUND ads."
</p><p>"Think of it!" cried Titania.
</p><p>"Well," continued Aubrey, "all this may not be 100
per cent. accurate, but after putting things together
this is how it dopes out.  Weintraub, who was as canny as
they make them, saw he'd have to get into direct touch
with Metzger.  He sent him word, on the Friday, to come
over to see him and bring the book.  Metzger, meanwhile,
had had a bad fright when I spoke to him in the hotel
elevator.  He returned the book to the shop that night,
as Mrs. Mifflin remembers.  Then, when I stopped in at
the drug store on my way home, he must have been with
Weintraub.  I found the <hi rend="italic">Cromwell</hi> cover in the drug-store
bookcase&mdash;why Weintraub was careless enough to leave it
there I can't guess&mdash;and they spotted me right away as
having some kind of hunch.  So they followed me over the
Bridge and tried to get rid of me.  It was because I got
that cover on Friday night that Weintraub broke into the


<pb n="281"/>
shop again early Sunday morning.  He had to have the
cover of the book to bind his bomb in."
</p><p>Aubrey was agreeably conscious of the close attention
of his audience.  He caught Titania's gaze, and flushed
a little.
</p><p>"That's pretty nearly all there is to it," he said.
"I knew that if those guys were so keen to put me out of
the way there must be something rather rotten on foot.
I came over to Brooklyn the next afternoon, Saturday, and
took a room across the street."
</p><p>"And we went to the movies," chirped Titania.
</p><p>"The rest of it I think you all know&mdash;except
Metzger's visit to my lodgings that night."  He described
the incident.  "You see they were trailing me pretty
close.  If I hadn't happened to notice the cigar at my
window I guess he'd have had me on toast.  Of course you
know how wrongly I doped it out.  I thought Mr. Mifflin
was running with them, and I owe him my apology for that.
He's laid me out once on that score, over in
Philadelphia."
</p><p>Humourously, Aubrey narrated how he had sleuthed the
bookseller to Ludlow Street, and had been worsted in
battle.
</p><p>"I think they counted on disposing of me sooner or
later," said Aubrey.  "They framed up that telephone call
to get Mr. Mifflin out of town.  The

<pb n="282"/>
point in having
Metzger come to the bookshop to get the suitcase was to
clear Weintraub's skirts if possible. Apparently it was
just a bag of old books.  The bombed book, I guess, was
perfectly harmless until any one tried to open it."
</p><p>"You both got back just in the nick of time," said
Titania admiringly.  "You see I was all alone most of the
afternoon. Weintraub left the suitcase about two o'clock.
Metzger came for it about six.  I refused to let him have
it.  He was very persistent, and I had to threaten to set
Bock at him.  It was all I could do to hold the dear old
dog in, he was so keen to go for Metzger.  The chef went
away, and I suppose he went up to see Weintraub about it.
I hid the suitcase in my room.  Mr. Mifflin had forbidden
me to touch it, but I thought that the safest thing to
do.  Then Mrs. Mifflin came in.  We let Bock into the
yard for a run, and were getting supper.  I heard the
bell ring, and went into the shop. There were the two
Germans, pulling down the shades.  I asked what they
meant by it, and they grabbed me and told me to shut up.
Then Metzger pointed a pistol at me while the other one
tied up Mrs. Mifflin."
</p><p>"The damned scoundrels!" cried Aubrey.  "They got
what was coming to them."
</p><p>"Well, my friends," said Mr. Chapman, "Let's


<pb n="283"/>
thank heaven that it ended no worse.  Mr. Gilbert,
I haven't told you yet how I feel about the whole affair.
That'll come later.  I'd like to propose the health of
Mr. Aubrey Gilbert, who is certainly the hero of this
film!"
</p><p>They drank the toast with cheers, and Aubrey blushed
becomingly.
</p><p>"Oh, I forgot something!" cried Titania.  "When I
went shopping this afternoon I stopped in at Brentano's,
and was lucky enough to find just what I wanted.  It's
for Mr. Gilbert, as a souvenir of the Haunted Bookshop."
</p><p>She ran to the sideboard and brought back a parcel.
</p><p>Aubrey opened it with delighted agitation.  It was a
copy of Carlyle's <hi rend="italic">Cromwell.</hi>  He tried to stammer his
thanks, but what he saw&mdash;or thought he saw&mdash;in Titania's
sparkling face&mdash;unmanned him.
</p><p>"The same edition!" said Roger.  "Now let's see what
those mystic page numbers are!  Gilbert, have you got
your memorandum?"
</p><p>Aubrey took out his notebook.  "Here we are," he
said.  "This is what Weintraub wrote in the back of the
cover."

<lb/>153 (3) 1,2,

</p><p>Roger glanced at the notation.
</p><p>"That ought to be easy," he said.  "You see



<pb n="284"/>

in
this edition three volumes are bound in one.  Let's look
at page 153 in the third volume, the first and second
lines."
</p><p>Aubrey turned to the place.  He read, and smiled.
</p><p>"Right you are," he said.
</p><p>"Read it!" they all cried.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">"To seduce the Protector's guard, to blow up the
Protector in his bedroom, and do other little fiddling
things."</hi>
</p><p>"I shouldn't wonder if that's where he got his idea,"
said Roger. "What have I been saying right along&mdash;that
books aren't merely dead things!"
</p><p>"Good gracious," said Titania.  "You told me that
books are explosives.  You were right, weren't you!  But
it's lucky Mr. Gilbert didn't hear you say it or he'd
certainly have suspected you!"
</p><p>"The joke is on me," said Roger.
</p><p>"Well, <hi rend="italic">I've</hi> got a toast to propose," said Titania.
"Here's to the memory of Bock, the dearest, bravest dog
I ever met!"
</p><p>They drank it with due gravity.
</p><p>"Well, good people," said Mr. Chapman, "there's
nothing we can do for Bock now.  But we can do something
for the rest of us.  I've been talking with Titania, Mr.
Mifflin.  I'm bound

<pb n="285"/>
to say that after this disaster
my first thought was to get her out of the book business
as fast as I could.  I thought it was a little too
exciting for her.  You know I sent her over here to have
a quiet time and calm down a bit.  But she wouldn't hear
of leaving.  And if I'm going to have a family interest
in the book business I want to do something to justify
it.  I know your idea about travelling book-wagons, and
taking literature into the countryside.  Now if you and
Mrs. Mifflin can find the proper people to run them, I'll
finance a fleet of ten of those Parnassuses you're always
talking about, and have them built in time to go on the
road next spring. How about it?"
</p><p>Roger and Helen looked at each other, and at Mr.
Chapman.  In a flash Roger saw one of his dearest dreams
coming true.  Titania, to whom this was a surprise,
leaped from her chair and ran to kiss her father, crying,
"Oh, Daddy, you <hi rend="italic">are</hi> a darling!"
</p><p>Roger rose solemnly and gave Mr. Chapman his hand.
</p><p>"My dear sir," he said, "Miss Titania has found the
right word. You are an honour to human nature, sir, and
I hope you'll never live to regret it.  This is the
happiest moment of my life."
</p><p>"Then that's settled," said Mr. Chapman.  "We'll go
over the details later.  Now there's

<pb n="286"/>
another thing
on my mind.  Perhaps I shouldn't bring up business
matters here, but this is a kind of family party&mdash;Mr.
Gilbert, it's my duty to inform you that I intend to take
my advertising out of the hands of the Grey-Matter
Agency."  Aubrey's heart sank.  He had feared a
catastrophe of this kind from the first.  Naturally a
hard-headed business man would not care to entrust such
vast interests to a firm whose young men went careering
about like secret service agents, hunting for spies,
eavesdropping in alleys, and accusing people of
pro-germanism. Business, Aubrey said to himself, is built
upon Confidence, and what confidence could Mr. Chapman
have in such vagabond and romantic doings?  Still, he
felt that he had done nothing to be ashamed of.
</p><p>"I'm sorry, sir," he said.  "We have tried to give
you service.  I assure you that I've spent by far the
larger part of my time at the office in working up plans
for your campaigns."
</p><p>He could not bear to look at Titania, ashamed that
she should be the witness of his humiliation.
</p><p>"That's exactly it," said Mr. Chapman.  "I don't want
just the larger part of your time.  I want all of it.  I
want you to accept the position of assistant advertising
manager of the Daintybits Corporation."
</p><p>They all cheered, and for the third time that


<pb n="287"/>
evening Aubrey felt more overwhelmed than any good
advertising man is accustomed to feel.  He tried to
express his delight, and then added:
</p><p>"I think it's my turn to propose a toast.  I give you
the health of Mr. and Mrs. Mifflin, and their Haunted
Bookshop, the place where I first&mdash;I first&mdash;"
</p><p>His courage failed him, and he concluded, "First
learned the meaning of literature."
</p><p>"Suppose we adjourn to the den," said Helen.  "We
have so many delightful things to talk over, and I know
Roger wants to tell you all about the improvements he is
planning for the shop."
</p><p>Aubrey lingered to be the last, and it is to be
conjectured that Titania did not drop her handkerchief
merely by accident.  The others had already crossed the
hall into the sitting room.
</p><p>Their eyes met, and Aubrey could feel himself drowned
in her steady, honest gaze.  He was tortured by the bliss
of being so near her, and alone.  The rest of the world
seemed to shred away and leave them standing in that
little island of light where the tablecloth gleamed under
the lamp.
</p><p>In his hand he clutched the precious book.  Out of
all the thousand things he thought, there was only one he
dared to say.


<pb n="288"/>

</p><p>"Will you write my name in it?"
</p><p>"I'd love to," she said, a little shakily, for she,
too, was strangely alarmed at certain throbbings.
</p><p>He gave her his pen, and she sat down at the table.
She wrote quickly

<lb/><hi rend="italic">For Aubrey Gilbert
<lb/>From Titania Chapman
<lb/>With much gr</hi>

</p><p>She paused.
</p><p>"Oh," she said quickly.  "Do I have to finish it
now?" She looked up at him, with the lamplight shining on
her vivid face.  Aubrey felt oddly stupefied, and was
thinking only of the little golden sparkle of her
eyelashes.  This time her eyes were the first to turn
away.
</p><p>"You see," she said with a funny little quaver, "I
might want to change the wording."  And she ran from the
room.
</p><p>As she entered the den, her father was speaking.
"You know," he said, "I'm rather glad she wants to stay
in the book business."  Roger looked up at her.
</p><p>"Well," he said, "I believe it agrees with her!  You
know, the beauty of living in a place like this is that
you get so absorbed in the books you don't have any
temptation to worry about anything

<pb n="289"/>
else.  The people in books become more real to you than any one
in actual life."  Titania, sitting on the arm of Mrs. Mifflin's
chair, took Helen's hand, unobserved by the others.  They
smiled at each other slyly.
