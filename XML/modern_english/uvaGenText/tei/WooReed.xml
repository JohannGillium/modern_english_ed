<head>CHAPTER I</head><pb n="1" id="f06114001"/>

<p>It was the spring of 1865, and the Civil War was almost<lb/>
over. Petersburg had been under siege since June, 1864. At<lb/>
this little Virginia city Robert E. Lee's half-starved, half-clad<lb/>
army -&ldquo;Lee's Miserables,&rdquo; they called themselves, in allusion to<lb/>
Victor Hugo's somber classic -had checked the advance toward<lb/>
Richmond, the Confederate capital, of the Union commander Ulysses<lb/>
S. Grant, who was determined to end the war by capturing the nerve<lb/>
center of southern resistance.</p>
<p>1.</p>
<pb n="2" id="f06114002"/>
<p>No longer did the high, canvas-covered wagons, drawn by six<lb/>
great horses decked with bells, rumble over the plank road into<lb/>
town with hogsheads of tobacco and sacks of corn and wheat. The<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">batteaux</hi>, similarly loaded, were gone from the canal and the river.<lb/>
The thriving tobacco factories had stopped operating: they had<lb/>
long since been converted into military hospitals. The siege,<lb/>
vigorous during the summer and fall, had dragged <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">wearily</add> through<lb/>
the winter.</p>
<p>During the cold weather, while military activity was al-<lb/>
most suspended, Petersburg was animated with the gaiety of<lb/>
people who did not know whether whey would live to see the next<lb/>
day. There were dances, weddings, entertainments -and,<lb/>
because of Grant's raids against the surrounding<lb/>
railroads, almost nothing to eat at any of them. When the occas-<lb/>
ional cannonades began, ladies took their reading and sewing and<lb/>
hurried to the &ldquo;bomb-proofs,&rdquo; holes six feet deep and covered with<lb/>
heavy timbers and packed earth, and listened quaking to the martial<lb/>
thunder.</p>
<p>Inaction might prevail at the siege, but the countryside<lb/>
around was ceaselessly, anxiously, on the alert. There was no<lb/>
telling when Union raiders, clad in their camp stained blue uni-<lb/>
forms, would trot into the yard and scour house and barn<lb/>
and grounds. The purpose of their raids was not only to provide<lb/>
Federal troops with necessities, but to prevent food, clothing and<lb/>
anything else of value from reaching the Confederates. It was no<lb/>
wonder that families developed considerable skill in concealing<lb/>
valuables. Important papers were jammed into chinks in the wood-<lb/>
pile, silver was tossed down the well, and food stuffed into cook-<lb/>

<pb n="3" id="f06114003"/>
ing u<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">t</add>ensils and hastily buried a couple of feed deep in the flow-<lb/>
er bed or vegetable patch. Livestock was driven into the thickest<lb/>
available woods, and hobbled. Then, when the raiders came, the<lb/>
report that others had been there before them had all the air of<lb/>
truth.</p>
<p>As the Yankees combed the country in widening circles in<lb/>
the early months of 1865, Lemuel Sutton Reed, the Methodist min-<lb/>
ister stationed at Lawrenceville, some fifty miles south of the<lb/>
siege, made what little provision a man of peace and a man of God<lb/>
could make to protect his property against enemy foragers. He<lb/>
told his two youngest sons, Walter and Christopher, so young that<lb/>
even the desperate Confederate army could not use them, to be<lb/>
ready to hide the horses on short notice in the thickets along<lb/>
the banks of the Meherrin River.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Walter had not been in bed long, but he realized, as<lb/>
he became conscious of the light shining weakly on his face, that<lb/>
he must have dropped asleep almost at once. He opened his eyes.<lb/>
His father, dressed only in his long white<lb/>
nightshirt, was bending over him, shading the candle with his hand.<lb/>
In the swift passage from sleep to waking, the thirteen year old<lb/>
boy noted, for the first time, how gray Pa had become in<lb/>
the last several years. His full, handsome beard, still as luxur-<lb/>
iant as ever, was grizzled, and his dark hair was heavily salted<lb/>
with white. Almost at the same moment he noticed that the blinds,<lb/>
open when he and Chris went to bed, were drawn now. In the waver-<lb/>
ing hollow of light, scooped by the candle out of the dark room,<lb/>
the bed posts loomed close, the rest of the furniture shrank into<lb/>
the protective dark.</p>
<p>3.</p>
<pb n="4" id="f06114004"/>
<p>Fully awake, Walter asked in a low voice, &ldquo;What is it, Pa?<lb/>
Is Ma sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brother Christopher, two years older than he, stirred on<lb/>
the other side of the big bed, and sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank heaven, it isn't your Ma. Joey Rogers is just in<lb/>
from the country. Sheridan's men were there today. He and Jeff<lb/>
got away with their team. They're down at the stable now, saddling<lb/>
Bess and Turnip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter and Christopher slipped out of bed and began drawing<lb/>
on their trousers. They knew what to do. For the last several<lb/>
weeks the saddle-bags, packed with cornbread and ham -nothing<lb/>
that would have to be cooked over a telltale fire -had been kept<lb/>
ready against the time when they might have to leave hurriedly<lb/>
to conceal the horses from the foragers.</p>
<p>As the boys dressed rapidly, the father's eyes were on his<lb/>
youngest son. Walter was a lean, wiry boy with blue eyes and<lb/>
straight brown hair. Good temper and quick-witted humor lay<lb/>
behind his serious and attentive expression. The shadow of the<lb/>
war, that had lain for so long over all of them, seemed to his<lb/>
father not to have darkened his youth, but rather to have touched<lb/>
it with a becoming gravity. The happy disposition, the generosity<lb/>
in thought and action, that had characterized him as a child were<lb/>
unaltered; but the discipline of hardship had made him strong be-<lb/>
yond his years.</p>
<p>The boys were dressed now. Pa hugged them both without a<lb/>
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't worry about anything. I'll take good care of Wal-<lb/>
ter, Pa,&rdquo; Chris promised him, pressing his hand. &ldquo;We'll be all<lb/>
right, and the horses, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will, son. You boys have always looked after<lb/>
4.<lb/>
<pb n="5" id="f06114005"/>
each other. I can trust you both to act wisely. Mr. Roger's Jeff<lb/>
will go with you to see where you hide. Then he'll come back to-<lb/>
morrow and fetch you more food, and let you know when it's safe<lb/>
to come out. Now off with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They slipped down the stairs, Pa leading the way with the<lb/>
candle. A quiet, hasty good-bye to Ma, and they were out in the<lb/>
damp spring night. The rain had been dripping down, softly, stead-<lb/>
ily, for a week, but tonight it had stopped and there was a thick<lb/>
mist. They made their way to the stable, where, feeling their way<lb/>
in the unfamiliar dark, Joey Rogers and Jeff, his father's young<lb/>
Negro boy, were saddling the horses. A few whispered words,<lb/>
and they were mounted, filing past the dark, wakeful house and<lb/>
down the village street.</p>
<p>The embrace of the sodden dark made Walter shiver.<lb/>
Through the black he could barely distinguish the bulk of the<lb/>
familiar houses on either side. There were no lights showing;<lb/>
apparently no one was astir. They rode past the deserted school-<lb/>
house -it had not opened at all this term -at a trot, and<del hand="unknown_hand">z</del> the<lb/>
horses' feet squelched loudly in the hock deep mud. The damp,<lb/>
fresh smell of the earth su<del hand="unknown_hand">bb</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">gg</add>ested spring, but there was nothing<lb/>
but hope to suggest that it would ever clear. The weather had<lb/>
made this road a mud-hole, but those leading into Petersburg, he<lb/>
had heard, were little better than morasses. Even the plank road<lb/>
was submerged in sticky red gumbo, stirred up by days of rain and<lb/>
renewed military operations.</p>
<p>Trotting along at the end of the short procession, with<lb/>
every sense alert to catch any sound that might mean someone was<lb/>
approaching, Walter forgot the wet and cold. As a matter of fact,<lb/>
he thought, we're very lucky to have such a murky night. No one<lb/>
5.<lb/>
<pb n="6" id="f06114006"/>
will be abroad on a night like this -except maybe another neigh-<lb/>
bor stealing off into hiding. In the dark he smiled to think what<lb/>
a fright they would give each other if they met.</p>
<p>A couple of miles out of town they turned off the main<lb/>
road into a lane that shortly dwindled to a wagon track. Low-<lb/>
growing branches smacked wet in their faces as Joey led them off<lb/>
the trail into a narrow path. The Negro boy began to sing<lb/>
softly, then to pray, a rapid chattering. Walter listened to him<lb/>
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Jeff!&rdquo; Joey told him sharply. &ldquo;Do you want to<lb/>
wake up the whole county?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy did not answer. He was quiet, but his teeth<lb/>
clicked together with chill and nervousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you cold, Jeff?&rdquo; Walter called softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's not cold -just scared to death,&rdquo; Joey's irate<lb/>
whisper carried back to him. &ldquo;He's afraid of the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter suppressed a chuckle. &ldquo;We don't have to be afraid<lb/>
of the dark, Jeff,&rdquo; he reassured him. &ldquo;It's the best friend we<lb/>
could have right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Yanks will ever find us on a ptichy night like this,&rdquo;<lb/>
Chris encouraged <del hand="unknown_hand">he</del> the frightened boy, &ldquo;and Yanks are all we've<lb/>
got to be scared of. The dark never hurt anybody. I hope you<lb/>
know where you're taking us, Joey,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've hunted all over this country,&rdquo; Joey told him. &ldquo;I<lb/>
bet I know every foot of it, light or dark or blindfold. We'll<lb/>
come out on a steep little bank at a bend in the river. It's deep<lb/>
there -good swimming and fishing -and the thickest trees you've<lb/>
ever seen in your life. No raiders, not even Sheridan's, are<lb/>
going to stumble across us there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>6.</p>
<pb n="7" id="f06114007"/>
<p>The woods seemed to be getting thicker, the night, if that<lb/>
were possible, blacker. Turnip struck his foot on a root, shook<lb/>
his head and blew indignantly. This was no kind of a jaunt for a<lb/>
respectable ministerial mount, even for a circuit rider's horse<lb/>
who was used to almost anything. Some of the boys' tension relaxed<lb/>
in the feeling of safety engendered by the thick darkness. Chris<lb/>
began to whistle almost inaudibly, and a tuneless hum from the<lb/>
front of the line indicated that Joey was busy with Dixie. But<lb/>
Jeff, unimpressed by the assurances of the white boys, who could<lb/>
know nothing of the sinister powers of the enveloping night, re-<lb/>
sumed his prayers.</p>
<p>Walter lost track of time and distance. For hours and<lb/>
miles, it seem<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>d to him, he had been warding off the swish of<lb/>
branches and straining his eyes into the absorbent blackness.<lb/>
He was beginning to be conscious of fatigue, but in spite of it<lb/>
felt increasingly alert, as though each nerve were becoming<lb/>
tighter and more sensitive. This night ride could have no end,<lb/>
had had no beginning; it had been going on for all remembered<lb/>
time. Automatically he held up his arm to fend off the slap of<lb/>
the wet boughs, tightened the reins as Turnip stumb<del hand="unknown_hand">u</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">l</add>ed again. The<lb/>
darkness and his weariness seemed to merge, both of them to<lb/>
fold <del hand="unknown_hand">him</del> around him warm and suffocating. Then he remembered: Pa<lb/>
had closed the windows -the miasma was bad for Ma. He could feel<lb/>
her tiredness all through him.</p>
<p>He was half out of the saddle before he felt himself slipping.<lb/>
Jerking himself back, he shook his head vigorously to clear it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joey, where are we?&rdquo; he called in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a daze Walter finally dismounted. The ground felt un-<lb/>
7/.<lb/>
<pb n="8" id="f06114008"/>
familiar to his chill feet and stiff legs. He could feel, rather than<lb/>
see, the little clearing amid the dense trees, sense the stream flow-<lb/>
ing swift and full at the foot of the bank. The tired boys unsaddled<lb/>
their horses and tied them at the edge of the thicket. With quick<lb/>
strokes of his hatchet Chris cut pine boughs for them all to lie<lb/>
on. Using their saddles as pillows and wrapping themselves in<lb/>
blankets, they fell asleep without even a whispered good-night.</p>
<p>A bird call, and the rays of the early sun pointing through<lb/>
the branches woke the sleepers. The sun was shining again! It<lb/>
was a glorious, a perfect spring day, warn, with an opal sky<lb/>
that would become a brilliant bl<del hand="unknown_hand">y</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">u</add>e as the sun rose higher. The<lb/>
boys sat up, stretching and smiling sleepily, then looked at each<lb/>
other blankly.</p>
<p>Jeff was gone.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In hiding the horses the boys had done all they could to<lb/>
insure their safety. Now they had nothing more to do until they<lb/>
received word that the raiders were gone from the neighborhood.<lb/>
High spirits, long suppressed by war time anxieties, bubbled up<lb/>
again. The first day they wrestled, told tall tales, built them-<lb/>
selves a rough shelter of pine boughs in case of rain, and, between<lb/>
relief and fatigue, slept again. Their anxiety over Jeff's dis-<lb/>
appearance evaporated gradually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; Chris reminded Joey, &ldquo;we knew he wasn't<lb/>
going to stay with us. He's just gone off to get us some more food,<lb/>
the way Pa said he would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't see why he lit out before anybody was awake,&rdquo;<lb/>
8.<lb/>
<pb n="9" id="f06114009"/>
Joey grumbled. &ldquo;He was supposed to wait till later, so's he wouldn't<lb/>
get back till late evening, not straggle in in broad daylight for<lb/>
the Yankees to nab him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he didn't like the notion of being out after dark<lb/>
again,&rdquo; Walter remarked. &ldquo;I'm afraid you maybe hurt his feelings,<lb/>
Joey, saying he was scared last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn't mean to -I was kind of jumpy myself. I was<lb/>
sure glad you fellows were along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don't worry about it,&rdquo; Walter advised him. &ldquo;He'll come back<lb/>
tomorrow or next day, with some food, and maybe news. I hope....&rdquo;<lb/>
His voice trailed away. As far as the war was concerned, even he<lb/>
knew now, there was nothing left to hope for, except its quick con-<lb/>
clusion. And he had done nothing to help! When he had told Pa how<lb/>
that made him feel, Pa had consoled him. There was always plenty<lb/>
to do in the world, he had explained, and his turn would come soon,<lb/>
just a few more years.</p>
<p>What shall I do when I'm a grown man? Walter wondered. He<lb/>
had thought about it many times, but had never been able to decide.<lb/>
Now he sat on the edge of the bank above the river, forgetting the<lb/>
horses, forgetting the war, his intent blue eyes staring unseeing<lb/>
at the water, trying to detect the shape of the future.</p>
<p>Joey strolled over and sat beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> going to be when you grow up, Joey?&rdquo; Walter<lb/>
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a farmer, of course,&rdquo; Joey answered. &ldquo;What else would<lb/>
I be? I'm one already. Like my pa, and my grandpa, and his pa.<lb/>
Rogers are always farmers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it's nice being a farmer,&rdquo; Walter agreed with the<lb/>
unspoken assumption, &ldquo;planting things, and seeing them come up <del hand="unknown_hand">and</del><lb/>
9.<lb/>
<pb n="10" id="f06114010"/>
and helping them grow. And making plenty of food for everybody,&rdquo; he<lb/>
added longingly. It had been four <del hand="unknown_hand">long</del> endless years since<lb/>
anyone he knew had had plenty of food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for me,&rdquo; Chris remarked, joining them. &ldquo;Farmers never<lb/>
get a chance to read anything. They work so hard that they<lb/>
haven't time to study things. I'm going to be a lawyer, and a city<lb/>
man. Maybe I'll go to New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There?&rdquo; Joey was shocked. &ldquo;That Yankee town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we'll all be friends again by the time Chris is<lb/>
ready to go,&rdquo; Walter explained trustfully. &ldquo;I'd like to go there<lb/>
myself, and then maybe out west. But I'd like to see such a big<lb/>
city first. Pa says 'most a million people live in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Joey exclaimed incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; Chris assured him. &ldquo;Pa told us so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all silent, contemplating the awesome figure. It<lb/>
was too big for Joey. He dismissed it. Anyway, he didn't believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to be, Walter?&rdquo; Joey finally inquired.</p>
<p>Walter answered slowly, &ldquo;I don't know. I haven't made up<lb/>
my mind. Maybe a minister, like Pa. Or maybe a schoolmaster. I<lb/>
want to do something,&rdquo; he hesitated a moment seriously, &ldquo;whatever<lb/>
it is, that will <hi rend="italic">help</hi> people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better not be a schoolmaster, then,&rdquo; Joey advised<lb/>
drily, recalling his own regrettable educational experiences in<lb/>
which a hickory switch had figured largely. He stood up and stretched,<lb/>
thinking how good it was to feel the spring sun again on the top of<lb/>
his head. It made a warmth, a kind of hot, live feeling, run all<lb/>
through you. &ldquo;Let's take the horses down for a drink,&rdquo; he suggested.<lb/>
&ldquo;They're acting awfully restless.&rdquo;</p>
<p><del hand="unknown_hand">By sunset they had to admit that Jeff probably wouldn't</del></p>
<p>10/.</p>
<pb n="11" id="f06114011"/>
<p>The day passed without incident, but by noon of the next<lb/>
they were beginning to wonder about Jeff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He'<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">d</add> better come pretty soon,&rdquo; Joey observed. &ldquo;We'll<lb/>
starve if he doesn't. Our rations are getting low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By sunset they had to admit that Jeff probably wouldn't ap-<lb/>
pear that day. They sat in the thickening twilight, inattentive to<lb/>
the final chirps of sleepy birds, the fading brilliance in the west<lb/>
and the increasing chill of the spring night, and speculated on how<lb/>
it would feel to be hungry -really hungry, with not a single thing<lb/>
to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won't be that bad,&rdquo; Walter predicted. &ldquo;After all, we<lb/>
don't have to sit here and starve. If he isn't here by the middle<lb/>
of tomorrow afternoon, I'll go out and see if I can't get us some-<lb/>
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you won't, Walter,&rdquo; Chris declared. &ldquo;I promised Pa<lb/>
I'd take care of you. I'll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll go,&rdquo; Joey stated gruffly. &ldquo;I know the way, and you<lb/>
fellows don't. You'd probably get lost the first thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd find it, all right,&rdquo; Walter asserted. &ldquo;Besides, if<lb/>
I ran into the Yanks, they'd probably think I was too young to<lb/>
bother with. But they might take either of you prisoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The argument trailed along inconclusively until it was<lb/>
thoroughly dark.</p>
<p>Finally Walter yawned. &ldquo;I reckon I'll go to sleep now,&rdquo;<lb/>
he said, wrapping up in his blanket. "Let's see what happens in the<lb/>
morning, before we decide what to do. Jeff may show up. Maybe no-<lb/>
body will have to go for food. 2</p>
<p>The next morning, like the one before it, was mild and sunny.<lb/>
11.<lb/>
<pb n="12" id="f06114012"/>
After eating the last scraps of ham and cornbread for breakfast, and<lb/>
watering the horses, the boys were faced with a long, warm, and<lb/>
probably hungry day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don't we take a swim?&rdquo; Joey proposed. &ldquo;The water's<lb/>
probably warm enough. It'll be the first time I've been in this<lb/>
spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; Chris agreed. Poised on the edge of the bank,<lb/>
he shouted over his shoulder, &ldquo;Last one in is a Red Indian,&rdquo; and<lb/>
slid down the incline. In a moment all three of them were scrambling<lb/>
out of their clothes. Chris, to Walter's great glee, turned out to<lb/>
be the Red Indian.</p>
<p>The water was chilly with spring, and ran rusty from the<lb/>
recent rains, but the boys didn't mind. They plunged in and ducked<lb/>
each other, sputtering and splashing. Then they swam, their pale<lb/>
arms and legs tossing the drops glistening into the air. Finally,<lb/>
winded, they climbed out and lay panting on the edge of the stream,<lb/>
while the sun dried them.</p>
<p>They were dressing when they heard one of the horses whinny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat that racket!&rdquo; Joey exclaimed anxiously. Hastily<lb/>
pulling his shirt over his head and jerking his belt tight, he<lb/>
started up the bank, the others at his heels. When his red head<lb/>
rose above it, and he took in what had happened, it was too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Johnny Reb,&rdquo; the big bearded Yankee said with an<lb/>
unhurried grin. &ldquo;Come on up.&rdquo; The grin fell away as Joey started<lb/>
to drop back. &ldquo;Don't try to run,&rdquo; the soldier warned, shifting his<lb/>
rifle a little. The smile came back as the two other astonished<lb/>
faces, incredulous eyes wide, bobbed over the edge of the bank.<lb/>
&ldquo;Well, well, well,&rdquo; he said mildly. &ldquo;Get on up here, all of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was impossible to refuse an invitation issued at the<lb/>
12.<lb/>
<pb n="13" id="f06114013"/>
point of a gun, so the three rueful boys, their hair still<lb/>
plastered flat from their swim, scrambled up beside him. A quick<lb/>
glance was enough to show that there was nothing they could do.<lb/>
There were eight or ten of the raiders, all in faded blue uniforms<lb/>
that looked as if they had had long, hard service. They had saddled<lb/>
Bess and Turnip and Joey's team, and were standing around watching<lb/>
the capture with amusement.</p>
<p>They didn't seem very sinister fellows, Walter though won-<lb/>
deringly, as he stared frankly at them. They might <del hand="unknown_hand">b</del> almost be<lb/>
any of their <del hand="unknown_hand">m</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add>eighborhood men, needing a shave and a bath and a<lb/>
fresh s<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">u</add>it. He examined their clothes. They were stained and soiled,<lb/>
but not in rags, like the Confederates' uniforms. And most envi-<lb/>
able of all, their boots were whole. The young lieutenant in<lb/>
charge of the group had on a fresher uniform than his men. As<lb/>
Walter reluctantly admired his fine figure it did not occur to him<lb/>
that, in another ten years, he would himself put on the United<lb/>
States uniform and wear it proudly for the rest of his life. Just<lb/>
then he would have given a great deal to see the Confederate gray<lb/>
and hear the shrill Rebel yell.</p>
<p>Their captor was solemnly searching them. Resting his<lb/>
rifle in the crook of his left arm, he patted their pockets with his<lb/>
free hand. The three knives he took from h them, he dropp<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">ed</add> into<lb/>
his own pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disarmed, sir,&rdquo; he reported to his superior with a<lb/>
straight face.</p>
<p>The lieutenant looked them over, the three young rebels.<lb/>
The tallest one, who looked like a farmer, glared at him, plainly<lb/>
uneasy about what was coming next. The other two were examining<lb/>
13.<lb/>
<pb n="14" id="f06114014"/>
him attentively, without friendliness and without fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anyone else with you?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>Joey sullenly kicked the earth with his toe. His team, the<lb/>
sturdy matched grays that Pa set such store by, how would they<lb/>
ever get along without them? What about the spring plowing? He<lb/>
could feel tears of helpless anger rising to his eyes.</p>
<p>Chris had moved close to Walter. Now he answered for all of<lb/>
them, a little louder than necessary in a voice harsh with indigna-<lb/>
tion. &ldquo;No sir. There are only three of us.&rdquo; No use telling about<lb/>
Jeff. He hoped Jeff wouldn't pick this moment to return. When<lb/>
he did come and found them gone, he could at least tell their fam-<lb/>
ilies, and they would guess what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes sir. That's right,&rdquo; another soldier, one with pale eyes<lb/>
and a broken nose set in a homely, weather-beate<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del>n face, said. &ldquo;That's<lb/>
what the colored boy said -three boys, four horses. Too bad we have<lb/>
to bother with the kids at all -they're no good to us.&rdquo; <del hand="unknown_hand">he added.</del></p>
<p>&ldquo;We can't turn them loose to warn the whole neighborhood,&rdquo;<lb/>
the lieutenant answered shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Jeff told you where to find us!&rdquo; Joey blurted, flus<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">h</add>ing<lb/>
angrily. &ldquo;Wait till I get my hands on him -wait till Pa gets at<lb/>
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, son,&rdquo; the man with the beard soothed him.<lb/>
&ldquo;You'll never see that boy again. The speed he showed when we let<lb/>
him go, he's half way to Canada now, I guess.&rdquo; He laughed hear-<lb/>
tily at the recollection of the flying heels.</p>
<p>As they picked their way single file through the woods, Wal-<lb/>
ter reflected on the uneasy distinction of being taken prisoner of<lb/>
war. There had been nothing at all glamorous about it, as he would<lb/>
have supposed. No ringing demand for surrender, no parley about<lb/>
14.<lb/>
<pb n="15" id="f06114015"/>
honorable terms, no formal exchange of courtesies between enemies<lb/>
who were also gentlemen. They had simply blundered into a booby<lb/>
trap set by an ignorant, resentful boy, and been ingloriously<lb/>
grabbed by some good-natured, quite dirty soldiers under the com-<lb/>
m<del hand="unknown_hand">e</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">a</add>nd of a very junior officer who scarcely spoke to them. It was<lb/>
a great disappointment, practically an insult.</p>
<p>Dodging the branches that swept low over the narrow path,<lb/>
he wondered nervously what their captors intended to do with them.<lb/>
Only spies were shot, he knew. But maybe they would be sent to<lb/>
one of the fearsome northern prisons -Libby, perhaps, from which<lb/>
such fearful rumors of want and disease filtered back. Maybe they<lb/>
would be taken to Sheridan himself, and questioned, Walter thought<lb/>
apprehensively, recalling tales of his ruthlessness in the desol-<lb/>
ated Shenandoah Valley. It was even possible -humiliating<lb/>
thought -that they would be liberated as not worth bothering with,<lb/>
their patriotism dismissed as ineffectual. Although at first in-<lb/>
clined to resent any such reflection, Walter realized that he<lb/>
would quickly reconcile himself to it, if it meant freedom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can think what they like, if they only let us go,&rdquo;<lb/>
he reasonably told himself.</p>
<p>This was probably the last time, he realized sadly, that<lb/>
Chris and he would ever ride good old Bess and Turnip. He leaned<lb/>
over Turnip's neck and gave him an affectionate pat. Fine old<lb/>
horses! They had faithfully carried Pa through sun and rain and<lb/>
cold countless miles all over Virginia. They had pulled the buggy<lb/>
to church, picnics, funerals, christenings. They were essential,<lb/>
cherished members of the family. He hated to think that they<lb/>
would now strain at cannon stuck in the mud, or go under fire,<lb/>
15.<lb/>
<pb n="16" id="f06114016"/>
ridden by some stranger. He and Chris and Joey had done all they<lb/>
could to save them, but it hadn't been enough.</p>
<p>The path widened into the wagon track, the wagon track into<lb/>
the highway. The little group of soldiers, breaking their file,<lb/>
surrounded their prisoners and trotted down the road.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was almost dark the next evening when the two limping,<lb/>
weary boys approached home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My feet are 'most worn off,&rdquo; Chris sighed. &ldquo;Fifteen miles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And some people do it for pleasure,&rdquo; Walter groaned. &ldquo;I'm<lb/>
nearly starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those sardines!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Maybe they wouldn't have been so bad if the soldier<lb/>
hadn't wrapped them in his handkerchief with his tobacco,&rdquo; Walter<lb/>
speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were terrible anyway,&rdquo; Chris affirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I never see another one of those slimy, smelly fish<lb/>
as long as I live,&rdquo; his brother solemnly declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Ma and Pa heard about us?&rdquo; Chris wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid so. Mr. Samuels saw us when we passed his place.<lb/>
He'd have let them know if he had to walk every step of the<lb/>
way. I hope it didn't scare Ma to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it had scared Ma almost to death. When her youngest sons<lb/>
actually stood before her, she was hardly able to believe it. She<lb/>
couldn't stop hugging them, and exclaiming, &ldquo;My babies! My poor<lb/>
little babies! Have you really come back to me safely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ma,&rdquo; Chris protested, a little embarrassed at being<lb/>
called a baby even by her, &ldquo;it wasn't so bad. They didn't<lb/>
hurt us. They didn't even scare us, did they, Walter? Only a<lb/>
16.<lb/>
<pb n="17" id="f06114017"/>
little bit, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, really, Ma,&rdquo; Walter clasped her hard to reassure her.<lb/>
&ldquo;They weren't mean to us at all. We were only scared that you and<lb/>
Pa would worry when you heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We worried, all right,&rdquo; Pa said grimly. &ldquo;When Mr. Samuels<lb/>
came with the news, I thought your Mr would faint clear away for a<lb/>
minute. Then she wanted to set right out for Petersburg and give<lb/>
General Grant and General Sheridan a piece of her mind -persecut-<lb/>
ing innocent children, she called it.&rdquo; He chuckled. &ldquo;She would<lb/>
have, too, if there'd been any means of conveyance left in the<lb/>
county.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did my brave boys get away?&rdquo; Ma asked fondly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; Walter explained shamef<del hand="unknown_hand">e</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">a</add>cedly, &ldquo;it was<lb/>
this way. They just turned us loose. A courier came with a message<lb/>
for the lieutenant, and he ordered the men to break camp, fast.<lb/>
Then he remembered us. He said,&rdquo; indignantly he repeated the young<lb/>
officer's slighting words, mimicing his brusque tone, &ldquo;&lsquo;Free these<lb/>
boys. They're not big enough to do us any good, and they're too<lb/>
small to do any harm. Sheridan's cavalry can't be nursemaids. They<lb/>
can go home to their mothers.&rsquo; So he just let us walk away, and<lb/>
Joey went to his place, and we came home.&rdquo; <del hand="unknown_hand">he concluded.</del> He could<lb/>
hardly keep his voice steady as he added, &ldquo;They kept Bess and Turnip,<lb/>
though, Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest boys!&rdquo; Pa exclaimed. &ldquo;You're what matters.<lb/>
We can do all right without the horses, so long as we have you back<lb/>
safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they feed you properly?&rdquo; Ma inquired anxiously,<lb/>
watching Chris down his second glass of buttermilk and reach again<lb/>
for the cornbread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sardines,&rdquo; he said tersely. &ldquo;Sardines for supper, sar-<lb/>
17.<lb/>
<pb n="18" id="f06114018"/>
dines for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sardines and tobacco,&rdquo; his younger brother amended. &ldquo;Never<lb/>
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>18.</p>

<head>CHAPTER II</head>

<p>The childhood climaxed by this adventure had opened<lb/>
thirteen years earlier in the rural peace of pre-war Virginia.<lb/>
Since Walter Reed's whole life was destined to be more or less<lb/>
nomadic, with scarcely four consecutive years spent in the same<lb/>
place, it was quite appropriate that he should have been born in<lb/>
a temporary shelter.</p>
<p>Shortly before Walter's birth his father, a Methodist<lb/>
circuit rider, was sent from Murfreesboro, North Carolina, to Bel-<lb/>
roi in Gloucester County, Virginia, to travel and preach among the<lb/>
churches in that neighborhood. In those days the arrival of a new<lb/>
minister in a country community was an event comparable onlt to<lb/>
19.<lb/>
<pb n="20" id="f06114020"/>
Christmas in its importance and possibilities for pleasant excite-<lb/>
ment. The neighborhood hummed. Would the new preacher frown on<lb/>
dancing? What kind of sermons would he deliver? What would his<lb/>
wife be like? How old were his children? Would he like his new<lb/>
parish, would they be happy in their new home?</p>
<p>Suddenly and horrifyingly, it appeared that an emphatic NO<lb/>
must be the answer to the last question. The parsonage burnt down.<lb/>
How could a family be happy without a roof over their heads, espec-<lb/>
ially a family of four children, with another expected any day? The<lb/>
parishoners were in consternation. Their new minister was even then<lb/>
traveling to them, they could not possibly erect a house for him by<lb/>
the time he arrived, and where were he and his expanding brood to<lb/>
lay their heads?</p>
<p>An answer was quickly found by Mr. Stubbs, owner of the Bel-<lb/>
roi plantation. He hastily transferred his overseer to other quar-<lb/>
ters and offered the frame cabin thus vacated for the use of the min-<lb/>
ister and his family. It was a sturdy little building, small but sub-<lb/>
stantially built, with two rooms downstairs, each with an immense<lb/>
fireplace, and an attic above. A pretty little elm tree by one cor-<lb/>
ner made the gesture of sheltering it, although it was so small and<lb/>
slender that the gesture was a mere promise, not fulfilled for many<lb/>
years. The neighborhood men got together and cleaned the yard and<lb/>
repaired the steps and whitewashed the walls, while the women swept<lb/>
and scrubbed inside. In short order the overseer's cabin was pre-<lb/>
pared for the role of Walter Reed's birthplace, a role the distinc-<lb/>
tion of which none of the kind neighbors, of course, could foresee.</p>
<p>Traveling by coach and boat, the Reeds journeyed from North<lb/>
Carolina to their new home. Walter, in due course, was born there.<lb/>
He was a good-natured baby, with straight fair hair and blue eyes,<lb/>
and the undistinguished chubbiness of a healthy infant. The youngest<lb/>
20.<lb/>
<pb n="21" id="f06114021"/>
of a family of five children, he was much admired, as the youngest<lb/>
always is until displaced by a new baby. This was a catastrophe<lb/>
which did not overtake Walter: he remained the baby for many years.<lb/>
By the time that his father, after his mother's death, remarried,<lb/>
and there was a baby half-sister, Walter was a responsible young<lb/>
man <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">of sixteen,</add>, entered as a student at the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>Naturally, Walter remembered nothing of his first home,<lb/>
since the family lived there only a short time, but the older mem-<lb/>
bers never forgot their few months in the crowded little cabin. It<lb/>
was, however, snug and weather-proof, and Mrs. Reed, whose talent<lb/>
for making a strange house into a home was well developed by life<lb/>
as the wife of a circuit rider, soon made this one comfortable and<lb/>
pleasant. It was a relief, though, to them all, except<lb/>
perhaps the indifferent baby, when they were able to move into the<lb/>
new parsonage, with its spacious upper story and detached kitchen and<lb/>
servants' quarters, and leave Walter's congested birthplace to its<lb/>
next tenants, and, later, the favorable notice of posterity.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The first Reed to arrive in America was Christian, who<lb/>
came to Carolima in 1640 to see how he liked the new world. He liked<lb/>
it well enough to live in, but not to die in, so returned to England<lb/>
when he grew old. He left his son Christopher, however, one of<lb/>
the Councillors of the Lords Proprietors who gover<del hand="unknown_hand">e</del>ned the colony<lb/>
from the safe and irresponsible distance of England, comfortably<lb/>
settled at Durant's Neck, a piece of land jutting down into the north<lb/>
side of Albemarle Sound between the Little and the Perquimans Rivers.</p>
<p>In good time, Christopher died and was buried near the<lb/>
21.<lb/>
<pb n="22" id="f06114022"/>
shore, and as the years passed his grave was all but washed into the<lb/>
sound. Pious hands rescued the tombstone and placed it under a gum<lb/>
tree near the water, far from the scattered bones it had once covered.<lb/>
Later, hands somewhat less pious broke off the slab for the doorstep<lb/>
of a new house. Christopher's son and son's sons lived on at Du-<lb/>
rant's Neck, and planted and prospered. One of them, Joseph, mar-<lb/>
ried a grand-daughter of George Durant, founder of the settlement.</p>
<p>George Durant, irked by the restraints of England's tight<lb/>
little island, had been drawn to the new continent in 1632 by its<lb/>
spaciousness and freedom. A brief pause in Virginia had convinced<lb/>
him that that colony was too like the land he had left for his taste.<lb/>
He wandered into Carolina, exploring the eastern shore and the rivers,<lb/>
and finally settled on the peninsula on which he conferred his name.<lb/>
He preferred to buy his land from the Indians, and be friends with<lb/>
them, rather than steal it like many other settlers and win their en-<lb/>
mity, and he came into possession of the first land title in what<lb/>
is now North Carolina. The old record shows that, on the first day<lb/>
of March, 1661, George Durant bought from Kilcocanen, Chief of the<lb/>
Yeopin Indians, &ldquo;a parcel of land lying on Roanoke Sound and a river<lb/>
by the name of Perquimans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other settlers, among them Christian and Christopher Reed,<lb/>
came to the fertile peninsula, and a substantial community of farmers<lb/>
and planters soon grew up. George Durant held a dominant position<lb/>
there. When harsh laws were imposed and an unpopular governor was<lb/>
appointed by the absentee Lords Proprietors, it was Durant who led<lb/>
the opposition and raised an armed rebellion. In the quieter years<lb/>
of his later life his activities were less stirring: as Justice of<lb/>
the Peace he applied himself to the suppression of witchcraft, sor-<lb/>
cery and other doings frowned upon by the local gentry. But the<lb/>
22.<lb/>
<pb n="23" id="f06114023"/>
adventurous and independent spirit of George Durant was strong in the<lb/>
grand-daughter who married Joseph Reed, and it flowed on, sometimes<lb/>
more and sometimes less silently, in the veins of their descendants,<lb/>
to crop out again undiluted in Walter Reed.</p>
<p>Walter's mother, Pharaba White Reed, was, like his father, a<lb/>
North Carolinian of English descent. Small, witty and vivacious,<lb/>
she was also a woman of character and intelligence.</p>
<p>In those days, the wife of a Methodist circuit rider needed<lb/>
such qualities. A preacher's salary was small, and his reward con-<lb/>
sisted largely of the consciousness of duty sincerely done and of<lb/>
the respect and liking of his neighbors. He could afford no luxur-<lb/>
ies. Lemuel Reed did not own slaves; a good slave might cost as<lb/>
much as fifteen hundred dollars. As he pointed out to Walter,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would a minister of the Gospel want with a slave? He<lb/>
cultivates souls, not the soil, and he must do it entirely by his<lb/>
own labor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Reed traveled the circuit in all weathers, sometimes on<lb/>
horseback and sometimes in a light carriage, preaching at his churches,<lb/>
baptizing babies, visiting the sick, carrying news about the country-<lb/>
side, performing all the dozens of extra duties that fell to the<lb/>
lot of a country parson. At home his wife attended to the children,<lb/>
supervised their lessons, managed the household and waited for his<lb/>
return.</p>
<p>Every two years, just as they would get settled and feel<lb/>
really at home, the Methodist conference regularly appointed him to<lb/>
a new circuit in another part of the state. Mrs. Reed and the two<lb/>
younger boys, with a few bags, would get into the cars <del hand="unknown_hand">and</del><lb/>
and ride to their destination behind the woodburning locomotive<lb/>
that chugged along breathtakingly about thirty miles an hour and<lb/>
23.<lb/>
<pb n="24" id="f06114024"/>
scattered sparks lavishly on either side of the right-of-way. Mr.<lb/>
Reed and his two older boys and their sister would pile their house-<lb/>
hold goods -chairs, lamps, bedding, some smoked meat in the back,<lb/>
and Pa's Bible on the seat beside him, where he could consult it<lb/>
while he thought about his sermon -into the wagon and make the ted-<lb/>
ious trip to a new home.</p>
<p>The two yea<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">r</add>s at Belroi were followed by two in Princess  Anne<lb/>
County, two in Murfreesboro, North Carolina, and two in Prince Ed-<lb/>
ward County. Here, at Farmville, the village on the banks of the<lb/>
Appomattox that was eight years later to be in the path of Lee's<lb/>
final retreat, the Reed's lived opposite the Presbyterian church, in<lb/>
a story and a half brick house large enough for five healthy, lively<lb/>
children and their studious father, too.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed, who loved flowers, laid out beds along the walk<lb/>
all the way to the front gate and planted them with roses, cornflow-<lb/>
ers, larkspur and other plants that grew well in the rich red soil.<lb/>
Walter, who shared his mother's love of gardening even as a little<lb/>
boy, would follow her around, digging, planting, pruning, cutting,<lb/>
in vigorous imitation. Sometimes his dog, Taffy, whom Nature had<lb/>
sketched freehand in a moment of reckless experimentation, would do<lb/>
a little planting himself, and dig a hole in a flower bed to bury his<lb/>
bone. Walter, who though Taffy the finest dog in the world, would<lb/>
reproach him, but not hard enough to hurt his feelings. He was<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">always</del> sensitive to other people's feelings, and Taffy, in his opin-<lb/>
ion, had the same standing in the family, and title to gentle treat-<lb/>
ment, as any other member of it.</p>
<p>It was at Farmville, when he was six years old, that Walter<lb/>
Reed performed his first experiment. It was not his own idea, but<lb/>
24.<lb/>
<pb n="25" id="f06114025"/>
it had seemed like a good one at the time. He knew better, however,<lb/>
after the first few puffs on the homemade &ldquo;cigar,&rdquo; made of tobacco<lb/>
leaves which he and Chris and a couple of their friends had picked<lb/>
up at a neighboring warehouse and rolled in newspaper. Convulsed with<lb/>
nausea, he thought he was surely dying. His frightened friends shared<lb/>
his alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, please don't die, Walter,&rdquo; implored the scared<lb/>
little boy who had suggested smoking. &ldquo;Promise you won't tell who<lb/>
you were with when this happened? Pa'd 'most kill me if he knew it<lb/>
was my fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise. I won't tell. It wasn't your fault.&rdquo; Walter<lb/>
managed a feeble smile. &ldquo;Get me home, Chris. I feel so awful. I'm<lb/>
'most dead now! I want Ma, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Walter, still feeble but no longer in fear of<lb/>
death, had an interview with his father. The minister, pulling on<lb/>
his full mustache, covered a smile with his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you promised not to tell who got you into this scrape,<lb/>
Walter? Well, then you mustn't tell. You were foolish, not naughty,<lb/>
and I'm not going to punish you. I think you've learned your lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes I have, Pa. I'll never touch the stuff again,&rdquo; Walter<lb/>
promised earnestly.</p>
<p>Mr. Reed smiled at his son and ruffled his sun-bleached hair.<lb/>
&ldquo;As a matter of fact, you probably won't,&rdquo; he told him. &ldquo;The<lb/>
same thing happened to your Pa thirty years ago. To this day I can't<lb/>
touch tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter never smoked again.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Life for a small boy in rural Virginia in the 1850's was<lb/>
25.<lb/>
<pb n="26" id="f06114026"/>
fun, especially with three older brothers, Jim and Tom and Chris,<lb/>
and a big sister, Laura, to play with. They made up all sorts of<lb/>
exciting games. As wild Indians they would lurk behind the big<lb/>
wood pile, a feature of every country home in those days, and fall<lb/>
with terrifying whoops on their parents, who always made very sat-<lb/>
isfactory victims, giving a convincing display of surprise and terror.<lb/>
Or they would be highwaymen and hold up the stage, or Indian scouts<lb/>
and crawl on their stomachs through the corn and tobacco, cautiously<lb/>
reconnoitering the movements of the wily redskins, and taking care<lb/>
not to put themselves in the way of punishment by flattening the<lb/>
stalks. When they played at being a pioneer family, Walter, to his<lb/>
disgust, had to be the baby. When he protested that he was a big<lb/>
boy now, almost big enough to go to school, Tom settled the matter<lb/>
by saying with authority,</p>
<p>&ldquo;All pioneer families have babies. You're the youngest,<lb/>
so you've got to be the baby if you want to play with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer to that, obviously, so Walter got his<lb/>
nose wiped and his face washed, and was scalped, lugged around and<lb/> spanked a great deal. He took it with good-nature, since he<lb/>
had a happy disposition, but promised himself that when he got a<lb/>
little older he wasn't going to play any old baby any more.</p>
<p>Laura, as the oldest and the only girl in a family of boys,<lb/>
was in a privileged position. She always got to play mother, and<lb/>
did so with great zest, scolding and protecting her family, cooking<lb/>
for them when they returned from the plains with a bison, and mourn-<lb/>
ing their untimely demise when the Indians murdered them. She took<lb/>
care, too, not to let the older boys &ldquo;baby&rdquo; their youngest brother<lb/>
with too much realism.</p>
<p>When they were tired of games they could ramble around the<lb/>
26.<lb/>
<pb n="27" id="f06114027"/>
countryside, fishing and swimming in the creeks in the summer, and<lb/>
watching the farmers strip the tobacco from its stems in the great,<lb/>
well-ventilated barns in the late fall and winter.</p>
<p>Probably the best fun, though, was the wrestling game with<lb/>
Pa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let's see if you fellows are strong enough to hold down your<lb/>
aged, feeble Pa,&rdquo; Mr. Reed would challenge them. The boys would fall<lb/>
on him with a shout. Pa would get down on his back on the floor,<lb/>
creakingly and with many groans, and Jim, the oldest <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">boy</add>, would issue<lb/>
orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter, you hold his left arm. Tom, take his right -hold<lb/>
them out, straight out! Get on his legs, Chris. Wait, I'll<lb/>
help you. No fair starting yet, Pa. All right, now! Let's see you<lb/>
get away this time, Pa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ensuing struggles were terrific. Pa and the boys rolled<lb/>
and scrambled and shouted with laughter, while Ma and Laura fluttered<lb/>
on the outskirts of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e and moved furniture out of the way.<lb/>
Heads, elbows and shins occasionally got banged, but nobody minded.<lb/>
The game always ended the same way: the boys, exhausted and laughing,<lb/>
lay scattered about the room, while Pa rose agilely to his feet and<lb/>
dusted himself off, saying triumphantly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! Maybe the next time you'll think twice before you<lb/>
get rough with your poor old Pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Pa,&rdquo; Mrs. Reed smilingly protested, &ldquo;one would think<lb/>
you were ten yourself, the way you act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeps me young, my dear,&rdquo; he answered, slipping one arm around<lb/>
her and the other around Laura. &ldquo;Aren't they fine fellows, though,&rdquo;<lb/>
he exclaimed proudly, smiling at his four boys as they picked them-<lb/>
selves up from the floor.</p>
<p>27.</p>
<pb n="28" id="f06114028"/>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma, when can I go to school?&rdquo; Walter demanded of his mother<lb/>
soon after their arrival at Farmville. &ldquo;I'm six, and I can read and<lb/>
spell and do sums almost as well as Chris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed glanced at him startled. How quickly they grew!<lb/>
Her youngest almost six! She put aside the bolt of cotton cloth from<lb/>
which she was cutting shirts for the boys and their father -the<lb/>
spinning wheel and loom had fallen into disuse in most of the homes<lb/>
of Virginia since cotton goods could be manufactured so cheaply in<lb/>
the north -and examined her youngest son. His hair, tow-colored from<lb/>
the hot Virginia sun, was darkening a little as he grew older. The<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">bright</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">blue</add> eyes showed his father's frank intelligence. Behind the<lb/>
youthful softness of the alert face, with its straight nose and<lb/>
slightly outthrust lower lip, the maternal eye recognized character<lb/>
and determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, Ma?&rdquo; the little boy persisted, leaning against her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you can go this next term, son,&rdquo; she answered slowly.<lb/>
&ldquo;I'll ask your Pa to speak to Mrs. Booker about it as soon as he<lb/>
gets back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed's scissors lay idle on the table as she stared out<lb/>
the window. How fast, how terribly fast time went! Was it possibly<lb/>
six years since that night in the overseer's tiny cabin when Walter,<lb/>
red and wrinkled and weakly squalling, first confronted his family<lb/>
and the world? Pa had been a deacon then; he was an elder now. It<lb/>
was hard to believe that this fall their <del hand="unknown_hand">bby</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">baby</add> would go to school with<lb/>
Chris, and under the efficient ministration of Mrs. Booker learn<lb/>
reading and moral tales from Professor McGuffy's readers, Latin from<lb/>
Professor Gildersleeve's grammar, and mathematics and geography from<lb/>
the appropriate texts. Then he would go to Mr. Jefferson's Univer-<lb/>
28.<lb/>
<pb n="29" id="f06114029"/>
sity at Charlottesville; and, finally, entering on the broader<lb/>
stage of life as a man of sound education, he would become -a min-<lb/>
ister like his father? a doctor? a soldier? a lawyer? In any case,<lb/>
a worthy gentleman and, God willing, a man of distinction.</p>
<p>Walter, unconscious of the high hopes centered on him, was<lb/>
at that moment telling his brother Tom where to get off. He had<lb/>
found Jim and Tom chopping a fallen apple tree into fire<del hand="unknown_hand">space</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">place</add> lengths,<lb/>
and lost no time in making his announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma says I can go to school next term, Tom, and I'm not going<lb/>
to play baby any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Walter,&rdquo; Tom said mildly. &ldquo;That's fine news.<lb/>
I'll give you my little pen knife, so you can keep your pencils sharp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim smiled. &ldquo;I guess you're a big fellow now, all right,&rdquo; he<lb/>
admitted. Well past the age of make-believe games himself, he still<lb/>
remembered with amused sympathy Walter's fruitless protests at the<lb/>
indignity of his role in the family dramas.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Attendance at the one room village school was an exciting<lb/>
novelty at first, then settled into a routine which Walter never found<lb/>
monotonous. The students, about twenty boys and girls, some of them<lb/>
sixteen and seventeen years old, sat in rows at desks, and Mrs.<lb/>
Booker faced them from her own on a raised platform, a blackboard<lb/>
behind her and a large globe beside her. She had never been known<lb/>
to use the ruler, suggestive of discipline and smarting palms,<lb/>
which lay in front of her, for anything except pointing.</p>
<p>In the country about Farmville there were a number of gold<lb/>
mines, which had been extensively worked before the rush to Califor-<lb/>
nia in 1849. One of them, Booker's Mine, cast an atmosphere of gla-<lb/>
29.<lb/>
<pb n="30" id="f06114030"/>
mor about the teacher for the younger Reed boys, although they never<lb/>
found out whether it was hers or not. They used to discuss the ques-<lb/>
tion lengthily, until practical Chris settled it finally to his own<lb/>
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she doesn't own a gold mine. Why would she work for<lb/>
a living teaching school if she did?&rdquo; he wanted to know.</p>
<p>That seemed like good sense to Walter, but it was a disappoint-<lb/>
ment. It was exciting to think that your teacher could get all the<lb/>
gold she wanted just by taking it out of her own mine -it was almost<lb/>
as exciting as if she had owned a candy store. The son of the poor<lb/>
country minister was dazzled by the mere idea of such resources.</p>
<p>While one class recited, the other prepared its lessons. Walter<lb/>
kept his nose buried in McGuffy's tale of the honest little chimney<lb/>
swe<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>p who was to occupy the next recitation period, but read, fascin-<lb/>
ated, the big flat book he had cautiously opened on his knees. The<lb/>
Rocky Mountains, the Colorado River, the buffalo and the Indians, the<lb/>
wild, adventurous west -how exciting it seemed by contrast to the<lb/>
well-ordered domestic scene! Some day, when he was big, he would go<lb/>
there himself -maybe on one of the new railroads that were even then<lb/>
slowly, certainly probing their way across the wide continent, span-<lb/>
ning rivers, crawling across plains, connecting remote villages with<lb/>
the outside world, binding east to west, north to south, with<lb/>
tough steel bonds.</p>
<p>The cool, crisp voice caught him off-guard. &ldquo;Walter Reed,<lb/>
bring me the book you are hiding under your desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was before the age of dime novels, but the popularity among<lb/>
her pupils of lurid adventure yarns about the gold rush, cattle<lb/>
thieves and other western topics, was well known to Mrs. Booker.<lb/>
Blushing, Walter stood up. Every eye in the room fastened on him.<lb/>
30.<lb/>
<pb n="31" id="f06114031"/>
He walked slowly toward the desk, holding the suspicious volume<lb/>
behind him, a small, tow-headed figure in neat cotton shirt and<lb/>
pants. A subdued expression of humor, Mrs. Booker noted, belied<lb/>
the penitent droop of his bearing. He stood meekly before her,<lb/>
his eye on the ruler. His teacher extended her hand for the of-<lb/>
fending book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this book, Walter?&rdquo; she demanded with a sternness<lb/>
that covered up a faint misgiving. The boy was almost smiling!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my geography, ma'am,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>31.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="3" id="d8"><pb n="32" id="f06114032"/>
<head>CHAPTER III</head>

<p>The shadow of the approaching catastrophe had lain, at<lb/>
first, but lightly over the younger members of the Reed household.<lb/>
The threatening atmosphere, growing more eletric with every year,<lb/>
had seemed, in fact, a natural element to the two boys who grew up<lb/>
into it and were unacquainted with the bland airs of peace. If Mr.<lb/>
Reed's habitually calm expression took on additional gravity when<lb/>
he discussed the possibility of war between the states with his<lb/>
wife, and if Mrs. Reed, looking at her older boys, could not always<lb/>
keep a trace of apprehension out of her expressive eyes, Chris and<lb/>
Walter probably did not notice, or, if they did, merely thought that<lb/>
32.<lb/>
<pb n="33" id="f06114033"/>
being grown up was in some mysterious way a grave affair.</p>
<p>1859 and 1860 saw the Reeds settled at Liberty, now called<lb/>
Bedford, in Bedford County, near the foothills of the Blue Ridge<lb/>
Mountains. After two years of duty there, discharged with the usual<lb/>
unselfish devotion that <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">made</add> the Methodist circuit riders beloved and<lb/>
admired wherever they went, Mr. Reed was shifted to Blackstone, in<lb/>
Nottingham County, then an important railway center and nearer the<lb/>
scene of the tragic action of the next four years.</p>
<p>The long dissension had been steadily sharpening between<lb/>
the manufacturing North and the farming South. The North wanted<lb/>
slavery barred from the United States territories, and the South,<lb/>
whose whole economy was based on slave labor, knew that its voice<lb/>
in the council of states would be diminished and finally strangled<lb/>
should slavery be kept out of the territories. Sectional bitterness<lb/>
was violent, and the struggle between the two societies was close<lb/>
to exploding into open conflict. Congressmen went armed with pistols,<lb/>
and Senator Jefferson Davis of Mississippi sadly reported that the<lb/>
Congress appeared to be composed of the representatives of warring<lb/>
states, rather than of men assembled for the<del hand="unknown_hand">x</del> common good.</p>
<p>Abraham Lincoln, unalterably opposed to the extension of slav-<lb/>
ery into the territories, but no abolitionist, was elected President<lb/>
in November, 1860. The following month, South Carolina, traditionally<lb/>
prone to secession, by the decision of a popular convention in holi-<lb/>
day spirits withdrew from the Union. Some southern states followed;<lb/>
others, Virginia among them, hesitated. In February Jefferson Davis<lb/>
was inaugurated President of the Confederate States before an excited<lb/>
throng in Montgomery, Alabama. Still, Lincoln solemnly assured his<lb/>
&ldquo;dissatisfied fellow countrymen&rdquo; that, while there would be no seces-<lb/>
33.<lb/>
<pb n="34" id="f06114034"/>
sion, neither would there be a war unless they started it. And to<lb/>
show his conciliatory spirit, he backed an amendment to the Consti-<lb/>
tution which passed both houses of Congress preventing the Federal<lb/>
government for all future time from interfering with slavery in any<lb/>
state in which it was already established. Almost, it appeared that<lb/>
war might at the last moment be staved off.</p>
<p>Then, on April 12th, 1861, southern guns fired on Fed-<lb/>
eral-held Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, and the hope of peace<lb/>
vanished with the puff of powder smoke in the damp spring air.</p>
<p>The antagonists quickly fell into line. Virginia reluctantly<lb/>
decided to join the seceding states rather than yield to the Federal<lb/>
government's demand for troops to discipline them. In the end,<lb/>
eleven southern states faced twenty-three northern ones; nine mil-<lb/>
lion people, more than a third of them slaves, pitted themselves<lb/>
against the strength of twenty-two million free men. The North had<lb/>
almost all the clothing, munitions and metal industries in the coun-<lb/>
try, and a large proportion of the <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">nation's</add> banking capital. Moreover, most<lb/>
of the foreign goods imported for southern use passed through northern<lb/>
warehouses.</p>
<p>The South had little but cotton -cotton and courage. But<lb/>
they believed that Cotton was King, in the popular phrase of the day,<lb/>
and they had yet to learn that brave hearts are no more bullet proof<lb/>
than trembling ones.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Having voted to secede, Virginia, as everyone had foreseen,<lb/>
was immediately invaded. The war was on now, in earnest.</p>
<p>Daylight was fading, and Laura moved closer to the window<lb/>
to make the most of it. Her eyes smarted and her throat burned<lb/>
34.<lb/>
<pb n="35" id="f06114035"/>
with the tears she painfully restrained. There was no good in crying.<lb/>
It would only upset the younger children, and distress Ma -brave<lb/>
Ma, whose air of cheerfulness deceived no one. In the dimming light<lb/>
she bent closer over Jim's shirt.</p>
<p>When Jim had returned suddenly from college at Randolph-<lb/>
Macon and announced that he was enlisting, there had been a heavy<lb/>
silence. Ma's hands, busy with a piece of sewing, had dropped in<lb/>
her lap and she stared at him speechless, her eyes slowly filling<lb/>
with tears. Her first son, only eighteen, going to the war! Fear-<lb/>
fully she thought, &ldquo;Thank heaven, the others are too young!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Reed had been the first to speak. He pushed away <del hand="unknown_hand">from<lb/>
him</del> the sheets of paper on which he was writing his sermon, and said<lb/>
sadly, &ldquo;It is your plain duty, son. Your mother and I could not<lb/>
wish you to act otherwise.&rdquo; He cleared his throad abruptly.</p>
<p>Tom got up from his chair and came to his father's side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa, I...&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; his father interrupted him almost harshly. &ldquo;Our cause<lb/>
is not so desperate that a sixteen year old boy must fight.&rdquo; He took<lb/>
the edge off his words by putting his arm around Tom's shoulders.<lb/>
&ldquo;Just wait,&rdquo; he advised a little grimly. &ldquo;Your turn may come yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Pa!&rdquo; Jim exclaimed. &ldquo;The war will be over in a few<lb/>
months. We can whip those Yanks easily. I expect to enter the Uni-<lb/>
versity at Charlottesville this fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm afraid your expectations will have to be put aside,<lb/>
Jim,&rdquo; the minister observed. You underestimate the resources of our<lb/>
opponents. Not only are we vastly outnumbered, but all the tools<lb/>
of war are made in the north. We have almost none of the necessary<lb/>
industries. Even the clothes we wear, made of the cotton we grow,<lb/>
have to be manufactured up there."<lb/>
35.<lb/>
<pb n="36" id="f06114036"/>
&ldquo;But Pa, that's just it,&rdquo; Jim pointed out. &ldquo;We'll stop delivering<lb/>
cotton. If the cotton mills go under, the whole industrial system<lb/>
of the North will be shaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theirs will be shaken,&rdquo; his father conceded, &ldquo;but<lb/>
ours will be destroyed. Ours is a farming economy, and cotton is<lb/>
our main crop. If we can't trade it for war materials -and you<lb/>
my rely on it that they won't trade us the guns to shoot them with,<lb/>
and that they'll do everything they can to keep England from doing<lb/>
so -we'll simply choke to death on it. We can't eat it, we can't<lb/>
shoot with it, we can't pay our soldiers with it, and we can't even<lb/>
wear it until it's been converted by northern mills. No, Jim, the<lb/>
South depends more on the North than it realizes, and the North is<lb/>
more independent of us than we suppose.&rdquo; He paused a moment and<lb/>
his family looked at him, troubled. &ldquo;It will certainly be a des-<lb/>
perate war, and probably a long one,&rdquo;"he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do you think it's hopeless, Pa?&rdquo; Tom inquired anxiously.</p>
<p>The minister's answer rang with confidence. &ldquo;No cause is<lb/>
hopeless when it is just, and when brave men defend it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa, will it last long enough for Chris and me to go?&rdquo;<lb/>
Walter inquired hopefully. &ldquo;We're almost big enough for drummers now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not!&rdquo; his mother answered fervently. &ldquo;Will it, Pa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; Mr. Reed exclaimed.</p>
<p>Laura's practical mind had run in advance of the discussion.<lb/>
Jimmy was going to the war; wh<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">at</add> could be done to make him as comfor-<lb/>
table as possible?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, what can I do to help you to get ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make me some shirts, sis. Most of mine are wearing out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow. I'll start to make you half a dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Two is enough. A good campaigner doesn't carry<lb/>
36.<lb/>
<pb n="37" id="f06114037"/>
a lot of extra clothes around with him.&rdquo; He smiled and took her hand.<lb/>
He and his sister, only two years apart, had always been particularly<lb/>
close friends. &ldquo;One to wear while the other is drying, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim! I'll make you the best shirts you've ever had in<lb/>
your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Not that I deserve it, but nothing's too good to fight<lb/>
for your country in,&rdquo; he said lightly.</p>
<p>And nothing's too good to die for your country in, he had not<lb/>
added. But the thought had leaped to everyone's mind.</p>
<p>Thinking of the unsaid words, Laura stitched faster, with a<lb/>
sort of panicky urgency. Nothing must happen to Jim -not to Jim,<lb/>
who was tall, and strong, and kind, whom everyone loved, who was<lb/>
just becoming a man, with perhaps half a century of usefulness and<lb/>
life ahead of him. The silent tears suddenly overflowed and slipped<lb/>
down her face. Pressing the almost finished shirt against her eyes,<lb/>
she thought desperately, &ldquo;Not Jimmy! No, no, not Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>37.</p>
</div1>



<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="d9"><pb n="38" id="f06114038"/>
<head>CHAPTER IV</head>

<p>Jim was gone, and the unhappy gap he left in the family<lb/>
circle forecast a changed manner of life that was to last for<lb/>
four dreary years. In the summers he had taught his younger<lb/>
brothers to swim and ride, had cut them fishing poles and carried<lb/>
them piggie-back. Winters he had helped them with their lessons<lb/>
and household chores and romped with them when they were finished.<lb/>
Now he was gone, and life seemed flat in his absence.</p>
<p>When fall came, Chris and Walter and Tom went back to school<lb/>
as usual, now to the Union Academy where the schoolmasters, two<lb/>
s<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>vere gentlemen named Crenshaw and Hardy, taught the classical cur-<lb/>
riculum of the day and relied heavily on the hickory stick as an<lb/>
aid to learning. The Reed boys learned easily and were too<lb/>
38.<lb/>
<pb n="39" id="f06114039"/>
interested in their studies to need such stimulus, but many of their<lb/>
friends were less fortunate. Several of the less scholarly often<lb/>
sought their help with their Greek and Latin, in exchange for rides<lb/>
on their ponies, use of their marbles and similar inducements. It<lb/>
was an arrangement <del hand="unknown_hand">sanctioned</del> satisfactory to everyone, and sanctioned<lb/>
by long use.</p>
<p>Although school changed little, life outside it was very<lb/>
different. Abandoning cowboy-and-Indian as outmoded, Walter and<lb/>
Chris now played that they were daring Confederate soldiers, and<lb/>
uttered the hair-raising Rebel yell instead of the Indian warwhoop.<lb/>
But Tom rarely joined their games any more. He was too old to <hi rend="italic">play</hi><lb/>
at war, he told them, almost with impatience, and he stuck close to<lb/>
his father, questioning him about the military developments and<lb/>
growing daily more restless.</p>
<p>Ma and Laura were continually sewing. They gathered at the<lb/>
church with other neighborhood <del hand="unknown_hand">ladies</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">women</add>, to make clothes for the sol-<lb/>
diers. Cotton cloth was running out, and it was not long before<lb/>
spinning wheels and looms were brought down from attics and homespun<lb/>
garments began to appear again.</p>
<p>How to help the men in the army was the thought uppermost<lb/>
in every patriotic mind. Pies, cakes, hams and other things to<lb/>
eat were prepared and sent to the troops. It was not long, however,<lb/>
before Virginians began to feel the pinch as the food shortage set<lb/>
in. Desserts disappeared, luxuries went out of common use; all good<lb/>
things available were saved for the &ldquo;boys.&rdquo; As the grip of the block-<lb/>
ade established by the North gradually and surely tightened, even<lb/>
such necessities as salt and coffee became increasingly scarce.</p>
<p>Mr. Reed, taking his first taste of adulterated coffee,<lb/>
choked into his napkin and glared at his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heaven! <del hand="unknown_hand">Ma</del> What is this stuff, Ma?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>39.</p>
<pb n="40" id="f06114040"/>
<p>&ldquo;It is dreadful, isn't it?&rdquo; Ma agreed. &ldquo;I made it out of<lb/>
parched corn and dried sweet potatoes, and just the least pinch of<lb/>
coffee, for flavor. Mrs. Sydnor told me about it. She thinks<lb/>
sweet potatoe's better than rye. Our coffee is almost gone, and<lb/>
it's the last we'll be able to get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Reed poured into the despised brew a liberal amount<lb/>
of &ldquo;long sweetening,&rdquo; the sorghum which was replacing sugar, and<lb/>
stirred it with a resigned expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we shall have to accustom ourselves to it. I sup-<lb/>
pose we may even get to like it when we're used to it,&rdquo; he observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like tobacco, Pa?&rdquo; Walter inquired smiling.</p>
<p>His father laughed, something he rarely did now. &ldquo;I hope<lb/>
it won't be that hard, son!&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;Even so, we're much better<lb/>
off here than they are in Richmond and Petersburg, where only corn-<lb/>
bread and peas and sorghum are really plentiful. No one except the<lb/>
blockade runners has any of the luxuries -we used to consider them<lb/>
the necessities -of food and clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our poor soldiers,&rdquo; Mrs. Reed sighed, thinking of Jim<lb/>
with Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. His letters were infrequent,<lb/>
brief and cheerful. He had escaped the measles epidemic; the Yanks<lb/>
hadn't shot him -yet; the life was hard, the food rough and scanty;<lb/>
General Lee, adored by his men, shared their hardships and accep-<lb/>
ted few privileges; he called the Yankees &ldquo;those people,&rdquo; never<lb/>
&ldquo;the enemy&rdquo;; a soldier's life left little time for writing letters<lb/>
and he still hoped to enter the University, if not this fall, the<lb/>
one after.</p>
<p>The deferment of Jim's plans was significant of the altered<lb/>
attitude of the South. The Confederates were beginning to grasp<lb/>
40.<lb/>
<pb n="41" id="f06114041"/>
the length<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del> of the odds against them and underestimation of the<lb/>
enemy was giving way to sober realization of his strength. The<lb/>
northern campaign to capture Richmond in the spring of 1862 came<lb/>
dangerously close to success. Later in the year, the southern<lb/>
invasion of Maryland ended in failure at Antietam, the bloodiest<lb/>
battle of the entire war. For the Reeds this last engagement<lb/>
fought on the fabled Indian battle ground was not only a serious<lb/>
reverse to their cause, but a personal grief as well. Jim was<lb/>
wounded, his left arm shot away by a cannon ball.</p>
<p>All over Virginia boys were coming back like Jim -when they<lb/>
came back at all. You could comb the state and find hardly an able-<lb/>
bo<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">d</add>ied young man -only the very young and the crippled and the old.<lb/>
Even the University was deserted. Many of the professors had taken<lb/>
the field, and the few students were all either under military age,<lb/>
or disabled soldiers.</p>
<p>The war might disrupt the state and the nation, but the south-<lb/>
ern Methodist Church continued to operate on schedule. At the close<lb/>
of his two years at Blackstone, Mr. Reed in 1863 was transferred to<lb/>
a new circuit, this time to Lawrenceville, in Brunswick County, a<lb/>
few miles from the southern border of the state and a little far-<lb/>
ther from the front.</p>
<p>But near or far, there was no escaping the war. No matter<lb/>
where the fighting lines were, it was in their homes. Tom had re-<lb/>
ceived his father's consent and joined the army. The blockade was<lb/>
being more keenly felt. Food shortages amounted to acute hard-<lb/>
ships and the prices <del hand="unknown_hand">for</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">of</add> all commodities, calculated in the almost<lb/>
worthless Confederate money, were fantastic. Increasingly urgent<lb/>
appeals flooded the countryside from Petersburg, where the big mil-<lb/>
41.<lb/>
<pb n="42" id="f06114042"/>
itary hospitals, kept going largely by voluntary contributions,<lb/>
were in desperate need of food, clothing and, above all, medicine<lb/>
and surgical supplies.</p>
<p>On January 1st, 1863, President Lincoln had proclaimed those<lb/>
slaves within the enemy lines free. The Mississippi, back door of<lb/>
the Confederacy's foreign trade, had been effectively stoppered,<lb/>
and <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">seaport</add> after seaport was falling into the hands of the superior<lb/>
Yankee fleet. The incomparable Stonewall Jackson, idol of his men<lb/>
and right hand of Lee, was accidentally killed by his own sentries<lb/>
after the battle of Chancellorsville, another of those southern vic-<lb/>
tories which served only to stave off the end. It was God's pur-<lb/>
pose, a southern minister said later, that the South should be de-<lb/>
fe<del hand="unknown_hand">c</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">a</add>ted, but, he added quite without impiety, He first had to get rid<lb/>
of Stonewall before He could accomplish His will. Early in July<lb/>
Vicksburg, sole remaining southern port on the Mississippi, succumbed<lb/>
to siege. At the same time Lee, reminding his troops that vengeance<lb/>
was the Lord's, and not theirs, to execute, tried again to carry<lb/>
the war into enemy territory and was defeated at Gettysburg. The<lb/>
tide had already set against the South; now it was running strong.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa, you can stop worrying about your ink,&rdquo; Walter, running<lb/>
to meet his father in the yard, shouted to him. &ldquo;We've made you<lb/>
some. It's fine stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Mr. Reed, returning from a call on a sick parishoner,<lb/>
dismounted from Bess and hoisted his son into the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you <del hand="unknown_hand">manage,</del> manage it, son?&rdquo; he asked. It had be-<lb/>
come impossible to buy ink, and to a man who wrote as much as he,<lb/>
this was as great a hardship as the lack of tea and coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma thought of it,&rdquo; Walter told him, &ldquo;and Chris and I worked<lb/>
42.<lb/>
<pb n="43" id="f06114043"/>
on it.&rdquo; Riding the horse to the barn, with his father walking be-<lb/>
side him, Walter explained about the elderberry wine and soot. They<lb/>
had made several small batches, to work out the right proportions,<lb/>
and finally produced a satisfactory ink, smooth and glossy.</p>
<p>Pa was pleased. As he congratulated his wife on her ingen-<lb/>
uity, he was glad to observe that z her cheerfulness seemed less<lb/>
forced than it had for some time. Her determined vivacity had not<lb/>
concealed from him the effort behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was quite simple,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;The boys did all<lb/>
the work, anyway. Really, Pa, "it's wonderful how independent of<lb/>
foreign aid we are becoming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We're doing splendidly,&rdquo; he agreed heartily. His con-<lb/>
science compelled him to add, &ldquo;It's fortunate for us that there is<lb/>
this lull now, since the defeat at Gettysburg and Lee's offer to<lb/>
resign his command. It gives us a breathing space.&rdquo; A breathing<lb/>
space for what? he could not help wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was good blacking we made, too. Remember, Ma?&rdquo; Chris<lb/>
chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was indeed. I shouldn't wonder if we were quite self-<lb/>
sufficient in another year,&rdquo; his mother answered hopefully.</p>
<p>All at once, in the face of this indomitable, pathetic opti-<lb/>
mism, the minister found himself unable to evade his settled fears<lb/>
any longer. The blockade was all but impenetrable, their money<lb/>
worthless, medicine unobtainable, food scarce, their resources of<lb/>
materials and man power approaching exhaustion. How could they go<lb/>
on? He dropped into his chairs, grasping its familiar arms for as-<lb/>
surance in the whirling world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, my dear, let us not deceive ourselves any longer,&rdquo;<lb/>
he said with sudden, utter weariness. &ldquo;We are doing remarkably<lb/>
43.<lb/>
<pb n="44" id="f06114044"/>
well, but not well enough. Under the circumstances, no people could<lb/>
do better. But it won't <del hand="unknown_hand">do'</del> do. The war is already lost; soon<lb/>
it will be over. I am glad,&rdquo; he added, taking Chris and Walter by<lb/>
the hand, &ldquo;that you two boys have been spared the worst of it.<lb/>
When it is all over, then we will need men as never before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>But the sinking Confederacy, like a mortally ill man who by sheer<lb/>
will prolongs his life for a few more hours, would not die yet.</p>
<p>The fall and winter of 1863 and 1864 dragged past in com-<lb/>
parative quiet in Virginia. By the middle of January, 1864, there<lb/>
was only one port still open to blockade runners on the entire<lb/>
southern coastline, and with the return of spring the pressure on<lb/>
land began again. The Yankees were swarming irresistibly, in<lb/>
heartbreaking numbers, all over northern Virginia. Richmond, the<lb/>
precariously held capital, was continually shaken by alarming ru-<lb/>
mors and the &ldquo;croakers&rdquo; mournfully predicted surrender at any mo-<lb/>
ment. The rich Shenandoah Valley, a farm region vital to the<lb/>
half-starved Confederacy, was pillaged bare. Sherman made<lb/>
his desolating march from Atlanta to the sea, breaking the South<lb/>
in half. Lee, holed up in Petersburg, stood off Grant's advance<lb/>
against Richmond for nine months, while the Union foragers plucked<lb/>
the country clean for miles around. Confederate strength was al-<lb/>
most spent.</p>
<p>Even while the handful of Sheridan's raiders were cap-<lb/>
turing the minister's sons and the farmer's boy and appro-<lb/>
priating their horses on the bank of the Meherrin, southern<lb/>
resistance was collapsing.</p>
<p>On the night of April 9th, 1865, the can<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add>on boomed one<lb/>
44.<lb/>
<pb n="45" id="f06114045"/>
hundred times in the capital of the Confederacy, but it was several<lb/>
days before the news of Lee's surrender was confirmed in the evac-<lb/>
uated city.</p>
<p>The government had fled south a week before, and President<lb/>
Lincoln had entered Richmond, while General Lee, rallying his<lb/>
thirty-three thousand &ldquo;Miserables&rdquo; for the last time, retreated<lb/>
westward. Only eight thousand of his starved and tattered army<lb/>
remained when he reached Appomattox; the rest, scattered, captured,<lb/>
demoralized, had melted away on the march. Lee, as serene in de-<lb/>
feat as in victory, surrendered, and accepted General Grant's terms,<lb/>
offered with soldierly generosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our past is a memory,&rdquo; Pa said sadly to his sons when the<lb/>
bitter news of defeat reached them, &ldquo;but there is still the future.<lb/>
It is up to you, and to boys and young men like you, to make some-<lb/>
thing of it.&rdquo;</p>

<head>CHAPTER V</head>

<p>Now that the war was over, young Lieutenant William<lb/>
Richardson Abbot thought, he could get on with his work. His<lb/>
father had been a scholar, a gentleman and a schoolmaster; he,<lb/>
he trusted, would be another.</p>
<p>Educated at his father's academy near Washington, and<lb/>
at Georgetown College and Military Academy, young Abbot had at-<lb/>
tended the University of Virginia, where for his brilliance he<lb/>
had been given an honorary master's degree on his graduation in<lb/>
1857. Three pleasant years of teaching ended with <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">the outbreak of</add> the Civil War<lb/>
46.<lb/>
<pb n="47" id="f06114047"/>
and the young schoolmaster took a job in the Treasury Department<lb/>
at Richmond. Irked by the safety of his work, he later enlisted<lb/>
for active service, and was assigned to the First Regiment En-<lb/>
gineers. His engineers -it was a source of undying pride to him -<lb/>
had fired the last voll<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>y at Appomattox; then they <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">had</add> surrendered and<lb/>
he, like the other officers, had been paroled.</p>
<p>Soldiering had been his duty, not his choice, and he was<lb/>
glad to get back to his business. The South might be defeated, but<lb/>
there were always children to educate, boys of whom to make men.<lb/>
The country that had the finest men, he believed, was in the end<lb/>
the strongest country. So in the fall of 1865 Mr. Abbot opened,<lb/>
with Major Horace Jones, a day school for boys at Charlottesville,<lb/>
the Charlottesville Institute.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Mr. Reed had been worrying about his sons' education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm a poor man, Ma,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;I don't see how I'm<lb/>
to give those boys the education they should have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody's poor now,&rdquo; his wife had reminded him. &ldquo;I<lb/>
hope we can manage to send them to the University, too, but if we<lb/>
can't I shan't be too distressed. There's no finer man in the<lb/>
whole world than their Pa,&rdquo; she told him proudly, &ldquo;and he didn't<lb/>
go to college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Ma,&rdquo; Pa said, smiling, &ldquo;you'll turn my head.<lb/>
But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;if we could live at Charlottesville, half our<lb/>
problem would be solved. Then the boys could live at home instead<lb/>
of boarding at the University.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don't you <del hand="unknown_hand">to</del> talk to the bishop about it? It's<lb/>
time for us to move on, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lemuel Reed was a modest man. He did not feel that he<lb/>
47.<lb/>
<pb n="48" id="f06114048"/>
deserved any special consideration from his church, nor did he want<lb/>
it. But four boys, every one of them a fine fellow and deserving<lb/>
the best education available! Finally and with reluctance he told<lb/>
the bishop that, should there be an opening in a town having good<lb/>
educational facilities, he would appreciate being considered for<lb/>
it, for the sake of his sons. He was overjoyed when he was ap-<lb/>
pointed Presiding Elder of the Charlottesville district.</p>
<p>So it happened that, when Mr. Abbot opened his school,<lb/>
young Walter Reed was one of some thirty boys who attended it.</p>
<p>A mile or so of red mud separated the Charlottesville<lb/>
Institute from the University of Virginia, but the path led straight<lb/>
from the one to the other. Indeed, it was the single aim of all the<lb/>
classical schools in the state at that time to fit boys to pursue<lb/>
advanced studies at Mr. Jefferson's celebrated University. The<lb/>
courses of study at these schools were almost identical: Latin,<lb/>
Greek, mathematics, history, a modern language, and often a<lb/>
science course taught from a text book, without laboratory work.</p>
<p>Walter by now was an excellent linguist, well advanced<lb/>
in the classical languages; strangely, however, considering his<lb/>
later choice of medicine as a profession, he had no particular in-<lb/>
terest in science. But perhaps it was not so strange that the fu-<lb/>
ture doctor, whose consuming desire was to relieve suffering <del hand="unknown_hand">wherev</del><lb/>
wherever he found it, was unmoved by scientific study, drily pre-<lb/>
sented between cardboard covers and applying, so far as he could<lb/>
see, only indirectly to human problems.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster immediately liked his young pupil. The<lb/>
boy, he found, had a sound, keen mind, and enthusiasm for learning.<lb/>
Moreover, he had a gracious and winning personality: gaiety without<lb/>
48.<lb/>
<pb n="49" id="f06114049"/>
frivolity, and the unfailing, unstudied courtesy that springs from<lb/>
a warm and considerate nature.</p>
<p>Walter, in turn, was deeply impressed by this man with<lb/>
the erect bearing and vigorous intellect, whose formality was tem-<lb/>
pered with friendliness. All the boys were impressed by him, and<lb/>
imitated him in little ways. They cultivated his manner of speak-<lb/>
ing, tried to copy his incisive handwriting, and laboriously<lb/>
trained their hair to fall, like his unmanageable forelock, over<lb/>
their foreheads.</p>
<p>The schoolmaster's discipline <del hand="unknown_hand">wa</del> with his boys was aus-<lb/>
tere; it was more austere with himself. A teacher, in his opinion,<lb/>
should have a wide and thorough training to be worthy of his calling.<lb/>
But enthusiasm was the first essential. Mr. Abbot<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del> had a way<lb/>
of expressing himself in telling aphorisms. &ldquo;Who was ever con-<lb/>
vinced,&rdquo; Walter remembered his saying, &ldquo;by one who did not feel<lb/>
the truth? What mind was ever lighted up or warmed by that which<lb/>
was dark and cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the Virginia schoolmaster Walter learned his lessons<lb/>
well; he learned also principles of teaching which, thirty years<lb/>
later, were to come back to him in all their force and make him a<lb/>
teacher worthy of his old preceptor.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Metropolitan Charlottesville, with its five thousand in-<lb/>
habitants, half-dozen churches, stores, daily paper, Court House<lb/>
and cobbled streets, amazed the boy from the slow-paced rural to-<lb/>
bacco towns of mid-Virginia by its urban bustle; but it did not<lb/>
distract him from his object. He was anxious to get to the Univer-<lb/>
sity and begin his professional training, in what field he had not<lb/>
yet decided. He owed it to Pa and Ma to become self-supporting as<lb/>
49.<lb/>
<pb n="50" id="f06114050"/>
soon as possible; and his wish to do something that would &ldquo;help<lb/>
people,&rdquo; as he had hesitantly expressed it to Joey, made him want<lb/>
to get out into the world without waste of time.</p>
<p>In the roomy brick house in Charlottesville life shifted<lb/>
back to its pleasant pre-war routine, a routine which Walter had<lb/>
almost forgotten. He worked hard for Mr. Abbot, and stood close<lb/>
to the head of his class; he listened tirelessly to his elder<lb/>
brother's accounts of that Mecca of all Virginia students, the Uni-<lb/>
versity; sometimes he made short trips with Pa, or tramped with<lb/>
Chris over the rolling green hills surrounding Charlottesville.</p>
<p>The pleasant, profitable fall gave way to winter, and the<lb/>
time passed rapidly -almost like a happy dream, Walter thought,<lb/>
looking backward sorrowfully, shaken by his first major grief.<lb/>
Early in February, 1866, Mrs. Reed died, leaving her family, in<lb/>
their first shock, unable to see how they would get along without<lb/>
her. Ma, with her sympathy and humor, her inexhaustible energy<lb/>
and patience and enterprise, had more than anyone else made the<lb/>
family a closely united one.</p>
<p><del hand="unknown_hand">The effect of her death on Walter was to make him apply<lb/>
himself even more closely to his studies. It</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">Her death</add> brought home to <del hand="unknown_hand">him</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">Walter</add><lb/>
jarringly the knowledge that the span of a life is relatively short.<lb/>
If he was to accomplish anything worth while in the world in which<lb/>
so much needed to be done, he had no time to lose.</p>
<p>He worked with extra diligence the rest of that session,<lb/>
and again the following. At the end of the second he was ready to<lb/>
enter the University -except for one thing, and that was beyond<lb/>
his control. He was under the required age. He decided, however,<lb/>
to try. The authorities were doubtful. They conceded that there<lb/>
50.<lb/>
<pb n="51" id="f06114051"/>
was nothing wrong with his scholarship or preparation. After all, had<lb/>
he not been in the hands of their own Mr. Abbot? But, they thought,<lb/>
it was unwise to accept so young a student, a mere boy. Finally,<lb/>
perhaps on his schoolmaster's recommendation, they consented to admit<lb/>
him.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1867, Walter Reed, barely sixteen, entered the<lb/>
University of Virginia.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The shade of Thomas Jefferson still lingered almost visibly<lb/>
over the University he had founded nearly half a century<lb/>
earlier. Although for more than forty years he had been lying in<lb/>
the little family burial plot on the shaggy Virginia<lb/>
hillside crowned by his beloved home, Monticello, professors and<lb/>
students respectfully alluded to &ldquo;Mr. Jefferson&rdquo; almost as though<lb/>
he might any day ride in again, as he had on his last visit, to con-<lb/>
sult with Mr. William Wertenbaker, the librarian, about cataloguing<lb/>
some new books.</p>
<p>The University was peculiarly the product of his versatile<lb/>
genius. Not only had he planned its first curriculum, engaged its<lb/>
original faculty and shaped its policies, but also he had designed<lb/>
and erected its buildings. The Rotunda, adapted from the Roman<lb/>
Pantheon, and the flanking pavillions, model<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del>ed after Roman temples<lb/>
and baths, suggested the great democrat's admiration for the sturdy,<lb/>
uncorrupted republic of Rome.</p>
<p>A strong unanimity of feeling existed among both students and<lb/>
professors. They were united not so much by their lost cause -that<lb/>
was history now -as by the resolution to do everything in their<lb/>
power to restore the prostrated South <del hand="unknown_hand">of</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">to</add> economic and political<lb/>
51.<lb/>
<pb n="52" id="f06114052"/>
health. During the war many of its most promising boys and valuable<lb/>
professional men had been killed. Those who were left had much to<lb/>
do. The student body was more than usually serious, too, for an-<lb/>
other reason: all of them had grown up among the sobering<lb/>
hardships of the war, and a number, especially in the professional<lb/>
schools, were young men in their middle twenties who had interrupted<lb/>
their training to fight through the four years. A few, like Jim,<lb/>
had a missing arm or leg, a limp or a patch over the eye, to testi-<lb/>
fy to their service.</p>
<p>The faculty were worthy successors to those men whom Mr.<lb/>
Jefferson had picked to conform to his exacting ideal of the good<lb/>
teacher. Walter now studied Greek with Dr. Basil Lanneau Gilder-<lb/>
sleeve, considered the finest Greek scholar in the country, and<lb/>
author of the Latin grammar he had used as a child. Dr. Gildersleeve's<lb/>
cutaway and silk hat, his full black beard and mustache, his limp<lb/>
from a battle wound -he had taught during the sessions, fought<lb/>
through the vacations -made him one of the most distinguished fig-<lb/>
ures at the University, while his erudition and good-humored witti-<lb/>
cisms made him a popular teacher. The unimposing appearance of<lb/>
Walter's professor of history and literature, Dr. George Frederick<lb/>
Holmes, did little to suggest his scholarship and ability. Habitu-<lb/>
ally garbed in an ill-fitting cutaway and shapeless pantaloons, with<lb/>
his neck in the grip of a badly knotted cravat, he always conveyed<lb/>
the impression of being in a great hurry, as he strode along, gray<lb/>
whiskers flying and gold-rimmed spectacles glittering.</p>
<p>Dr. William Elisha Peters, with whom Walter studied Latin,<lb/>
was a small, mild man, plain in his dress but vastly proud of his<lb/>
dainty feet, which he never disfigured, even in the worst weather,<lb/>
with overshoes. No one laughed at his little vanity. He was a man<lb/>
52.<lb/>
<pb n="53" id="f06114053"/>
of character, and entitled to his foibles. As a colonel in the Con-<lb/>
federate army, it was said, he had refused the order of his superior<lb/>
officer to burn Chambersburg with the retort, &ldquo;I am not in the war<lb/>
to burn the homes of helpless women and children&rdquo; -a piece of in-<lb/>
subordination which General Lee later approved.</p>
<p>There were other celebrated characters, too, at the Uni-<lb/>
versity whom Walter frequently saw. William Holmes McGuffey, from<lb/>
whose readers he and countless other children had learned reading<lb/>
and morality, both similarly adjusted to their years, taught Moral<lb/>
Philosophy. A small, beardless, bright-eyed man, he was pointed out<lb/>
to Walter as he trotted along the arcade, carrying a cane and dressed<lb/>
with old-fashioned conservatism in a long, black, full-skirted coat,<lb/>
a high collar and stock and a tall silk hat.</p>
<p>Another figure having a distinction all his own was Mr.<lb/>
Wertenbaker, almost the last man left at the University who had known<lb/>
the great founder personally. Small and infirm, with a wrinkled<lb/>
face topped by thin gray hair, he was looked on with general affec-<lb/>
tion by the boys. He handled the University's printing, made up the<lb/>
annual catalogue, kept the library open at specified hours every day,<lb/>
filled in and signed diplomas, and played chess tirelessly in his<lb/>
spare time in the back room of Dr. Michie's drugstore. More than<lb/>
anything else he loved to recall the early days of the University,<lb/>
when Mr. Jefferson was Rector, Mr. Madison and Mr. Monroe were on<lb/>
the Board of Visitors, and Mr. <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">Poe</add> was a student.</p>
<p>The only other relic of Mr. Jefferson's day then remaining<lb/>
was Henry Martin, the ancient and respected Negro who had been<lb/>
brought from Monticello in the year of his master's death. A tall,<lb/>
stalwar<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">t</add> old man, with thick black hair, almost straight, a long,<lb/>
53.<lb/>
<pb n="54" id="f06114054"/>
thin goatee and remarkable gray-blue eyes, he rang the bell hourly<lb/>
for classes, kept the fires going in the Rotunda and classrooms<lb/>
and took care of the buildings. Perhaps his most impressive at-<lb/>
tribute was his ability to call every student by name, not only<lb/>
during his years of residence at the University, but long after.</p>
<p>No time was wasted at the University. Classes began early<lb/>
in the morning, the school year was nine months long, and no va-<lb/>
cations broke it. The faculty thought long holidays were demoral-<lb/>
izing; even Christmas was observed with but a single day's free-<lb/>
dom. Any interruption to the business of educati<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">ng</add> young men to<lb/>
take responsible places in society was less than ever to be per-<lb/>
mitted when the South, prostrated under the extreme measures of<lb/>
the Reconstruction, needed intelligent and well trained men to<lb/>
re-establish it.</p>
<p>Walter quickly felt at home attending lectures or work-<lb/>
ing in the library in the Rotunda, walking to class through the<lb/>
arcades formed by the classical porticoes of the pavillions, or<lb/>
strolling with one of his brothers down the avenues of trees on<lb/>
the Lawn. It was a conge<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add>ial and stimulating atmosphere for the<lb/>
boy whose youthful face was already beginning to assume the ex-<lb/>
pression of intentness that later characterized the doctor.</p>
<p>At home life was much happier than it had been at any<lb/>
time since Ma's death. Pa had married again, Mrs. Mary Byrd<lb/>
Kyle of Harrisonburg, Virginia, and although no one could replace<lb/>
Ma, the boys soon became fond of their step-mother. Laura<lb/>
had married J. W. Blincoe and gone to Ashland, and they had<lb/>
missed having a woman in the family. When a baby half-sister,<lb/>
Annie, was born, they all felt that their shattered family was,<lb/>
54.<lb/>
<pb n="55" id="f06114055"/>
in a sense, restored.</p>
<p>Walter was charmed by Annie. She seemed to like him, too, or<lb/>
at least to think he was funny, and laughed and clucked at him as<lb/>
she clung to his extended finger with the surprising<del hand="unknown_hand">ly</del> tenacity of<lb/>
very small babies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember when Walter was born, Jim?&rdquo; Tom asked at<lb/>
supper one evening. &ldquo;What a terrible little pest you and I thought<lb/>
he was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I! He couldn't do a thing for himself except yell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'd just about reconciled ourselves to Chris, and then there<lb/>
was this new baby. But we finally got kind of used to him, too,&rdquo;<lb/>
Tom added, grinning at his youngest brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter, as I remember him, was much squallier than Annie,&rdquo; Pa<lb/>
joined in the teasing, &ldquo;and the house was smaller, too. I think<lb/>
babies have improved a lot in the last sixteen years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Pa,&rdquo; Walter answered good-humoredly, &ldquo;I hope I've im-<lb/>
proved in the last sixteen years, too, although I know I still<lb/>
can't compete with the young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't see how any of you could improve any more,&rdquo; Mrs.<lb/>
Reed confessed, smiling around happily at them. &ldquo;You'd be too good<lb/>
to be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>At the University Walter was working very hard. He had a<lb/>
plan in the back of his head. It might take persuasion to put it<lb/>
across; certainly it would take hard work, and he would need the<lb/>
highest marks he could get. He intended to ask for his bachelor's<lb/>
degree at the end of his first year because he realized that it<lb/>
was too hard for Pa to keep three boys in the University at once.<lb/>
The University sometimes certified students whose records <del hand="unknown_hand">was</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">were</add><lb/>
55.<lb/>
<pb n="56" id="f06114056"/>
very good, and he was out to make the best one possible.</p>
<p>He still found time, however, to stop occasionally for a<lb/>
chat with Mr. Wertenbaker when he climbed to the library by the<lb/>
narrow, steep stairs which, built into the wall and hidden from<lb/>
sight, were the only kind Mr. Jefferson could tolerate.<lb/>
Sometimes the old gentleman would show him a cherished book, its<lb/>
fly leaf endorsed in the founder's fine, legible hand, or read him<lb/>
a page from the new life of Jefferson by Hershey, the English his-<lb/>
torian, just published by Thomas Jefferson Randolph, Mr. Jefferson's<lb/>
devoted grandson. Once he showed him a framed letter from Mr. Jeffer-<lb/>
son to young Mr. Kean*, appointing him student assistant in the li-<lb/>
brary in the first year of the University's existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a fine young gentleman,&rdquo; the old librarian reminisced.<lb/>
&ldquo;His son was a student here, too. He married a Randolph, daughter<lb/>
of Mr. Jefferson's grandson, and now he has a fine little boy, must<lb/>
be six or seven years old by this time. He'll come here too, like<lb/>
his pa and his grandpa.&rdquo; He was off now on a complicated genealog-<lb/>
ical discourse to which Walter, smiling, only half listened. He did<lb/>
not foresee that this little boy, in whose existence he was now<lb/>
barely interested, was in thirty years be his colleague and dear<lb/>
friend.</p>
<p>Once in a while, as long as the ice held, Walter would go<lb/>
skating with Chris or Tom or some of the other students on the<lb/>
University ice pond, or on Cochran's pond beyond Charlottesville.<lb/>
As spring came on the boys took long rambles in the hills around<lb/>
the city, and once had a picnic at Monticello.</p>
<p>The beautiful home of Thomas Jefferson, the site of which<lb/>
he had selected in his youth and which he had spent some thirty<lb/>
* Pronounced <hi rend="italic">Kane</hi><lb/>
56.<lb/>
<pb n="57" id="f06114057"/>
years in building, was in ruins. The roof was decayed and the rooms<lb/>
were dust covered and mouldering, with cracked walls and fallen<lb/>
ceilings. Windows and shutters, skillfully designed by their arch-<lb/>
itect to give the impression of a one story rather than a two story<lb/>
house, were broken and unhinged. The slates of the porch were over-<lb/>
grown with moss, and visitors had disfigured with their names and<lb/>
their sentiments the front door and the columns of the portico.<lb/>
The overseer, so old that he was nearer dead than alive, always wel-<lb/>
comed students and let them roam freely. After all, what more harm<lb/>
could they do than his own goats and chickens, innocent creatures<lb/>
who wandered at liberty through all the rooms?</p>
<p>Even in its decay, the building impressed Walter with its<lb/>
simple grandeur and dignity. The hens scattered ahead of the boys<lb/>
as they came into the spacious entrance hall, covered with the<lb/>
second parquet floor ever seen in the country -the first had been<lb/>
in the palace of the colonial governors at Williamsburg, and Mr.<lb/>
Jefferson, during his residence there, had admired it. Set above<lb/>
the front door, the ingenious two-faced clock of his own design,<lb/>
which had once told for the benefit of the absent-minded the day of<lb/>
the week as well as the hour, looked blind and broken with its in-<lb/>
ner face on the desolate elegance of the big hall, while its outer<lb/>
one gazed blankly over the weedy lawn and the wooded hill. A skinny<lb/>
goat stared back at them, curiosity in its mild eyes, from the room<lb/>
in which the great man had worked on the plans for the University,<lb/>
then scampered out of the way. In an upper room, reached by the<lb/>
narrow, typically Jeffersonian stairs, they found the coach in which<lb/>
the Marquis de Lafayette had ridden on one of his visits to the<lb/>
University, stored there for a reason long since forgotten by someone<lb/>
equally lost to memory.</p>
<p>57.</p>
<pb n="58" id="f06114058"/>
<p>The ruin of the beautiful house, which had been its arch-<lb/>
itect's beloved home for fifty years, distressed Walter. Its<lb/>
desolation seemed to reproach the scanty honor done to the memory<lb/>
of a great man in letting the place he loved most on earth fall<lb/>
into decay. But Mr. Jefferson, Walter reflected, had left behind<lb/>
him, in the Declaration, in the University, in all his other varied<lb/>
achievements, more lasting memorials. Let his home, let every<lb/>
physical reminder of him crumble; he would still be remembered be-<lb/>
cause he did work worth doing, and did it well. That was better<lb/>
than a monument.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was the last week of the term. Walter <del hand="unknown_hand">had</del> waited for<lb/>
a quarter of an hour in the hall, then came out on the steps of<lb/>
the Rotunda and stood looking down the Lawn. A slender boy of med-<lb/>
ium height and erect carriage, he had a determined, almost stubborn,<lb/>
mouth, and his blue eyes were clear and pleasant. Straight brown<lb/>
hair was brushed neatly across his forehead, which he patted with<lb/>
a clean white handkerchief. It was warm now, mid-June, but not<lb/>
warm enough to account for the prickle between his shoulder blades,<lb/>
or the dampness of his palms. He ran his finger around his collar,<lb/>
which felt too tight, then hoped that he hadn't disarranged the<lb/>
cravat his step-mother had carefully knotted for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to look your very best, Walter, when you go<lb/>
before the faculty,&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;A neat appearance always helps.<lb/>
Pa's so proud of you. I do hope your application will be success-<lb/>
ful. Such a shame you haven't a beard,&rdquo; she added, touching his<lb/>
smooth cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long, wooly beard at sixteen, ma'am?&rdquo; he teased her.<lb/>
&ldquo;I'd be a freak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>58.</p>
<pb n="59" id="f06114059"/>
<p>&ldquo;Not a long one -just enough to shave, so you'd look older,&rdquo;<lb/>
she explained. They had both laughed.</p>
<p>Walter felt very little like laughing now, as he leaned<lb/>
against the column and waited to be summoned before the faculty for<lb/>
their decision. He had made his request to be certified for a<lb/>
bachelor's degree without completing the academic course, a<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del>nd he<lb/>
was to receive his answer today. Although such exceptions were<lb/>
occasionally made, he feared that his youth would prevent it<lb/>
in his case. If they refused him -well, then he had another pro-<lb/>
position to make to them.</p>
<p>Behind him he heard a door open, and turned. Dr. Holmes was<lb/>
peering up and down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Reed, there you are. Will you come in now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter followed him into the lecture room. Ten or a dozen<lb/>
professors were standing around talking to each other. He<lb/>
recognized, besides those under whom he studied, Dr. Socrates Mau-<lb/>
pin, chairma<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add> of the faculty and professor of chemistry and phar-<lb/>
macy; Dr. James C. Cabell, one of a family famous in Virginia his-<lb/>
tory; and Dr. John Staige Davis, the professor of anato<del hand="unknown_hand">r</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">m</add>y. Dr.<lb/>
James Harrison, teacher of legal medicine and obstetrics, was<lb/>
raptly following a play by lay account of one of Lee's victories<lb/>
given by Colonel Venable, who had been a staff officer of the general's.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Mr. Reed,&rdquo; Dr. Maupin greeted him. &ldquo;Gentlemen,<lb/>
shall we continue our business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all resumed their seats, and in the brief silence that<lb/>
followed Walter could hear his heart thump.</p>
<p>Dr. Maupin, clearing his throat, looked around him and then<lb/>
at Walter.</p>
<p>59.</p>
<pb n="60" id="f06114060"/>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Reed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am very sorry to disappoint you.<lb/>
It is, however, the decision of this faculty that we cannot waive<lb/>
the regulations to certify you for a degree, under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, sir,&rdquo; Walter answered slowly, fighting back his<lb/>
disappointment. &ldquo;My work has not been up to the required standard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, my boy. Your record is excellent, excel-<lb/>
lent. Your age is the obstacle. A graduate of sixteen is almost<lb/>
unheard of, and as a matter of long range policy we do not care to<lb/>
set such a <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">P</add>recedent, however worthy your case may be. We made,<lb/>
you will recall, an exception to let you into the University. It<lb/>
would really be too much to have to make another to let you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter could not help smiling, Dr. Maupin had put it so<lb/>
neatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir. I must bow to your judgment,&rdquo; he agreed.<lb/>
&ldquo;But may I make another request?&rdquo; The chairman assented. &ldquo;Will<lb/>
you give me a medical degree next year, if I pass the examination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Cabell, whose chin had been sunk up to the fringe of<lb/>
his side <del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">w</add>hiskers in his stiff collar, straightened and looked<lb/>
sharply at the slim, beardless young man. The medical school, one<lb/>
of the best in the country, would give a degree to any student,<lb/>
regardless of the length of his attendance who could pass the ri-<lb/>
gorous examination. It was rare for anyone to do it in less than t<lb/>
two years; some took more. If the boy wanted to get his degree the<lb/>
hard way, let him try it, Dr. Cabell thought, and shrugged. If he<lb/>
hadn't the brain or the stamina, and it would take plenty of both,<lb/>
he wouldn't last long.</p>
<p>Walter was waiting for an answer. For a moment there was<lb/>
none. The gentlemen were glancing doubtfully at each other, with<lb/>
60.<lb/>
<pb n="61" id="f06114061"/>
expressions which held a trace of amused pity for this over-con-<lb/>
fident boy.</p>
<p>To clinch matters, he added, with a deferential little how<lb/>
toward the anatomy teacher,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Dr. Davis has blazed the trail, perhaps it will<lb/>
not be impossible for others to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Davis, who had received his own medical degree from the<lb/>
University when he was seventeen, smiled broadly at the adroit and<lb/>
flattering invocation of precedent. Consulting the other doc-<lb/>
tors with a glance, he nodded to Walter. Walter drew his first<lb/>
deep breath that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; he said warmly. &ldquo;Dr. Maupin, you have<lb/>
witnessed these gentlemen's consent. Will you see that I get my<lb/>
medical degree if I meet the required standard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it, if you pass the examinations,&rdquo; Dr.<lb/>
Maupin promised him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, gentlemen,&rdquo; Walter turned to the faculty, &ldquo;I shall<lb/>
hold you to your word.&rdquo; He bowed to them and left the room.</p>
<p>Alone in the hall, he leaned against the wall, his knees<lb/>
suddenly limp. Pulling his handkerchief out, he patted his fore-<lb/>
head and wiped his damp palms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven,&rdquo; he thought fervently, &ldquo;my voice didn't break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another year, and what a year it would be, what a mountain<lb/>
of work in it! But at the end of it, a profession to practice, and<lb/>
beyond, the world and the future! Elated, he set off as fast as<lb/>
he could walk to tell Pa and the family.</p>
<p>Back in the lecture room, Dr. Harrison was shaking his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm doubtful about it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's a dreadful grind<lb/>
for one year. Few have tried it, and fewer have come through it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>61.</p>
<pb n="62" id="f06114062"/>
<p>&ldquo;I think he may make it,&rdquo; Dr. Gildersleeve observed. &ldquo;He's<lb/>
an excellent student, quick and sound. Look at his record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scarcely anticipate that he will win his degree in a<lb/>
year,&rdquo; someone else remarked, &ldquo;and I am even more doubtful of the<lb/>
wis<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">d</add>om of giving it to him if he does. A <del hand="unknown_hand">goy</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">boy</add> of that age lacks<lb/>
balance, experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There I can't agree with you, sir,&rdquo; Dr. Davis came to the<lb/>
defense. &ldquo;He appears to be a very competent young man. He<lb/>
behaved like a reasonable adult, respectful, no show of disappoint-<lb/>
ment; and his reminder that he had precedent on his side was most<lb/>
tactfully put. And,&rdquo; he added with a smile, &ldquo;he kept his wits about<lb/>
him -no loose ends. He left us no way out. He exacted our word,<lb/>
and we will have to give him the degree if he passes. It was a<lb/>
very smooth performance for a youngster. I have an idea that we may<lb/>
make a fine doctor of that young fellow,&rdquo;</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI</head>

<p>The oil in his lamp was almost gone, Walter noticed. Turning<lb/>
the flame low, he pushed back his book and got up from the desk.<lb/>
His legs were stiff from long sitting, and he had a crick in his<lb/>
neck. Stretching, he went to the window. The silence lay softly<lb/>
over the dark city as he looked out at the starry night.</p>
<p>Since he had been attending classes and studying eight-<lb/>
een or twenty hours a day, the <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">nighttime</add> had become almost as<lb/>
familiar to him as the daylight in which he had been moving for<lb/>
seventeen years. He liked the feeling of having the world <del hand="unknown_hand">to</del> all<lb/>
63.<lb/>
<pb n="64" id="f06114064"/>
to himself that came when everyone else was in bed. Then he had<lb/>
elbow room to think and study; the dark and the silence quenched<lb/>
all distractions. At this hour, too late for the most determined<lb/>
merrymakers, only the ill and the unhappy -and the very diligent-<lb/>
were still up. Even Chris, who had sat up studying with him until<lb/>
well past midnight, had gone to bed.</p>
<p>The door opened softly, and Walter turned to see Pa,<lb/>
dressed, like most of the male population of the country at this<lb/>
hour, in the classic white nightshirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Aren't you ever going to<lb/>
bed? It's after three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Pa. I'm going soon. We're having a chem-<lb/>
istry quizz tomorrow, and I wanted to brush up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another? You had one a couple of weeks ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. We have them all the time. In everything.<lb/>
It keeps <del hand="unknown_hand">you on your toes, and keeps</del> your knowledge in circulation.<lb/>
You don't have a chance to forget what you've learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a good system,&rdquo; his father agreed. &ldquo;But I'm wor-<lb/>
ried about you, Walter. I don't think you've had more than four<lb/>
or five hours sleep a night for weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm trying to do two years' work in one, Pa,&rdquo; Walter<lb/>
reminded him. &ldquo;I'm not brilliant, so I can't learn without work-<lb/>
ing, but I can work hard, and I must. It isn't doing me any harm.<lb/>
I have no fear of the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have,&rdquo; Pa said with emphasis. &ldquo;You'll make your-<lb/>
self sick by not getting enough rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think so. I feel fine. In any case, I have no<lb/>
choice. I got into medicine by accident, but I can't stay in it<lb/>
that way. I'll have to work my hardest, especially if I'm to get<lb/>
64.<lb/>
<pb n="65" id="f06114065"/>
my degree by the end of this session. Getting a medical education<lb/>
isn't the easy thing it used to be, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter, the best assets you'll ever have in your life<lb/>
are your health and your wits. Keeping hours like this will ruin<lb/>
one and addle the other. Now get on to bed, like a good fellow,&rdquo;<lb/>
Pa said authoritatively. &ldquo;You can resume your education in the<lb/>
morning,&rdquo; he went on drily. Whatever else you may think, the night<lb/>
was created for rest, and there are few better used to which you can<lb/>
put it."</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Pa,&rdquo; Walter <del hand="unknown_hand">yild</del> yielded with a smile. &ldquo;I'll go<lb/>
now. But pleas<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add> stop worrying about me.&rdquo; Picking up the lamp, he<lb/>
followed Pa into the hall. At the door of the room he and Chris<lb/>
shared he whispered good night to his father. Then, blowing out<lb/>
the lamp, he quietly opened the door and slipped noiselessly<lb/>
into the dark room, so as not to disturb his sleeping brother.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Walter was right when he said that a medical education<lb/>
was not the easy thing to acquire that it had been; certainly it<lb/>
was not if you went to the University of Virginia for it.</p>
<p>During most of the <del hand="unknown_hand">previous</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">eighteenth</add> century there had been no<lb/>
medical schools at all in America. Very few men went abroad to<lb/>
study. A young man who wanted to be a doctor apprenticed himself<lb/>
to a physician for a period of from three to eight years, accompan-<lb/>
ied him on his calls and helped him compound his medicines. Then,<lb/>
having learned as much as his native ability permitted through ob-<lb/>
servation, trial and error, he went into practice for himself.</p>
<p>In the decade before the Revolutionary War two medical<lb/>
schools had been founded: the Medical College of Philadelphia, which<lb/>
later became a part of the University of Pennsylvania, and the med-<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">64.</del> 65.<lb/>
<pb n="66" id="f06114066"/>
ical school of King's College, afterward Columbia Uni-<lb/>
versity's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Before the end of<lb/>
the century, both Harvard and Dartmouth had established medical<lb/>
schools. Then a mushroom growth of <del hand="unknown_hand">medical schools</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">them</add> set in. A<lb/>
large proportion of them, staffed by incompetents and quacks and<lb/>
run for private profit only, graduated &ldquo;doctors&rdquo; after only a few<lb/>
months of perfunctory training. In spite of the work of the few<lb/>
good schools, by the middle of the nineteenth century the reputation<lb/>
of American medical education was so scandalous, and its results<lb/>
were so dire, that a group of reputable and well trained physicians<lb/>
formed the American Medical Association, with the primary purpose<lb/>
of forcing certain minimum uniform requirements on both schools and<lb/>
students. Their progress was slow and often discouraging, but the<lb/>
association did, <del hand="unknown_hand">eventually</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">gradually</add>, cause a great improvement in medical<lb/>
education.</p>
<p>The medical training offered by the University of Virginia,<lb/>
however, had never caused the educational reformers a moment's dis-<lb/>
tress. Its term of study was considerably longer, and its require-<lb/>
ments for the degree were more exacting by far than those of the<lb/>
general run of medical colleges. It ranked with the best schools<lb/>
of the time. Although it had no hospital attached to it then, and<lb/>
hence few facilities for clinical instruction, its theoretical<lb/>
teaching was unexcelled, as its founder, himself a more skilled<lb/>
and learned practitioner than most doctors of his day, had intended<lb/>
it should be. In Walter's time, those who intended to go into<lb/>
practice usually went to Philadelphia or New York after their grad-<lb/>
uation, where they got their clinical experience and took another<lb/>
medical degree at a college connected with a hospital.</p>
<p>The current state of medical knowledge was reflected in<lb/>
66.<lb/>
<pb n="67" id="f06114067"/>
the school's curriculum. When Walter studied there he took just<lb/>
four courses: chemistry and pharmacy under Dr. Maupin; medicine,<lb/>
which included legal medicine and obstetrics, with Dr. Harrison;<lb/>
physiology and surgery with Dr. Cabell; and anatomy and <hi rend="italic">materia<lb/>
medica</hi> with Dr. Davis. That session, for the first time, Dr. John<lb/>
William Mallet was offering his optional course in clinical micro-<lb/>
scopy, but there is no record to show that Walter took it.</p>
<p>Acceptance in America of the discoveries of Pasteur, which<lb/>
were to revolutionize both the theory and practice of the science<lb/>
of healing, was still several years in the future. No one in this<lb/>
country conceived of the role of bacteria in disease and infection.<lb/>
Preventive medicine and sanitation were practically unexplored<lb/>
fields, although it was realized that there was some connection be-<lb/>
tween cleanliness and good health. Epidemic fevers were still at-<lb/>
tributed variously to filth, the night air, &ldquo;miasmas&rdquo; and the wrath<lb/>
of God. The few medical men who ventured to suggest that insects<lb/>
might have something to do with the spread of several of them were<lb/>
decried by the profession as crackpots.</p>
<p>Although the discovery some twenty years earlier of an-<lb/>
aesthetic agents, the greatest single medical advance of the century<lb/>
up to that time, had given surgery a great impetus, Lister's re-<lb/>
cently demonstrated antiseptic technique had as yet gained no fol-<lb/>
lowers in this country. Wounds either healed &ldquo;by first intention&rdquo;<lb/>
-that is, immediately and without complication -or something mys-<lb/>
teriously went wrong and infection set in. When Walter was study-<lb/>
ing, even the most scrupulous surgeon would have dismissed as ri-<lb/>
diculous the notion that he might be carrying with him, from one of<lb/>
his patients to another, infection and even death on his bright in-<lb/>
struments and his bare hands.</p>
<p>67.</p>
<pb n="68" id="f06114068"/>
<p>The sum total of medical knowledge, however, had increased vastly<lb/>
over the preceding century. Much more was known of the functions<lb/>
of the body and its organs, and of the cellular structure<lb/>
of bone and tissue. Diseases were more accurately classified and<lb/>
identified, and symptoms were differentiated from diseases them-<lb/>
selves. Typhus and typhoid were no longer confused; measles, scar-<lb/>
letina, smallpox and chickenpo<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">x</add> were clearly distinguished. The<lb/>
&ldquo;bilious remittent fevers&rdquo; were now separated into yellow fever,<lb/>
dengue, typhoid and malaria. Kidney diseases had been recognized<lb/>
and described, heart and lung and other diseases of organs identi-<lb/>
fied. Medical knowledge was constantly on the march, a march no<lb/>
less significant for being overshadowed by the tremendous burst of<lb/>
progress shortly to follow.</p>
<p>The tools physicians worked with had improved, too. The<lb/>
stethescope had been in use for about fifty years, enabling doc-<lb/>
tors better to diagnose valvular diseases of the heart. The clin-<lb/>
ica<del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>n</unclear></del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">l</add> thermometer, an unwieldly instrument almost a foot long, was<lb/>
just coming into general use, and could reveal to a physician in<lb/>
five minutes whether his patient had a fever or not. The hypoder-<lb/>
mic syringe was beginning to be used, as were various instruments<lb/>
useful in examination and diagnosis. The greatly improved micro-<lb/>
scope made possible the study of cellular structure.</p>
<p>At the University of Virginia most of the medical lec-<lb/>
tures were given in the upstairs room of the small square brick<lb/>
building to the west of the other University buildings. Five<lb/>
years before, Henry Scharf had completed his beautifully executed<lb/>
series of colored plates, considered at the time the finest anat-<lb/>
omical pictures in the country, for the use of the physiology and<lb/>
68.<lb/>
<pb n="69" id="f06114069"/>
anatomy classes; and although the practice of working on cadavers<lb/>
and, later, <del hand="unknown_hand">on,</del> on laboratory animals, was to make them outmoded in<lb/>
time, they were in constant use in Walter's day, when it was still<lb/>
difficult to obtain corpses for medical students to dissect.</p>
<p>The University's medical course had provided for dissec-<lb/>
tion from its beginning, but it was not until 1884 that the state<lb/>
recognized the need for legal provisions governing the supply of<lb/>
anatomical material. Until then, all medical schools in Virginia<lb/>
had to obtain bodies by such devices as grave-robbing and bribing<lb/>
dishonest undertakers to bury coffins heavy not with the remains<lb/>
of the dear departed, but with weights. Executed criminals and<lb/>
paupers buried in the potters' field were fair game for the resur-<lb/>
rectionists, as the grave-robbers were called.</p>
<p>The operations of the resurrectionists provoked a cer-<lb/>
tain ghoulish humor, as the following jingle, popular among medical<lb/>
students of the time, suggests:</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>The body-snatchers, they have come,</l>
<l>And made a snatch at me.</l>
<l>It's very hard them kind of men</l>
<l>Won't let a body be!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Don't go and weep upon my grave</l>
<l>And think that there I be.</l>
<l>They haven't left an atom there</l>
<l>Of my anatomy!</l>
</lg>
<p>At the University of Virginia the problem of getting<lb/>
cadavers was left to one of the janitors -not to Old Henry, who<lb/>
69.<lb/>
<pb n="70" id="f06114070"/>
was too dignified to be cast in the horrid role of body-snatcher,<lb/>
but to another less venerable. Only a real love of science got<lb/>
most of the students through the anatomy course. The cadavers,<lb/>
few in number and ill preserved, gave many of the boys a life-<lb/>
long distaste for dead bodies -not a bad thing, after all,<lb/>
in a doctor.</p>
<p>Sometimes, looking back on his days as a medical student,<lb/>
Walter wondered how he could have handled so much work. Day after<lb/>
day, he spent hours in the dissecting room, <del hand="unknown_hand">sometimes with a wet<lb/>
handkerchief tied over his mouth and nose to make the smell more<lb/>
supportable</del>, working on the corpse of some pauper or criminal who<lb/>
was rendering this final, involuntary service to society; hours<lb/>
working in the chemistry laboratory; hours examining and copying<lb/>
Scharf's anatomical plates, until he had fixed in his mind forever<lb/>
the position of every muscle and organ, the course of every vein<lb/>
and artery; more hours at home, and these regularly carried him<lb/>
into early morning, studying his text books and preparing<lb/>
for the frequent quizzes. When he had time, he thought, too,<lb/>
about the future.</p>
<p>He would work far into the morning for s<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>veral weeks at<lb/>
a stretch; then, yielding to Pa's forceful protests and his step-<lb/>
mother's pleas, he would slack off a little. But it made him an-<lb/>
xious to feel that he was working less hard than he might. He<lb/>
had too much to do to waste time resting, he thought, and soon he<lb/>
would <del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>be</unclear></del> find himself, almost involuntarily, back on his old sched-<lb/>
ule. He was young and healthy and strong, so the grind, as he in-<lb/>
sisted, did him no harm. Above all, he was single-minded; and<lb/>
that, more than anything else, enabled him to drive steadily ahead,<lb/>
70.<lb/>
<pb n="71" id="f06114071"/>
working night and day as though his life depended on it, and ig-<lb/>
noring fatigue when he could no longer deny it.</p>
<p>Chris and he had definitely decided to go to New York,<lb/>
Chris to practice law and Walter to work at Bellevue Hospital<lb/>
Medical College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you're going to be a lawyer,&rdquo; Chris theorized one<lb/>
night when they were studying together after the rest of the house-<lb/>
hold had gone to bed, &ldquo;you might just as well be one in a place<lb/>
where you won't ever run out of clients. Even if there are a lot<lb/>
of lawyers in New York, I reckon there still are enough disputes<lb/>
to go round among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's as good a place as there is in the country for a<lb/>
young doctor to train, too,&rdquo; Walter observed, &ldquo;and it certainly has<lb/>
some of the finest hospitals. I'm glad you're going, too. Won't<lb/>
we have fun exploring the city together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think! A million people all at once! Remember<lb/>
how Joey Rogers wouldn't believe us when we told him? It's almost<lb/>
impossible to imagine, isn't it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlottesville, times two hundred,&rdquo; Walter suggested.<lb/>
&ldquo;Just suppose that, for every person you see here, you were seeing<lb/>
two hundred. Does that help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<del hand="unknown_hand">&ldquo;</del> Help!&rdquo; Chris groaned. &ldquo;How does it make you feel to<lb/>
imagine four hundred people working at this desk right now? It<lb/>
makes me feel so terrible,&rdquo; he closed his book with a grin, &ldquo;that<lb/>
I'm going to bed. You'd better come, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon,&rdquo; Walter promised him. &ldquo;Mind you don't<lb/>
wake Pa, the way you did last night. It wasn't twelve yet, and<lb/>
he made me go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>71.</p>
<pb n="72" id="f06114072"/>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty soon&rdquo; was two hours later, but when he finally fol-<lb/>
lowed Chris to bed, Walter felt that he could face Dr. Cabell's<lb/>
test the next day with confidence.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Belching threateningly, the steam engine gathered its en-<lb/>
ergies for the start. Its bell tolled loudly. Smoke, shot through<lb/>
with sparks, puffed faster from its flaring stack. The high, heavy<lb/>
wheels, which the engineer had tapped while the train waited, began<lb/>
to turn. Slowly the old one story brick station moved backward,<lb/>
taking with it the platform along which stood a line of ancient<lb/>
hacks and Negro drivers equally aged. Mrs. Reed waved her damp<lb/>
handkerchief again as she <del hand="unknown_hand">red</del> receded. Pa, remaining stationary<lb/>
amid the sliding scene by walking as fast as his long legs could<lb/>
take him, shouted some final word lost in the clamor, and dropped<lb/>
back waving his hat.</p>
<p>The train went faster. The scenery began to flow. Chris,<lb/>
who had been staring out the window for a last look at famil-<lb/>
iar things, sat back in his seat and regarded his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dr. Reed,&rdquo; he said almost with awe, &ldquo;we're on our<lb/>
own now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the train pounded over the long bridge across the Ri-<lb/>
vanna River, both young men gazed out the window for a final sight<lb/>
of Monticello, which, its decay softened by distance, watched the<lb/>
valley from the crown of its flat topped hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Reed!&rdquo; Walter repeated. &ldquo;I can still hardly believe<lb/>
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commencement, preceded by the festivities of the various<lb/>
fraternities and clubs, the parade through the arcades with Chin-<lb/>
72.<lb/>
<pb n="73" id="f06114073"/>
ese lanterns, the open house receptions of convivial pr<del hand="unknown_hand">e</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">o</add>fessors, the<lb/>
sermons and the speeches, was past. On the first of July, 1869,<lb/>
Dr. Maupin, true to his wor<del hand="unknown_hand">k</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">d</add>, had given Walter his medical degree.<lb/>
He was, the chairman told him, the youngest man ever to earn one<lb/>
from the University of Virginia. Walter was less impressed by the<lb/>
luster of that distinction than by the responsibility it laid on him.</p>
<p>Through cuts, up and down inclines, the little engine<lb/>
roared and strained along the road over the rugged, hilly<lb/>
country to Gordonsville. It paused, blowing hard, at the tiny<lb/>
town with the big whitewashed hotel, <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">handful</add> of stores and small white<lb/>
houses, and let Chris and Walter, with the other Washington-bound<lb/>
passengers, change to the Orange and Alexandria line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walter, aren't you excited?&rdquo; Chris demanded, after they<lb/>
had disposed their baggage and lunch boxes about them for the sec-<lb/>
ond time. &ldquo;I feel as though I could hardly breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter turned shining eyes on his brother. &ldquo;You know,&rdquo;<lb/>
he said, &ldquo;I feel as if we were just about to step into the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are about to step into the future,&rdquo; Chris agreed<lb/>
soberly. &ldquo;And to step out of the past, too,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;All<lb/>
this....&rdquo; he waved his hand, glancing out the window at the liquid<lb/>
landscape streaming past. The train was passing out of the gradu-<lb/>
ally subsiding hills, covered with pine and oak and infrequently<lb/>
broken by scrubby farms in cleared patches, into the rolling farm-<lb/>
lands beyond. An occasional levelled farmhouse among blackened<lb/>
trees, a trench and breastworks on a bit of rising ground, a plow<lb/>
abandoned in an uncultivated field, were all embraced in the past<lb/>
that Chris's gesture implied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's still very much the present for most souther-<lb/>
73.<lb/>
<pb n="74" id="f06114074"/>
ners,&rdquo; Walter said sadly. In the peaceful countryside, so lately<lb/>
ravaged and bloodstained, and in the towns poverty stricken<lb/>
by defeat, partisan feeling was as bitter as ever, and the war was<lb/>
still the one absorbing topic among people burningly resentful<lb/>
under the savage reprisals of the Reconstruction.</p>
<p>As the train rocked and jolted over the irregular and<lb/>
neglected roadbed through the wide battle field of northern Vir-<lb/>
ginia, the two young men saw everywhere reminders of the war. In<lb/>
the country, neglected farms and buildings falling into disrepair<lb/>
testified that the slaves, who had carried the South's whole ag-<lb/>
rarian system on their broad shoulders, were now <del hand="unknown_hand">freeman</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">free men</add>, most of<lb/>
whom would bear no burden for a long time but their own tragic be-<lb/>
wilderment. Skinny steers hitched to rickety carts indicated that<lb/>
the ruined farmers still had neither the draft animals to plant<lb/>
and reap crops, nor adequate crops to feed to or trade for draft<lb/>
animals. In the towns, worn uniform jackets and trousers, the<lb/>
newest and most substantial clothing their impoverished wearers <del hand="unknown_hand">co</del><lb/>
could muster even now, were liberally sprinkled through the groups<lb/>
waiting on station platforms to see the Washington train go by.<lb/>
Neatly kept military cemeteries, with row after row of small white<lb/>
markers watching over the last sleep of the Confederate<lb/>
dead, were to be seen at almost every stop.</p>
<p>Not the least cogent reminder of the war's destruction<lb/>
was the railroad itself, its roadbed even now in its war-time<lb/>
condition. The light rails, repeatedly torn up and replaced, ac-<lb/>
cording to the strategic necessities of retreating and advancing<lb/>
armies, were loose and irregular. It was not unusual for a &ldquo;snake's<lb/>
head,&rdquo; a rail with one loosened end reared into the air, to strike<lb/>
the wheel of an oncoming car above its middle and drive through<lb/>
74.<lb/>
<pb n="75" id="f06114075"/>
the wooden floor, to wreak gruesome o<del hand="unknown_hand">f</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">r</add> little damage, purely<lb/>
as chance dictated. Rickety bridges sometimes collapsed, or cars<lb/>
screeching around a curve left the track and plowed up the sagging<lb/>
roadbed, splintering ties and ripping the weak rails. Occasionally,<lb/>
an exhausted engine would explode, or the train would be delayed<lb/>
by running into cattle wandering in fatal innocence along the un-<lb/>
guarded right-of-way and nibbling the grass that grew unhindered<lb/>
between the rails. The railroads<unclear>'</unclear> disrepair all over the former<lb/>
Confederacy was dangerous, but the economy of the South,<lb/>
shattered by the war and saddled with the ironic burden of paying<lb/>
for its own defeat, was unequal to rebuilding them.</p>
<p>At Culpeper, from which Grant had launched his costly<lb/>
Wilderness campaign, Negroes balancing trays on their heads passed<lb/>
up and down the platform under the car windows, selling<lb/>
fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, sandwiches, cakes and apples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Albemarle Pippins!&rdquo; Walter exclaimed enthusiastically,<lb/>
&ldquo;Chris, we must have some! This will be our last chance to have<lb/>
a home grown apple for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning out the window to attract the attention of the<lb/>
vendor, the young doctor and the young lawyer could see the well-<lb/>
groomed burial ground of the Union dead, a reminder of Grant's<lb/>
operations in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Walter wiped his apple thoughtfully and took a bite be-<lb/>
fore he spoke. &ldquo;I wonder how it's going to be up there, Chris.<lb/>
Is the war still as hot an issue as it is in the South?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. Nobody can forget it here, where it still<lb/>
shows so much -the cemeteries, and the cripples, and the uniforms,<lb/>
and the poverty, and all the Reconstruction. Up there, they're<lb/>
75.<lb/>
<pb n="76" id="f06114076"/>
probably already forgetting; they have less to remind them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you and I have put it pretty well behind us,<lb/>
but we're a little unusual. We were young when it ended, and<lb/>
we've been too busy getting our professional training to think much<lb/>
about it since. And Jim and Tom, who actually fought, are such<lb/>
kindly fellows that they've let it go past, too. But most souther-<lb/>
ners remember bitterly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The losers always remember longer than the winners. Victors<lb/>
are always glad to forget,&rdquo; Chris pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the country's at peace again, and we're a new genera-<lb/>
tion,&rdquo; Walter said. &ldquo;We didn't make the war, and we didn't fight<lb/>
it -although we did want to be drummers, remember?&rdquo; He smiled.<lb/>
&ldquo;It seems to me that the best thing we can do is try to<lb/>
forget our grievances, and look to the future instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cinders were flying through the open window. Chris blew<lb/>
some off his apple before taking another bite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;It's the hard thing to do, but<lb/>
it's the right one. And in a country the size of this one, there<lb/>
is room <del hand="unknown_hand">for</del> and work for everyone. You know, that reminds me -<lb/>
I rather like your idea of going west some time. With the rail-<lb/>
road clear across the continent now, it isn't a bad trip at all<lb/>
any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter laugh<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del>ed. &ldquo;What a restless fellow you are, Chris!<lb/>
We haven't even reached New York yet, and you're already talking<lb/>
about going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're the one who's restless,&rdquo; Chris reminded him.<lb/>
&ldquo;You've been talking about going west ever since you were big<lb/>
enough to read your geography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one thing at a time,&rdquo; Walter decided. He tossed<lb/>
76.<lb/>
<pb n="77" id="f06114077"/>
his apple core out the window and watched it roll down the cindered<lb/>
embankment. &ldquo;We're on the brink of a new world. We both have<lb/>
work to do in it, and there's no telling where it may take us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Falling silent, he gazed, his clear blue eyes fixed in<lb/>
his characteristically intent expression, at the speeding land-<lb/>
scape as it poured by, giving the illusion of pivoting on a point<lb/>
somewhere beyond the horizon.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="7" id="d12"><pb n="78" id="f06114078"/>
<head>CHAPTER VII</head>

<p>Dr. Reed, with cold politeness, finished questioning<lb/>
his well dressed visitor, whose heavy gold watch chain, spanning<lb/>
his comfortably curved front, loudly proclaimed the successful<lb/>
professional man. The tall hat was tilted back on the<lb/>
fringed dome, and the off-hand manner pointedly condescended to<lb/>
the youthful Health Inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del> lucid description of the symptoms, sir,&rdquo;<lb/>
Reed summed up, carefully keeping sarcasm out of his voice, &ldquo;I<lb/>
78.<lb/>
<pb n="79" id="f06114079"/>
should conclude that the unfortunate child was a victim of<lb/>
lymphadenoma.&rdquo; And of a conscienceless quack, he added bitterly<lb/>
to himself.</p>
<p>The older man assumed a judicious air. &ldquo;Hmmmm, possibly,&rdquo;<lb/>
he conceded, stroking his full beard thoughtfully. &ldquo;A rare case,<lb/>
of course. Don't recall seeing one quite like it in my exper-<lb/>
ience -wide experience,&rdquo; he stressed the last phrase suggestively.<lb/>
&ldquo;The symptoms do suggest it, however.&rdquo; He shrugged. &ldquo;You might<lb/>
as well enter the cause of death as lymphadoma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The miscalled medical name jarred on Reed only a little<lb/>
less than the tone of dismissal, a tone that implied that there<lb/>
were, still, a great many children in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very bright of you to think of it, I'm sure,&rdquo; the stout<lb/>
doctor added patronizingly, drawing on his yellow kid gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Reed answered drily. He showed his visitor<lb/>
to the door of the office, but did not offer to shake hands. Out-<lb/>
side he caught sight of the doctor's carriage, with a pair of hand-<lb/>
some bays, waiting in the street. <del hand="unknown_hand">and</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">He</add> watched while the coachman<lb/>
held the door and the doctor's portly person disappeared within.</p>
<p>Reed's mouth was set sternly as he seated himself at his<lb/>
desk and jotted down a report on the case. The doctor who had<lb/>
come to notify him, as one of the Brooklyn Health Inspectors, of<lb/>
the death was a locally prominent practitioner. Yet he was so<lb/>
grossly ignorant that he was unable to use medical terminology<lb/>
correctly, or even to state symptoms accurately. Lymphadenoma was<lb/>
not a rare disease, but he had failed to recognize a well marked<lb/>
case. In the days <del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>when</unclear></del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">before</add> medical education was strictly regulated<lb/>
79.<lb/>
<pb n="80" id="f06114080"/>
such men were, unfortunately, not unusual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor little girl!&rdquo; Reed muttered aloud. He finished<lb/>
writing and read over his report. &ldquo;The poor little thing!&rdquo; he<lb/>
repeated resentfully.</p>
<p>Death was very familiar to the young doctor now. He had<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">encountered</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">met</add> it countless times -the corpses brought to the nar-<lb/>
row white room of the Bellevue dead-house, the quiet, sheet-cov-<lb/>
ered forms on the hospital beds, the pitiful figures dead of filth<lb/>
and neglect and sometimes violence in the swarming tenement houses-<lb/>
but he could never see it with indifference. Sensitive and imag-<lb/>
inative, he always felt the pathos of each individual. It was never<lb/>
a &ldquo;case&rdquo; that he treated; it was always a person.</p>
<p>Reed's zeal for his profession was keen; his enthusiasm<lb/>
for the immense city, however, he realized, had changed in the four<lb/>
years he had spent in it. During his first year, when his princi-<lb/>
pal work had been to attend lectures at the Bellevue Hospital Med-<lb/>
ican College and at Charity Hospital on Blackwell's Island and to <del hand="unknown_hand">g</del><lb/>
go to clinics and autopsies, he had found time to be delighted with<lb/>
New York's endless variety.</p>
<p>He had occasionally gone to the theatres -to the stock<lb/>
company on fashionable Madison Square, or to the Italian opera at<lb/>
the Academy of Music -and dropped in afterwards at the gay Fifth<lb/>
Avenue Hotel, where <del hand="unknown_hand">sy</del> stylish young men, gloved in the inevitable<lb/>
yellow kid, eyed the pretty girls and twirled their glossy mus-<lb/>
taches. On hot summer evenings he had listened to the concerts<lb/>
in Central Park, and <del hand="unknown_hand">afterwards</del> admired the brisk carriage horses,<lb/>
handled by livried coachmen, as they whirled along the winding<lb/>
drives.</p>
<p>80.</p>
<pb n="81" id="f06114081"/>
<p>The big new buildings, <del hand="unknown_hand">too</del> springing out of the earth everywhere,<lb/>
had interested him, too. The Grand Central Station which, won-<lb/>
derfully, had two acres of glass in its roof, was almost finished<lb/>
then, and the splendid St. Patrick's Cathedral, begun a dozen<lb/>
years before, was slowly toiling upward. He had been fascinated<lb/>
by the waterfront, through which flowed some sixty percent<lb/>
of the country's foreign trade, with its ocean-going steamers, and<lb/>
tugs and ferries and sailing craft; and by the ambitions beginnings<lb/>
of the new Brooklyn Bridge, to be the longest suspension bridge in<lb/>
the world and the first to link Brooklyn to New York across the<lb/>
swift current of the East River.</p>
<p>In Mott Street he had seen his first Chinese, some of<lb/>
the bland and industrious hundreds who crowded in the rotting ten-<lb/>
ements of Chinatown. On almost any street corner he could <del hand="unknown_hand">encount</del><lb/>
encounter Italians, Germans, Irish or French, and hear them speak-<lb/>
ing their own tongue. In his walks uptown he used sometimes to<lb/>
come upon old farm houses, many of them relics of the colonial<lb/>
past, tucked here and there about the city and hemmed in by factor-<lb/>
ies and slaughter houses.</p>
<p>The contrasts and the bustle, the feeling of drive<lb/>
and power in the big city, the sense of the new boisterously dis-<lb/>
placing the old and of life expanding at breakneck speed into<lb/>
vistas of boundless hope and wonder, had intoxicated the young<lb/>
man from the country. Home had been nothing like this.</p>
<p>Gradually, however, his viewpoint had changed, ad-<lb/>
justing and sobering. Interrupting his course at Bellevue at<lb/>
the end of the 1870-1871 term to work in various of the city's<lb/>
hospitals, he had come into close contact for the first time with<lb/>
81.<lb/>
<pb n="82" id="f06114082"/>
the misery of the submerged half of the city's population. Then he<lb/>
had taken his medical degree in 1872, and from that time on his<lb/>
services had been, for the most part, devoted to the very poor who<lb/>
lived in the squatters' colonies in Central Park, out of sight of<lb/>
the gay drives and the rich Avenue, and in the tenements that hud-<lb/>
dled in side streets toward the rivers and downtown in the older<lb/>
parts of the city. In tottering buildings, without sanitary fac-<lb/>
ilities, ventilation or privacy, half a million people, half the<lb/>
population of the richest and largest city in the country, lived<lb/>
neglected in a squalor that Reed would have found unimaginable a<lb/>
few years earlier, and which he could now believe only because he<lb/>
actually saw it.</p>
<p>It was a period of unrestricted immigration. The poor<lb/>
of all countries were swarming hopefully to the United States to<lb/>
work in the coal mines and oil fields and factories, and to take<lb/>
up claims on the free lands of the west. Steamship companies,<lb/>
cutting their rates to attract trade, crowded the immigrants like<lb/>
cattle into hold and steerage, where epidemics inevitably took<lb/>
root among them. Pouring into New York, they spread their dis-<lb/>
eases through the miserable tenements and the poverty-ridden<lb/>
neighborhoods. Immigrants and native poor had an appalling rate<lb/>
of sickness and death. Even those not actively sick with something<lb/>
worse suffered from &ldquo;the tenant-house rot,&rdquo; grim blanket term for<lb/>
rickets, scurvy, outright starvation and a dozen other ills.</p>
<p>When Reed had begun his hospital work in New York, the<lb/>
situation had been slowly improving. Sanitary legislation had<lb/>
been passed and the Metropolitan Board of Health established in<lb/>
1866, after years of agitation by medical men and public minded cit-<lb/>
82.<lb/>
<pb n="83" id="f06114083"/>
izens. The Board, set up by the state legislature and thus free<lb/>
from the grasp of the Tweed Ring, a gang of criminal polititians<lb/>
who were just then ruling and robbing New York City with brazen<lb/>
greed, had sweeping powers not only over the city proper but over<lb/>
Brooklyn and widely outlying districts.</p>
<p>The Board worked through Health Inspectors, most of them<lb/>
young doctors recently out of medical school, who, among their<lb/>
other duties, saw to it that cases of contagious diseases were<lb/>
isolated or removed to the proper hospitals, and that tenement<lb/>
house owners kept their property up the the requirements of the<lb/>
Board of Health.</p>
<p>Reed, while interning at the King's County Hospital, had<lb/>
attracted the notice of Dr. Joseph C. Hutchison, then a leading<lb/>
doctor and surgeon in Brooklyn and a member of the Board of Health.<lb/>
Dr. Hutchison had taken a liking to the pleasant, competent young<lb/>
man, whose skill in surgery and in the treatment of children's<lb/>
diseases was already marked. Perhaps, too, he remembered his own<lb/>
struggles twenty years earlier when, like Reed, he had come from<lb/>
the country to establish a practice in the toughest city in the<lb/>
nation, a city which had received the fledgling doctor from Howard<lb/>
County, Missouri, with the same indifference it was now displaying<lb/>
toward the one from Charlottesville, Virginia. In any case, Dr.<lb/>
Hutchison had expressed his liking by having Reed appointed a<lb/>
Health Inspector.</p>
<p>The modest salary attached to this post was very welcome<lb/>
to the young man <del hand="unknown_hand">just</del> starting out in practice, and the experience<lb/>
that the duties involved was just as welcome. New York's million<lb/>
83.<lb/>
<pb n="84" id="f06114084"/>
population furnished a huge and interesting variety of medical<lb/>
and surgical cases which came to the hospitals where Reed, both<lb/>
as student and practitioner, had the opportunity to see them.<lb/>
Cholera, diphtheria, typhoid and erysipelas were among the dis-<lb/>
eases which, we may assume from his later work, particularly in-<lb/>
terested him at this time.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, as early as 1871, the eruption of the<lb/>
scandals about the Tweed Ring suggested to the boy from the coun-<lb/>
try that there was something rotten <del hand="unknown_hand">about</del> in the glamorous <del hand="unknown_hand">city</del><lb/>
metropolis. Later, increasing familiarity with the submerged and<lb/>
shameful side of the city, which noisily drew attention to its<lb/>
rich men, its churches, schools, banks and the size of its charity<lb/>
budget, had disenchanted him completely. Now this episode of the<lb/>
arrogant, ignorant doctor, prospering on the miseries of <del hand="unknown_hand">the</del> people<lb/>
whom he did nothing to relieve, seemed the last straw.</p>
<p>He told Chris who, now launched on a successful legal<lb/>
career, lived with him and shared many of his experiences.</p>
<p>Noticing his dejected air when he came in after his of-<lb/>
fice hours, Chris asked, &ldquo;What's the matter, Walter? Did you<lb/>
have a hard day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not particularly.&rdquo; Walter walked to the window of<lb/>
their room and stood looking out over the busy harbor and at the<lb/>
low jumble of the Manhattan sky line beyond it. He noticed an<lb/>
ocean <del hand="unknown_hand">lin</del> steamer being warped to the pier, a steamer which, he<lb/>
supposed from his experience, would debark not only its passen-<lb/>
gers but a cargo of disease as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not particularly,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;but I am so disgusted<lb/>
that I should almost like to give up my profession!&rdquo;</p>
<p>84.</p>
<pb n="85" id="f06114085"/>
<p>&ldquo;Walter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. Don't look so alarmed, Chris. Not really.<lb/>
You know nothing would induce me to. But I do think I shall leave<lb/>
New York. Do you know what happened to me today? I'll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of the doctor's patronizing air, he could smile.<lb/>
But he did not smile when he told of his ignorance and callousness.<lb/>
Those, he declared, could work tragedy, and heaven knew how many<lb/>
times they already had. &ldquo;And yet that man, a first rate quack,<lb/>
ha<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add> the leading practice in that part of Brooklyn. It makes one<lb/>
ashamed of the profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how <hi rend="italic">can</hi> such a man become eminent, if he has no<lb/>
qualifications?&rdquo; Chris wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he ha<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add> &lsquo;qualifications&rsquo; all right, but they're not<lb/>
medical ones. He's independently wealthy, for one thing<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del>, and<lb/>
puts up a good front. He married a society woman, too. And he<lb/>
has all sorts of political connections. It all adds up to a big<lb/>
practice. It's very hard for a young man to have to compete with<lb/>
pull and front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is discouraging,&rdquo; Chris assented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my age, too,&rdquo; Walter went on, listing his diffi-<lb/>
culties. &ldquo;It's funny but true that a doctor's success for<lb/>
the first decade depends more on his beard than his brains. I<lb/>
entered my profession three or four years earlier than most men<lb/>
do, and I look young. There's a tendency not to take a young man<lb/>
as seriously, or have a<del hand="unknown_hand">n</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add> much confidence in him, as an older man.<lb/>
On top of that, this work as Health Inspector is keeping me so busy<lb/>
that I haven't time to build up a private practice. I'm thinking<lb/>
more and more seriously of leaving New York, and going to some small-<lb/>
er city, where the odds aren't so heavy and where I can get a faster<lb/>
85.<lb/>
<pb n="86" id="f06114086"/>
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chris had been listening with a smile. Now he inquired,<lb/>
&ldquo;Haven't you rather -ah, glided -over another motive for<del hand="unknown_hand">e</del> leav-<lb/>
ing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Walter's expression he broke into a <del hand="unknown_hand">luagh</del> laugh. Walter<lb/>
joined in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he answered a little sheepishly, &ldquo;What better motive<lb/>
could I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; Chris agreed unhesitatingly. &ldquo;You've been almost<lb/>
bubbling o<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>ver since you visited Pa in Murfreesboro in June,&rdquo; he<lb/>
teased. &ldquo;And you should see your face when you find a letter waiting<lb/>
for you. A blind man could tell what's the matter with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may call it something the &lsquo;matter&rsquo; with me,&rdquo; Walter said<lb/>
cheerfully, &ldquo;but I like it. But I haven't asked her yet -I don't<lb/>
see how I can until I have an assured income. That's another rea-<lb/>
son I'm so anxious to get established in a hurry. I've been thinking<lb/>
about entering the Army -that's a modest, steady salary, and I'd<lb/>
like nothing better for a few years than moving about and seeing<lb/>
the country. Torney's been talking it up to me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George Torney? The fellow you were in the University with?<lb/>
I thought he was a Navy doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's changing,&rdquo; Walter grinned. &ldquo;Dry land may not be as<lb/>
exciting, but at least it doesn't roll. He suffers from invincible<lb/>
seasickness. Every time he sets foot on a boat he's the sickest<lb/>
man aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; Chris laughed. &ldquo;It does seem rather a good<lb/>
idea for you, Walter, and an answer to your problem. Who would<lb/>
ever have thought, though, ten years ago, that one of us would want<lb/>
86.<lb/>
<pb n="87" id="f06114087"/>
to wear the Army blue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one, I guess. It would have been scandalously disloyal<lb/>
even to dream of such a thing. However, I haven't decided yet. I<lb/>
want to ask Pa's advice. Let's go out to dinner now. I have a<lb/>
lot of calls to make this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In mid-July he confided his plan to the girl whom he had<lb/>
met on his visit to his father. In his clear, even writing he<lb/>
wrote to Emilie Lawrence,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been recently contemplating a departure from Brook-<lb/>
lyn.... I have about made up my mind to make a strenuous effort to<lb/>
enter the Medical Corps of the United States Army.&rdquo; He went on to<lb/>
explain his reasons, the same ones he had mentioned to Chris, and<lb/>
added that he would want to remain in the Army for just a few years.<lb/>
&ldquo;If at the end of that time (3 or 4 years hence) I could find some<lb/>
fair damsel who was foolish enough to trust me,&rdquo; <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">he suggested hopefully,</add> &ldquo;I think I would<lb/>
get -married, and settle down to sober work for the rest of my days<lb/>
in some small city where one could enjoy the advantages of a city<lb/>
and at the same time not feel as if lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The onset of love had been sudden and hard. He had known<lb/>
the girl to whom he was writing just a month. She, for her part,<lb/>
was already taken with the decisive young man who had fallen so im-<lb/>
petuously in love with her.</p>
<p>The Ex<del hand="unknown_hand">man</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">amin</add>ing Board of the Army Medical Corps, which exam-<lb/>
ined applicants for the service, met in New York on August 4th,<lb/>
1874. Reed, taking a few hours off from his duties, went over to<lb/>
see its Recorder, and was dismayed to learn that candidates were<lb/>
87.<lb/>
<pb n="88" id="f06114088"/>
examined not only in medical subjects, but in Latin, Greek, mathe-<lb/>
matics and history. &ldquo;Horror of Horro<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">r</add>s!&rdquo; he lamented to Miss Law-<lb/>
rence when he wrote her a week later. &ldquo;Imagine me conjugating an<lb/>
irregular verb, or telling what x + y equals, or what year Rome was<lb/>
founded, or the battle of Marathon fought. Why, the thing is im-<lb/>
possible, I shall utterly fail. Add to this that each applicant is<lb/>
examined five hours each day for six successive days -thirty hours'<lb/>
questioning -and, to cap the climax, there are more than 500 appli-<lb/>
cants for less than 30 vacancies? The very thought of it makes me<lb/>
dizzy. Think of my condition and pity me, for I need all the sym-<lb/>
pathy of all my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dizzy or not, Reed must have had <del hand="unknown_hand">g</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">h</add>igher hopes of success<lb/>
than he betrayed. Having a naturally cheerful disposition, he <del hand="unknown_hand">alw</del><lb/>
always approached undertakings with an optimism that gave him a<lb/>
good running start. He surrounded himself with text books and set<lb/>
to work with the same industry that had carried him through the Uni-<lb/>
versity medical school in a year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he worked so hard that he made himself sick<lb/>
in a fortnight. It had been years since he had had any sort of ill-<lb/>
ness, but now he was prostrated for three weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember the time when I could safely study as much as<lb/>
20 hours uninterruptedly day after day, and not experience any bad<lb/>
effect from it, but I presume that time shall return no more.&rdquo; Thus<lb/>
he mourned his lost youth to the young lady who would, he hoped,<lb/>
share his rapidly advancing years.</p>
<p>The approach of the examination and the difficulty of re-<lb/>
freshing his knowledge of so many forgotten things threw him<lb/>
into a panic. He worked desperately, late into each night. When<lb/>
88.<lb/>
<pb n="89" id="f06114089"/>
he was exhausted he would lay aside the book and try to rest. But,<lb/>
as he wrote his sympathetic confidante, &ldquo;the thought flashes<lb/>
through my mind that there are a thousand things in that cast-aside<lb/>
volume of which I am ignorant, a thousand unanswerable questions<lb/>
that may rise up against me in the day of my examination, to humble<lb/>
and mortify me. Wracked with a thousand fears, I tear open the book<lb/>
and eagerly scan its pages, determined to exhaust every effort, and,<lb/>
if need be, to suffer death rather than defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mental strain that fathered this somewhat extravagant<lb/>
resolution subsided as the rest enforced by illness began to take<lb/>
effect. The examination, too, was defer<del hand="unknown_hand">e</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">r</add>ed, and Reed, deeply re-<lb/>
lieved, determined to treat himself with more discretion now that<lb/>
he had until the middle of January to prepare for it.</p>
<p>His good intentions to the contrary, he made himself ill<lb/>
again by the beginning of November. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he mourned to his an-<lb/>
xious correspondent, &ldquo;I am so harrassed.&rdquo; Calling finally on the<lb/>
discipline instilled in his youth and developed over the interven-<lb/>
ing years, he made a strong eff<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">o</add>rt to face his problem reasonably.<lb/>
With the unpretentious determination characteristic of him, he wrote<lb/>
Emilie Lawrence, &ldquo;S<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">t</add>ill I believe that when a person determines to<lb/>
accomplish an end, that he should put forth all honest effort, nor<lb/>
turn aside, unless for the best of reasons; and if he meets with<lb/>
defeat let him accept it like a man, remembering that many better<lb/>
men have found themselves in a like situation. At all events I<lb/>
shall <del hand="unknown_hand">pr</del> pursue my course until every prop is knocked away from un-<lb/>
der me. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By January improved health and increased calmness had<lb/>
cheered him to the point where he could write hopefully of the im-<lb/>
pending examination. It was postponed again, this time for a month.</p>
<p>89.</p>
<pb n="90" id="f06114090"/>
<p>Finally, one February day, Reed entered the shabby building<lb/>
in downtown New York where the Examining Board met to face the week-<lb/>
long inquisition. At its close, he jubilantly wrote Miss Lawrence<lb/>
that he had passed with conspicuous success.</p>
<p>She was as elated as he. But his letter was not satisfactory,<lb/>
she complained. He must come down and tell her in person. The<lb/>
happy young man hurried south with the details of his good news.<lb/>
Bemused with joy, he lost his bag in Norfolk and arrived in Murfrees-<lb/>
boro, barely disconcerted, to greet his beloved in travel-stained<lb/>
linen. Her brother equipped him with fresh clothes, and, restored<lb/>
to his customary cleanliness, he pr<del hand="unknown_hand">e</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">o</add>ceeded to deal with the matter<lb/>
most pressingly on his mind. Miss Lawrence saw eye to eye with him<lb/>
on it. Family blessings were obtained, and their engagement promptly<lb/>
followed.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
<p>On June 26th, 1875, Walter Reed was appointed<lb/>
Assistant Surgeon in the Medical Corps of the United States<lb/>
Army with the rank of first lieutenant. His oath of office<lb/>
reached him <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">a few days later</add> in Harrisonburg, Virginia, where he was visiting<lb/>
his father, who was still moving about the state on behalf of<lb/>
his church as briskly as in his younger days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, Walter Reed,&rdquo; the oath read, &ldquo;having been ap-<lb/>
91.<lb/>
<pb n="92" id="f06114092"/>
pointed an Assistant Surgeon in the Military Service of the United<lb/>
States, do solemnly swear that I have never voluntarily borne arms<lb/>
against the United States since I have become a citizen thereof;<lb/>
that I have voluntarily given no aid, countenance, counsel<lb/>
or encouragement to persons engaged in armed hostility thereto;<lb/>
that I have neither sought nor accepted nor attempted to exercise<lb/>
the functions of any office whatever, under any authority or pre-<lb/>
tended authority, in hostility to the United States; that I have not<lb/>
yielded a voluntary support to any pretended government, authority,<lb/>
power or constitution within the United States hostile or inimical<lb/>
thereto. And I do further swear that, to the best of my knowledge<lb/>
and ability, I will support and defend the Constitution of the<lb/>
United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I<lb/>
will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this<lb/>
obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of<lb/>
evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties<lb/>
of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walter Reed, a rebel, although an inactive one, a dozen<lb/>
years before against the authority of the United States, unhesi-<lb/>
tatingly signed the oath with his clear, bold signature. He had no<lb/>
doubts about the wisdom of his choice. Then he went to Murfrees-<lb/>
boro to visit the Lawrences and wait for his orders.</p>
<p>On July 23rd he was ordered to the Army post at Willets<lb/>
Point, Long Island. Between the novelty of his new life and hap-<lb/>
py musing over the future, he forgot his birthday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, could you believe that I would allow my<lb/>
twenty-fifth birthday to pass without so much as thinking of it<lb/>
during the whole day,&rdquo; he inquired of his fiancee. &ldquo;The very day<lb/>
92.<lb/>
<pb n="93" id="f06114093"/>
on which I wrote you last I was twenty-four years old (just think<lb/>
of it), and yet I was totally ignorant of it. Of course, I felt<lb/>
the weight of years more than usual on that day, but I could not<lb/>
account for it. Suddenly on Tuesday the 14, it occurred to me that<lb/>
I was one year older and immediately the cause of my fatigue<lb/>
flashed across my mind.&rdquo; Becoming serious, he asked himself what<lb/>
he had to show for his years. &ldquo;What good deeds have I done that<lb/>
merit approbation! How negligent and wayward have I been! What<lb/>
golden moments of opportunity have come and gone, all unheeded!<lb/>
As I look back over my past life to-night, but few thoughts occur<lb/>
to me such as cause my bosom to swell with honest pride.&rdquo; Thus the<lb/>
twenty-four year old doctor, who had entered his medical career at<lb/>
an age <unclear><del hand="unknown_hand">then</del></unclear> when most boys were preparing for college and who al-<lb/>
ready had years of practice behind him, upbraided himself for his<lb/>
squandered youth.</p>
<p>To him the serious side of life was always uppermost, but<lb/>
his cheerful and enthusiastic disposition usually prevented him<lb/>
from lapsing into melancholy. His more characteristic attitude was<lb/>
resolution, as appears from a letter to his future wife about this<lb/>
time on the death of her little nephew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, while I prayed that his life might be prolonged<lb/>
to many years of usefulness, he had already departed for a better<lb/>
and a brighter home....little pilgrim of a few days what sad, sad<lb/>
hours you have escaped!...... When I see the little <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">lambs</add> hastening home,<lb/>
I would not call them back, for though I have scarcely begun life,<lb/>
I have known what sorrow is and felt the weight of care. Do not<lb/>
think that I shrink from meeting life's realities. No, no. That<lb/>
93.<lb/>
<pb n="94" id="f06114094"/>
would display a lack of courage and a want of faith. No<del hand="unknown_hand">w</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">r</add> that I<lb/>
would not wish to live many years yet. It may be that God in his<lb/>
all-wise Providence has some wise purpose for me, humble as I am,<lb/>
to fulfil, and shall I,&rdquo; questioned the minister's son, &ldquo;shrink<lb/>
from it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he had certain knowledge of his own future, he could<lb/>
not have written more prophetically.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>That future almost got off to a bad start. Just before<lb/>
his wedding, which was to take place in the spring of 1876, Reed<lb/>
was ordered to Arizona. He was stunned. It was unthinkable to<lb/>
drag a new wife into the unknown and distant west, equally<lb/>
unthinkable to postpone his marriage. His feelings toward Uncle<lb/>
Sam, to whom he usually referred as &ldquo;a good-natured old chap,&rdquo;<lb/>
must have been, for the moment at least, mixed.</p>
<p>The young officer conceived the idea of going to Washington<lb/>
to discuss his orders with the Surgeon General. It was probably<lb/>
not, he supposed, the most correct military procedure in the world,<lb/>
but surely General Barnes, remote and god-like though he was, would<lb/>
understand how pressing his problem was and suggest a solution.<lb/>
The thought of approaching the august personage might be appalling,<lb/>
but it was less appalling tha<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add> the idea of plunging Emilie into the<lb/>
wilds or of leaving her behind indefinitely. So he went to Washington.</p>
<p>Reed, although preoccupied with his mission, was not in-<lb/>
different <del hand="unknown_hand">the</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">to</add> the appearance of the capital city, with which he had<lb/>
already formed a slight acquaintance on several previous trips.<lb/>
Since he had first passed through it half a dozen years before, as<lb/>
94.<lb/>
<pb n="95" id="f06114095"/>
a medical graduate still in his teens, the city had changed vastly.<lb/>
He observed that paved streets and sidewalks had replaced the dusty<lb/>
roads. Street lights had been erected, whose flickering gas glow<lb/>
made the passage along them less hazardous after dark. Sewers had<lb/>
been installed, parks laid out and thousands of trees planted along<lb/>
the avenues, to the mounting outcries from bleeding taxpayers against<lb/>
&ldquo;squandering the public funds&rdquo; to convert the seat of government<lb/>
from a wasteland to a suitable capital.</p>
<p>Congress was again discussing resumption of work on<lb/>
the Washington Monument, whose abandoned base, desolate and shabby,<lb/>
stood on the Mall, less a reminder of the father of his country than<lb/>
of public parsimony and Congressional indifference. Even now, as<lb/>
he approached the Surgeon General's office, Reed could glimpse, far-<lb/>
ther along Pennsylvania Avenue beyond the White House, the partially<lb/>
finished State, War and Navy Building, an extraordinary granite con-<lb/>
fection adorned with a cascade of small columns that made the criti-<lb/>
cal eye reel.</p>
<p>The short trip from the station, however, dislodged his<lb/>
problem from his mind only for a few minutes. With sinking heart<lb/>
he entered the old bank building on Pennsylvania Avenue opposite<lb/>
the Treasury, where General Joseph K. Barnes and his small staff<lb/>
had their modest offices. Smoothing his hair, straightening his<lb/>
uniform jacket and hoping that his appearance would pass muster,<lb/>
Reed asked for the Surgeon General. Barnes, a gruff old gentleman<lb/>
with side-whiskers, who had been head of the Medical Corps since<lb/>
the later years of the Civil War, glanced up from his desk as Reed<lb/>
was announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; the general ordered the lieutenant without<lb/>
95.<lb/>
<pb n="96" id="f06114096"/>
ceremony.</p>
<p>Reed obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; he demanded abruptly, &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed was glad, since his interview was plainly to be with-<lb/>
out social trimmings, that he had a faculty for concise statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know, sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;if I can get leave<lb/>
while I am stationed in the west. I am engaged to be married, and<lb/>
shall want to return for my wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His throat was dry when he finished speaking, and he observed<lb/>
the clouding of his chief's brow with apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, if you don't like your orders, leave the service,&rdquo;<lb/>
the general snapped.</p>
<p>Reed heard him with utter astonishment that instantly gave<lb/>
way to indignation. He had asked a simple question, irregular per-<lb/>
haps but innocent, and he had too keen a sense of his own rights<lb/>
and dignity to lie down under this undeserved rebuff. His nervous-<lb/>
ness replaced by his sense of outrage, he retorted,</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Barnes, I did not labor with all my will for my<lb/>
commission just to toss it away lightly. Neither can I be deprived<lb/>
of it except for unworthy conduct!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older man took another look at his subordinate. He<lb/>
remarked the erect military posture, the unsmiling, almost stub-<lb/>
born mouth, the keen blue eyes that did not waver from his own.<lb/>
Here was a man, it occurred to him, who was the kind of material<lb/>
they needed in the Medical Corps. His officers were too often<lb/>
treated with scant regard by the line officers, and a man who ex-<lb/>
pected and could enforce respect, who could stand up for himself<lb/>
with firmness and courtesy even against a superior, would be a good<lb/>
96.<lb/>
<pb n="97" id="f06114097"/>
thing for the service. A good boy, Barnes thought approvingly.<lb/>
His scowl faded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a cigar, Dr. Reed,&rdquo; he suggested mildly, &ldquo;and let's<lb/>
talk this thing over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Reed left his chief some half-hour later, he was<lb/>
puzzled and thoughtful. It had again been impressed on him that<lb/>
a man always had to make his important decisions for himself. Some<lb/>
officer stationed in the west, the general had said, would &ldquo;probably&rdquo;<lb/>
become insane &ldquo;in a few months.&rdquo; He should postpone his marriage,<lb/>
go to Arizona, and take a chance on being designated to escort this<lb/>
problematical poor fellow to St. Elizabeth's, the Federal asylum at<lb/>
Washington. There would be the opportunity for his wedding, Barnes<lb/>
had pointed out. What a prospect to offer a young man in love!<lb/>
Aside from that, the idea of gambling on the misfortune of a fellow<lb/>
officer repelled him. What a solution for a general to suggest! A<lb/>
first lieutenant should be able to think of something better than<lb/>
that. Reed did.</p>
<p>The next few weeks passed so rapidly, in such a blur of<lb/>
happiness and haste, that it was not until he was on the train,<lb/>
making the long trip from New York to the coast with the recruits<lb/>
that he was escorting to California, that Reed was able to assemble<lb/>
his recollections and sensations. His dominant feeling was a sol-<lb/>
emn and slightly incredulous <del hand="unknown_hand">happinesst</del> happiness: he was a Married<lb/>
Man. Whatever shocks or disappointments the future could contrive<lb/>
for him, he could face them with calmness now, with Emilie to share<lb/>
them and encourage him. He felt steeped in well-being and confidence.</p>
<p>The wedding had been held rather suddenly, on April 25th,<lb/>
97.<lb/>
<pb n="98" id="f06114098"/>
187<del hand="unknown_hand">7</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">6</add>, at Murfreesboro. Then Reed had taken his wife to his father's<lb/>
home at Harrisonburg, in the Shenandoah Valley, <del hand="unknown_hand">for</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">and</add> for several<lb/>
happy, swift weeks they had been together. They had gone for<lb/>
long walks through the countryside, just stirring with spring; and<lb/>
sitting with their backs against a battle-scarred tree they had<lb/>
discussed and planned the future. They had played with <del hand="unknown_hand">t</del>his half-<lb/>
sister Annie, no longer the baby he had left behind when he went<lb/>
to New York, but a big girl nine years old, who was disappointed<lb/>
that she had missed the wedding. Reed had had his picture taken<lb/>
in uniform, arms folded across his chest, a confident, grave-look-<lb/>
ing young man of twenty-five, with straight eyebrows, direct glance<lb/>
and slightly outthrust lower lip.</p>
<p>Then his leave was up, it seemed to them both, almost as<lb/>
soon as it began, and he had to leave Emilie with Pa and his family<lb/>
while he went to the frontier post where she would join him in the<lb/>
fall, when travel was more comfortable and after he had made arrange-<lb/>
ments for her comfort. As he jiggled over the endless miles of<lb/>
track, he sometimes caught himself wondering if it all actually<lb/>
had happened. Nothing seemed outwardly changed; inside, however,<lb/>
he felt a different man, transformed by this new feeling of pride<lb/>
and responsibility and happiness.</p>
<p>The trip from New York to San Francisco took eight days<lb/>
and nights. The recruits were bored, played cards and occasionally<lb/>
quarrelled, but Reed, with his unflagging enthusiasm for new ex-<lb/>
periences, was delighted with every moment of it. The great<lb/>
west had captured his fancy when he was a tow-headed little boy<lb/>
studying his first geog<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">r</add>aphy lessons at Mrs. Booker's school. The<lb/>
idea of seeing it had teased him ever since, becoming more insis-<lb/>

tent as a result of his depression with the city and the persuasions<lb/>
of his friend Torney. Now he was actually penetrating into it,<lb/>
rolling jouncingly along the thin gleaming rails that railroad pio-<lb/>
neers had adventurously, doggedly, and in an atmosphere of resounding<lb/>
financial scandal, stretched all the way to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Beyond Omaha, where the famous Union Pacific began, the<lb/>
train toiled through Nebraska and Wyoming, over whose plains the<lb/>
bison, which a decade earlier had wandered by the millions, now<lb/>
wandered by the thousands, and left their whitening bones as a mem-<lb/>
orial to the white man's wasteful slaughter. The vast expanse of<lb/>
this country astonished the young man used to the domesticated na-<lb/>
ture and the shrunken distances of the settled east. Confined <del hand="unknown_hand">with</del><lb/>
in the cramped railway carriage, covered with soot and sometimes<lb/>
smothered with alkaline dust, he wrote long letters to his wife, tell-<lb/>
ing her that he missed her, and that he was enthusiastic about this<lb/>
wild immensity. He mailed them at the wayside stops where, in those<lb/>
days before dining cars, the passengers debarked to fight with<lb/>
swarms of flies for the greasy, ill-cooked food served at long tables<lb/>
in public <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">dining</add> rooms close to the station.</p>
<p>Arriving tired and dirty and still enthusiastic in San Fran-<lb/>
cisco, whose old frame houses and wooden sidewalks teetered on<lb/>
the steeply pitched hillsides, he took the little coastwise steamer<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Orizaba</hi> to San Diego, and fully appreciated, for the first time,<lb/>
George Torney's preference for dry land. Probably he began to<lb/>
question it, however, on the wearisome overland route across the<lb/>
coastal range to Fort Yuma, where he arrived about the first of June,<lb/>
in time to savor at its height the famous climate with which, accor-<lb/>
ding to garrison tradition, Hell itself compared favorably.</p>
<p>His two months at this hottest of all Army posts, where<lb/>
99.<lb/>
<pb n="100" id="f06114100"/>
the thermometer day after scorching day mounted to a hundred and<lb/>
fifteen degrees in the blistering shade, was not enough to accus-<lb/>
tom him to the routine and monotony of post life. His most vivid<lb/>
recollection of this short tour of duty centered on the infantry<lb/>
captain with whom he shared one of the cramped, bare quarters re-<lb/>
served for the bachelor officers. This officer, whose imposing<lb/>
bulk amounted to some two hundred and fifty pounds, always appeared<lb/>
at dinner in his underwear for maximum relief from the heat, equipped<lb/>
with a fan and a towel to wipe his face. Seated opposite his swel-<lb/>
tering and fully clothed junior, he would politely serve him with<lb/>
a slice or two from the substantial roast of range beef before him,<lb/>
then fanning and mopping heartily he would consume the rest of<lb/>
it to the last scrap, emptying a large pitcher of water between<lb/>
mouthfuls. Reed's amazement at this gastronomic stunt was equalled<lb/>
only by his respect for the digestive apparatus that could absorb<lb/>
such punishment.</p>
<p>He was snatched from admiration of this wonder in early<lb/>
August, 1876, by orders to proceed to Fort Lowell, <del hand="unknown_hand">near Tuscon,</del><lb/>
near Tucson, Arizona.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX</head>

<p>Mrs. Reed, muffled to shapelessness in her waterproof<lb/>
and two Army overcoats, asked, with just the trace of a quaver in<lb/>
her tone, &ldquo;How much farther is it now, do you suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can't be far,&rdquo; her husband answered cheerfully,<lb/>
straining his eyes into the moonless night for the glimmer of light<lb/>
that would <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">mark</add> their over-night stop. She was holding his hand<lb/>
101.<lb/>
<pb n="102" id="f06114102"/>
tightly under the robe, and he gave hers an encouraging squeeze.</p>
<p>The doherty wagon, a primitive ancestor of the station wagon,<lb/>
with seats that could be converted into beds at night and canvas<lb/>
sides that rolled down, lurched and bounced behind its four-mule<lb/>
team, which felt their way at a gingerly walk over the rutted, stony<lb/>
road. The driver, constrained by the presence of a lady, did not<lb/>
swear aloud. Silently, however, with hair-raising oaths, he cursed<lb/>
the mules, the darkness, the frightful road, the missing station, and<lb/>
the day he joined the Army. Having left San Diego, where Reed had<lb/>
gone to meet his wife, at two in the afternoon of November 15th, 1876,<lb/>
the party expected to pass the first night at Jamul (pronounced, Mrs.<lb/>
Reed learned with interest, Ha-mool), a tiny roadside station seven-<lb/>
teen miles inland, but the road had turned out to be so rough that<lb/>
any progress faster than a walk <del hand="unknown_hand">had</del> threatened to shake both the am-<lb/>
bulance (as the doherty wagon was also called) and its occupants<lb/>
apart<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del>. They had passed their baggage wagon, which was making even<lb/>
worse headway, some miles back. The sun had gone down about five;<lb/>
by seven it had become cold and they had begun to worry about missing<lb/>
the station in the dark, and by nine, as they still lumbered hesi-<lb/>
tantly through the almost tangible blackness, even Reed's cheerful-<lb/>
ness had worn a little thin.</p>
<p>Holding his wife's hand and bracing her against the shat-<lb/>
tering jolts of the wagon, he peered intently ahead.</p>
<p>"There! &ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly, relief escaping into<lb/>
his voice. &ldquo;That must be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light shone some distance ahead, a stationary, unblinking<lb/>
light that must come from a house.</p>
<p>102.</p>
<pb n="103" id="f06114103"/>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> so glad<del hand="unknown_hand">!</del> A fire, and something hot to drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor darling, you've had a dreadful time,&rdquo; her husband<lb/>
sympathized. &ldquo;A train collision, a blizzard in Wyoming, and now this<lb/>
awful ride. And all,&rdquo; he added in a whisper, &ldquo;for a worthless fellow<lb/>
who adores you.&rdquo; It was too dark to distinguish expressions, but<lb/>
he knew she was smiling now.</p>
<p>The light gradually drew nearer. Misgivings sprang to<lb/>
Reed's mind -surely it was on the wrong side of the road for the<lb/>
Jamul station! Ordering the driver to stop as close to it as poss-<lb/>
ible, he sent him in to inquire. In a few minutes he was back. It<lb/>
was not the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man hopes the doctor and the lady will stay overnight<lb/>
with him anyway,&rdquo; he reported, addressing Reed in the third person<lb/>
soldiers always used to officers. He added, &ldquo;However, if the<lb/>
doctor doesn't think the station is too far away....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has no hay or grain for the mules, sir, and,&rdquo; he con-<lb/>
tinued, &ldquo;he hasn't a bed, either. He says he and his old lady had<lb/>
a little -&lsquo;family jar&rsquo; he called it -today, and she walked out<lb/>
and took the bed and covers with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed's laugh ended in a sigh. &ldquo;Well, let's get on. He's<lb/>
a very kind gentleman, I'm sure, but we'd better wait for a more<lb/>
favorable time to accept his hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver climbed aboard and shouted at the mules, and the<lb/>
ambulance again bumped off behind its reluctant team. The road got<lb/>
worse. The soldier sitting beside the driver had to get down sev-<lb/>
eral times to see where it was. The driver was now earnestly curs-<lb/>
ing not only the day he joined the Army but the day he was born.<lb/>
103.<lb/>
<pb n="104" id="f06114104"/>
Ten o'clock passed. After an endless length of time, Reed again<lb/>
looked at his watch. Only eleven. Emilie, uncomfortably dozing<lb/>
against his shoulder, opened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; she demanded, as they rounded a bend.</p>
<p>It was a smoldering campfire, its dim glow just enough to<lb/>
outline two wagons and two men wrapped in blankets sleeping beside<lb/>
it. Reed, glad of the chance to stretch his legs, sprang out of<lb/>
the ambulance. He shook one of the sleepers, a brawny, bearded<lb/>
fellow, who sat up abruptly and reached for his rifle in the same<lb/>
movement. Reed hastily stepped back so that the dim firelight<lb/>
fell on his uniform and asked how far they were from the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two miles,&rdquo; the teamster answered, his voice a sleepy<lb/>
rumble, &ldquo;over the worst road in California. Last mile,&rdquo; he informed<lb/>
them gloomily, &ldquo;through a canyon a coyote can't hardly cross in<lb/>
broad daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Sorry I had to disturb you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; the man growled, lying down again and<lb/>
pulling his blankets around him. Reed heard him remark to his com-<lb/>
panion who had awakened and raised up on one elbow, &ldquo;Young Army<lb/>
fellow wants to get to Jamul. He'll never get through that canyon<lb/>
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, won't I?&rdquo; the young Army fellow said to himself grimly.<lb/>
&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; he told the driver. &ldquo;Only two miles more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After another mile the road dipped into the mouth of the<lb/>
canyon and lost itself completely in the jumble of boulders. The<lb/>
tree covered walls rose up steeply on either side, multiplying the<lb/>
darkness. The mules, unable to feel anything but stones under their<lb/>
hooves, balked, while the driver cracked his whip over them in vain.</p>
<p>104.</p>
<pb n="105" id="f06114105"/>
<p>Reed took a lantern, and the soldier a bit of candle,<lb/>
and, getting out of the wagon, they clambered over the rocks to<lb/>
the head of the team. Now stumbling and now sinking to their knees<lb/>
in the soft sand, they kept just ahead of the mules and called di-<lb/>
rections to the driver, who was by this time too preoccupied with<lb/>
trying to get out of this boulder strewn waste without breaking an<lb/>
axle to remember his grudge against Providence. Their slow, jolt-<lb/>
ing progress, halted every few yards by a sizable boulder against<lb/>
a wheel, made them feel that the <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">preceding</add> hours had been<lb/>
passed on a race track. Emilie, clinging to the pitching, strain-<lb/>
ing wagon, could see the flickering light up ahead, and kept calling<lb/>
anxiously, &ldquo;Where are you, Dr. Reed?&rdquo; -she could never get used<lb/>
to calling him anything else -&ldquo;Please come back and let the sol-<lb/>
dier carry the lantern!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After an hour of calling directions, digging, shoving and<lb/>
hoisting, the dreadful canyon was behind them. Ahead, again, was<lb/>
a light. This time it was really the station. It was nothing but<lb/>
a one room shack of plain board, about ten feet square, and a<lb/>
stable, but never before had a human habitation looked so inviting<lb/>
to the young doctor or his wife.</p>
<p>Reed aroused the station keeper, a frontiersman of for-<lb/>
bidding appearance, who came out to the wagon with the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady!&rdquo; he exclaimed, astounded, when he detected Emilie<lb/>
shivering in the body of the ambulance. A few minutes before she<lb/>
had been sure that nothing could ever make her smile again, not<lb/>
at least until she had had something hot to drink and a good night's<lb/>
rest, but his complete astonishment was so comic that a wavering<lb/>
little smile came of itself to her face.</p>
<p>105.</p>
<pb n="106" id="f06114106"/>
<p>&ldquo;You must be right tired, ma'am,&rdquo; he said, as he helped<lb/>
her down, &ldquo;but we'll have you comfortable in no time at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they entered the barren shack, with its dirt floor and<lb/>
tiny window, which was really unnecessary since the wind poured un-<lb/>
hindered through wide cracks between the boards, Emilie wondered<lb/>
how he could ever make her or himself or anyone else comfortable<lb/>
in it. It was furnished with a stool and a broken chair, an un-<lb/>
painted pine table, a cooking stove and a bed which was nothing more<lb/>
than a frame with a piece of canvas stretched over it. She sank<lb/>
stiffly onto the stool.</p>
<p>Their host wasted no time. He started a roaring fire in<lb/>
the stove, and made them some tea which he served in cracked cups<lb/>
without saucers. Then he asserted with awkward gallantry that the<lb/>
lady should have the bed -he would do all right with the mules -<lb/>
and went to the stable for the night.</p>
<p>Dr. and Mrs. Reed agreed that <del hand="unknown_hand">the</del> he was a dear man and<lb/>
toasted him in scalding strong tea, and enthu<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add>iastically ate the<lb/>
lunch they had carried along in the wagon. Both of them forgot<lb/>
that they had been cold and tired and discouraged so short a time<lb/>
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn't have missed this for anything on earth,&rdquo; Em-<lb/>
ilie exclaimed.</p>
<p>Reed laughed. &ldquo;Darling,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I hope you'll always<lb/>
be able to say as much. You're in the Army now, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place, but that's not the man,&rdquo; Reed observed<lb/>
late the next day, as the wagon halted on the barren hillside. The<lb/>
mules, blowing, hung their heads and let their long ears flop. The<lb/>
106.<lb/>
<pb n="107" id="f06114107"/>
fading sunlight glinted coldly off the barrel of the Winchester<lb/>
rifle that leaned against the wall of the hut. The tall man in<lb/>
ragged pants and deerskin jacket slouching against the door<lb/>
straightened and came toward them. He was plainly not Jackson,<lb/>
the station keeper whom Reed had seen on his way to the coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; he drawled amiably to Reed. &ldquo;Howdy, ma'am,&rdquo;<lb/>
to Mrs. Reed, touching his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdy,&rdquo; Reed answered him. &ldquo;Jackson here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the pore fellow's name?&rdquo; the stranger inquired.<lb/>
&ldquo;No, he ain't here. He won't be here no more. He's dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; Reed exclaimed. &ldquo;What happened to him? There<lb/>
didn't seem to be anything the matter when I saw him on my way<lb/>
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn't nothing lingering,&rdquo; the hunter said drily.<lb/>
&ldquo;I found him four-five days ago with a bullet through his head.<lb/>
Coyot<del hand="unknown_hand">o</del>es didn't leave nothing but bones, polished him clean. I<lb/>
buried him up yonder,&rdquo; he jerked him thumb vaguely over his shoul-<lb/>
der. &ldquo;I been camping in his cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed was shocked. &ldquo;Haven't you any idea who killed him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some varmint. Indians, mebbe.&rdquo; He dismissed the spec-<lb/>
ulation with a shrug. Lonely frontiersmen were always getting<lb/>
killed. It was one of the chances they took. &ldquo;You all better<lb/>
stop here. It's 'most sundown, and no place to stop farther on.<lb/>
The lady can have the cabin. It ain't much, but it's shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had little choice but to accept the invitation.</p>
<p>The frontiersman helped the soldiers put up the mules<lb/>
and prepare the dinner. Emilie, suspecting him of having done<lb/>
away with the cabin's previous occupant, followed his every move-<lb/>
107.<lb/>
<pb n="108" id="f06114108"/>
ment with wide eyes. She was less impressed with his sinwey agil-<lb/>
ity than with his possible wickedness. Would he, perhaps, dare<lb/>
to sneak softly up on them in the night, and.... she shuddered,<lb/>
unable to finish the thought. Her husband, guessing her uneasiness,<lb/>
reassured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think he did it. He hasn't even protested his in-<lb/>
nocence. He takes it for granted that <hi rend="italic">we'll</hi> take it for granted.<lb/>
Anyway, a murderer doesn't go around telling strangers that he's<lb/>
found the body of his victim. If he hadn't told us, we'd never have<lb/>
known that Jackson was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Emilie agreed reluctantly, &ldquo;but I don't like this<lb/>
place. It gives me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner their host indicated the rough bed under the<lb/>
cabin's single window. &ldquo;Guess you'll want to turn in early,&rdquo; he<lb/>
suggested, &ldquo;I'll get the window open for you -it's mighty stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave it a vigorous jerk, and it screeched up. Reaching<lb/>
behind the bed, he pulled out something with which to prop it open.<lb/>
Reed could not smother an exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, man! What have you got there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This?&rdquo; the frontiersman inquired with mild surprise.<lb/>
&ldquo;It's right handy to hold this here window up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the upper arm bone of the deceased Jackson.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The wagon road wound across the coastal range, dipped over<lb/>
its crest and snaked down its eastern side. Far ahead, they could<lb/>
sometimes glimpse stretches of the Arizona desert, threaded by the<lb/>
<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">trickle</add> of the Gila River. The days were cool and pleasant in<lb/>
108.<lb/>
<pb n="109" id="f06114109"/>
mid-November, the nights <del hand="unknown_hand">cool</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">cold</add>. Remembering the infantry captain<lb/>
at Fort Yuma, Reed supposed that he was appearing at dinner more<lb/>
formally attired during this season.</p>
<p>Following the stage road, the party crossed the Colorado<lb/>
River a dozen miles below Yuma on a small barge, attached to a<lb/>
rope stretched across the river, which was pulled along by a<lb/>
couple of husky Indians. The road then followed the Gila River<lb/>
for more than a hundred miles, before leaving it to strike off<lb/>
into the desert toward Tucson. The region was still wild, and<lb/>
trouble with the Indians common, but the frontier was yielding to<lb/>
the penetration of ranchers and miners, and the country was opening<lb/>
up to travel. The light, two-horse coaches of the Southern Over-<lb/>
land Stage, which operated between El Paso and San Diego, became a<lb/>
familiar sight to Emilie on the long trip.</p>
<p>The length of each day's march was determined principally<lb/>
by the distance of water holes from each other. Travel by wagon<lb/>
was slow; since the mules were not changed at frequent relays, as<lb/>
stage horses were, they could not be driven too fast. It took Reed<lb/>
and his party about three weeks to cover the five hundred miles<lb/>
of mountain, valley and desert between San Diego and Tucson, where<lb/>
Camp Lowell was situated. They arrived at the post the first week<lb/>
in December, 1876, and Army life, as they were both to know it for<lb/>
the next fourteen years, began for them.</p>
<p>It was a life distinguished principally by its narrowness.<lb/>
The United States Army in the late 187<del hand="unknown_hand">9</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">0</add>'s and for many years there-<lb/>
after was an organization of about twenty-five thousand men,<lb/>
scattered in small groups all over the country. Existence, partic-<lb/>
ularly at the distant western posts, was very monotonous. Pay for<lb/>
109.<lb/>
<pb n="110" id="f06114110"/>
both officers and men was meagre; patriotism was its own reward,<lb/>
in the opinion of the country that, confident it would never have<lb/>
to fight another war, took little interest in the upkeep of its<lb/>
fighting force. There were, in any case, few places to spend mon-<lb/>
ey, since most of the western posts were planted miles from centers<lb/>
of population offering any diversion but saloons.</p>
<p>The life was, by modern standards, a hard one. The officers'<lb/>
quarters, built of unpainted board, adobe or logs, were small, ugly<lb/>
and barren, and entirely innocent of such comforts as <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">central</add> heating,<lb/>
running water and bathrooms. Water was usually hauled in wagons<lb/>
from the nearest well or creek, and stored in barrels behind the<lb/>
houses. The Commanding Officer usually had a fairly large dwell-<lb/>
ing, but a lieutenant was lucky to get three of four rooms. En-<lb/>
listed men lived in ill-ventilated, ill-heated barracks, often<lb/>
with dirt floors, where it took enterprise and ingenuity to achieve<lb/>
even minimum personal cleanliness.</p>
<p>Time was heavy on the hands of men and officers alike in<lb/>
between the occasional Indian disturbances. The routine of inspec-<lb/>
tion, drill, guard and other duties neither filled their time nor<lb/>
taxed their energies. The soldiers got up baseball games, held<lb/>
running, jumping and boxing matches and played poker. On their<lb/>
days off they went hunting, or took aboard impressive amounts of<lb/>
red-eye, or whatever the <del hand="unknown_hand">local</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">native</add> intoxicant was called, and found<lb/>
spectacular ways of disturbing the local peace.</p>
<p>The officers and their families did the best they could<lb/>
with their meagre entertainment opportunites. The men hunted and<lb/>
rode and fished, and the more intelligent among them developed<lb/>
110.<lb/>
<pb n="111" id="f06114111"/>
hobbies that could be indulged locally, like geology or botany.<lb/>
There were frequent picnics, dances, improvised theatricals -gay<lb/>
entertainment, if repetitious. The women called on each other, had<lb/>
tea parties, made over their dresses, eagerly attended the auctions<lb/>
of the household goods of departing officers, and vied with each<lb/>
other socially.</p>
<p>Tucson was unlike any town Mrs. Reed had known <del hand="unknown_hand">previously</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">before</add>.<lb/>
In one respect it did not even seem American. Spanish was the lan-<lb/>
guage you most commonly heard spoken as you drove down its single<lb/>
dusty street, or stepped over a dozing Papago Indian on you way<lb/>
into the general store; the sprinkling of <del hand="unknown_hand">white</del> Americans had adap-<lb/>
ted themselves to the usage of the overwhelmingly Mexican population.<lb/>
The San Diego-El Paso stage regularly rolled through the street,<lb/>
raising a cloud of dust. An occasional prospector, plodding along<lb/>
with his flop-eared donkey, passed through on his way to the moun-<lb/>
tains on the eternal search for gold and silver. Otherwise there<lb/>
was little travel. Buchalew Block, a row of one story adobe<lb/>
houses, symbolized modern progress, and the number of saloons sug-<lb/>
gested that it was a country to build a man's thirst. The sun baked<lb/>
town, it seemed to Mrs. Reed, looked as though it had sprung up<lb/>
out of the arid soil overnight, complete with basking population<lb/>
and dusty main street. Nothing could have been less like the civ-<lb/>
ilized, gracious South in which she had grown up, with its great<lb/>
shade trees and softly weathered homes set in green lawns. But if<lb/>
she missed home, she did not complain, and settled into the mono-<lb/>
tonous life of the &ldquo;Army wife&rdquo; with the same kind of enthusiasm and<lb/>
interest as Reed's.</p>
<p>Where there was so little variety, amusement tended to fall<lb/>
111.<lb/>
<pb n="112" id="f06114112"/>
into a routine, but life was not without its unexpected humor. Reed<lb/>
and his wife never forgot the post chaplain and his pet. He came<lb/>
to call on them one evening, a diffident and serious man nearing<lb/>
middle age, plainly excited and a little shaken. Greetings were<lb/>
hardly over when his story came out: he had found a Gila monster,<lb/>
the large, ugly, venomous lizard native to the arid part of Arizona,<lb/>
in his kitchen. He had captured it in a potato sack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with the horrid thing?&rdquo; Mrs.<lb/>
Reed asked, shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not quite sure. I wondered,&rdquo; the minister speculated,<lb/>
&ldquo;if it might not respond to kindness. I believe that I shall try<lb/>
to make a pet of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed smiled. &ldquo;You're a brave man, chaplain. They're ill-<lb/>
natured things, and their bite's poisonous. I shouldn't advise<lb/>
you to let it eat out of your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chaplain nodded absently. He was already laying plans<lb/>
to win the heart of his lizard.</p>
<p>He named it Sally Anne, for two officers' wives who were<lb/>
his most faithful parishoners -the compliment was wasted on them<lb/>
since neither cared greatly for Gila monsters -and spent a great<lb/>
deal of time catching it insects for food. When the Reeds left<lb/>
the post a few months later, the chaplain was still industriously<lb/>
trying to rouse a spark of affection in its reptilian bosom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So soon?&rdquo; Mrs. Reed inquired in a stricken tone,<lb/>
glancing around the ugly square room with the worn furniture that<lb/>
had seen service with so many officers' families. There was little<lb/>
beautiful about it, or even attractive, she admitted to herself,<lb/>
but it had the well-lived-in look that rooms acquire when people<lb/>
have been comfortable and happy in them. They were leaving their<lb/>
first home, the thought with a small pang. &ldquo;But we've hardly been<lb/>
here any time at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1<del hand="unknown_hand">3</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">1</add>3.</p>
<pb n="114" id="f06114114"/>
<p>&ldquo;That's Army life for you.&rdquo; Reed said philosophically.<lb/>
&ldquo;The Army's quite a lot like the Methodist Church -it doesn't<lb/>
give you a chance to stagnate in one spot. My childhood training<lb/>
in frequent moves will come in handy. Personally, I'll be glad<lb/>
to miss the rest of the August heat here. It's cooler at Camp<lb/>
Apache, and wilder country, too, in that part of Arizona.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilder? What about the Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't think we need worry about Indians. All the Apaches<lb/>
in the state except the scouts enlisted in the Army and a few out-<lb/>
laws are at San Carlos Reservation now, and behaving themselves.<lb/>
It was the tribes under Geronimo and Victorio who were making most<lb/>
of the trouble, and now that Clum's got them on the reserva-<lb/>
tion they'll probably be good.&rdquo; No point to alarming Emilie with<lb/>
the information that the young civilian Indian agent, John Clum,<lb/>
who had made a model reservation of San Carlos,. had just resigned<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">in p</del> his post in protest because troops had been stationed there.<lb/>
Already, Reed had been told, the fierce and crafty Geronimo, whom<lb/>
Clum and his Apache police had captured and imprisoned, after the<lb/>
Army had several times failed to catch him, had been liberated and<lb/>
given the run of the reservation.</p>
<p>On August 11th, 1877, Reed and his wife were ready to set<lb/>
off on their second major wagon expedition, to proceed &ldquo;by the<lb/>
shortest usually traveled route,&rdquo; as the Army orders of that day<lb/>
always expressed it, to Camp Apache, north of Tucson in the White<lb/>
Mountains. The baggage wagon, loaded with such household furnish-<lb/>
ings as could withstand the rough two hundred mile trip, had<lb/>
started the previous morning, and at nine o'clock the doherty<lb/>
114.<lb/>
<pb n="115" id="f06114115"/>
wagon, painted white to turn a little of the burning heat, waited<lb/>
outside their quarters for the doctor and his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're sure you haven't forgotten anything, Dr. Reed?&rdquo; Mrs.<lb/>
Reed questioned anxiously as she hurried out of the house. Her<lb/>
little dog, Undina, wedged tightly under her arm, began to sniff<lb/>
with excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have, I really don't <del hand="unknown_hand">wh</del> know where we would put it<lb/>
now,&rdquo; Reed observed, watching his wife's expression with amusement<lb/>
as she surveyed the ambulance. He, the driver, and the strapping<lb/>
corporal who sat up front with the driver had packed it to the brim.</p>
<p>Only the back seat, on which he and Mrs. Reed and the dog<lb/>
were to sit, was vacant. Beneath it was an emergency kit of medi-<lb/>
cines, a large lunch box, a pair of Reed's boots and a bulging<lb/>
bag which rattled with coffee pot, frying pan and sauce pans. A<lb/>
couple of folding chairs, a valise, blankets, a bundle of shawls,<lb/>
a work basket, a feather pillow and some light reading crowded the<lb/>
front seat, while under it were packed a mess chest containing<lb/>
tableware for the journey, a box of provisions and a clothes basket<lb/>
holding an assortment of necessaries. Two hats, Reed's sword, an<lb/>
umbrella, firearms, a pair of shoes and two canteens full of water<lb/>
swung from the roof. Outside, underneath the front seat, Reed had<lb/>
stowed his heavy instrument case beside a sack of grain and the<lb/>
driver's ten days' rations. His trunk, and a mat-<lb/>
tress and bedding tied in a canvas cover, were securely strapped<lb/>
on behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very stylish equipage, don't you think, my dear?&rdquo; he in-<lb/>
quired smilingly. &ldquo;At last I feel completely at home in the Army.<lb/>
The only difference is that Pa didn't arm to the teeth when he<lb/>
115.<lb/>
<pb n="116" id="f06114116"/>
traveled. Hop in and let's be off. We've a forty mile run ahead<lb/>
of us today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seasoned travelers by now, the Reeds enjoyed the ten day<lb/>
trip through the almost uninhabited Apache domain. Hazards and<lb/>
hardships were, at their best, fun; at their worst, merely routine.</p>
<p>The road skirted the southern edge of the mountain range<lb/>
that lay between Tucson and Camp Apache. A leading item on the fun<lb/>
side of the ledger was Undina's behavior. Unsubdued by a temper-<lb/>
ature of a hundred and ten degrees, she barked at the top of<lb/>
her lungs the whole first day out, and jumped tirelessly back and<lb/>
forth across the seats. Having made herself too hoarse even to yelp,<lb/>
she thereafter behaved with more composure.</p>
<p>Under routine hazards came anxiety about hostile Indians.<lb/>
Reed, recalling that they sometimes frequented a spot called the<lb/>
Lime Kilns which his party was to pass on the second day, kept his<lb/>
weapons loaded and close at hand, and avoided the topic of Indians,<lb/>
in which his wife was showing an untimely interest. The wagon, how-<lb/>
ever, rattled unmolested along the hot road past the danger spot,<lb/>
between the innocent greasewood and m<del hand="unknown_hand">i</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>squite bushes which concealed<lb/>
nothing more alarming than an occasional reptile.</p>
<p>Bending north off the stage route to cross the plain, the<lb/>
road left to the right the Dragoon Mountains, still infested with<lb/>
outlaw Indians, where a stage driver had been murdered only a week<lb/>
before. <del hand="unknown_hand">and</del> It led them through the green Aravaipa Valley to Camp<lb/>
Thomas, where they spent the night with Lieutenant Powell, an ac-<lb/>
quaintance of Reed's. Mrs. Reed was the first woman who had ever<lb/>
been on the post, and a small dog, catching sight of her, ran away<lb/>
yelping with alarm.</p>
<p>From then on, they had to camp out, sleeping in the do-<lb/>
116.<lb/>
<pb n="117" id="f06114117"/>
herty wagon, with Undina, who demanded all the comforts of hom, on<lb/>
the bed at their feet. There were no way stations or even houses<lb/>
along the trail which ran through the <del hand="unknown_hand">Indian res</del> San Carlos Reser-<lb/>
vation, which they had now entered, but there were Indians. It<lb/>
gave Mrs. Reed rather a turn when, at their first halt in the open,<lb/>
an Apache came into the camp. He laid down his rifle and sat be-<lb/>
side the doctor, and explained with unsmiling friendliness that he<lb/>
was on his way to Camp Apache and would like something to eat.<lb/>
When he had devoured a loaf of bread, he said &ldquo;Adios&rdquo; and walked away.</p>
<p>The fishing expedition Reed undertook one afternoon was a<lb/>
complete failure. They had reached camp -that is, the nearest<lb/>
water -early that day, and <del hand="unknown_hand">after spending</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">Reed spent</add> an hour dangling his<lb/>
line in Ash Creek. His only bite was a turtle, and after spending<lb/>
another hour trying to get it off his hook, he gave up. A sudden<lb/>
downpour that evening, just at dinner time, flooded the oven, ruined<lb/>
the bread and depressed the spirits of their soldier-cook without<lb/>
dampening those of Reed and his wife at all. Bad weather, they<lb/>
agreed, was part of the fun -if you could stay in the doherty wagon.</p>
<p>The way was now gradually ascending into the White Mountains,<lb/>
and the trail was becoming almost impassable, even to stout hearts<lb/>
and Army mules. How to get up and down hills where the track was<lb/>
only a steep jumble of barrel sized rocks became the major problem.<lb/>
Leaving the baggage wagon stuck on a tremendous hill with the sol-<lb/>
diers who were to unload it and bring it up empty the next morning,<lb/>
Reed one evening pushed ahead with the ambulance. Again those bug-<lb/>
aboos, bears and Indians, so potent a fiction in the safe nurseries<lb/>
of the east and so real a danger in the lonely reaches of the far<lb/>
west, haunted Mrs. Reed. The sight, however, of the blazing fire<lb/>
under the tall pines and of her husband preparing supper for them<lb/>
117.<lb/>
<pb n="118" id="f06114118"/>
reminded her that life in the open made her even more hungry than<lb/>
nervous.</p>
<p>Heroic measures -in trying to keep the wagon from going<lb/>
over a steep bump with a fatal smash, Reed was jerked along behind<lb/>
it with such violence that the soles were ripped from his shoes-<lb/>
brought them safe and whole, in body and baggage, over the last lap<lb/>
and into Camp Apache. They were to live at this post, one of the<lb/>
most inaccessible in all this wild and inaccessible region, for the<lb/>
next three years.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was the last month of 1877. The year, so eventful and<lb/>
so crowded with new experiences for Walter and Emilie Lawrence Reed,<lb/>
still had one major novelty in store for them. On December 4th<lb/>
their first child was born.</p>
<p>Reed knocked very softly at the door, and bent his neat<lb/>
brown head attentively toward it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; his wife called. &ldquo;I'm not asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He entered and closed the door quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future President is, though,&rdquo; she greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's nice, isn't he,&rdquo; Reed said, bending over to look at<lb/>
the tiny baby. &ldquo;He already looks just like you. I feel unreason-<lb/>
ably proud of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baby opened his eyes and stared unwinkingly at his<lb/>
father. Reed picked him up gently and looked at him with a combin-<lb/>
ation of fatherly tenderness and professional interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sound specimen, doctor?&rdquo; Mrs. Reed asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine specimen, ma'am,&rdquo; he assured her, &ldquo;and a credit to<lb/>
his parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed and reached out for the baby. Reed carefully<lb/>
laid him beside her and pulled a chair up to the bedside.</p>
<p>118.</p>
<pb n="119" id="f06114119"/>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn't we better give him a name pretty soon?&rdquo; he sug-<lb/>
gested. &ldquo;We've had him now for three days, and it isn't very con-<lb/>
venient just to call him &lsquo;he&rsquo; all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want him named after his father,&rdquo; Mrs. Reed asserted.<lb/>
&ldquo;And I want him to grow up like him, too,&rdquo; she added positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can easily arrange for your first request, anyway,&rdquo;<lb/>
Reed agreed, &ldquo;but the other will have to wait for a while. I want<lb/>
him named after you, though, but I'll compromise. Let's name<lb/>
him Walter Lawrence, and call him Lawrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed though that a splendid solution. The object of<lb/>
the discussion, however, was not interested. He had gone back to<lb/>
sleep<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">.</add><del hand="unknown_hand">again.</del></p>
<p>119.</p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="11" id="d16"><pb n="120" id="f06114120"/>
<head>CHAPTER XI</head>
<p>The doctor looked more dishevel<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del>ed than his wife had<lb/>
ever seen him before, even on camping trips. Amusement and des-<lb/>
peration mingled in his expression. She did not need to ask what<lb/>
was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cook has left!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>120.</p>
<pb n="121" id="f06114121"/>
<p>&ldquo;By your face.&rdquo; She could not help laughing.</p>
<p>Reed sighed. &ldquo;He's gone, all right. Out the window, too.<lb/>
After I found him drunk last night, I made him go to bed and locked<lb/>
his door and pocketed the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! And after he <hi rend="italic">promised</hi> you to keep sober until I<lb/>
was up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice he promised me: when I hired him, and when the baby<lb/>
was born,&rdquo; Reed said bleakly. &ldquo;And you should see the kitchen this<lb/>
morning, too -all yesterday's dirty dishes. What would you sug-<lb/>
gest?&rdquo; he asked helplessly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed lay back on her pillow and smiled sweetly at her<lb/>
husband. &ldquo;There's only one thing I can think of,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm<lb/>
surprised it hasn't occurred to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has. But I was hoping for something better from your<lb/>
ingenuity, my dear.&rdquo; He grinned ruefully and went over to the bu-<lb/>
reau. &ldquo;Where do you keep your aprons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed could follow his progress from the noises downstairs.<lb/>
She heard him shake the stove; next came the slam of the door as he<lb/>
stepped into the lean-to shed for wood; the clank of the stove lid<lb/>
and the thump of wood being tossed in followed, and the slosh of<lb/>
water ladled into the tea-kettle. After a bit came the clatter of<lb/>
dishes inexpertly wash<del hand="unknown_hand">ing</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">ed</add> and dried. She slipped off to sleep<lb/>
again to the sound of pots being impatiently banged on the stove,<lb/>
and to the rising smell of fresh hot coffee.</p>
<p>When Reed came upstairs again, carrying a tray, she woke<lb/>
up. His face was flushed, and her apron was knotted around his<lb/>
middle in a most unmilitary manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm all worn out from hanging over the hot stove,&rdquo; he<lb/>
121.<lb/>
<pb n="122" id="f06114122"/>
grumbled in comic imitation of a disgruntled housewife, setting<lb/>
the tray on the bedside table. Whisking the napkin off, <del hand="unknown_hand">the way the<lb/>
waiters did it at the Fifth Avenue Hotel,</del> he exposed bread, butter,<lb/>
coffee and boiled eggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were getting this superb breakfast in a city ho-<lb/>
tel,&rdquo; he pointed out to his hungry wife, &ldquo;it would be listed on the<lb/>
menu as <hi rend="italic">pan fr&eacute;sco</hi>, <hi rend="italic">mant&eacute;ca</hi>, <hi rend="italic">caf&eacute; caliente y huevos asados</hi>. B<del hand="unknown_hand">i</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">u</add>t it<lb/>
wouldn't taste a bit better.&rdquo; He served her and began to eat with<lb/>
enjoyment. &ldquo;I don't know what we want with a cook when I do so nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you like the dishes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that's something else. I suppose I shall have to<lb/>
be severe with Private Anmach when he comes back. In fact, I feel<lb/>
like being severe,&rdquo; he added grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the poor man,&rdquo; Mrs. Reed protested. &ldquo;He must have<lb/>
such a dull life. Anyway, Christmas comes only once a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good thing, too. We couldn't afford to have our cook<lb/>
disappear much more often. He may be eccentric, but as soldier-<lb/>
cooks go, he's pretty good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Private James Anmach had agreed to cook for the Reeds on<lb/>
the first of December. Although officers could not have enlisted<lb/>
men as cooks in more civilized stations, wherever it was impossible<lb/>
to get civilian help they could, if the soldier was willing. An-<lb/>
mach, when approached by Reed with the suggestion, had been willing.<lb/>
He had been at one time or another a plasterer, painter, carpenter,<lb/>
tinner, plumber and farmer. He wouldn't mind learning to cook, he<lb/>
said; it might come in handy some time.</p>
<p>His cooking, under Reed's direction, had developed well;<lb/>
but he had original ideas about serving. His favorite crockery<lb/>
was soup plates. Steak, chicken, vegetables, flannel cakes, every-<lb/>
122.<lb/>
<pb n="123" id="f06114123"/>
thing, appeared on the table in soup plates. Reed was expected to<lb/>
eat from a soup plate, too. Thankful that his wife was upstairs<lb/>
in bed, beyond the reach of such barbarism, the doctor remonstrated<lb/>
mildly that soup plates were for soup. Whether the explanation<lb/>
offended Anmach, or merely baffled him, Reed never knew. But the<lb/>
next day at dinner he found potatoes in the soup tureen, and pickles<lb/>
in the gravy boat. He wisely refrained from comment.</p>
<p>It became a point of honor with him not to betray surprise<lb/>
at Anmach's ingenious flouting of table convention. When a boiled<lb/>
potato rolled out of the water pitcher and plunked into his<lb/>
glass, Reed blandly speared it onto his plate, like a man accus-<lb/>
tomed all his life to having boiled potatoes served in water pit-<lb/>
chers. Anmach's little game was harmless, Reed thought with amuse-<lb/>
ment, and since he took a great deal of pains with the cooking, he<lb/>
was willing to indulge him.</p>
<p>Then Anmach, carried away by the holiday spirit, disappeared<lb/>
Christmas night, <del hand="unknown_hand">leaving behind him the day's dirty dishes.</del> For<lb/>
three <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">days</add> Reed saw nothing of him. And for three days Reed did<lb/>
the cooking and housework. By his own account, the dishes he pre-<lb/>
pared were barely fit to eat. Sympathetic ladies at the post<lb/>
sent Mrs. Reed her meals. Distrust of the culinary prowess of<lb/>
husbands was general among them.</p>
<p>On the morning of the fourth day, while Reed was start-<lb/>
ing the fire in the stove, he heard a meek rap at the door. He<lb/>
opened it to Anmach, a penitent Anmach who asserted that he was a<lb/>
&ldquo;dog&rdquo; and reproached himself so movingly for his base conduct<lb/>
that Reed did not have the heart to add reproaches of his own.<lb/>
Besides, he was too happy to see him again to think of any. That<lb/>
123.<lb/>
<pb n="124" id="f06114124"/>
night, as he warily reconnoitred his dinner, which Anmach had<lb/>
served with his usual talent for surprise, Reed was conscious only<lb/>
of gratitude: he would not have to wash the dishes. His troubles<lb/>
were over.</p>
<p>So he thought. But he had reckoned without his wife's<lb/>
feeling for the fitness of things. Eating from soup plates and<lb/>
finding dumplings in the cream pitcher did not conform to it. By<lb/>
the middle of January she was up again, and having her meals with<lb/>
Reed. Disregarding her husband's urgent advice, she protested.<lb/>
Anmanch, offended, disappeared again; and Reed, for another five<lb/>
days, took over the kitchen department, since Mrs. Reed was not<lb/>
yet well enough. Finally he found another private as cook.</p>
<p>Powers, Mrs. Reed reported, was a jewel. He was sober,<lb/>
pleasant, took suggestions kindly and outraged no conventions.<lb/>
Her satisfaction was so great that she did not conceal it.<lb/>
Powers' renown came to the ears of the Commanding Officdr, whose<lb/>
cook had lately deserted the stove for the bottle. The Commanding<lb/>
Officer, therefore, found himself under the &ldquo;painful necessity,&rdquo; as<lb/>
he regretfully put it, of taking Powers to cook for his household.<lb/>
The &ldquo;painful necessity&rdquo; was neither painful nor necessary, Reed<lb/>
knew, but what could a <del hand="unknown_hand">m</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">l</add>ieutenant do when the CO coveted his cook?<lb/>
He could look around for another cook, that was all.</p>
<p>He engaged Private Howard, who had the reputation of being<lb/>
a good one. The reputation was undeserved. His cooking was deplor-<lb/>
able, his disposition worse. Mrs. Reed hotly insisted that he be<lb/>
discharged. Reed, remembering thos mornings when he had shiveringly<lb/>
come down to the icy kitchen to start the fire and make the break-<lb/>
fast, begged her to be patient. Tapping her foot, she replied that<lb/>
124.<lb/>
<pb n="125" id="f06114125"/>
she could be patient with that impudent lazy-bones only so long.<lb/>
Howard relieved the situation by asserting that he was being over-<lb/>
worked, and asked to be sent back to his company. Reed paid him<lb/>
off and tried to find another cook. It seemed impossible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply don't know what to do about it,&rdquo; he lamented the<lb/>
next evening. Mrs. Reed was preparing the dinner, and he had just<lb/>
finished setting the table. The despair in his voice was only half<lb/>
comic<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del>.</p>
<p>She took the roast out of the oven and put it on the platter -<lb/>
not a soup plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gives me the most wonderful idea!&rdquo; she exclaimed sud-<lb/>
denly. &ldquo;Why shouldn't we get Anmach to come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed looked at her with admiration. &ldquo;Why shouldn't we, in-<lb/>
deed? I can't think of any reason of earth. My dear, you <hi rend="italic">are</hi><lb/>
wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Anmach came back. Reed, cannily determined to avoid<lb/>
shoals this time, drew up a contract: Private <del hand="unknown_hand">Anmach</del> James Anmach<lb/>
agreed to cook, to do general work such as milking and gardening,<lb/>
and to serve food in the traditional vessels; and Dr. Walter Reed<lb/>
agreed that Private Anmach should have a week's bender after every<lb/>
pay day, or once every two months.</p>
<p>Reed knew how to compromise.</p>
<p>He summed up his experience in a quotation from Edward<lb/>
Lytton's &ldquo;Lucile&rdquo; which he sent to his wife's sister.</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>We may live without poetry, music and art;</l>
<l>We may live without conscience and live without heart;</l>
<l>We may live without friends; we may live without books;</l>
<l>But civilized man cannot live without cooks.</l>
</lg>
<p>125.</p>
<pb n="126" id="f06114126"/>
<p>This was the lighter side of post life, but there was<lb/>
more to it than comedy. There was, for instance, nothing funny<lb/>
about the Indians.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no good Indians but dead Indians,&rdquo; General<lb/>
Philip Sheridan had sweepingly declared in a ca<del hand="unknown_hand">a</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">l</add>lous epigram that<lb/>
was widely taken for truth.</p>
<p>The majority of the settlers and soldiers in the far<lb/>
west knew little about the rights and wrongs of white and Indian<lb/>
affairs. All they knew was that they were trying to open up the<lb/>
country and make it safe, and that the Apaches would sweep down<lb/>
without warning, burn and kill and capture, and then dissolve into<lb/>
the mountains or across the Mexican border. It would probably<lb/>
have surprised them to know President Hayes' opinion: &ldquo;Many, <del hand="unknown_hand">o</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">i</add>f<lb/>
not most, of our Indian wars have had their origin in brok<del hand="unknown_hand">i</del>en pro-<lb/>
mises and acts of injustice on our part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time that Reed was stationed in Arizona,<lb/>
however, most of the Apaches, submitting to the pressure of the<lb/>
inevitable, had given up the unequal war against the white men and<lb/>
were living as government wards at San Carlos Indian Reservation.<lb/>
But Geronimo, an outlaw, was irreconcilable. When John Clum gave<lb/>
up his post as Indian agent, the war chief, crafty and vengeful,<lb/>
was set at liberty again. He spent the <del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">w</add>inter of 1877-1878 at the<lb/>
reservation, living at government expense in more ease and comfort<lb/>
than he could otherwise have enjoyed; but when spring came, and<lb/>
the snow began to melt from the mountains and game was easier to<lb/>
find, he a<del hand="unknown_hand">h</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add>d his <del hand="unknown_hand">lieutenants and</del> followers slipped away from the<lb/>
reservation and headed south toward Mexico's Sierra Madre<lb/>
range, the &ldquo;Mother Mountains&rdquo; of the Apaches, raiding on the way.</p>
<p>126.</p>
<pb n="127" id="f06114127"/>
<p>The Camp Apache cavalry was sent in pursuit, with the<lb/>
friendly Coyotero Apaches who had enlisted in the Army acting<lb/>
as scouts. They followed Geronimo's trail, but were unable to<lb/>
catch him. The <del hand="unknown_hand">Apahes</del> Apaches, when pursued, usually broke up<lb/>
into small bands of two and three and escaped separately, to re-<lb/>
unite later at some prearranged safe place.</p>
<p>Reed, who had not been ordered to accompany the expedi-<lb/>
tion, was awakened before dawn one morning by persistent knocking<lb/>
on his door. When he stepped out on the porch, he could distinguish<lb/>
by the starlight two enlisted men standing there, one of them with<lb/>
a bundle in his arms. Before <del hand="unknown_hand">the</del> anyone could speak the bundle<lb/>
whimpered. Reed stepped sharply forward and demanded,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A child, sir,&rdquo; the soldier holding the bundle answered.<lb/>
&ldquo;A little Indian girl, badly burned. Two days ago our force came<lb/>
into <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">a</add> camp that Geronimo had just left, and found her there. They'd<lb/>
left her to die, so we volunteered to bring her back. We'd have<lb/>
got here quicker, but the captain ordered us to travel only at night,<lb/>
because of hostile Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good men,&rdquo; Reed approved them. &ldquo;Carry her to the hospi-<lb/>
tal and have the steward stir up the fire and put water on to heat.<lb/>
I'll join you right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dressed hastily and hurried over to the rough log<lb/>
hospital. A wood fire was roaring in the stove, and the water<lb/>
was already heating. The child lay in the middle of the single<lb/>
ward on the pine table <del hand="unknown_hand">tjat</del> that served as operating table. Dex-<lb/>
terously Reed snipped away the makeshift bandages from her burned<lb/>
side. A youthful cavalryman with a broken leg woke up and, rais-<lb/>
127.<lb/>
<pb n="128" id="f06114128"/>
ing himself on his elbow, watched from his<del hand="unknown_hand">be</del> bed. He admired the<lb/>
young doctor's skill and gentleness -he had recently experienced<lb/>
them himself -and noticed that his slight frown of concentration<lb/>
did not at all detract from the kindliness of his expression. As<lb/>
his skillful hands moved, he spoke once or twice. &ldquo;Closer,&rdquo; he<lb/>
said, to the soldier holding the candle which flickered in the<lb/>
cold air seeping through chinks in the logs, and &ldquo;Water, now,&rdquo; to<lb/>
the steward. The boy drifted off to sleep again. When he opened<lb/>
his eyes the sun was rising. The doctor, smiling, was rolling<lb/>
down his sleeves and advising one of the soldiers, who was looking<lb/>
very green and miserable, to go over to his quarters and ask An-<lb/>
mach for some coffee: that would put him back on his feet after<lb/>
his hard night. The child had stopped moaning and was sleep-<lb/>
ing under an opiate. Reed smoothed the straight black hair<lb/>
off her low forehead and lightly patted the round cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She'll come through, all right,&rdquo; he said confidently.</p>
<p>Funny, the young soldier thought, an educated man like<lb/>
the doctor taking so much trouble just for an Indian kid.</p>
<p>Reed walked briskly out, whistling softly between his<lb/>
teeth, to get his breakfast and tell his wife about the little<lb/>
Indian girl whom he hoped to save.</p>
<p>He thought live Indians were good, too.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="12" id="d17"><pb n="129" id="f06114129"/>
<head>CHAPTER XII</head>
<p>The practice of an Army doctor in those days was much<lb/>
like that of his civilian confreres. He treated wounds, injuries,<lb/>
frostbite and any illness that occurred among the healthy young<lb/>
men of his post, and cared for the officers' wives and children.<lb/>
Because he was often the only doctor for miles around, he also<lb/>
attended anyone in the surrounding region who sent for him. His<lb/>
practice was a general one. Specialization was just a word to<lb/>
him, one, indeed, that he rarely heard.</p>
<p>129.</p>
<pb n="130" id="f06114130"/>
<p>His life was not easy. The Army was neglected by the coun-<lb/>
try that thought it was through with wars, and the Medical Corps wa<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add><lb/>
the step-child of the Army. In posts such as Apache the hospital<lb/>
was usually a crude building erected by the troops. It was built to<lb/>
last ten years on the theory, possible only in an age that knew<lb/>
nothing about bacteriology, that it would by then be too &ldquo;saturated<lb/>
with hospital infection&rdquo; for further use and should be torn<lb/>
down. An office, a dispensary, a store room and a kitchen were<lb/>
usually partitioned off in the four corners, and the rest of the room<lb/>
served as a ward. It was heated by wood-burning stoves and lighted<lb/>
by candles or coal oil lamps. Such necessities of a modern hospi-<lb/>
tal as a laboratory, an operating room and running water were un-<lb/>
dreamed of.</p>
<p>There were no nurses, and the Hospital Corps had not yet<lb/>
been formed. The sick were cared for by hospital stewards, many of<lb/>
them men of some education and training who were attached to the<lb/>
Medical Corps as non-commissioned officers; and by privates, de-<lb/>
tailed <del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>for</unclear></del> by their company commander to hospital duty, and not<lb/>
greatly interested in the work beyond the extra-duty pay.</p>
<p>Reed got along well with the men working under him, and<lb/>
succeeded in inspiring them with a little of his own devotion to<lb/>
the art and, as he saw it, <del hand="unknown_hand">privilege,</del> the privilege of healing.<lb/>
Order and cleanliness were strict rules with him. Lenient with<lb/>
Anmach's lapses from sobriety, he would not tolerate drinking by<lb/>
hospital attendants: the welfa<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">r</add>e of his patients was at stake.</p>
<p>Usually gracious and pliable, he could be rigid when his<lb/>
authority was slighted. There was a tendency at that time among<lb/>
the line officers -the fighting men -the pay scant attention<lb/>
130.<lb/>
<pb n="131" id="f06114131"/>
to the advice of the Army doctors. The medical officer was in the<lb/>
unhappy position of being able only to advise on health and sani-<lb/>
tary matters; he had no enforcement power at all. The Commanding<lb/>
Officer of <del hand="unknown_hand">thi</del> his post could ignore even his most urgent recommen-<lb/>
dations. It was a <del hand="unknown_hand">gl</del> galling situation, and one which Reed met with<lb/>
his customary directness.</p>
<p>On one occasion a soldier still on sick list who was taking<lb/>
a walk was ordered <del hand="unknown_hand">by</del> to active duty by the Commanding Officer<del hand="unknown_hand">,</del> at<lb/>
Apache, who remarked that if he was well enough to be strolling<lb/>
about he was well enough to work. Reed did not waste his time or<lb/>
temper in a protest to his superior. Instead he sent a letter through<lb/>
him to headquarters asking if such interference with medical treat-<lb/>
ment was allowed. The answer, filtering back through official<lb/>
channels, upheld him. The Commanding Officer, who received it first,<lb/>
read it and sighed as he handed it to his Adjutant for delivery to<lb/>
Reed. &ldquo;Confound the doctors, Mr. Adjutant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We can never<lb/>
get ahead of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could snare Reed's cook away from him, but he knew better<lb/>
now than to interfere with his patients! Surgeon General Barnes<lb/>
had been right when he recognized the young lieutenant as a man who<lb/>
would defend the dignity of his Corps.</p>
<p>The duty of safeguarding the health of his handful of pa-<lb/>
tients left Reed time for his favorite hobby, gardening, which he<lb/>
and his wife enjoyed together. She grew flowers, he, vegetables.<lb/>
The Army, in the days when little was known about the importance<lb/>
of fresh vegetables in the diet, made no provision for them in the<lb/>
daily ration. Even if it had, there would have been no way to ob-<lb/>
tain them at posts like Apache, except by growing them on the spot.<lb/>
A soldier threatened with scurvy -a disease caused by lack of<lb/>
131.<lb/>
<pb n="132" id="f06114132"/>
fresh vegetables and fruit -was ordered to go to the commisary<lb/>
and get canned tomatoes; and this food at many posts took the place<lb/>
of fresh vegetables. Reed could not grow enough in his garden<lb/>
for the whole post, but he did provide the hospital. In the mild<lb/>
evenings, when his duties for the day were over, he and Mrs. Reed,<lb/>
trailed by Undina and Anmach, would tour their gardens and make sug-<lb/>
gestions to their ex-farmer and sometimes do a little planting or<lb/>
digging or picking themselves.</p>
<p>Nobody worried much about hostile Indians at the post.<lb/>
The few Coyotero Apaches who, with their women and children, lived<lb/>
there were peaceable folk, and most of their men were enlisted in<lb/>
the Army. As long as Geronimo was at large the danger from hos-<lb/>
tile Indians was real, but it was chiefly confined to the southern<lb/>
parts of Arizona and New Mexico from which retreat across the Bor-<lb/>
der, out of reach of the United States troops, was easy. And even<lb/>
that danger abated for the time<del hand="unknown_hand">,</del> when, in October, 1879, Geronimo,<lb/>
seeing a cold hard winter ahead, proclaimed that he was tired of<lb/>
the war-path and wanted to return to San Carlos -where the govern-<lb/>
ment would take care of his food, clothing and shelter.</p>
<p>The post Indians were fond of games, and the men, in their<lb/>
free time, could often be found squatting in the shade <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">playing</add> cards,<lb/>
each with his little scrap of red flannel, which all Apaches wore<lb/>
for good luck, stuck in hat or belt or buttonhole. The cards, home-<lb/>
made from horsehide, were marked with crude sketches of men and<lb/>
animals, and with tods and Apache signs; stakes were a bit of to-<lb/>
bacco, small coins, a knife, or perhaps a pair of canvas pants.</p>
<p>They were a sturdy people, of great endurance and<lb/>
strength, who had little sickness. When an Apache became ill the<lb/>
medicine man, hideously painted, with chanting, incantations and<lb/>
dancing would set to work to drive out the evil spirit. The In-<lb/>
132.<lb/>
<pb n="133" id="f06114133"/>
dians at Camp Apache, when an illness did not immediately yield to<lb/>
this treatment, got in the habit of sending for the white medicine<lb/>
man.</p>
<p>They liked him and looked on him as a friend. He had saved<lb/>
the life of the little Indian girl, they knew, and <del hand="unknown_hand">he</del> had named her<lb/>
Susie and was bringing her up in his own household; and he was<lb/>
never too busy or tired to come to them when they asked for him.<lb/>
Reed, on his part, treated them faithfully and was never discour-<lb/>
aged by the almost certain knowledge that, the moment his back was<lb/>
turned, the witch doctor, shaking his gourd rattle and whooping<lb/>
frightfully, would resume his effort to scare the devil out of the<lb/>
sufferer -who probably needed quiet more than anything else. That<lb/>
they apprecited his efforts for them, whether or not they thought<lb/>
them as effective as those of their own medicine man, they made plain<lb/>
by bringing him presents -a haunch of venison, or a wild turkey, or<lb/>
a few quail. If no one was in the house to receive it, they would<lb/>
slip inside and, removing a picture from the wall, hang the game in<lb/>
its place, or perhaps lay it on Mrs. Reed's dressing table.</p>
<p>It was, in some respects, an ideal life, active, healthy<lb/>
and busy, and free of financial strain; but it had drawbacks, too,<lb/>
distressing to Reed's scholarly temperament. In this remote Army<lb/>
post, seven hundred miles from the nearest railway and six weeks by<lb/>
mail from the east, he was shut off from the distractions of the<lb/>
world, but also from its problems and ideas. Medical knowledge, <del hand="unknown_hand">h</del><lb/>
he knew, was not static; it was continually pressing against its<lb/>
frontiers and forcing them back as surely as the ranchers and miners<lb/>
and farmers were forcing back those of the west. It was a slow<lb/>
process, but a continuing one, one with which it was hard to keep<lb/>
up from an isolated garrison in the Arizona mountains.</p>
<p>133.</p>
<pb n="134" id="f06114134"/>
<p>Revolutionary new theories were seeping into the medical<lb/>
journals. Some European doctors were saying that &ldquo;germs,&rdquo; tiny<lb/>
living organisms that could be seen only through a microscope,<lb/>
were the causes of certain diseases and of the infections that made<lb/>
even the simplest surgical operation dangerous. Lister himself had<lb/>
addressed a skeptical audience on antiseptic surgery at the Inter-<lb/>
national Medical Congress at the Philadelphia Centennial in 1876.<lb/>
A brother officer, Captain A. C. Girard of the Medical Corps, had<lb/>
been abroad in 1877 and, convinced of the value of Lister's tech-<lb/>
nique, had sent the Surgeon General a full <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">report</add> of it. Barnes,<lb/>
somewhat impressed, <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">had</add> published it to the Corps in August, 1877, and<lb/>
more than a year later had made available to any post surgeons who<lb/>
asked for it &ldquo;Weir's Antiseptic Spray Apparatus,&rdquo; with antiseptic<lb/>
dressings. The new scientific <del hand="unknown_hand">medicicne</del> medicine was barely launched,<lb/>
but it was beginning to make headway.</p>
<p>Reed, scanning the few and belated medical journals that<lb/>
penetrated his wilderness, noticed and wondered about the daring<lb/>
new theories. Meanwhile, he faithfully attended to his post duties -<lb/>
sick call, inspection, hospital calls, professional visits out-<lb/>
side -practiced with increasing skill and knowledge, and cultivated<lb/>
his garden.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Modestly, because there was a lady present, the corporal<lb/>
stepped behind one of the supply wagons to take off his red flan-<lb/>
nel undershirt. He emerged in a moment holding it in his hand,<lb/>
his uniform jacket b<del hand="unknown_hand">e</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">u</add>ttoned over his bare chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Dr. Reed directed him, &ldquo;cut off a limb and tie<lb/>
your shirt to it by the arm<del hand="unknown_hand">y</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add>. As soon as the train comes in sight,<lb/>
start waving it.&rdquo; The corporal saluted and withdrew.</p>
<p>134.</p>
<pb n="135" id="f06114135"/>
<p>The paired steel ribbons before him stretched two thousand<lb/>
miles eastward, a thousand westward. Behind lay more than seven<lb/>
hundred miles of the roughest and loneliest country left in the<lb/>
United States. Reed, his three years of frontier duty finished,<lb/>
had been ordered to travel north from Camp Apache until he picked<lb/>
up the Union Pacific tracks west of Cheyenne. He was to flag the<lb/>
first train and identify himself to the engineer. The engineer<lb/>
on his next trip would bring out the doctor who was to return<lb/>
to Camp Apache in Reed's place with the wagon train; <del hand="unknown_hand">while</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">and</add> Reed<lb/>
and his family, in the expensive discomfort that distinguished<lb/>
railway travel in the early days, would return to civilization.</p>
<p>It sounded easy, but they had been twenty-seven days on<lb/>
their way -twenty-seven days over trackless territory unmarked by<lb/>
a single settlement. The ambulan<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">ce</add> and the four escort wagons -one<lb/>
with feed for the mules, one with the soldiers' baggage and provis-<lb/>
ions, two with the furniture they were able to bring out -had had<lb/>
to break their own trail. It was like all the rest of his wagon<lb/>
trips, only longer and tougher. Just as well that Lawrence, now a<lb/>
robust two year old, was a good soldier like his mother, Reed thought.</p>
<p>Lawrence's mother stepped out of the doherty wagon to join<lb/>
her husband who was thoughtfully heating a cup of shaving water by<lb/>
the camp fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawrence is asleep, I'm glad to say,&rdquo; she reported, &ldquo;and<lb/>
so is Susie.&rdquo; They were bringing the Indian girl back to civiliza-<lb/>
tion with them to train her, on government orders, as a household<lb/>
servant.</p>
<p>Reed turned to her with a rapt expression. His blue eyes<lb/>
had the look of one who sees a lovely vision. &ldquo;A hot bath,&rdquo; he said<lb/>
reverently. &ldquo;Just think! A hot bath all over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>135.</p>
<pb n="136" id="f06114136"/>
<p>The soldier by the track shouted and began to wave his<lb/>
improvised flag in wide arcs. (1)</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
<p>By 1881 Walter Reed was a captain and had a mustache. He<lb/>
had been in the United States Army for six years. He did not<lb/>
know when his original idea of leaving it had faded from his mind,<lb/>
but it was gone.</p>
<p>He had begun his Army career with a dutiful regard for the<lb/>
good name of the Medical Corps. That sentiment had expanded<lb/>
quietly into complete devotion to the service which, struggling<lb/>
against disadvantages, rose constantly above its limitations.</p>
<p>137.</p>
<pb n="138" id="f06114138"/>
<p>There were never enough medical officers to go around,<lb/>
so that civilian doctors had to be hired under contract to fill<lb/>
even the peace time needs. Overworked hospital stewards and<lb/>
bored privates continued to care for the sick. Post hospitals<lb/>
still were unequipped with modern facilities. Hidebound offi-<lb/>
cers sneered at bacteriology and antisepsis. The prospective<lb/>
retirement of Surgeon General Barnes had brought about an un-<lb/>
dignified scramble among the higher ranking men who hoped to<lb/>
succeed him.</p>
<p>There were, however, certain heartening advances. The<lb/>
use of antisepsis in surgical operations by post surgeons was no<lb/>
longer infrequent, although Lister was still being ridiculed in<lb/>
London. Some of the more alert officers had become interested<lb/>
in bacteriology and modern hygiene. In George Miller Sternberg<lb/>
the Medical Corps had an officer who was a bacteriologist of real<lb/>
distinction, one of the earliest and foremost in the country.<lb/>
There might be much to deplore in the Corps, but there were also<lb/>
many things to be proud of, and these sprang from the initiative<lb/>
and enterprise of men like Reed, who, by no means blind to its<lb/>
faults, were proud of its progress and eager for its improvement.</p>
<p>On his return from Arizona, Reed had been appointed a<lb/>
captain in June, 1880. After three months' leave of absence,<lb/>
which he spent in Virginia, he had been stationed that fall with<lb/>
the infantry at Fort Ontario, at Oswego, New York. The next March<lb/>
and April found him on duty at Fort<del hand="unknown_hand">h</del> McHenry, in the vicinity of<lb/>
Baltimore -and, incidentally, of Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>This university, <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">operating on a principle new in Amer-</add><lb/>
ican education, had been established in 1876. It was not,<lb/>
138.<lb/>
<pb n="139" id="f06114139"/>
like most American colleges, a school for the general education<lb/>
of undergraduates, but a center of learning, like the European<lb/>
universities, where advanced students trained for work in their<lb/>
chosen fields. Thomas Huxley, the famous English biologist and<lb/>
exponent of evolution, which was then widely regarded as a theory<lb/>
that could not be reconciled with religion, had spoken on biolog-<lb/>
ical research at the inaugural exercises, which had been held<lb/>
without the customary prayers or hymns. The <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">incident</add> had provoked<lb/>
a storm. &ldquo;It was bad enough to have asked Huxley. It were bet-<lb/>
ter to have asked God to be there. It would have been absurd<lb/>
to ask them both,&rdquo; wrote an indignant minister. The incident had<lb/>
also served notice that the new university was backing modern<lb/>
science.</p>
<p>During those two months early in 1881 Reed was briefly<lb/>
introduced, at first hand, to modern medicine. Dr. Newell Mar-<lb/>
tin, formerly an assistant of Huxley's, was the professor of<lb/>
physiology, and had established the first biological laboratory<lb/>
in the United States. Special students, not enrolled in courses,<lb/>
were sometimes given the privilege of attending lectures at the<lb/>
university, and it appears that Reed took advantage of this op-<lb/>
portunity to hear Martin lecture. There were not yet, in 1881,<lb/>
courses in pathology and bacteriology -they were to wait four<lb/>
years for the coming of Dr. William Henry Welch, whose student<lb/>
and friend Reed was to become -but interest in both subjects<lb/>
was <del hand="unknown_hand">keen</del> already keen. Conservative medical journals might still<lb/>
make game of Pasteur for seeing germs everywhere, but modern<lb/>
medicine had enthusiastic converts at the new university. It<lb/>
quickly made another of the young Army doctor who had <del hand="unknown_hand">spent most</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">been for</add><lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">of</del> the last five years <del hand="unknown_hand">on the frontier,</del> almost entirely out of<lb/>
139.<lb/>
<pb n="140" id="f06114140"/>
touch with scientific developments.</p>
<p>The time at Fort McHenry passed with exasperating quickness<lb/>
for the eager medical officer who was barely given time to glimpse<lb/>
the new scientific world opening before the explorations of re-<lb/>
search men. At the end of two months Reed was ordered to duty<lb/>
at the coast artillery post, Washington Barracks, at Washington,<lb/>
D. C. He must have felt like a starving man jerked unceremonious-<lb/>
ly away from an irresistibly appetizing meal.</p>
<p>The Reeds, however, found Washington an agreeable change<lb/>
from the lonely years on the frontier. They could go to the<lb/>
theatre, make short trips into Virginia and North Carolina to see<lb/>
their families or, on more limited excursions, walk about the city<lb/>
without sinking, as they once would have done, in mud to the ankle.<lb/>
&ldquo;Electric speaking telephones,&rdquo; although still rarities, had been<lb/>
in use for several years. The first electric light had just ap-<lb/>
peared in the city. Work was continuing on the huge and fussy<lb/>
pile of the State, War and Navy Building. <del hand="unknown_hand">And</del> The Washington Mon-<lb/>
ument was deliberately laboring upward. The city everywhere<lb/>
proudly flaunted signs of its progress, progress which was excit-<lb/>
ing to the officer and his wife so recently arrived from the west.<lb/>
Their most vivid memory of Washington, however, had nothing to do<lb/>
with its growth and the changing scene. It centered on July 2nd,<lb/>
1881.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was hot that morning, hot and clear. Reed, glanc-<lb/>
ing through the newspaper at breakfast, scanned the big headlines<lb/>
proclaiming Yale's crew had defeated Harvard's and noticed with<lb/>
more interest the statement in smaller type that the<lb/>
President's wife, Mrs. Garfield, was rapidly improving in health<lb/>
140.<lb/>
<pb n="141" id="f06114141"/>
and strength. Mrs. Reed remarked that weather like this made one<lb/>
appreciate Arizona, and Lawrence upset his glass of milk across<lb/>
the table.</p>
<p>At his mother's reproachful exclamation his lower lip<lb/>
turned out ominously, and his blue eyes floated in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, old man,&rdquo; Reed consoled him, hastily right-<lb/>
ing the glass and sopping up the flood with his napkin, &ldquo;this is<lb/>
one thing we never cry over. Co<del hand="unknown_hand">n</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">m</add>e on, smile now for Father, like<lb/>
a good fellow. Smile?&rdquo; Lawrence smiled, a little uncertainly,<lb/>
then laughed at the funny face his father made for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Dr. Reed, you'll spoil him to deat<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">h</add>,&rdquo; Mrs. Reed<lb/>
said smilingly and without conviction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's like his mother. He won't spoil,&rdquo; Reed said and w<del hand="unknown_hand">on</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">en</add>t<lb/>
back to his paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Garfield will probably not take action on the ex-<lb/>
pected retirement of Surgeon General Barnes and Paymaster General<lb/>
Brown until Congress meets,&rdquo; he read aloud. &ldquo;Barnes is a fine<lb/>
old gentleman,&rdquo; he commented, &ldquo;but it would be the best thing in<lb/>
the world for the Corps to have a man with modern training at<lb/>
its head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you think will be the next Surgeon General?&rdquo; Mrs.<lb/>
Reed wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, probably one of the old timers. Crane, maybe. He's<lb/>
been Barnes' office assistant for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You'd like to see Dr. S<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">t</add>ernberg get it, wouldn't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I would! Professionally he's the most eminent<lb/>
man in the Corps. But it's out of the question; too many out-<lb/>
rank him. Think what a clanking of brass hats there would be!<lb/>
Did I tell you that Sternberg has set up a biological laboratory<lb/>
141.<lb/>
<pb n="142" id="f06114142"/>
at his own expense at Fort Mason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed sighed. She suspected that her husband, after<lb/>
his brief Johns Hopkins experience, would like to do something<lb/>
of the sort himself. But it was one of the things -there were a<lb/>
great many -that you couldn't do on a captain's pay.</p>
<p>Reed folded the paper and took a final swallow of coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he remarked, getting up, &ldquo;I can't sit here and gos-<lb/>
sip with my charming wife and interesting son all morning. I work<lb/>
for a living, you know.&rdquo; A warm, quick <del hand="unknown_hand">smile,</del> smile that made his<lb/>
blue eyes sparkle, and he was gone.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed did not see him again until evening. By that time<lb/>
neither the newspapers or anyone else cared about the crew races<lb/>
or the Surgeon General. The shattering news of the attempt on<lb/>
the President's life had crowded all other matters from everyone's<lb/>
mind. He had been shot and gravely wounded in the Baltimore and<lb/>
Potomac railroad station as he was about to depart for New York.<lb/>
His assail<del hand="unknown_hand">i</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">a</add>nt had immediately been caught, and troops had been or-<lb/>
dered from the barracks to keep order.</p>
<p>Reed, when he returned, was tired and depressed. He had<lb/>
guarded the man, he said, at Police Headquarters before he was trans-<lb/>
ferred to the greater <del hand="unknown_hand">d</del> safety of the District Jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the President?&rdquo; Mrs. Reed questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a bad wound, so I was told,&rdquo; Reed answered. &ldquo;He may<lb/>
well die of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could have done such a senseless, wicked thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crack-pot. His name's Charles Guiteau. He's a little<lb/>
man with thin brown hair and sunken cheeks and gray eyes. When we<lb/>
got to Police Headquarters he was boasting that he had done it<lb/>
on inspiration from God for the good of the Republican party. He'<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">d</add><lb/>
142.<lb/>
<pb n="143" id="f06114143"/>
been trying to get some political appointment, and had been<lb/>
snubbed. He said the blood of French Revolutionaries ran in his<lb/>
veins, and made a number of other irresponsible remarks. He's<lb/>
simply unbalanced. He's afraid, &ldquo;Reed smiled faintly, &ldquo;that Nast&rdquo;<lb/>
-the popular cartoonist who had launched the Tweed Ring expos&eacute; -<lb/>
won't make a good likeness of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that the President of the United States may die be-<lb/>
cause a crank imagined a grievance against him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's frightful,&rdquo; Reed agreed wearily. He raised himself<lb/>
stiffly out of his chair and went to the door. &ldquo;I'll have to look<lb/>
in at the hospital for a few minutes. I haven't been there since<lb/>
early morning, and there are a couple of men I want to see a<del hand="unknown_hand">f</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">g</add>ain.<lb/>
Don't wait up for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President lingered manfully. General Sherman, granting<lb/>
an interview in his garden, tried to allay public anxiety. He<lb/>
expected the President to recover; his face didn't have &ldquo;a cer-<lb/>
tain death-like look.&rdquo; Everyone hoped the Civil War hero knew<lb/>
what he was talking about. Certainly he had seen enough dead men.<lb/>
Ungrammatical with emotion, he had added, &ldquo;The dreadful act was<lb/>
committed by a fool -he don't even rise to the dignity of a<lb/>
crazy man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For more than two months Washington lived in a crescendo<lb/>
of muted anxiety. Then the President was moved to the seaside.<lb/>
Two weeks later he was dead. Chester A. Arthur took the <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">oath</add> of<lb/>
office as President of the United States, and life in the capital<lb/>
clicked back to normal.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIV</head>
<p>So this time it was Nebraska. You could never tell<lb/>
where they'd send you next. I've never been to the northwest,<lb/>
Reed thought, and my southern blood chills at the idea of going<lb/>
there in mid-winter. It was November, 1882.</p>
<p>Omaha for a month, and then Fort Omaha, the infantry<lb/>
post near the city. A daughter, Emilie Lawrence Reed, was born<lb/>
there on July 12th, 1883.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks like a little angel,&rdquo; Reed exclaimed, touch-<lb/>
144.<lb/>
<pb n="145" id="f06114145"/>
ing the light down on her head with a finger that almost hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Reed! how you exaggerate!&rdquo; his wife teased him. &ldquo;Angel,<lb/>
indeed. She looks more like a little lobster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Angel, lobster -it's all the same thing,&rdquo; he said cheer-<lb/>
fully. &ldquo;I'm so glad it was a girl! I think I'm going to like<lb/>
her a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so? She is rather sweet, at that,&rdquo;<lb/>
Mrs. Reed said complacently.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>And then, in October, 1883, to Fort Sidney, an infantry<lb/>
post on the Union Pacific, over toward the western border of<lb/>
the state.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before the settlers for miles around found<lb/>
out: you could always call on the post doctor; he never failed<lb/>
the sick or distressed. He had been known to come out on a<lb/>
pressing call -these lonely people rarely sent for the doctor<lb/>
until it was an emergency -when he was so ill himself that he<lb/>
had to lie down on arriving and rest before seeing the patient.<lb/>
He made a sick person feel better the moment he came in the room.<lb/>
He joked and played with the children. The women, drab and stringy<lb/>
from overwork, were touched as much by the hint of chivalry in<lb/>
his manner toward them as by his painstaking care. A man might,<lb/>
at first sight, underestimate him for his thin mustache, his<lb/>
quick, slender figure and his quiet manner, but only at first<lb/>
glance. There was an endurance and courage in the Army doctor of<lb/>
which the toughest settler might have been proud.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The sturdy post horse wanted to turn his tail to the wind,<lb/>
heavy with biting snow, that whipped in his face, but his rider<lb/>
145.<lb/>
<pb n="146" id="f06114146"/>
forced him <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">on</add>. Snorting protest, he plodded ahead.</p>
<p>Reed was glad of the buffalo overcoat, and the cap with<lb/>
muskrat ear-flaps. A man could freeze solid in this sub-zero<lb/>
weather before he realized it, if he weren't well protected. The<lb/>
boy who had come on snowshoes to fetch him had cheeks and hands<lb/>
badly frostbitten. He had been most of the day covering the<lb/>
dozen miles that took only a couple of hours in less dreadful<lb/>
weather. He had begged to be allowed to start back with the doc-<lb/>
tor, but Reed had made him go to bed in the post hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've made a call on your mother before,&rdquo; he assured him.<lb/>
&ldquo;I know the way, and I'll take a steward with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fearful cold, and the sparkling white loneliness out<lb/>
here did something to people. The boy had been almost hysterical<lb/>
as well as exhausted when he floundered into the post. He'd be<lb/>
all right with a little rest, but sometimes, after a more severe<lb/>
ordeal by snow and silence, a man would come out crazy as -they<lb/>
had a word for it here -as a shitepoke, the big awkward heron<lb/>
that seemed to have no sense at all.</p>
<p>Reed and the steward pushed on through the whirling white-<lb/>
ness that muffled their vision. They had been out several hours,<lb/>
and it was getting dark. Both were anxious to reach the sick wo-<lb/>
man; their own safety was involved, too. People who got lost in<lb/>
a plains blizzard were usually found the next spring -when the<lb/>
circling buzzards drew attention to them. Reed recognized the<lb/>
danger, but did not dwell on it: it was just one of the chances<lb/>
you had to take.</p>
<p>This snow storm reminded him of the toy that the major's<lb/>
wife had brought back to little Emilie from the east. It was a<lb/>
hollow glass ball, holding a miniature snow-covered landscape,<lb/>
146.<lb/>
<pb n="147" id="f06114147"/>
across which three tiny figures made their way toward a little<lb/>
church with a pointed steeple. When you shook the ball the snow<lb/>
flew up and whirled about, obscuring for a few moments the people<lb/>
and the church, and then settled down leaving the little scene<lb/>
clear and serene again. Reed felt that he and the steward, like<lb/>
the little people at the center of the glass ball, were plodding<lb/>
through the whilring snowflakes at the heart if a shut-off world<lb/>
exclusively their own.</p>
<p>Then, thank heaven, they were no longer in a private world!<lb/>
There, peering dimly through the growing darkness, was a light!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ma's mighty bad,&rdquo; the settler said in a hoarse <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">whisper</add><lb/>
as he helped the cold, stiff doctor out of his overcoat, &ldquo;and<lb/>
fretting something terrible about Tom, gone to get you in this<lb/>
blizzard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward, who had carried in Reed's saddle-bags, was<lb/>
gathering pans full of snow to heat on the rickety stove.</p>
<p>Reed washed his hands and stepped over to the bed. Ma was,<lb/>
as her husband had said, mighty bad. Her face was gray, but she<lb/>
had made a pathetic effort to fix her hair, which was damp with<lb/>
sweat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Tom's a fine boy,&rdquo; Reed cheered her. &ldquo;He came<lb/>
through like a soldier, and he's snug in bed now. He certainly<lb/>
thinks the world of his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled wanly. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; Reed took her wrist and lightly<lb/>
felt the pulse, &ldquo;let's have a look at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hours later, numb with fatigue, he sat in a chair by the<lb/>
stove. The steward was asleep on the floor and the settler, hag-<lb/>
gard from another sleepless night, was making coffee. Ma was<lb/>
resting comfortably, and the baby had an excellent chance to<lb/>
147.<lb/>
<pb n="148" id="f06114148"/>
survive his hectic entrance into the world. One of the hardest<lb/>
deliveries I've ever handled, and I was fortunate to pull them<lb/>
both through, Reed thought gratefully. It wasn't just skill,<lb/>
either. That's never enough, by itself. It takes something extra.<lb/>
Some call it luck. Maybe, the minister's son speculated, God's<lb/>
help i<del hand="unknown_hand">n</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add> a better name for it.</p>
<p>Drowsily he watched the <del hand="unknown_hand">granger</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">settler</add> pour the coffee. The stew-<lb/>
ard smelt it and sat up. How on earth do these people stand the<lb/>
wracking, nerve-splitting loneliness of these winters? Reed won-<lb/>
dered. It had stopped snowing, and out the window through<lb/>
which the lantern had shone, the view was an unbroken white mono-<lb/>
tony. Inside, the only reading matter he could see was a few<lb/>
well-worn government panphlets on agriculture. Although <del hand="unknown_hand">he</del> tired<lb/>
to the point of exhaustion, he was burning to get back to the post-<lb/>
the post with its four companies of noisy young soldiers, the mil-<lb/>
itary band, the railroad station, his family and his journals -<lb/>
to escape the crushing white silence that lay like death all a-<lb/>
round this speck of a house.</p>
<p>The <del hand="unknown_hand">granger</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">settler</add> handed him his coffee and gave some to the sol-<lb/>
dier. This skinny young doctor was a real man, tough as a whip<lb/>
and not scared of weather. His wife was going to be all right, a<del hand="unknown_hand">m</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add>d<lb/>
he had a new son. He was feeling better now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said sociably, &ldquo;we sure do feel sorry for you<lb/>
young fellows shut up on the post all winter. It must get pow-<lb/>
erful lonely sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The soldier spluttered into his cup. Dr. Reed was not<lb/>
too tired to smile.</p>
<p>148.</p>
<pb n="149" id="f06114149"/>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In August, 1884, they packed up again, furnit<del hand="unknown_hand">y</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">u</add>re, dogs,<lb/>
two children and the Indian girl Susie, and traveled<lb/>
in a wagon train four days across Nebraska's panhandle to Fort<lb/>
Robinson.</p>
<p>It was toward sundown one day that fall that a wagon,<lb/>
moving at a cautious walk, pulled into the post. Swooning and<lb/>
swearing, the disheveled invalid with the fierce eyes was helped<lb/>
out by the driver and his companion and carried into the log hos-<lb/>
pital. Reed examined the crushed ankle, horribly discolored and<lb/>
swollen, and whistled softly. <del hand="unknown_hand">The man must have the courage and<lb/>
vitality of a tiger, he thought.</del></p>
<p>&ldquo;This injury has been neglected so long,&rdquo; he said,<lb/>
&ldquo;I'm very much afraid you will have to lose your foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The settler, his mind filmed with pain and opiates,<lb/>
clung savagely to consciousness long enough to promise the<lb/>
doctor in profane and broken English that he would kill him if he<lb/>
amputated. Reed believed him; those burning eyes didn't lie.</p>
<p>If he wanted to take a chance on dying with his foot on,<lb/>
rather than make sure of recovering with it off, Reed told him<lb/>
calmly, no one would interfere with his choice. He might even<lb/>
get well. The patient, dimly impressed by the quiet officer who<lb/>
yielded to his wish in ignoring his threat, went under the ether<lb/>
without further protest. Reed operated, removing the dead flesh<lb/>
and loose bone fragments. He put a drain through the joint,<lb/>
dressed the wound antiseptically and put it in a plaster of Paris<lb/>
splint. The hospital was full, so he had his patient settled com-<lb/>
fortably in a tent.</p>
<p>Later the same evening, Sturgeon and Scribner, who had<lb/>
149.<lb/>
<pb n="150" id="f06114150"/>
driven the injured man the seventy-five miles from his claim on<lb/>
Mirage Flats on the Niobrara River to the Army post, dropped in<lb/>
to see <del hand="unknown_hand">who</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">how</add> their friend Jules Sandoz had stood the operation.<lb/>
Bathed, shaved and clothed in a clean nightshirt, he was a very<lb/>
different looking person from the ragged and semi-delirious<lb/>
wild man they had carried in earlier. The doctor, who was<lb/>
with him, beckoned them outside. Their friend, he told them, was<lb/>
tough. He would probably recover, but he would be lame. He lis-<lb/>
tened while they explained that Jules had been injured in a fall<lb/>
down a forty-foot well <del hand="unknown_hand">jus</del> almost two weeks before. He was a<lb/>
stubborn fellow who had had part of a medical education before im-<lb/>
migrating from Switzerland; he had thought he could take care of<lb/>
the injury himself. They had tried to nurse him, then persuaded<lb/>
him to let them bring him to the post doctor. They had been two<lb/>
days on the road, walking the team every step of the way.</p>
<p>Then they said good night to the doctor. Afterwards,<lb/>
half way home, they wished that they had thought to ask him his<lb/>
name.</p>
<p>Jules, soon transferred to the post hospital, turned out<lb/>
to be a bright spot in Reed's winter. When he had time after<lb/>
dressing the ankle, he would stay with him to discuss politics,<lb/>
science, the shortcomings of American medical education and the<lb/>
possibilites and promise of this harsh and fertile territory<lb/>
about which Jules was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Only the most tenacious, like this Swiss immigrant, were<lb/>
equal to its challenge. Storms and blizzards swept fiercely over<lb/>
it. The sun, blazing like and evil eye, glared unwinkingly for<lb/>
weeks, and the rain, when it came, came too late and in floods.</p>
<p>150.</p>
<pb n="151" id="f06114151"/>
<p>Prairie fires swept the earth clean of pasturage and game. Horse-<lb/>
thieves and highwaymen hid in the broken hills to the north. Cat-<lb/>
tlemen tore up the government section markers, cut the settlers'<lb/>
fences, and sometimes shot them. The law was not highly regarded;<lb/>
nearly everyone adjusted his grievances personally. The ground,<lb/>
however, was fertile and the homesteaders <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">were</add> determined. Fighting the<lb/>
cattlemen, the elements and the land itself, <del hand="unknown_hand">they</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">men like Jules</add> were settling<lb/>
the country. Reed, too, saw a future in the forbidding country<lb/>
and remarkably, because an Army captain rarely had spare cash,<lb/>
invested in a town lot in Chadron, the settlement rising near the<lb/>
post.</p>
<p>Under Reed's careful treatment the infection in Jules'<lb/>
crushed ankle slowly <del hand="unknown_hand">dri</del> drained away, and by spring the settler<lb/>
was well enough to return to his deserted dugout on his claim at<lb/>
Mirage Flats. He was permanently lamed, but he knew enough medi-<lb/>
cine to realize that the post doctor had worked what was almost<lb/>
a miracle in saving his mangled foot.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Reed had been right when he thought he was going to<lb/>
like his new daughter. He adored her. They became inseparable<lb/>
companions. The dignified young doctor played games with her on<lb/>
the floor, held her on his lap to tell her stories and recite<lb/>
Mother Goose rhymes, gravely attended her kittens in their make-<lb/>
believe illnesses and took unfailing interest in her small world.<lb/>
&ldquo;Little daughter,&rdquo; he always called her. She had a different name<lb/>
for herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What's your name, little girl?&rdquo; an officer, seeing<lb/>
the doctor's small daughter playing in the yard, had asked her.</p>
<p>Twiddling a mangled flower, she had looked at him<lb/>
151.<lb/>
<pb n="152" id="f06114152"/>
without shyness, and he noticed how like Reed's her eyes were.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blossom,&rdquo; she informed him. The direct glance stopped him<lb/>
on the point of protesting that he knew better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he said helplessly. &ldquo;Blossom -that's a pretty name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed thought it was a pretty name, too. From that time on<lb/>
she was never called anything else.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The doctor who succeeded Reed at Fort Robinson in July, 1887,<lb/>
heard much about him from the soldiers and settlers. His warm<lb/>
smile, his blue eyes, his fine brown hair, his skill and kindness<lb/>
and studious habits, all became familiar by hearsay to Jefferson<lb/>
Randolph Kean. The little boy whom the librarian, Mr. Werten-<lb/>
baker, had mentioned to Reed while he was still a student at the<lb/>
University of Virginia had followed Reed, at a decade's distance,<lb/>
through the same school, like him had entered the Army and now was<lb/>
hearing, for the first time, of the man with whom he was to become<lb/>
so closely associated.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Alabama summers were hot, the winters mild, and spring<lb/>
came in, not with the noisy bursting of ice-locked streams as in<lb/>
Nebraska, but easily and softly as though it had no need to force<lb/>
its way in this congenial climate. Many of Reed's recollections<lb/>
of his three years from 1887 to 1890 at Mount Vernon Barracks, a<lb/>
small coast artillery post fifteen miles above Mobile, were pleas-<lb/>
ant ones.</p>
<p>He knew that his work in Nebraska was not forgotten when<lb/>
Jules sent him a handsome otter pelt which he had prepared himself.<lb/>
Pleased at being remembered, Reed sent the settler a small bag of<lb/>
tobacco with a five dollar bill, squeezed from his slim captain's<lb/>
152.<lb/>
<pb n="153" id="f06114153"/>
pay, tucked away in it.</p>
<p>He enjoyed his gardens, vegetable and flower, and espec-<lb/>
ially admired the splendid avenue of magnolia trees on which the<lb/>
line of officers' quarters faced. Mischieviously flaunting the<lb/>
<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">local</add> belief that whoever transplanted a magnolia tree that<lb/>
lived would have a death in his family within the year, he dug<lb/>
some out of the woods and set them out in the hospital yard. The<lb/>
trees lived, Reed's family flourished, nor was the vitality of<lb/>
the tradition impaired.</p>
<p>Reed was a medicine man once more, too. Geronimo and his<lb/>
Chiricahua Apaches, who had left San Carlos again in a flurry of<lb/>
murder and surrendered in the fall of 1886 to United States troops,<lb/>
were being held then as pri<del hand="unknown_hand">n</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add>oners of war at Mount Vernon Barracks.<lb/>
They lived, several hundred of them, in a teepee village flanking<lb/>
the post. Reed treated their sick -there was considerable bron-<lb/>
chial trouble among them -and Lawrence rode his pony with<lb/>
the Indian boys, swam with them in the Tombiggbee River<lb/>
three miles from the barracks, played Apache games and learned<lb/>
a little of their language. He even knew Geronimo and proudly<lb/>
pointed him out to visitors.</p>
<p>It was hard to believe that anyone had even been afraid<lb/>
of this tolid, wrinkled old man who, on Sundays and holidays,<lb/>
squatted quietly near the main entrance of the little artillery<lb/>
station and sold curious sightseers toy bows and arrows he had<lb/>
made during the week, and picture post cards of himself.<lb/>
Not long ago his name had been enough to spread panic in the<lb/>
scattered ranch houses on either side of the border, but now he<lb/>
was through with the war-path. He was old, and he was comfort-<lb/>
able, sitting in the sun and selling trinkets to awestruck white</p>
<p>153</p>
</div1>

<head>CHAPTER XV</head>

<p>The path to the future, however, was not yet clear. It<lb/>
must have been a deep disappointment to Reed when he was told<lb/>
not to spend any time on bacteriology, the promising branch of<lb/>
medicine that was throwing new light on the origin and spread<lb/>
of contagious diseases. Surgeon General Baxter had made it<lb/>
plain that he was permitted to study at Hopkins so that he could<lb/>
learn more about the treatment of sick and wounded soldiers, not<lb/>
155.<lb/>
<pb n="156" id="f06114156"/>
so that he could fiddle with a microscope. That there was any<lb/>
connection between the two activities apparently did not occur<lb/>
to the senior officer.</p>
<p>Then fortune, which had been with Reed only enough to<lb/>
tantalize him, came over to his side wholeheartedly. The new<lb/>
Surgeon General, Charles Sutherland, who was appointed on Bax-<lb/>
ter's sudden death, gave him permission to do laboratory work<lb/>
in bacteriology under Dr. William Henry Welch.</p>
<p>When Reed arrived in Baltimore in October, 1890, Johns<lb/>
Hopkins did not have a medical school. One of the investments<lb/>
of the thrifty Quaker who had given the institution his name and<lb/>
his fortune had turned out so badly that there were no funds<lb/>
for it yet. Graduate doctors, however, were coming from all<lb/>
over the country to work in the hospital and laboratories with<lb/>
William Osler, Howard A. Kelly, William S. Halstead and Welch,<lb/>
the &ldquo;Four Doctors&rdquo; of John Singer Sarge<del hand="unknown_hand">a</del>nt's well known painting.</p>
<p>Welch had established, in 1885, a laboratory which was<lb/>
already famous for the training it gave young men in pathology<lb/>
and bacteriology. Celebrated as the leading exponent of modern<lb/>
medicine in this country, Welch was only a year older than Reed.</p>
<p>He had gone about his medical education more slowly,<lb/>
taking his degree at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in<lb/>
New York in February, 1875, at the same time that Reed, crammed<lb/>
with facts and dates, was undergoing his grilling at the hands<lb/>
of the Army medical examining board. While Reed was doctoring<lb/>
the routine ills of hardy young soldiers on frontier posts, Welch<lb/>
was studying the new medicine in Germany, with the men who were<lb/>
contributing most to its brilliant advance. On his return to<lb/>
the United States he gave, at Bellevue Hospital Medical College,<lb/>
156.<lb/>
<pb n="157" id="f06114157"/>
the first laboratory course in pathology ever offered in an Amer-<lb/>
ican medical school. His growing reputation as a scientist and<lb/>
teacher induced the trustees of Johns Hopkins University, who were<lb/>
gradually collecting a medical faculty, to invite him to teach<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">and</del> pathology and bacteriology. Welch, who loved research and<lb/>
detested the prospect of practicing for a living, eagerly accepted,<lb/>
and began his long and influential career at Hopkins in the fall<lb/>
of 1885.</p>
<p>Plump, bright-eyed, <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">baldish</add> and bewhiskered, at the age<lb/>
of forty he was already moving in the aura of greatness that was<lb/>
to grow steadily <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">stronger</add> for the rest of his life. His students<lb/>
<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">regarded</add> him with a sort of affectionate awe, and called him Popsy<lb/>
behind his back. All of them, including Reed, were well fitted<lb/>
to his novel method of teaching which was based on the belief that<lb/>
medical students in this country were over-taught, directed and<lb/>
guided until their self-reliance was stifled. Popsy would de-<lb/>
liver the lecture in bacteriology or pathology three times a week<lb/>
and demonstrate<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del> the subject of it at the microscope; or, if he<lb/>
felt like it, he would fail to appear and leave the session to<lb/>
his assistant. Students selected their own special problems for<lb/>
study without advice from him. With his long cigar<lb/>
tilted at an angle and his rounded waistcoat sprinkled<lb/>
with ash, he would go among them at the end of the demonstration,<lb/>
encouraging and suggesting, and then proceed to his own micro-<lb/>
scope and the work that currently held his interest.</p>
<p>Reed, from the first moment, loved the Pathological, as<lb/>
Welch's laboratory was called. It was full of alert young men,<lb/>
enthusiastically investigating problems in the new fields of<lb/>
bacteriology and pathology, who discussed, experimented and<del hand="unknown_hand">jo</del><lb/>
joked together endlessly. The scientific curiosity<lb/>
157.<lb/>
<pb n="158" id="f06114158"/>
and the friendliness that gave the atmosphere its tone made it<lb/>
the most stimulating place in which he had ever worked.</p>
<p>The work table in the Pathological extended under the<lb/>
windows along three sides of the room. Each student had his own<lb/>
space on it, where he kept his microscope, slides, notebook and<lb/>
other <del hand="unknown_hand">working</del> materials. Reed was assigned a space at the end<lb/>
of the table next to a soft-spoken young doctor from Louisville,<lb/>
Simon Flexner. Absorbed in his work, Flexner at first scarcely<lb/>
noticed the Army man working next to him; the only effect of his<lb/>
arrival was to prevent him from spreading out as freely as he had<lb/>
done before. One day Reed came into the laboratory and found<lb/>
Flexner working at his microscope, with his materials, as usual,<lb/>
spilling over unnoticed into the next space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, doctor,&rdquo; Reed observed smilingly, as he sat down<lb/>
at the tiny space left, &ldquo;you'll soo<del hand="unknown_hand">m</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add> have me clear off the<lb/>
end, won't you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deeply a<del hand="unknown_hand">g</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">b</add>ashed, the younger man started to apologize for<lb/>
his thoughtlessness. &ldquo;I'm so sorry,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I hadn't<lb/>
realized.....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing the laughter in Reed's eyes, he began to smile, too.<lb/>
He decided he liked this friendly newcomer.</p>
<p>A sort of family feeling, based on enthusiasm for their<lb/>
work and admiration of Welch, prevailed among the laboratory<lb/>
workers. Reed was soon accepted cordially into the intimate<lb/>
circle of the students and their teacher, all of whom were quick<lb/>
to respond to his charm and to recognize his ability.</p>
<p>Welch, urbane, kindly and aloof, paid little per-<lb/>
sonal attention to any student until he had given evidence of<lb/>
ability. It was not long, however, <del hand="unknown_hand">unti</del> before he became inter-<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">ested</del><lb/>
158.<lb/>
<pb n="159" id="f06114159"/>
ested in the Army doctor who, in spite of his belated introduction<lb/>
to pathology and bacteriology, was already showing marked<lb/>
aptitude for the work. Reed and Welch probably liked the same<lb/>
things in each other: the dignity which, while friendly and pleas-<lb/>
ant, forbade familiarity; the scholarly and inquiring attitude of<lb/>
mind; the scientific enthusiasm and the personal graciousness.<lb/>
The two doctors became cordial friends.</p>
<p>Reed's military duties took little time, and he worked in<lb/>
the laboratory early and late, searching far beyond class require-<lb/>
ments and eagerly learning his way around the fascinating new<lb/>
world that had so nearly escaped him. He learned to recognize the<lb/>
murderers of the microscopic world, the slender motionless bacil-<lb/>
lus that causes diphtheria, the rod-shaped <hi rend="italic">tubercle bacillus</hi>, the<lb/>
comma-shaped germ of the Asiatic cholera whose ravages he had a<lb/>
few times seen in New York, and the other villains invisible to<lb/>
the naked eye.</p>
<p>As soon as he became familiar with the new technical methods,<lb/>
he began to do independent work. Anxious to make up for his late<lb/>
start, he haunted autopsies to obtain pathological material to<lb/>
study. On these occasions he often saw Osler, and became friendly<lb/>
with this beloved and brilliant man who was known to the younger<lb/>
doctors as &ldquo;The Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osler was working on malaria at the time. Welch was inves-<lb/>
tigating both hog-cholera with Dr. A. W. Clement, a veterinarian,<lb/>
and diphtheria, the anti-toxin for which had just been discovered,<lb/>
with Alexander C. Abbott, one of his students. Reed followed<lb/>
these investigations as well as his own. During the winter, too,<lb/>
he probably attended the lectures in which Welch, in his logical<lb/>
and lucid way, covered the entire subject of diphtheria. He reg-<lb/>
159.<lb/>
<pb n="160" id="f06114160"/>
ularly went to the weekly meetings of the hospital medical so-<lb/>
ciety and to the monthly ones of its medical historical society.<lb/>
Reed knew his time at Hopkins was to be short, and he wanted to<lb/>
squeeze every possible advantage out of it.</p>
<p>His work was interrupted just before Christmas when he<lb/>
was ordered<del hand="unknown_hand">, to Blossom's inconsolable grief,</del> to Fort Keogh, Mon-<lb/>
tana, for a short time. When he returned to Baltimore toward<lb/>
the end of January, he was grateful for the friendliness and co-<lb/>
operation of his fellow-workers: Flexner and William T. Howard,<lb/>
another of Welch's young men, during his absence had mounted for<lb/>
him pathological specimen<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del>s which they thought he might want to<lb/>
study.</p>
<p>Reed usually had lunch with his new friends at the &ldquo;Church&rdquo;<lb/>
-it somehow sounded better, if you were a serious scientific man,<lb/>
to say you'd be at the &ldquo;Church&rdquo; than at the tavern -across the<lb/>
street from the hospital.<lb/>
In the private dining room which the proprietor<lb/>
kept for the laboratory doctors they could have beer for five<lb/>
cents a schooner, and a lunch of wild duck, or sea food in season,<lb/>
or sandwiches for a quarter, and enjoy an hour's relaxation. The<lb/>
younger men would urge the Army doctor to tell about post life,<lb/>
and he would tell of his adventures as cook and medicine man, or<lb/>
of the hardships of travel by doherty wagon or horseback in sub-<lb/>
zero weather, or of the discomforts and boredom of garrison life.<lb/>
In the companionship of these friendly, enthusiastic young scien-<lb/>
tific workers, it all seemed very remote, so distant and so <del hand="unknown_hand">dif-</del><lb/>
different from this congenial new life where modern medicine was<lb/>
taken for granted, and where the desire to study it was regarded<lb/>
160<lb/>
<pb n="161" id="f06114161"/>
as the mark of a reasonable being, not an eccentric.</p>
<p>In the late afternnon when Schutz, Welch's laboratory helper,<lb/>
seemed about to sweep him out, Reed would leave the laboratory<lb/>
and walk down the hill from the hospital to the boarding house<lb/>
where he was living with Mrs. Reed and Blossom. The apartment<lb/>
seemed almost empty now, with Lawrence in school at Bedford, where<lb/>
Reed himself had lived as a child, and Susie gone, too. The In-<lb/>
dian girl who had lived with them for the last dozen years,<lb/>
helping with the housework and sewing, had stayed with the Apaches<lb/>
at Mount Vernon Barracks to teach them English. (The Reeds, inci-<lb/>
dentally, never saw her again, since she went with her people to<lb/>
Fort Sill, Oklahoma, and died there about 1902.) Blossom was the<lb/>
only juvenile member of the household. &ldquo;Little daughter,&rdquo;<lb/>
now seven years old, took up most of her adoring father's spare<lb/>
time.</p>
<p>In the evenings Reed would sometimes go to a concert with<lb/>
his wife, or, more frequently, to one of the medical meetings.<lb/>
Usually, though, he <del hand="unknown_hand">had work to do, and</del> looked up articles in the<lb/>
medical journals in the hospital library, or studied German so that<lb/>
he could follow the work being done by German scientists.</p>
<p>Although Reed did not join the younger doctors in their<lb/>
Saturday night poker games, he occasionally had dinner with Popsy,<lb/>
whose good food, good wine and good conversation were memor-<lb/>
able. On summer afternoons he would sometimes leave his work to<lb/>
go with Welch or Flexner or Councilman, Welch's assistant, to the<lb/>
ball game. Baltimore at that time had occasion to be very proud<lb/>
of its Orioles, and Welch was an enthusiastic fan. Shortly before<lb/>
the game he was likely to appear at the laboratory door, his<lb/>
161.<lb/>
<pb n="162" id="f06114162"/>
small bright eyes twinkling, the inevitable cigar cocked in his<lb/>
mouth, and coax them away from their microscopes. He rarely had<lb/>
to use persuasion. Few people could resist the prospect of<lb/>
spending the afternoon with Popsy, whether at <del hand="unknown_hand">the</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">a</add> ball game or<lb/>
an autopsy.</p>
<p>By May, Reed knew enough to undertake his first big<lb/>
piece of scientific investigation. He had noticed in autopsies<lb/>
that victims of typhoid fever had tiny nodules, or lumps, in the<lb/>
lymph glands of the liver. Under Welch's supervision, he under-<lb/>
took to study these nodules. As he worked tirelessly over his<lb/>
problem, it probably never occurred to him that the<lb/>
few months' scientific training he was then receiving were to turn<lb/>
him from a competent, obscure Amry doctor into a scientific in-<lb/>
vestigator who would solve one of the gravest health problems that<lb/>
had ever bedevilled the public and baffled the medical profession.<lb/>
But he did know that his old sense of dissatisfaction, the feel-<lb/>
ing of being left behind, was gone for good. He had had to wait<lb/>
until his fortieth year, but now he was learning something beyond<lb/>
the mere treatment of diseases; he was beginning to understand a<lb/>
little about the organisms causing disease, and to think in terms<lb/>
of prevention rather than of cure.</p>
<p>His summer's work was broken into several times by<lb/>
military duties that called him away from Baltimore. Each time<lb/>
he reluctantly laid aside his investigation, confident, however,<lb/>
that one of the other men, <del hand="unknown_hand">or</del> perhaps Welch himself, would carry<lb/>
on his animal experiments for him. In June he went to West Point<lb/>
to give <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">physical</add> examinations to candidates for the Military Academy<lb/>
and members of the graduating class. Lawrence was already talking<lb/>
about becoming a soldier. Reed examined the fit and intelligent<lb/>
162.<lb/>
<pb n="163" id="f06114163"/>
boys who appeared before his board with special sympathy, <del hand="unknown_hand">and in-<lb/>
terest,</del> for he hoped that his son, too, would qualify to enter<lb/>
the Academy.</p>
<p>Then he had to go to Washington as a member of another<lb/>
board; and in October to New York, to sit on the board examining<lb/>
Medical Corps aspirants. More than sixteen years separated the<lb/>
young Health Inspector, anxiously approaching the fateful exam-<lb/>
ination, from the medical officer in the blue dress uniform sitting<lb/>
in judgement on a new generation of nervous candidates, but Reed<lb/>
could still remember his alarm and depression. He hoped<lb/>
these poor fellows were not feeling like that, or, if they were,<lb/>
that they would be able to look back sixteen years hence and feel,<lb/>
like him, that it had been worth it.</p>
<p>In spite of interruptions, however, he managed to complete<lb/>
his typhoid fever study. By November, when he had to leave for<lb/>
his new post at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, he had produced the<lb/>
little lumps experimentally in laboratory animals, and had demon-<lb/>
strated that they originated as small groups of dead liver cells.</p>
<p>Reed was confident now that he had found the work to<lb/>
which he could enthusiastically devote the rest of his life.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVI</head>

<p>Reed's new talents had little opportunity to expand in<lb/>
his ten month's at Fort Snelling, nor were they particularly ap-<lb/>
preciated. His Commanding Officer, in a routine report, remarked<lb/>
that his character and attention to duty were excellent, his sci-<lb/>
entific attainments &ldquo;nothing special,&rdquo; and his prominent talents<lb/>
&ldquo;none.&rdquo; If Reed had known, it would probably have cause him<lb/>
rueful amusement, and no surprise at all. How could a colonel of<lb/>
164.<lb/>
<pb n="165" id="f06114165"/>
the line be expected to judge the scientific qualifications of his<lb/>
medical officers? How should he know the difference between a<lb/>
horse doctor and a bacteriologist?</p>
<p>The indifference of the line officers notwithstan-<lb/>
ding, the Medical Corps was beginning to win a little renown for<lb/>
the bacteriological work of some of its members. Sternberg's ex-<lb/>
cellent text book on the subject, the first ever written in the<lb/>
United States, appeared in 1892. <del hand="unknown_hand">reflecting credit on the<lb/>
service.</del> Reed drew favorable attention in interested circles with<lb/>
his first paper, published in March of the same year in the Boston<lb/>
Medical and Surgical Journal, on the contagiousness of erysipelas.<lb/>
Some of the more enlightened intelligences of the line, as well as<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">in</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">of</add> the Medical Corps, were beginning to get the idea that, since<lb/>
sickness regularly took heavier toll of an army in the field<lb/>
than enemy action, the Medical <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">C</add>orps was important, especially in<lb/>
preventive work.</p>
<p>As Reed went about his old routine -sick call, visits to<lb/>
officers' families, hospital work, -he wondered when he would be<lb/>
able to go back to bacteriology. As he regretfully wrote to Stern-<lb/>
berg, his regular duties left him time only for &ldquo;dabbling&rdquo; in his<lb/>
favorite field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only Sternberg would be appointed to succeed Suther-<lb/>
land when he retires for age!&rdquo; he exclaimed longingly to his wife.<lb/>
&ldquo;Then I'd get the opportunity to do the work I'm really keen about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he will be,&rdquo; she encouraged him. &ldquo;Let's keep our<lb/>
fingers crossed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed's transfer to the staff of General Wesley Merritt in<lb/>
St. Paul, in August, 1892, was welcome: a city was always better<lb/>
165.<lb/>
<pb n="166" id="f06114166"/>
than a garrison, especially from his wife's point of view, and<lb/>
they could have their son with them again. With the boy atten-<lb/>
ding St. Paul High School, Reed thought, maybe he could keep an<lb/>
eye on his work, which he was inclined to neglect.</p>
<p>As attending surgeon and examiner of recruits on Merritt's<lb/>
staff, Reed had an opportunity to appreciate the general's ad-<lb/>
vanced opinion, entirely sympathetic to his own, that one of the<lb/>
Medical <del hand="unknown_hand">Corp's</del> Corps' most important functions should be the pre-<lb/>
vention of disease among the troops. He was reminded, as well,<lb/>
how far behind him now, how almost forgotten, was the civil con-<lb/>
flict that had dominated his childhood and youth. Merritt, a<lb/>
Union officer then, had had a share in the devastation of the<lb/>
Shenandoah Valley. Now the Yankee general and the Virginia doc-<lb/>
tor, ignoring the old enmity, were loyally serving their country<lb/>
together.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was the evening of March 28th, 1893. The meeting of<lb/>
the Ramsey County Medical Society was breaking up, and the young<lb/>
high school teacher standing on the edge of the group around the<lb/>
Army doctor had <del hand="unknown_hand">an opportunity</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">a chance</add> to get a good look at him. He<lb/>
saw a man in his early forties, erect and slender and a little a-<lb/>
bove medium height. Mr. Wilson liked his quick, animated manner,<lb/>
and the courteous attentiveness with which he was listening to<lb/>
Dr. Millar, dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School.<lb/>
His bearing suggested that, although he was known as an excellent<lb/>
bacteriologist and a fine doctor, he was also a modest man. He<lb/>
had attended the meeting as a guest speaker to talk on the chol-<lb/>
era germ, the fatal comma-shaped bacillus which was just then<lb/>
166.<lb/>
<pb n="167" id="f06114167"/>
savagely flourishing in Hamburg and neighboring German cities.</p>
<p>The medical officer, his face lighting with a quick smile,<lb/>
made some remark which the teacher on the edge of the circle did<lb/>
not catch. Laughter followed it, and as the group shifted a little<lb/>
Wilson moved closer and caught Dr. Millard's eye. Beckoning him<lb/>
forward, Millard presented him to Reed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Reed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'd like you to meet Louis Wilson,<lb/>
one of our medical students. He teaches biology at the Central<lb/>
High, and has a laboratory there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed, the smile still lingering around his blue eyes, turned<lb/>
eagerly to Wilson. &ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; he exclaimed as he shook hands<lb/>
with him, &ldquo;do you really have a laboratory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. It's nothing elaborate, though. But for a high<lb/>
school lab it isn't bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should see mine -all I have is a few test tubes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you'd care to come over and have a look at mine....&rdquo;<lb/>
Wilson suggested diffidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When may I come?&rdquo; Reed asked promptly. &ldquo;Tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they said good night, it would have been hard to tell<lb/>
which was the more elated: the student at having the opportunity<lb/>
to work with the medical officer who knew about bacteriology, or<lb/>
the doctor at the prospect of again getting into a laboratory.</p>
<p>It was a good thing for Reed and Wilson that Central High<lb/>
decided to discontinue its domestic science department. They<lb/>
were able to salvage from it a couple of gas ovens and some boilers<lb/>
and make them into fairly effective bacteriological apparatus.<lb/>
Reed spent most of the time he could spare from his regular duties<lb/>
helping to fix up the laboratory and working in it.</p>
<p>167.</p>
<pb n="168" id="f06114168"/>
<p>Diphtheria had always interested him. Now he heard that<lb/>
a New York physician, Dr. William H. Park, had begun to diagnose<lb/>
it from cultures made from swabs of patients' throats. If the cul-<lb/>
ture, examined under a microscope, showed the diphtheria bacill<del hand="unknown_hand">y</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">u</add>s,<lb/>
he at once knew that the patient had diphtheria.<del hand="unknown_hand">.</del> If the culture<lb/>
was free of the bacillus, he knew that he was dealing with some-<lb/>
thing else. The method eliminated the danger of mistaking the<lb/>
serious disease for less grave types of croup which it resembled<lb/>
in its earlier stages. Reed and Wilson obtained from Dr. Park a<lb/>
sample of his apparatus, which consisted simply of a small box and<lb/>
two test tubes, one containing a sterile swab and the other a cul-<lb/>
ture medium in which diphtheria germs would grow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice, <del hand="unknown_hand">simlet</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">simple</add> little outfit,&rdquo; Reed observed as he ex-<lb/>
amined it. &ldquo;What do you think, Wilson, about getting some our-<lb/>
selves and asking the local doctors to send us swabs when they<lb/>
suspect <del hand="unknown_hand">somethi</del> diphtheria?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a good idea doctor, I'm sure a number of them<lb/>
would do it. We can have the box factory make us up some of<lb/>
these little boxes. It oughtn't to cost much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it won't. It will have to come out of our own<lb/>
pockets, since it's neither Army nor school work,&rdquo; Reed remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let's try to squeeze out a hundred,&rdquo; Wilson suggested.<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">"That oughtn't to cost us too much.</del> &ldquo;I'm very keen to do it. I<lb/>
don't suppose it's been done outside of New York, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men scraped the bottoms of their pockets -Reed<lb/>
had recently sold his lot at Crawford, Nebraska, so he had a little<lb/>
spare money -and ordered a hundred boxes. Together they worked<lb/>
over the diphtheria study off and on during most of the summer.<lb/>
168.<lb/>
<pb n="169" id="f06114169"/>
As he instructed his first student in the elements of bacteriol-<lb/>
ogy, Reed felt the deep satisfaction of introducing a promising<lb/>
young man into the field for which he himself felt such enthusi-<lb/>
asm. Investigating and teaching others to investigate, that was<lb/>
what he would like to do, he thought. That was the really radi-<lb/>
cal way to attack disease. Learn to prevent it, and you would<lb/>
never have to cure it.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Reed wanted to toss his hat in the air. At last,<lb/>
at last, it had happened! George Miller Sternberg was Surgeon<lb/>
General, appointed late in May, 1893, to succeed General Suth-<lb/>
erland! It was significant of the changing atmosphere, the grow-<lb/>
ing appreciation of modern scientific medicine, that President<lb/>
Cleveland had selected not an able executive, not a man adroit<lb/>
in departmental politics, not merely a good doctor, but the one<lb/>
man in the Corps with a distinguished reputation as a scientist.<lb/>
The fossil age, Reed jubilantly declared, was past.</p>
<p>One of the new Surgeon General's first official acts<lb/>
was to establish the Army Medical School, improvising it, with a<lb/>
wary eye on a Congress already exercised over the current finan-<lb/>
cial panic, in such a way as to add nothing to the expenses of<lb/>
the Army's medical department. Its classrooms were in the buil-<lb/>
ding which already housed the Army Medical Museum and the Surgeon<lb/>
General's Library, and medical officers composed the faculty.<lb/>
Sternberg, who admired and liked Reed, appointed him professor of<lb/>
clinical and sanitary microscopy and curator of the museum, which<lb/>
already had all the materials for bacteriological and chemical<lb/>
study that the new school would need, <del hand="unknown_hand">for laboratory use.</del> John<lb/>
169.<lb/>
<pb n="170" id="f06114170"/>
Shaw Billings, librarian of the Surgeon General's Library and a<lb/>
man of enormous influence in the medical world, became professor<lb/>
of military hygiene, and Sternberg, although not a member of the<lb/>
faculty, lectured on bacteriology.</p>
<p>Reed, summoned to Washington from St. Paul to be examined<lb/>
for promotion to major, appeared on September 6th, 1893, at the<lb/>
red bric<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">k</add> building backing on the Mall where he was to spend most<lb/>
of the short remainder of his life. In response to his examiners'<lb/>
questions, he discussed typhoid, pneumonia, tuberculosis, gunshot<lb/>
wounds, antisepsis and malaria to their full satisfaction. Three<lb/>
days later he was pronounced &ldquo;physically and professionally fit<lb/>
for promotion.&rdquo; In December, after he had returned to take up his<lb/>
new duties in Washington, he was advanced to the rank of major.</p>
<p>The Washington to which Reed and his family returned<lb/>
after a dozen years' absen<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">c</add>e was a city of more than two hundred<lb/>
thousand people. Grover Cleveland, the only Democrat to win the<lb/>
presidency since the Civil War, was presiding for the second time<lb/>
over the White House, and, somewhat more uneasily, over the nation-<lb/>
al destiny. The Washington Monument, completed in 1884, was a well-<lb/>
established landmark. Sturdy little mules pulled the street<lb/>
cars along the shaded avenues. A few of those mechanical wonders,<lb/>
the electric trolleys, had invaded the streets and, propelled as<lb/>
if by magic, suggested to the far-seeing that horse cars might be<lb/>
on their way out. Electric lights and telephones were almost<lb/>
commonplace. The State, War and Navy Building, squatting massive<lb/>
and ornate beside the simple presidential residence, was finished<lb/>
at last. The city had elegant mansions built like Italian palaces<lb/>
and French chateau<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">x</add> along its wide avenues. There were good res-<lb/>
taurants, good hotels, and a half dozen theatres which tempted<lb/>
170.<lb/>
<pb n="171" id="f06114171"/>
the delighted public with such stellar lures as Lillian Russell,<lb/>
Henry Irving, Sarah Bernhardt and Lily Langtry. The capital was<lb/>
taking its national dignity seriously.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed unpacked their much-traveled household goods<lb/>
for what seemed the hundredth time, with positive elation. They<lb/>
were settling in Washington! No more ugly officers' quarters, no<lb/>
more frontier inconveniences -for a while, anyway. This was civ-<lb/>
ilization. She thought she could never get enough of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Reed,&rdquo; she threatened her husband playfully, &ldquo;if you<lb/>
ever go west of the Mississippi again, you're going alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed laughed reassuringly. &ldquo;Well, my dear, I don't think<lb/>
you need worry about that for a while. We'll be here for a few<lb/>
years. Anyway, I've just about done my share of frontier duty.<lb/>
That's for the younger fellows. For that matter, there's not much<lb/>
frontier left any more, the way the country's being settled. And<lb/>
travel so much easier, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed's expression was reminiscent. &ldquo;It was fun, though.<lb/>
Remember what heavenly duck you could roast in those little Dutch<lb/>
ovens that we always carried in the doherty wagons -the ones you<lb/>
set over coals and stacked coals on top of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmmmmm,&rdquo; Reed agreed appreciatively. &ldquo;Travel by doherty<lb/>
wagon had advantages, like game en route, but I think I prefer<lb/>
the iron horse now. I'm not the valiant frontiersman I was fif-<lb/>
teen years ago. Now I'm an aging medical officer who's had his<lb/>
fill of the west and the Indians and the rest of the trimmings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed smiled at him. It wasn't that he was<lb/>
tired of adventure, she knew that. The adventurous spirit that<lb/>
had filtered through generations from his earliest American <del hand="unknown_hand">an-</del><lb/>
171.<lb/>
<pb n="172" id="f06114172"/>
forebears to the little boy mooning over his geography in Mrs.<lb/>
Booker's one room school was still strong in the doctor to whom<lb/>
&ldquo;the west and the Indians and the rest of the trimmings&rdquo; were<lb/>
now an old story. It was simply that he had discovered a new<lb/>
and more exciting frontier in the world of bacteriology.</p>
<p>172.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVII</head>
<p>Time was gliding past, Reed realized with a slight sense<lb/>
of surprise, and he, as he advanced into his fifth decade, was<lb/>
settling slowly into a middle age of inconspicuous usefulness.<lb/>
After twenty years of active practice, he could now devote him-<lb/>
self to the teaching and investigating that appealed to him so<lb/>
strongly.</p>
<p>It was natural that the first thing he should do was<lb/>
renew his contacts with his friends at Johns Hopkins. He and<lb/>
173.<lb/>
<pb n="174" id="f06114174"/>
his assistant, Dr. James Carroll, who had also been trained in<lb/>
Welch's laboratory, made frequent trips to Baltimore to keep<lb/>
in touch with the work carried on there, and to attend medical<lb/>
meetings. <del hand="unknown_hand">The long delayed medical school had been opened in the<lb/>
fall of 1893 with eighteen students -three of them women, to the<lb/>
disquietude of the modest bachelor, Dr. Welch -and Reed followed<lb/>
all the affairs of the new school with interest.</del></p>
<p>Hopkins doctors often came to the capital, too, for med-<lb/>
ical meetings and to consult the Surgeon General's Library which,<lb/>
under the direction of John Shaw Billings, had already attained<lb/>
the position it still holds as the most complete medical library<lb/>
in the United States. With Sternberg, Billings, Reed and Carroll<lb/>
all in Washington, the link between Hopkins and the Medical Corps<lb/>
was close.</p>
<p>Reed, lecturing to the rising generation of medical of-<lb/>
ficers and directing them in their laboratory work, may sometimes<lb/>
have thought of his old schoolmaster's query: &ldquo;What mind was<lb/>
ever lighted up or warmed by that which was dark and cold?&rdquo; He<lb/>
war turning out to be a teacher patterned on Mr. Abbot's ideal,<lb/>
with an enthusiasm for his subject<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del> that his students found con-<lb/>
tagious, and such intimate knowledge of it that it seemed to be<lb/>
part of himself.</p>
<p>A straight man with a drooping mustache, a little heav-<lb/>
ier now but still slender, and with the slight frown of concen-<lb/>
tration habitually fixed on his face as though he were always<lb/>
thinking ahead of his words, he would stand before his class and<lb/>
discuss his complicated subject with a clarity that almost com-<lb/>
pelled understanding. Peering through a microscope, he would ex-<lb/>
plain what was there to some bewildered novice and kindly, with<lb/>
a few words, take the trouble to dispel his discouragement. He<lb/>
174.<lb/>
<pb n="175" id="f06114175"/>
won, quite without design, as many devotees for himself by his<lb/>
courteous patience as he did for bacteriology by his lucid pre-<lb/>
sentations. Young Dr. Leonard Wood, arriving in Washington in<lb/>
1885 after a tour of duty in the west, was one of Reed's enthus-<lb/>
iastic students.</p>
<p>His assistant, Carroll, was devoted to him, and Reed<lb/>
felt warm respect for the quiet, retiring man who worked with<lb/>
him so ably. Born in England in 1854, Carroll had come to Can-<lb/>
ada as a boy, and, at the age of twenty, enlisted in the United<lb/>
States Army. He became interested in medicine and while still a<lb/>
soldier in the newly-formed Hospital Corps won his medical degree<lb/>
at the University of Maryland. After his work in Welch's labor-<lb/>
atory, he was attached in 1893 to the Army Medical School as<lb/>
Reed's assistant. He had a wife and a family of small children.<lb/>
Reed could appreciate what a long, uphill grind it must have<lb/>
been for him to reach his modest eminence, and what sacrifice<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">and devotion</del> must have gone into the achievement.</p>
<p>Reed loved his new life. &ldquo;You can accomplish so much<lb/>
more good for so many more people by training other men in mod-<lb/>
ern medicine,&rdquo; he answered when Mrs. Reed asked him if he missed<lb/>
practicing. &ldquo;And that's what counts with me. I might be able<lb/>
to save ten children strangling with diphtheria, but if I teach<lb/>
ten men to use antitoxin, they can save a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Training his students in modern ways and coverting<lb/>
established practitioners to new methods presented two different<lb/>
problems, Reed found. The use of diphtheria anti<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">-</add>toxin was an<lb/>
example. Loeffler had discovered the specific germ, and his<lb/>
find had been widely confirmed by independent workers. Then<lb/>
175.<lb/>
<pb n="176" id="f06114176"/>
the French scientist Roux, like the German von Behring, had immun-<lb/>
ized horses to diphtheria toxin and produced the anti<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">-</add>toxin that<lb/>
both prevents and cures. When Roux read his paper at the Inter-<lb/>
national Congress on Hygiene at Budapest in 1894, the scientists<lb/>
listening to him in the stuffy classroom of the old university had<lb/>
jumped shouting on their seats and tossed their hats into the air.<lb/>
Hat tossing, however, was not general throughout the profession.<lb/>
Although laboratories all over Europe, America and Japan promptly<lb/>
began to produce anti<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">-</add>toxin, a number of doctors remained uncon-<lb/>
vinced.</p>
<p>When the District of Columbia Medical Society met in<lb/>
December, 1894, a doctor of wide reputation assailed a paper<lb/>
supporting the use of the anti<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">-</add>toxin. He was not unfriendly to the<lb/>
new remedy, he said, but based his criticisms on the statistics<lb/>
and arguments of others, not on his own experience. Reed entered<lb/>
the <del hand="unknown_hand">argument</del> discussion. He had never regretted the long period<lb/>
he had spent in general practice before getting into his specialty.<lb/>
Now it enabled him to speak not only as a laboratory man but as<lb/>
a practitioner of experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are theorizing,&rdquo; he got to his feet and earnestly, al-<lb/>
most sternly, addressed the other doctor. &ldquo;We are dealing with<lb/>
facts. If another friend of anti<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">-</add>toxin arises and deals it such a<lb/>
blow, the anti<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">-</add>toxin serum will be murdered in the house of its<lb/>
friends. I myself almost feel like saying that the failure to<lb/>
use it in a case of human diphtheria is criminal; and I beg you,&rdquo;<lb/>
he added urgently, &ldquo;that, if you have not yet done so, when you<lb/>
next stand by the bedside of your patient afflicted with this<lb/>
disease, you do not withhold this invaluable remedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strong word, criminal; but his seriousness, backed by<lb/>
176.<lb/>
<pb n="177" id="f06114177"/>
his high standing, impressed the meeting so deeply that the value<lb/>
of the anti<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">-</add>toxin was not again questioned in that society.</p>
<p>Sternberg's routine reports sounded nothing like the one<lb/>
his Commanding Officer at Fort Snelling had written in 1892. So<lb/>
far as the limitations of the standard government form allowed,<lb/>
they were glowing. In his heavy, sprawling writing, the Surgeon<lb/>
General yearly wrote the almost monotonous praise: excellent char-<lb/>
acter and professional qualifications, excellent control over the<lb/>
men under him, highly skilled bacteriologist, a valuable man in<lb/>
his work. Sternberg, dwelling on distant official heights in the<lb/>
State, War and Navy Building and occupied with executive duties<lb/>
that left him no time for the research he loved, no doubt wist-<lb/>
fully envied his subordin<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">at</add>e.</p>
<p>There was no lack in these years of the stimulating con-<lb/>
tacts which Reed had missed on the frontier. In the spring of<lb/>
1895 he was appointed a delegate from the Medical Corps to <del hand="unknown_hand">attend</del><lb/>
the annual meeting of the American Medical Association in Balti-<lb/>
more. Later the same season, Welch and Osler came to Washington<lb/>
for the meeting of the Association of American Physicians at<lb/>
which Welch, analysing the world literature on diphtheria anti-<lb/>
toxin, asserted that it was &ldquo;a specific curative agent for diph-<lb/>
theria, surpassing in its efficacy all other known methods of<lb/>
treatment.&rdquo; How it must have gratified Reed to hear him express<lb/>
the opinion he had so forcibly stated himself: &ldquo;It is the duty of<lb/>
the physician to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By no means through with the subject of anti<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">-</add>toxin now<lb/>
that its &ldquo;friends&rdquo; were no longer likely to slaughter it, Reed<lb/>
told the District Medical Society that its manufacture should be<lb/>
177.<lb/>
<pb n="178" id="f06114178"/>
under municipal control to prevent the production of contam-<lb/>
inated serum by careless or unscrupulous individuals.</p>
<p>He was busier than ever before in his life. Not only did<lb/>
he teach at the Army and Columbian University Medical Schools,<lb/>
serve on examining boards, attend medical meetings, consult with<lb/>
other doctors when his specialized knowledge was needed, but he<lb/>
worked in his laboratory on croupous pneumonia,<lb/>
erysipelas, abdominal typhus, malaria and other subjects, and<lb/>
published his observations in scientific journals.</p>
<p>For a time he was even busier than necessary, trying to keep<lb/>
up with the overwhelming supply of white rats <del hand="unknown_hand">which</del> sent him by<lb/>
his nephew Walter, Tom's son. Reed had seen Walter on a visit to<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">Ashland</del> his sister Laura in Ashland in the summer of 1894. The<lb/>
enterprising boy, learning that his uncle used white rats in his<lb/>
experiments, undertook to supply them. He went about it with such<lb/>
energy that the laboratory was swamped. Reed, unable to <del hand="unknown_hand">keep up</del><lb/>
think of enough experiments to use them up, had to write his name-<lb/>
sake to cease shipment.</p>
<p>He left the house in Georgetown, at Number 5 Cooke Place,<lb/>
early in the morning to take the horse car to the museum. When<lb/>
he came back in the late afternoon Blossom, his favorite companion,<lb/>
would meet him at the corner where he got off. She was el<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>ven years<lb/>
old now, and went to school at Gunston Hall in Washington. Law-<lb/>
rence was in high school. He was a tall, good looking fellow more<lb/>
addicted to sports than to study, and usually was off playing<lb/>
ball when his father came home. If the children and the friends<lb/>
waylaid him as he came up the street, he would stand by the<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">ir</add> gate<lb/>
with them for a few minutes, laughing and joking. His wife,<lb/>
watching from the porch, thought how youthful he looked, with his<lb/>
178.<lb/>
<pb n="179" id="f06114179"/>
thick brown hair, straight figure and quick movements. The en-<lb/>
gaging young man -sweet-natured, happy, deeply in earnest about<lb/>
his responsibility to the sick -with whom she had so promptly<lb/>
fallen in love twenty years before, existed almost unchanged -a<lb/>
little graver, a little more serene, perhaps -in the middle-aged<lb/>
doctor.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Lawrence's special admiration were the Blackford<lb/>
girls, three sisters who lived across the street. They had a<lb/>
pair of smooth-haired fox terriers with the good Virginia names<lb/>
of Shirley and Carter. The jaunty little dogs were favorites<lb/>
through the neighborhood, and it was a widely lamented calamity<lb/>
when Shirley, rushing to hurl insults at a passing horse car,<lb/>
skidded and had his left hind foot badly mangled under a wheel.<lb/>
His tearful mistresses hurried him to the veterinarian who am-<lb/>
putated the crushed paw.</p>
<p>Reed, on his way home one afternoon, waved to Blossom<lb/>
and the three young girls <del hand="unknown_hand">who, followed by their</del> who were approach-<lb/>
ing down the street. They crossed over to meet him with Carter<lb/>
jumping at their heels and Shirley hobbling behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Shirley,&rdquo; Reed bent to pat the small, sleek<lb/>
head, &ldquo;I haven't seen you since your operation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor darling, he's quite wretched about it still,&rdquo;<lb/>
Lily said.</p>
<p>Reed whistled as he caught sight of the amputation.<lb/>
&ldquo;No wonder! Poor old fellow,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, Major Reed, doesn't it look right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed was stooping beside the little dog who, trustful<lb/>
179.<lb/>
<pb n="180" id="f06114180"/>
and troubled, let him examine the injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won't heal properly like this, Miss Lily,&rdquo; he explained.<lb/>
&ldquo;That end of bone ought to come off.&rdquo; He paused a moment, rubbing<lb/>
the dog's ear and thinking: the examining board in the morning,<lb/>
laboratory all afternoon -Carroll can take care of that for a<lb/>
while -I can manage it. &ldquo;I'll tell you what you do -bring him<lb/>
to me tomorrow afternoon at the laboratory, and I'll fix him up<lb/>
so it won't bother him any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling under the ecstatic barrage of thanks, Reed waved<lb/>
the sisters goodbye from the gate and went up the walk, his arm<lb/>
through Blossom's.</p>
<p>Landon followed him with her eyes, exclaiming, &ldquo;Isn't that<lb/>
the sweetest thing you've ever heard of! Shirley, you're a lucky<lb/>
dog!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How's my patient?&rdquo; Reed greeted Lily and Shirley the next<lb/>
afternoon when they appeared at the laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's calm, thank you,&rdquo; Lily told him. &ldquo;He has the great-<lb/>
est confidence in his new doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I'll try to justify it. Come along in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lily watched the doctor's adroit, gentle hands with admir-<lb/>
ation. He was one of the busiest medical officers in the Army,<lb/>
and he took the time, personally, to operate on an <del hand="unknown_hand">u</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">i</add>njured dog.<lb/>
Shirley lay quiet under ether while Reed worked. The protruding<lb/>
bit of bone was off now, a flap of skin tucked over the end and a<lb/>
neat bandage adjusted over the wound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! That oughtn't to trouble him any more, as soon<lb/>
as it heals,&rdquo; Reed remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can't think you enough, Mjor Reed,&rdquo; Lily faltered, as<lb/>
180.<lb/>
<pb n="181" id="f06114181"/>
he showed her, with that attentive courtesy she and her sisters<lb/>
found so charming, to the door. &ldquo;When you're so busy, to go to<lb/>
this trouble...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed dismissed the thanks with his quick smile. &ldquo;Not at<lb/>
all, my dear. We couldn't have Shirley an invalid for the rest<lb/>
of his life, could we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shirley, it may be added here, was from then on almost as<lb/>
good as new. He quickly learned to run, dodge and throw himself<lb/>
into reverse with one hind leg as well as he had with two, and<lb/>
he lived, with Carter, to a hale and rowdy old age.</p>
<p>** * *</p>
<p>The little stea<del hand="unknown_hand">r</del>mer ran from the mainland to Key West<lb/>
three times a week, carrying passengers, mail, food and some-<lb/>
times water. Waiting on the pier as the few passengers debarked,<lb/>
Dr. Jefferson Randolph Kean scanned them for the medical officer<lb/>
from Washington. Kean, although he had never seen him, recognized<lb/>
him at once, and smiled to notice how closely his appearance cor-<lb/>
responded with descriptions of him he had heard ten years before<lb/>
at Fort Robinson. The mustache was heavier and he was unprepared<lb/>
for the blueness of the eyes, but he could have picked him out of<lb/>
a much larger crowd than this.</p>
<p>Sitting in the evenings on the veranda of Kean's quarters<lb/>
at Key West Barracks, the <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">two</add> officers and Mrs. Kean, her dress<lb/>
a pale graceful blur in the dark, talked, or fell into the sil-<lb/>
ences which congenial people do not fear. Reed was enjoying his<lb/>
stay at Key West so much, he told them, that this detail was<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">equivalent to</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">as good as</add> a holiday.</p>
<p>He had been sent toward the end of July, 1896, by the Sur-<lb/>
geon General to investigate an epidemic of small pox at Key West,<lb/>
181.<lb/>
<pb n="182" id="f06114182"/>
to see if he could find in the blood of those actually suffering<lb/>
with the disease the same microscopic, one-celled body which he<lb/>
had found in the laboratory in the blood of children<lb/>
and monkeys inoculated against it.</p>
<p>The results of the study were negative, but everything<lb/>
else about his two weeks on Key West was successful. A large<lb/>
part of each day he spent at the Army hospital making microscopic<lb/>
examinations of blood. In the late afternoons he enjoyed play-<lb/>
ing with the Kean's baby -&ldquo;that dear little girl,&rdquo; he called her -<lb/>
and demonstrating to her admiring parents that, although he had<lb/>
had little practice in the last ten years, he could still soothe<lb/>
a fit of weeping with enviable skill. He even learned to eat<lb/>
mangoes, to the amusement of the Keans, with no more than a little<lb/>
distaste for their slight turpentine flavor. But the pleasantest<lb/>
thing of all about the trip was the friendship it developed with<lb/>
Kean, a cultivated and delightful man who, like Reed, was a pro-<lb/>
duct of Mr. Abbot's preparatory school and Mr. Jefferson's Univer-<lb/>
sity.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Back in Washington again, Reed was busy, as usual. He<lb/>
occasionally saw Welch, who came to the capital to combat, success-<lb/>
fully, the anti-vivisection legislation then pending, and other<lb/>
Hopkins friends who came down on various errands. In May, 1897,<lb/>
Kean and his wife, on their way to Fort Warren, Boston, stopped<lb/>
for a few days at Number 5 Cooke Place. Laboratory in-<lb/>
vestigations, classes, examining boards filled his time. In the<lb/>
evenings he taught at Columbian University (now George Washington),<lb/>
or read or wrote or studied Italian, which he was learning so that<lb/>
182.<lb/>
<pb n="183" id="f06114183"/>
he could follow the work on malaria then being done in Italy. Oc-<lb/>
casionally he, with his wife, dined with the Sternbergs or some<lb/>
other friends, or went to the theatre. The children were growing<lb/>
up: Lawrence was almost twenty, Blossom fourteen. Reed himself<lb/>
was close to fifty.</p>
<p>The quiet, obscure years were running out. As if to put<lb/>
a period to their passing, Reed's father died shortly before<lb/>
Christmas, 1897, in Farmville, the little Appomattox town where<lb/>
the minister's family had lived forty years earlier. He was an<lb/>
old man, and he left behind him the pleasant memory of a useful<lb/>
and unselfish life -such a memory as his youngest son hoped would<lb/>
survive him at the close of a life of unfaltering service to the<lb/>
sick and <del hand="unknown_hand">the</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">to</add> science. It would be enough to know<del hand="unknown_hand">n</del> that he in his<lb/>
field, like Pa in his, had been able to accomplish some little<lb/>
good for humanity.</p>
<p>The eclipse of this humble ambition by the brilliant<lb/>
climax of his career was an event which no premonition suggested<lb/>
to the Army doctor. It threw no shadow before it, but now his<lb/>
fame was almost upon him.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>
<p>History, of course, had not been standing still during<lb/>
the years that Walter Reed was unwittingly treading the path to<lb/>
fame. Since the Civil War the United States had undergone great<lb/>
changes, the greatest of which were the passing of the frontier<lb/>
and the country's shift from a primarily farming to a primarily<lb/>
manufacturing economy.</p>
<p>By 1898 the last of the Indian outbreaks was eight years<lb/>
behind us, and the fearful Geronimo was soon to join the Dutch<lb/>
Reformed Church. The Union proudly numbered forty-five states.<lb/>
184.<lb/>
<pb n="185" id="f06114185"/>
The population had doubled. Tourists and traveling salesmen<lb/>
could go by rail almost anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>Manufacturers were making more and more goods for home<lb/>
consumption and for export abroad, and our new industrial economy<lb/>
was giving the country new wealth, new power, new horizons. Our<lb/>
interest in foreign affairs, already whetted by our need for over-<lb/>
seas markets, was suddenly riveted to them by the outbreak of the<lb/>
Spanish-American War early in 1898.</p>
<p>We had been wrangling with Spain off and on for some<lb/>
years about her island Cuba, which was just then in a state of<lb/>
armed revolt against the aged and feeble monarchy. After the<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">United States Ship Maine</hi> was blown up in Havana harbor on Feb-<lb/>
ruary 15th, 1898, the wrangling stopped and the fighting began.<lb/>
War was declared on April 25th. Thousands of enthusiastic young<lb/>
men hurried to enlist.</p>
<p>Lawrence Reed was one of them. He had been out of school<lb/>
almost two years, working for a local coal company. He still<lb/>
wanted to go into the A<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">R</add>my, but had failed to obtain an appoint-<lb/>
ment to West Point. There were, at that time, two ways of getting<lb/>
a commission besides being graduated from the Military Academy.<lb/>
One was to enlist, and after two years' service take the examin-<lb/>
ation for a second lieutenancy. The other was to be designated<lb/>
as a civilian by the War Department to take the examination.<lb/>
Someone, however, had to recommend you to the War Department be-<lb/>
fore it would select you as a candidate. Lawrence's employer,<lb/>
Mr. Parke Agnew, was a friend of President McKinley's. He thought<lb/>
a great deal of his young employee and asked him if he would like<lb/>
to have a letter from McKinley recommending him for the examination.<lb/>
185.<lb/>
<pb n="186" id="f06114186"/>
Lawrence, naturally, could have liked nothing better. When the<lb/>
letter came, he hurried downtown to file it at the War Department.<lb/>
Unfortunately, there were so many young men who wanted<lb/>
to take the examination, and so many genial political gentlemen<lb/>
who recommended them, that the War Department was flooded with<lb/>
their letters. It therefore announced that no recommendations<lb/>
would be considered except those having a red line under the as-<lb/>
pirant's name. Mr. Agnew again applied to the President and ob-<lb/>
tained another letter, this one with Walter Lawrence Reed clearly<lb/>
underscored in red. Lawrence filed it at the War Department, too,<lb/>
and waited for the announcement of the list of lucky men who<lb/>
would be permitted to compete. In due course it was published.<lb/>
His name was not there.</p>
<p>This called for explanation. The President himself had<lb/>
recommended him, and he wanted to know why he had been passed<lb/>
over. He decided to find out.</p>
<p>The horse car let him off near the State, War and<lb/>
Navy Building and he ran up the wide flight of steps into the<lb/>
building. It was a beehive these early June days. Elderly clerks<lb/>
who looked as though they had been under wraps since the Civil War<lb/>
scuttled nimbly through the corridors. Voices murmured and rose<lb/>
in the offices. Doors slammed, footsteps were brisk, official<lb/>
brows knit. Lawrence went to the fifth floor to see the clerk<lb/>
with whom he had left his letter.</p>
<p>An elderly man, he had a mouth hedged about with gray<lb/>
whiskers, and mild eyes protected by spectacles. When Lawrence<lb/>
explained his errand, he looked stricken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just a mistake, Mr. Reed,&rdquo; he said miserably,<lb/>
&ldquo;A most unfortunate oversight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>186.</p>
<pb n="187" id="f06114187"/>
<p>&ldquo;Can't it be corrected now, sir?&rdquo; Lawrence wanted to know.<lb/>
&ldquo;I'm pretty anxious to try for a commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it could be,&rdquo; the old man admitted reluctantly,<lb/>
&ldquo;if you want to bad enough. If you care to take the matter higher<lb/>
up, you can probably get on the list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what's wrong with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I suppose. Except that it would put this office<lb/>
in a very bad light, make trouble for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. It seems to have been my fault. But you go<lb/>
ahead if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lawrence looked at him and noted his mild, weak eyes, his<lb/>
clerical stoop, his shiny coat. You couldn't get a poor old fel-<lb/>
low like this in trouble, he thought wretchedly, it would be in-<lb/>
human. There went his chance for a commission, but there wasn't<lb/>
any choice that he could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, then,&rdquo; he said gruffly. &ldquo;Let's forget it. Good-<lb/>
bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, son!&rdquo; The relief in the old <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">gentleman's</add><lb/>
voice was almost touching. &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm going down to Washington Barracks and enlist! I'll<lb/>
earn my commission!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later, hot and flushed, Lawrence arrived at the<lb/>
Army Medical Museum and went to his father's office. Reed looked<lb/>
up from his work in surprise -it wasn't like his son to pay un-<lb/>
expected calls at the laboratory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Lawrence. What brings you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; Lawrence came abruptly to the point, &ldquo;will you<lb/>
give me your permission to enlist? I've just been to the bar-<lb/>
racks, and Dr. de Schon turned me down because I'm not twenty-one.<lb/>
187<lb/>
<pb n="188" id="f06114188"/>
I need your permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why do you want to enlist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to earn a commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed got up slowly and eyed the tall young man. In words his<lb/>
son never forgot, he inquired, &ldquo;Young man, if the President of the<lb/>
United States would accord you the unusual privilege of selecting<lb/>
your own examining board, do you think that you could find three<lb/>
officers who would pass you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reproachful query conjured up the guilty memory of neg-<lb/>
lected studies and mediocre marks. His father questioned his a-<lb/>
bility to earn a commission, Lawrence realized with a pang. If he<lb/>
answered no, his father would withhold permission. He would have<lb/>
to say yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Father,&rdquo; he answered steadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Lawrence,&rdquo; Reed agreed quietly. &ldquo;I'll give you<lb/>
a note with my permission. You can take it back to de Schon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The United States Army in June, 1898, accepted Walter Law-<lb/>
rence Reed as a buck private. When he retired from it forty-two<lb/>
years later, he had risen to the rank of major general. Events<lb/>
had not justified his father's misgivings.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">W</add>ith the war in progress, disease, the United States quickly<lb/>
found, was a far<del hand="unknown_hand">m</del> more dangerous enemy than Spain. Fewer than<lb/>
sixteen hundred American soldiers stopped bullets in the<lb/>
whole course of the fighting, but the mortality from <del hand="unknown_hand">sickn</del> illness<lb/>
was frightful. Everybody seemed to get sick in the camps. Malaria,<lb/>
typhoid, dysentery ravaged the untrained, ill-equipped troops hast-<lb/>
ily assembled with almost no sanitary precautions in the big<lb/>
training camps in the United States. As the death rate climb<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del>ed<lb/>
188.<lb/>
<pb n="189" id="f06114189"/>
steadily through the hot summer of 1898, and the Army's under-<lb/>
staffed, under-equipped medical department struggled stoutly to<lb/>
keep up with its duties, the costliness of the penny-pinching<lb/>
policies applied to the Corps for so many years became glaringly<lb/>
apparent.</p>
<p>In the financial panic four years earlier Congress, un-<lb/>
impressed with the increasing prestige and scope of the Medical<lb/>
Corps and eyeing the War Department's budget with an axe in its<lb/>
ready hand, had lopped fifteen doctors from its already inadequate<lb/>
staff, reducing it to a hundred and ten. At the same time it had<lb/>
prohibited the employment of contract doctors. In spite of this<lb/>
treatment, the Corps had pro<del hand="unknown_hand">f</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">g</add>ressed under Sternberg. So that of-<lb/>
ficers could keep up with current medical developments, important<lb/>
new literature was regularly sent to them, and the use of the Sur-<lb/>
geon General's Library was extended to them by mail and express.<lb/>
Modern equipment, including laboratory apparatus and operating<lb/>
rooms, had been installed in post hospitals; and a training school<lb/>
for the Hospital Corps, as well as the Army Medical School, had<lb/>
been established. Sternberg's personal eminence had been emphasized<lb/>
by his election to the presidency of the American Medical Associa-<lb/>
tion in 1897.</p>
<p>Faced by war, Congress hastily restored the fifteen of-<lb/>
ficers to the Corps, again authorized the employment of contract<lb/>
surgeons, and set aside the absurdly inadequate sum of twenty<lb/>
thousand dollars, out of a war budget of <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> millions, for use<lb/>
in safeguarding the health of an army suddenly expanded to<lb/>
ten times its normal size. Short-handed, without reserve sup-<lb/>
plies and <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">nearly</add> penniless, the Medical Corps was almost<lb/>
hopelessly handicapped at the start.</p>
<p>189.</p>
<pb n="190" id="f06114190"/>
<p><del hand="unknown_hand">Teh</del> The campaigns of the <del hand="unknown_hand">Sapnish</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">Spanish</add>-American War were fought<lb/>
in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Phil<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del>i<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">p</add>pines during May, June,<lb/>
July and the first week of August, 1898. At the close of the war,<lb/>
however, the men assembled in training camps were not immediately<lb/>
disbanded for fear that they would spread their diseases all over<lb/>
the country. Early in the war Reed had been anxious to get a re-<lb/>
sponsible position in the field where his knowledge of Army routine<lb/>
and methods of sanitation would be useful. Too often, however,<lb/>
the important medical commands were given by authorities who<lb/>
should have known better to civilian doctors who, however<del hand="unknown_hand">,</del> patri-<lb/>
otic and professionally capable, knew nothing of military procedure<lb/>
and lacked training in camp sanitation.</p>
<p>Swallowing his chagrin, Reed had remained at his teaching<lb/>
post. It was not until mid-August -the war was already over -<lb/>
that he had an opportunity for valuable service. Then, with<lb/>
Dr. Victor C. Vaughan and Dr. Edward O. Shakespeare, both eminent<lb/>
sanitarians and majors of volunteers, he was appointed to a board<lb/>
to investigate the causes of the typhoid epidemics that prevailed<lb/>
in almost every camp.</p>
<p>By that time everybody had to admit, however reluctantly,<lb/>
that there was some typhoid, although the diagnosis of malaria,<lb/>
or even acute indigestion, was greatly preferred wherever it could<lb/>
decently be made. There was little inclination among the medical<lb/>
officers to irritate the public, already angry over the inefficient<lb/>
management of the whole war, with the news that a dangerous disease<lb/>
was epidemic among the soldiers.</p>
<p>All three board members were thoroughly familiar with<lb/>
the current view of typhoid. It was generally believed that it<lb/>
190.<lb/>
<pb n="191" id="f06114191"/>
was caused by a specific germ, Eberth's bacillus, and was spread<lb/>
by contaminated drinking water. It was not known to be transmitted<lb/>
by any other agency, although flies were suspected. It could be<lb/>
diagnosed by a laboratory process known as Widal's test, and, at<lb/>
autopsy, recognized by certain pathological findings. It <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">could</add><lb/>
also, on the basis of its symptoms, easily be confused with mal-<lb/>
aria, but malaria <del hand="unknown_hand">itslef</del> itself could be identified by the finding<lb/>
of the malarial plasmodium in the blood on microscopic examination.<lb/>
Given the proper equipment and a doctor who could make Widal's<lb/>
test and recognize the plasmodium, there was no excuse on earth<lb/>
for confusing the two diseases. There were still, however, few<lb/>
medical men in the country so trained, and the Army board found,<lb/>
on arriving at Camp Alger in nearby Virginia on the morning of<lb/>
August 20th, that there was not a microscope in the camp.</p>
<p>By the end of their first day's work, all three men real-<lb/>
ized that the first thing to do was to get a scientific diagnosis<lb/>
of the fever. The camp doctors insisted that it was malaria. The<lb/>
three inspectors were sure it was typhoid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Major Reed,&rdquo; one of the doctors handed him a sheaf of<lb/>
temperature charts, &ldquo;look at the temperature curves. In each case<lb/>
it's a typical malarial curve, up, down, up, down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed glanced through them. The curve was, undoubtedly, un-<lb/>
like the characteristically steady fever of typhoid victims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmmmmmm,&rdquo; he said non-committally. &ldquo;By the way, have you<lb/>
done any autopsies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Autopsies? And have the papers all over us? There's<lb/>
enough public clamor without increasing it by doing autopsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the doherty wagon on the way back to Washington Reed re-<lb/>
marked, &ldquo;Those fever charts, up and down like an intermittent fe-<lb/>
191.<lb/>
<pb n="192" id="f06114192"/>
ver -I wonder if they suggest the same thing to you that they do<lb/>
to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shakespeare smiled. &ldquo;I guess so, doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's typhoid, all right,&rdquo; Vaughan agreed, &ldquo;in disguise.<lb/>
They're administering drugs to reduce the fever, so of course it<lb/>
goes down. Then when the drug wear off, up it mounts again. The<lb/>
action of the drug gives the steady fever, typhoid, the appear-<lb/>
ance of the intermittent one, malaria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's the way I see it, too,&rdquo; Reed concurred. &ldquo;However,<lb/>
Widal's and the microscope will settle it for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did. Each one of the hundred cases at Camp Alger<lb/>
which the board believed to be typhoid, and the camp doctors thought<lb/>
was malaria, turned out on laboratory analysis to be typhoid.<lb/>
Would it be the same at the rest of the camps? the board wondered.<lb/>
They immediately requested the Surgeon General to establish a diag-<lb/>
nostic laboratory at each large camp; he agreed to do so, and they<lb/>
left Washington for further investigation.</p>
<p>Traveling in the private car lent them by the Southern<lb/>
Railroad, the three doctors, accompanied by a good chef, an atten-<lb/>
tive porter and a secretary, arrived early in September at Jack-<lb/>
sonville, Florida, where the Seventh Army Corps was encamped under<lb/>
the command of Fitzhugh Lee, a nephew of Robert E. Lee's and him-<lb/>
self a Confederate veteran.</p>
<p>The medical officers at Jacksonville, like those at Alger,<lb/>
were sure they were dealing with malaria. Typhoid was a water-<lb/>
borne disease -<hi rend="italic">everybody</hi> knew that -they reminded the board.<lb/>
Their water supply, from deep artesian wells, was unquestionably<lb/>
pure.</p>
<p>There was no good debating, the <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">three</add> doctors saw. It was<lb/>
192.<lb/>
<pb n="193" id="f06114193"/>
proof that was needed, not argument. They requested the medical<lb/>
officers to select two hundred &ldquo;malaria&rdquo; cases, and sent them in<lb/>
hospital trains to the Army diagnostic laboratory run by Carroll<lb/>
at Fort Myer, near Washington, and to leading hospitals in Balti-<lb/>
more, Boston and other cities. Every single case was pronounced<lb/>
typhoid. The camp doctors were convinced. They had to be.</p>
<p>The thing &ldquo;everybody knew,&rdquo; that typhoid was due to bad<lb/>
water, did not explain this epidemic. In scientific research,<lb/>
Reed knew, you could take nothing for granted -least of all the<lb/>
things &ldquo;everybody knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since water was not causing the epidemic, what was? Reed and<lb/>
his colleagues, trained observers, looked around. They had already<lb/>
been struck by the bad sanitary conditions at the camp. Could they<lb/>
be responsible?</p>
<p>A large tent camp had, naturally, no bathrooms with running<lb/>
water. At Jacksonville the latrines were at regular intervals<lb/>
cleaned and the contents carted away by scavengers. This disagree-<lb/>
able labor, the board noted, was often carelessly performed, so<lb/>
that some of the filth spilled in the roads, dried and mingled with<lb/>
the dust, was tracked throughout the camp and blown about by the<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">widn</del> wind. Flies swarmed on it, then flew to the camp kitchens and<lb/>
mess halls and lighted on the food. The regiments having the poor-<lb/>
est disposal methods also had the highest proportion of typhoid.<lb/>
This certainly suggested, the board members agreed, that both wind<lb/>
and flies might be carrying Eberth's <del hand="unknown_hand">bacill</del> vicious little germ<lb/>
from victim to victim.</p>
<p>If it could be spread by wind and flies, why not by con-<lb/>
tact with soiled clothes and bedding, even by the touch of a dirty<lb/>
hand? Wasn't it possible that the men were spreading the bacillus<lb/>
directly from one to another by what the board called &ldquo;comrade in-<lb/>
193.<lb/>
<pb n="194" id="f06114194"/>
fection&rdquo;? It seemed quite likely that they were.</p>
<p>Now, the investigators felt, they were getting somewhere:<lb/>
the fever was certainly typhoid; just as certainly, it was not<lb/>
being carried by water; there was reason to think that wind and<lb/>
flies and comrade infection were spreading it. The thing to do,<lb/>
plainly, was to attack the possible cause, filth, and see if that<lb/>
did any good.</p>
<p>The board began to inspect the regiments, their camping<lb/>
grounds, kitchens, tents and latrines. It had, of course, no en-<lb/>
forcement power, but it could make emphatic recommendations. When<lb/>
they came to the Third Nebraska, of which William Jennings Bryan<lb/>
was colonel, the doctors presented their credentials and in-<lb/>
vited the commander to join them in the inspection of his regi-<lb/>
ment. All had been bad; the Third Nebraska was no exception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Bryan,&rdquo; Reed addressed him with his disarming<lb/>
smile, &ldquo;Vaughan and Shakespeare are on this commission because they<lb/>
know about camp sanitation. I am on it because I can damn a col-<lb/>
onel.&rdquo; He proceeded to lecture the astonished orator sternly on<lb/>
the duty of a Commanding Officer to care for the health and clean-<lb/>
liness of his troops.</p>
<p>The episode, Reed supposed, was closed. If only these civ-<lb/>
ilians, suddenly blooming in uniforms, could be made to understand<lb/>
the importance of sanitary measures in military life! It would be<lb/>
worth all the unpleasantness, all the hurt feelings. No one of<lb/>
the board mentioned the <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">incident</add> to Lee, at whose mess they ate.</p>
<p>But he heard of it somehow. It was probably too good a<lb/>
story to keep -the Army medical officer scolding the loquacious<lb/>
Boy Orator of the Platte to a standstill. A few days later, Lee,<lb/>
rather insistently, invited the board to stand with him on the<lb/>
194.<lb/>
<pb n="195" id="f06114195"/>
platform while he reviewed the troops. As the regiments tramped<lb/>
past the three doctors stood respectfully behind the general. Fin-<lb/>
ally he turned to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step up, please, gentlemen. Here comes the Third Nebraska.<lb/>
Salute the colonel as he passes,&rdquo; he suggested, with a little smile.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Chickamauga, in Tennessee, was the next camp<lb/>
on the list. Sixty thousand men had camped there during Ju<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add>e and<lb/>
July, some still remained, and not a regiment had escaped <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">typhoid.</add><lb/>
Here the water from shallow wells and the river was definitely<lb/>
contaminated. Also the soil of the whole camp had been fouled<lb/>
by the carelessness of troops who knew they would soon move on.<lb/>
The rocky ground made digging latrines difficult, moreover,<lb/>
and the earth was unabsorptive. It was hard to fix the blame <del hand="unknown_hand">of</del><lb/>
for the wretched and filthy situation, unless it could be fastened<lb/>
on the ignorance of camp sanitation that prevailed among the En-<lb/>
gineer Corps and the line officers. Most of the medical men, too,<lb/>
were far from being sanitary experts; and what good recommendations<lb/>
they could make were usually snubbed.</p>
<p>The troops still stationed at Chickamauga Park were despon-<lb/>
dent and ill. Their Commanding Officer was no more cheerful than<lb/>
his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he whispered, drawing Vaughan aside, &ldquo;do you<lb/>
know what the word Chickamauga means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, what?&rdquo; the plump, matter-of-fact man of science asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;River of Death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don't say. Inter<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>sting, these Indian names.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer nodded somberly. &ldquo;There's no use you fellows<lb/>
going around trying to figure if it's malaria, or typhoid, or how<lb/>
195.<lb/>
<pb n="196" id="f06114196"/>
it comes. It's the Chickamauga fever, and it's from the miasma.<lb/>
Every night you can feel it, a foul damp that rises off the River<lb/>
of Death and creeps through the whole camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Giving this explanation the credence it deserved, the board<lb/>
tried an experiment. Observing that typhoid occurred more rarely<lb/>
among regiments that a<del hand="unknown_hand">r</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">t</add>e in screened tents, they scattered lime<lb/>
in the latrines and then watched flies, their feet white with<lb/>
it, later crawling over tables and food in unscreened messes.</p>
<p>Now they were sure of flies, and equally sure, from further<lb/>
observation, about comrade infection. It would be interesting,<lb/>
they thought, to find out next how long it took the bacillus, from<lb/>
the time it entered a man's digestive tract, to lay him low. Con-<lb/>
veniently, fifty trained nurses just then arrived from Chicago;<lb/>
the first came down with typhoid ten days later. The conclusion,<lb/>
later confirmed, was that the incubation period of the germ was <del hand="unknown_hand">t</del><lb/>
about ten days.</p>
<p>Now reports of the board's studies were beginning to reach<lb/>
the camps, and when they arrived at Camp Meade, in Pennsylvania,<lb/>
they found that the camp doctors were disinfecting all bedding,<lb/>
clothes, tents and other possibly soiled articles of each victim.<lb/>
This practice, soon adopted in all the camps, caused an abrupt<lb/>
decline in the number of new cases.</p>
<p>From mid-October, when they returned to Washington, until<lb/>
the following June, Vaughan and Shakespeare, working at the Army<lb/>
Medical Museum during the day and in their rented room on K Street<lb/>
at night, went over the huge mass of statistics and other data<lb/>
that they had collected at the camps. From detailed analysis of the<lb/>
records of almost a hundred regiments they were able to draw cer-<lb/>
tain conclusions about typhoid which still stand. They confirmed<lb/>
196.<lb/>
<pb n="197" id="f06114197"/>
their original beliefs that typhoid is due to Eberth's bacillus<lb/>
and does not develop even in fouled soil in the absence of the<lb/>
bacillus; that Widal's test and autopsy can always identify it;<lb/>
that it need never be confused with malaria, which can always be<lb/>
identified by the plasmodium in the blood. They altered, however,<lb/>
their earlier belief that it was largely water-borne: air and<lb/>
water accounted for only twenty-two percent of the cases they had<lb/>
studied, comrade infection for sixty-two and flies for fifteen.<lb/>
These findings were the last word on typhoid until the discovery,<lb/>
several years later, of the existence of carriers, people who have<lb/>
recovered from the disease and continue, unaccountably, to<lb/>
produce the bacillus in the<del hand="unknown_hand">in</del> intestinal tract.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>While his friends toiled over the typhoid material,<lb/>
Reed was assigned to other duties. Late in October he went on a<lb/>
trip to Natural Bridge, Virginia, to see if two hotels there could<lb/>
be converted into military hospitals. Having decided that they<lb/>
could not, he made a hasty trip to Lynchburg, where his brother<lb/>
Jim was then living.</p>
<p>As he grew older, he realized, he valued his association<lb/>
with his oldest brother increasingly, especially since it was fif-<lb/>
teen years since he had seen either Chris, who was a judge in Kan-<lb/>
sas City, or Tom, a merchant in Kansas. Jim, now an elderly min-<lb/>
ister like Pa, met him at the station, and they started walking<lb/>
together up the hill to the car line. With his empty sleeve, mem-<lb/>
ento of Antietam, pinned in his coat pocket, Jim still walked<lb/>
with the quick long stride of his youth, and laughed when his<lb/>
youngest brother, puffing, mentioned that they were in no hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take the hill like a breeze,&rdquo; Reed said breath-<lb/>
197.<lb/>
<pb n="198" id="f06114198"/>
lessly, &ldquo;and I'm about winded. How do you keep so young, Jimmy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn't spend a hard summer riding all around the country<lb/>
inspecting camps,&rdquo; Jim reminded him, &ldquo;and the life of a rural min-<lb/>
ister, although not exactly strenuous, does involve some walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's good to see you so well, Jim. You seem to feel just<lb/>
as young as ever. I wish I could say as much for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim, seeing the lines of weariness and strain in his face<lb/>
that had been absent even a year ago, at Pa's funeral, said anx-<lb/>
iously, &ldquo;You need some rest, Walter. You're tired. We'll spend<lb/>
a quiet evening at home, and if you feel like it, maybe you'll<lb/>
tell us a little about your typhoid work. The children are dying<lb/>
to hear about it. They think their military uncle is quite a fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Washington again, Reed continued his usual work of<lb/>
teaching and research, and met with Vaughan and Shakespeare as<lb/>
often as possible to discuss the typhoid studies. In the middle<lb/>
of April, 1899, he was sent to Cuba to investigate the epidemic of<lb/>
&ldquo;pernicious malaria&rdquo; at the camp at Puerto Principe. It was, of<lb/>
course, typhoid. He was miserably seasick going and coming on<lb/>
this first trip to Cuba, and, poor man, he had many more such ex-<lb/>
cursions ahead of him. By the first of June, 1899, he was back<lb/>
in Washington again, in time to tell Vaughan and Shakespeare good-<lb/>
bye.</p>
<p>That month the typhoid board was disbanded. Although its pre-<lb/>
liminary report, which contained <del hand="unknown_hand">criticisms and</del> recommendations on<lb/>
the sanitary organization of the Army, had been published in Jan-<lb/>
uary, the board's studies were not completed. Splitting the re-<lb/>
maining sick reports between them, Vaughan and Shakespeare took<lb/>
them home, and agreed to meet the next June at Atlantic City to<lb/>
198.<lb/>
<pb n="199" id="f06114199"/>
write a full report on the board's findings.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The war, happily, had been short. Hostilities were offic-<lb/>
ially opened late in April, 1898, and the peace protocol was<lb/>
signed the following August 12th. Our lack of preparation and in-<lb/>
efficiency had been appalling (the War Department's conduct was<lb/>
later the subject of an investigation), but Spain's decrepitude<lb/>
had been fatal. We won easily.</p>
<p>The war had some interesting results. The United States,<lb/>
now that it had some island possessions -Puerto Rico and the Phil-<lb/>
ippines -and was occupying Cuba, was beginning to think of itself<lb/>
as a world power and to take a livlier interest in foreign affairs.<lb/>
At the same time, much of the lingering bitterness of the Civil<lb/>
War was wiped out in the new unity of national feeling.</p>
<p>A new set of heroes, too, had arisen to replace the totter-<lb/>
ing gaffers of the Civil War. The image of Teddy Roosevelt, or-<lb/>
ganizer of the Rough Riders, his teeth bared in a strenuous smile,<lb/>
was familiar to every newspaper reader. Dr. Leonard Wood's dizzy<lb/>
ascent from captain in the Medical Corps to brigadier general and<lb/>
military governor of Cuba was known to everyone. Admiral Dewey,<lb/>
for his destruction of the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay, was sudden-<lb/>
ly subjected to the rigors of unrestrained hero-worship. Young Mr.<lb/>
Richard Pearson Hobson, who had tried -and failed -to bottle up<lb/>
the Spanish ships in Santiago Bay by sinking a collier across the<lb/>
mouth of the harbor, became, for his pains, &ldquo;the most kissed man<lb/>
in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The typhoid board won little public attention, however,<lb/>
and there is no record that any attempts to kiss its members<lb/>
199.<lb/>
<pb n="200" id="f06114200"/>
were made by an enthusiastic public. This oversight notwithstand-<lb/>
ing, <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">their</add> work had not been insignificant. They <del hand="unknown_hand">had</del> did much to<lb/>
dispel a dangerous misconception about the spread of a serious com-<lb/>
mon disease, and thus contributed greatly to its prevention.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XIX</head>

<p>The slave trade, fertile source of so much other ill, seems<lb/>
also to have been responsible for introducing yellow fever into<lb/>
the Western Hemisphere. The disease was probably carried in slave<lb/>
ships from the west coast of Africa to the Barbadoes in September,<lb/>
1864 where it caused thousands of deaths. It raged through the<lb/>
neighboring <del hand="unknown_hand">islands</del> West Indian islands of St. Christopher and<lb/>
Guadaloupe, jumped across to Yucatan on the mainland, and <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">then</add> struck<lb/>
disastrously, probably in the summer of <del hand="unknown_hand">19</del> 1649, in Havana, Cuba.<lb/>
This was the end of its first eruption in the New World; but the<lb/>
disease had established itself. For the next two and a half cen-<lb/>
turies it was to be a major affliction.</p>
<p>201.</p>
<pb n="202" id="f06114202"/>
<p>It was called by different names in different places -<lb/>
American plague, malignant infectious fever, Barbadoes distemper,<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">coup-de-barre</hi> (blow of a rod), yellow fever -and it was e-<lb/>
qually dreaded in all. In some epidemics as many as eighty-five<lb/>
out of every hundred victims died. One attack, happily, usually<lb/>
produced immunity.</p>
<p>Its onset came with chills and headache. Severe pains<lb/>
in the back and arms and legs (hence <hi rend="italic">coup de barre</hi>) followed, with<lb/>
high fever, nausea and vomiting. This feverish stage might last<lb/>
a few hours, or several days, and was sometimes accompanied by the<lb/>
jaundice that gave the disease its name. Next came the &ldquo;stage of<lb/>
calm,&rdquo; during which the severity of the symptoms subsided and the<lb/>
fever dropped. In mild cases the patient was then on the mend;<lb/>
in more severe ones &ldquo;febrile reaction&rdquo; set in. The fever again<lb/>
mounted, the aching in back and limbs became acute, jaun-<lb/>
dice was pronounced. Bleeding from the kidneys and gums sometimes<lb/>
occurred, and blood vessels occasionally broke into the skin. The<lb/>
most dreaded symptom of all was the &ldquo;black vomit,&rdquo; the ejection<lb/>
of blood released into the stomach by the breaking of its blood<lb/>
vessels. When a yellow fever patient had the black vomit, his<lb/>
chance of recovery was slight indeed.</p>
<p>Yellow fever scourged our coast from the Rio Grande to<lb/>
Nantucket for more than two centuries, but did its most frequent,<lb/>
fatal work in the southern ports. One authority tells us that<lb/>
there were ninety epidemics in the United States from the time<lb/>
of the first proven outbreak at Boston, in 1668, until its con-<lb/>
trol at the beginning of the twentieth century; another, that<lb/>
in the hundred years between 1798 and 1898 there were three hun-<lb/>
dred thousand cases and eighty thousand deaths.</p>
<p>202.</p>
<pb n="203" id="f06114203"/>
<p>One of the worst of the early outbreaks took place in Philadelphia<lb/>
in the summer of 1793. The roads were packed with fleeing refu-<lb/>
gees, many of whom were turned away from neighboring cities and<lb/>
left to wander and starve in the countryside. Over the city a<lb/>
heavy silence rested, broken by the rattle of the dead-wagons col-<lb/>
lecting corpses. They were buried, without service or ceremony,<lb/>
in shallow graves dug by the Negroes who carted them away. The<lb/>
living shunned each other and abandoned their dearest and closest<lb/>
connections at the first symptom. Dr. Benjamin Rush, one of the<lb/>
foremost doctors in the city and a signer of the Declaration of<lb/>
Independence, prescribed for a time for more than a hundred and<lb/>
fifty patients a day, had no time to eat or sleep or rest, and<lb/>
later recalled, with grief, that <del hand="unknown_hand">he</del> in passing through the streets<lb/>
he sometimes had to whip up his horse to escape the desperate <del hand="unknown_hand">d</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">c</add>ries<lb/>
of people imploring help. Whole families were erased, and the un-<lb/>
tended sick lay in the same room with the decomposing dead until<lb/>
they died themselves. <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">The life of the entire community was halted</add><lb/> by the plague. At the sight of a man cutting wood, early<del hand="unknown_hand">,</del><lb/>
in October, for the coming winter, Rush was struck with surprise.<lb/>
&ldquo;I should as soon have thought of making provision for a dinner on<lb/>
the first day of the year 1800,&rdquo; he said. By the time the pesti-<lb/>
lence was over, in December, it had killed more than four thousand<lb/>
people, one tenth of the whole population. &ldquo;Moschetoes (the usu-<lb/>
al attendants of a sickly season) were uncommonly numerous,&rdquo; Dr.<lb/>
Rush innocently observed.</p>
<p>In the epidemic at Memphis in 1878 more than half the<lb/>
population fled, and those that remained died faster than they<lb/>
could be buried. The police force was reduced by the disease<lb/>
from forty-seven to seven, and the replacements could not keep<lb/>
203.<lb/>
<pb n="204" id="f06114204"/>
up with the deaths. Thieves and criminals swarmed in to loot the<lb/>
prostrated city, and many of them died by the disaster from which<lb/>
they had expected to profit. It has been estimated that the total<lb/>
cost, in loss of trade and money paid out, of the 1878 epidemic,<lb/>
which was widespread in the South, was about a hundred million dol-<lb/>
lars. There is, of course, no measure of the cost in human grief<lb/>
and suffering.</p>
<p>The worst of it was that, at the end of that epidemic,<lb/>
little more was known about the cause of yellow fever than had been<lb/>
known at the time of the great Philadelphia pestilence. Then some<lb/>
thought the disease was contagious -that is, could be passed from<lb/>
a sick person to a well one by contact; others thought it was not<lb/>
contagious, but was spread through the air by poisonous vapors<lb/>
arising from decaying vegetable and animal matter.</p>
<p>In 1804 a determined University of Pennsylvania medical<lb/>
student named Stubbins Ffirth tried to settle the question. He<lb/>
swallowed pills made of fresh balck vomit, inserted small quan-<lb/>
tities of it into cuts in his arms and legs, and injected blood<lb/>
serum from a yellow fever patient into his own blood stream. These<lb/>
courageous and drastic experiments were negative. He did not con-<lb/>
tract the disease. We know now, however, that he missed it by a<lb/>
hair. Had he taken blood from a patient in the first three days<lb/>
of illness, he would -unless he himself was immune -surely have<lb/>
been rewarded with yellow fever. In any case, his experiments<lb/>
convinced him that it could not be transmitted by contact, that<lb/>
it was not contagious.</p>
<p>As doctors observed more epidemics and noticed how the<lb/>
people in intimate contact with the sick and their soiled clothes<lb/>
204.<lb/>
<pb n="205" id="f06114205"/>
and bedding often escaped the plague, the contagion theory<lb/>
fell into disrepute. <del hand="unknown_hand">We know now that Stubbins Ffirth and those<lb/>
who agreed with him were right; yellow fever is not spread by con-<lb/>
tact.</del> But they still could not explain how it was spread.</p>
<p>Some accurate observations had, however, been made about<lb/>
it. It had been remarked, not only by Dr. Rush, that mosquitoes<lb/>
were numerous when yellow fever was epidemic. It was known, too,<lb/>
that epidemics always ended with the coming of cool weather. Tho-<lb/>
mas Jefferson, and others before and after him, had noticed that<lb/>
the malady was &ldquo;genera<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del>ted near the waterside, under warm climates,&rdquo;<lb/>
and seemed &ldquo;pretty exactly circumscribed.&rdquo; It was realized, also,<lb/>
that it was not a filth disease, since rich and poor, clean and<lb/>
squalid neighborhoods were equally victimized.</p>
<p>Doctors kept on making guesses about its cause. Dr. J. C.<lb/>
Nott of Mobile, Alabama, in 1848 suggested that insects might car-<lb/>
ry it, and was hooted by his professional brethren. By the late<lb/>
1870's theories far more fantastic than Doctor Nott's were serious-<lb/>
ly discussed.</p>
<p>But in more serious scientific circles the idea was gaining<lb/>
ground that it was due to a specific germ: and it was but a step<lb/>
to the conclusion that the germ was carried in <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> -black<lb/>
vomit and other emanations of the sick, and articles soiled by them.<lb/>
Thus the contagion theory, in new scientific trappings, was well<lb/>
established again by the end of the 1878 epidemic. Stubbins Ffirth's<lb/>
experiments were forgotten. That <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> spread yellow fever was<lb/>
something that &ldquo;everybody knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For twenty years this belief was generally accepted -twen-<lb/>
ty years in which the bedding and furniture of sick rooms were burned,<lb/>
baggage and wearing apparel of people traveling from a yellow fe-<lb/>
205.<lb/>
<pb n="206" id="f06114206"/>
ver zone destroyed or disinfected, houses sometimes burnt to the<lb/>
ground, millions of dollars worth of property destroyed -all to<lb/>
kill the germs thought to be lurking in <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi>.</p>
<p>For twenty years, too, Dr. Carlos Finlay of Havana kept in-<lb/>
sisting that yellow fever was spread by the bite of a certain mos-<lb/>
quito, the female of <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>, now called <hi rend="italic">Aedes aegypti</hi>.<lb/>
Everyone laughed at him indulgently: he was a nice old gentleman,<lb/>
but tiresome about his ridiculous theory. He was known as the<lb/>
&ldquo;mosquito man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Surgeon General Sternberg was this country's leading<lb/>
authority on yellow fever. It was his most ardent ambition to<lb/>
identify its germ and to discover how the plague spread. He had<lb/>
an old score to settle with it: it had almost killed him in 1875<lb/>
at Pensacola, Florida. He had spent fourteen years, from 1879<lb/>
until he became Surgeon General, searching for the germ in the<lb/>
blood -most expert opinion held that it must live in the blood<lb/>
stream -as well as in tissues and the intestinal tract.</p>
<p>Serving on the Havana Yellow Fever Commission in 1879, he<lb/>
had become a close friend of Dr. Finlay's. Even his friendship and<lb/>
respect for the Cuban doctor, however, did not incline<lb/>
him to take seriously the mosquito theory, when Finlay announced<lb/>
it on February 18th, 1881, before the International Sanitary Con-<lb/>
ference of Washington, and again the next August before the Havana<lb/>
Academy of Medicine. Sternberg persistently pursued yellow fever<lb/>
in Brazil, Mexico, Cuba and the United States, and examined and<lb/>
exploded every <del hand="unknown_hand">assertion</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">claim</add> that the specific agent had at last been<lb/>
cornered. He finally concluded that the only remaining competitor<lb/>
206.<lb/>
<pb n="207" id="f06114207"/>
for the distinction of causing the pestilence was a germ which he<lb/>
called <hi rend="italic">bacillus x</hi>. He was not sure of <hi rend="italic">bacillus x</hi>, since repeated<lb/>
inoculations with it had failed to produce the disease in any lab-<lb/>
oratory animal, but he regarded it as a possibility. What he was<lb/>
sure of, however, was that yellow fever investigation had gone<lb/>
as far as it could until experiments could be done on human beings.</p>
<p>When the Italian scientist, <del hand="unknown_hand">Sanarelli</del> Giuseppe Sanarelli,<lb/>
electrified the medical world <del hand="unknown_hand">by</del> in 1897 by announcing that he<lb/>
had identified the bacillus causing yellow fever, Sternberg was<lb/>
skeptical. He did not see how a germ which was easily seen under<lb/>
a microscope and grown in ordinary cultures could have escaped him<lb/>
for years. He obtained some of <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">Sanarelli's</add> germ, <hi rend="italic">bacillus icter-<lb/>
oides</hi>, and toward the end of 1897 set Reed and Carroll to work on<lb/>
the problem. Off and on for eighteen months, as their other work<lb/>
permitted, they studied the new germ and experimented with it.<lb/>
Early in 1899 they published a paper asserting that Sanarelli's<lb/>
bacillus was not It; it belonged to the group causing hog-cholera,<lb/>
the disease which Welch and the veterinarian Clement had been<lb/>
studying while Reed was working in the Hopkins laboratory in the<lb/>
early 1890's. In the same paper they added that Sternberg's<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">bacillus x</hi> also had no connection with yellow fever.</p>
<p>During the same period Aristides Agramonte, a young con-<lb/>
tract doctor, on orders from Sternberg was trying to find <hi rend="italic">bacillus<lb/>
icteroides</hi> in the yellow fever cases he autopsied in Cuba during<lb/>
the war. A Cuban himself and the son of an insurgent general who<lb/>
had been killed in an earlier war between the island and Spain,<lb/>
he had been educated in New York <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">City</add> and graduated from the College of<lb/>
Physicians and Surgeons in 1892. After several years as a sani-<lb/>
207.<lb/>
<pb n="208" id="f06114208"/>
itary inspector and assistant bacteriologist in the New York City<lb/>
Health Department, he joined the Army and was put in charge of the<lb/>
laboratory at Military Hospital Number One in Havana. He not<lb/>
only failed to find <hi rend="italic">bacillus</hi> <hi rend="italic">icteroides</hi> in seventy percent of<lb/>
the cases he autopsied, but also he did find in it many that were<lb/>
not yellow fever.</p>
<p>/Rom</p>
<p>These findings might have disposed of Sanarelli's claim<lb/>
but for two things: <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">the Italian</add> <del hand="unknown_hand">he</del> asserted that Reed's and Carroll's results<lb/>
were due to faulty work and prejudice; and two doctors of the<lb/>
United States Marine Hospital Service (now the Public Health Ser-<lb/>
vice) said that they <del hand="unknown_hand">have</del> had found <hi rend="italic">bacillus icteroides</hi> in almost<lb/>
every yellow fever victim they had autopsied in the past two years.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Bacillus icteroides</hi> remained a strong contender for the unsavory<lb/>
honor of being the yellow fever agent. Interest in it was very<lb/>
keen throughout the medical profession.</p>
<p>/Roman</p>
<p>Rom/</p>
<p>The issue, obviously, had to be settled one way or an-<lb/>
other. And for that matter, Sternberg thought impatiently, it was<lb/>
about time that something was done to solve the whole question<lb/>
of yellow fever. There had to be an answer <hi rend="italic">somewhere</hi>. How would<lb/>
it be, he wondered, to appoint a commission to go into the whole<lb/>
matter thoroughly?</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p><del hand="unknown_hand">R</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">R</add>eed, standing with his legs apart to brace himself<lb/>
against the slight motion of the anchored ship, looked curiously<lb/>
at the little pill before he swallowed it. If it was as good as<lb/>
it was supposed to be, he would go to bed in Tampa harbor, and<lb/>
wake up next morning with most of the trip to Havana behind him -<lb/>
and never a touch of seasickness. He popped it into his mouth,<lb/>
washed it down with a gulp of water, wiped his mustache on his<lb/>
208.<lb/>
<pb n="209" id="f06114209"/>
handkerchief and got into his bunk.</p>
<p>He woke up in the morning feeling fine. He lay in the nar-<lb/>
row bunk for a minute, enjoying the unusual sensation of not be-<lb/>
ing seasick and admiring the bar of sunlight that came through<lb/>
the porthole. As he got up a doubt assailed him. He couldn't<lb/>
feel any engine vibration and, unless he had overslept, they could<lb/>
hardly be in Havana harbor already. He opened the cabin door and<lb/>
looked out. A seaman was mopping the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; Reed inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Tampa, sir,&rdquo; the sailor told him. &ldquo;The sea was so<lb/>
heavy last night we didn't leave port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed closed the door unhappily. He was sick for the whole<lb/>
trip.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>General Leonard Wood, the handsome, energetic military<lb/>
governor of Cuba, was making everyone work so hard that the Cu-<lb/>
bans were poking good-natured fun at him with a rueful rhyme.</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>&ldquo;Don't stop to drink or spit,</l>
<l>Or smoke or scratch your ear.</l>
<l>Go work while the stars are lit!</l>
<l>Come home when night is near.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>There is no time for food.</l>

<l>The man who works for Wood</l>

</lg>
<p>But they liked him, too. Taxes were honestly collected,<lb/>
justice was more properly administered, prisons were reformed,<lb/>
the insane had been collected out of cellars and jails and placed<lb/>
209.<lb/>
<pb n="210" id="f06114210"/>
in an asylum in Havana. The administrative chaos due to the war<lb/>
was straightening out and municipal self-government was being<lb/>
started. The island's cities, which had been in a shocking state<lb/>
of filth and ruin, were being systematically cleaned up.</p>
<p>Reed's mission on this trip in March, 1900, was to report on<lb/>
a disinfectant which was manufactured locally and used to flush the<lb/>
city streets. While he conducted his investigation, he lived at<lb/>
Camp Columbia.</p>
<p>Camp Columbia, where the Seventh Cavalry was stationed, was<lb/>
near Quemados, a suburb some half dozen miles west of Havana. The<lb/>
flat ground of the camp, almost unbroken by trees or shrubs, sloped<lb/>
gradually to the sea. It was healthful, well drained and swept by<lb/>
the wind. Except during <del hand="unknown_hand">mid-day</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">midday</add>, when the sun beat directly on<lb/>
the unshaded wood buildings, it was pleasantly cool.</p>
<p>The post hospital, a group of frame buildings, stood by it-<lb/>
self at the south end of the grounds. Its buildings included wards,<lb/>
offices, barracks for the Hospital Corps, quarters for the non-<lb/>
commissioned officers, nurses' quarters and small houses for the<lb/>
medical officers who had brought their families with them to Cuba.<lb/>
It was in the long, one story bungalow, with a wide veranda on all<lb/>
sides, which provided quarters for the bachelor medical officers,<lb/>
that Reed stayed.</p>
<p>It took him only a short time to decide<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del> that he did not<lb/>
think much of the new disinfectant. But he enjoyed the camp, the<lb/>
excellent mess at the bachelors' quarters, and the friendly, inter-<lb/>
esting group of young men. Among them was First Lieutenant <del hand="unknown_hand">Truby,</del><lb/>
Albert E. Truby, clean-shaven, round-faced, smiling, whom he had<lb/>
examined for a commission in the Medical Corps two years before<lb/>
and of whom he had since grown very fond. His friend Kean, Chief<lb/>
210.<lb/>
<pb n="211" id="f06114211"/>
Surgeon of the Department of Western Cuba, was at General Fitzhugh<lb/>
Lee's headquarters in nearby Marianao, and another doctor, Jesse<lb/>
W. Lazear, <del hand="unknown_hand">in whom Reed took great interest,</del> was in charge of the<lb/>
laboratory at Camp Columbia.</p>
<p>A handsome young man with a heavy, close-cropped <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">dark</add> beard,<lb/>
Lazear was a thoroughly trained bacteriologist. Born in Balti-<lb/>
more in 1866, he had been educated at Washington and Jefferson<lb/>
College and at Johns Hopkins University. After taking his medical<lb/>
degree at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in the same class<lb/>
as Agramonte, he had spent most of his time in research, and was<lb/>
a bacteriologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital when he joined the<lb/>
Army as a contract doctor. He was an authority on malaria, which<lb/>
had recently been proved to be spread by mosquitoes, and especially<lb/>
interested in mosquitoes as <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">carriers</add> of disease. Reed, won by<lb/>
his personal charm and his intelligence, spent much time with him<lb/>
in the laboratory where, as a matter of diagnostic routine, La-<lb/>
zear did blood tests of all fever cases.</p>
<p>In the warm, bright evenings after dinner, the young doc-<lb/>
tors, dressed in fresh white uniforms, sat on the veranda<lb/>
of the officers' quarters and talked to Reed. They had at first<lb/>
been inclined to be a little stiff and diffident with the major -<lb/>
the gap is wide between the rank of lieutenant and major -but<lb/>
his sparkling good-humor and genial manner had put them completely<lb/>
at ease. Kean, Agramonte and others of Reed's friends would come<lb/>
to see him and all of them would sit long after the tropical dark-<lb/>
ness had <del hand="unknown_hand">fall</del> closed down, talking about their work and especially<lb/>
about yellow fever, in which Reed's interest was tireless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's a fascinating problem,&rdquo; he observed one night,<lb/>
211.<lb/>
<pb n="212" id="f06114212"/>
&ldquo;and one that's ripe for solution now. General Sternberg's dis-<lb/>
credited all the mistaken ideas before Sanarelli's; and we're<lb/>
pretty sure, from the work <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">done</add> in our laboratory <del hand="unknown_hand">and</del> in Washington, and<lb/>
by Agramonte here, that Sanarelli's wrong. The field is clear, now,<lb/>
for the definitive piece of work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's clear,&rdquo; Lazear concurred, &ldquo;and the relation of<lb/>
mosquitoes to malaria may be the clue to follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed looked dubious. All the best authorities -except<lb/>
nice, stubborn, old Finlay -said yellow fever <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">was</add> spread by <hi rend="italic">fo-<lb/>
mites</hi>, and he believed them.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>On May 23rd, 1900, in Washington, Reed and the Surgeon<lb/>
General had a long talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we understand each other on every point, Major?&rdquo;<lb/>
Sternberg, seated behind his big desk, concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, I think, General,&rdquo; Reed told him.</p>
<p>Sternberg scribbled a memorandum in his sprawling hand-<lb/>
writing. &ldquo;I'll ask the Adjutant General to issue the order today,&rdquo;<lb/>
he promised. &ldquo;You, Carroll, Agramonte and Lazear. How I wish I<lb/>
could be on the board with you!&rdquo; He sighed. &ldquo;For twenty years<lb/>
it's been my dearest hope to lick yellow fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn't done all the necessary preliminary work so<lb/>
thoroughly,&rdquo; Reed reminded him, &ldquo;we would have to start 'way back<lb/>
from scratch. It might add several years to our work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's some little comfort,&rdquo; Stermberg admitted. &ldquo;Now,<lb/>
when the AG's order comes through, I'll give you written instruc-<lb/>
tions. General ones. Needless to say, some of the things we've<lb/>
discussed won't be covered. If the anti-vivisectionists got hold<lb/>
of the news that we were prepared even for human experimentation,<lb/>
212.<lb/>
<pb n="213" id="f06114213"/>
as a last resort, they'd scream themselves hoarse; and so<lb/>
would plenty of others, especially doctors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed said gravely, &ldquo;We'll be prepared to experiment on hu-<lb/>
man beings, provided they give their full consent. But it's a<lb/>
terrible responsibility, General, to take a man's life in your<lb/>
hands and run a deliberate risk with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed, Major, But it's a responsibility which we<lb/>
shall all share. And I know no man more fit by nature and training<lb/>
to assume it than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more thing, General. This mosquito theory of Finlay's -<lb/>
do you take any stock at all in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sternberg smiled. &ldquo;Major Reed, you know I'm devoted to Fin-<lb/>
lay. He's a fine old man, and an expert on yellow fever treatment.<lb/>
But frankly, I think you'll be wasting your time if you investi-<lb/>
gate the mosquito possibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm inclined to agree with you. S<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">t</add>ill, maybe we'd better<lb/>
look into it sometime, just to leave no stone unturned.&rdquo; Reed<lb/>
stood up. &ldquo;I'll expect the order, then, appointing the commission<lb/>
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo; Sternberg accompanied his colleague to the door<lb/>
and shock hands cordially, &ldquo;And, Major...&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, General?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very best of luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>On May 24th, 1900, the Adjutant General issued the order<lb/>
creating a board of medical officers composed of Major Walter Reed<lb/>
and Acting Assistant Surgeons James Carroll, Aristides Agramonte<lb/>
and Jesse W. Lazear &ldquo;to meet at Camp Columbia, Quemados, Cuba,<lb/>
for the purpose of pursuing scientific investigations with refer-<lb/>
213.<lb/>
<pb n="214" id="f06114214"/>
ence to the infectious diseases prevalent on the Island of Cuba.&rdquo;<lb/>
And the Surgeon General wrote, &ldquo;You will naturally give special<lb/>
attention to questions relating to the etiology [the bacterial<lb/>
cause] and prevention of yellow fever. As you are familiar with<lb/>
what has already been done by other bacteriologists in this field<lb/>
of investigation, I do not consider it necessary to give you any<lb/>
suggestions or detailed instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These papers were the death warrant of epidemic yellow<lb/>
fever in the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XX</head>

<p>On May 23rd, the same day that the Surgeon General put in<lb/>
his request for the formation of the yellow fever board, Dr. Lazear<lb/>
was called to 20 General Lee Street, Quemados.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He's been complaining of headache all day, doctor,&rdquo; Mrs.<lb/>
Sherwood told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll take a good look at him and see what the trouble<lb/>
is,&rdquo; Lazear said reassuringly.</p>
<p>215.</p>
<pb n="216" id="f06114216"/>
<p>Sherwood was a stout, short, strong-looking man who worked<lb/>
in Havana. His head ached, he said, and he felt ho<del hand="unknown_hand">w</del>t all over -<lb/>
he supposed he'd picked up a cold someplace. Lazear examined him,<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">carefully,</del> found his temperature was over a hundred degrees, and<lb/>
took a sample of his blood to examine in his laboratory. A mos-<lb/>
quito, buzzing viciously in the doctor's ear, made him shake his<lb/>
head vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don't give a man any peace,&rdquo; Sherwood complained.<lb/>
&ldquo;They get to be an awful pest about this time of year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll catch a few of these fellows,&rdquo; Lazear remarked, &ldquo;and<lb/>
take them along with me. They're wonderful things under a micro-<lb/>
scope.&rdquo; <del hand="unknown_hand">He rose and clapped the open end of a test tube over one<lb/>
sitting on the wall, tapped till it flew down into it, and corked it.</del></p>
<p>Sherwood was not greatly interested. &ldquo;Do you think I can<lb/>
get back to work tomorrow, doctor? I'm soo busy to be sick.&rdquo; He<lb/>
smiled feebly at his pleasantry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Lazear's tone was positive. &ldquo;You must stay in bed -<lb/>
no moving around whatever, and nothing at all to eat. Just plenty<lb/>
of cold water. I'll be out and see you again in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in his laboratory, he took off his uniform coat, lay-<lb/>
ing it on the table with special care for the five mosquitoes, cap-<lb/>
tive in test tubes, that he had brought from Sherwood's room.<lb/>
Quickly preparing a blood smear, he put the slide under the micro-<lb/>
scope and examined it searchingly. His handsome, bearded face be-<lb/>
came grave: there were no malaria parasites in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there's a chance it isn't yellow fever,&rdquo; he muttered<lb/>
out loud. &ldquo;The Widal test may show typhoid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Widal, too, was negative. In the morning Sherwood<lb/>
ached all over and his temperature was higher. Lazear had him<lb/>
moved to the isolation ward of the post hospital. Yellow fever<lb/>
216.<lb/>
<pb n="217" id="f06114217"/>
was loose again.</p>
<p>The plague picked its vicitms with its usual eccentricity.<lb/>
From 20 General Lee Street it hopped around the corener to 102 Cal-<lb/>
zada Real, where no one from Sherwood's house had entered or was<lb/>
even acquainted. Then it struck again in General Lee Street,<lb/>
skipping, in its passage, over a house inhabited by two non-immunes.<lb/>
A few days later it came back to attack them. It progressed in er-<lb/>
ratic jumps through the clean, pleasant little suburban town.<lb/>
Sherwood died, more people got sick. The officers of his mess com-<lb/>
plained to General Lee that Kean shouldn't be allowed to visit yel-<lb/>
low fever cases -he might bring it back and distribute it among<lb/>
them. Kean, ordered to keep away from the fever, obeyed -and came<lb/>
down with it himself on the 21st of June.</p>
<p>Havana was having an epidemic too, and the officers of Gen-<lb/>
eral <del hand="unknown_hand">Lee</del> Wood's staff were falling before it like bowling pins. In<lb/>
the officers' mess they drank their red wine, supposed to have a<lb/>
preventive effect, with the grim toast, &ldquo;<del hand="unknown_hand">Th</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">H</add>ere's to the ones who<lb/>
have gone. Here's to <del hand="unknown_hand">ne</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">the</add> next one to go.&rdquo; People were getting fright-<lb/>
ened. Rigorous sanitary measure, carried out with all the thorough-<lb/>
ness of which Major William Crawford Gorgas, the Havana <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">sanitary</add><lb/>
officer, was capable, failed to check the pest. It's rapid spread<lb/>
made mock of the health officers.</p>
<p>Lazear and Agramonte were kept busy examining blood,<lb/>
and <del hand="unknown_hand">m</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">ma</add>terial from autopsies. Lazear, in addition, <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">studied</add> his mos-<lb/>
quitoes in the minutest detail, and found nothing. He did not dis-<lb/>
cuss this phase of his work with anyone, but he persisted in it.<lb/>
The authorities could ridicule the mosquito theory all they wanted<lb/>
to -he had a hunch there was something in it.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Reed and Carroll landed on the morning of June 25th in<lb/>
217.<lb/>
<pb n="218" id="f06114218"/>
Havana harbor. Carroll had never been in Cuba before, and Reed as<lb/>
they rode through pointed out the sights to him -the long, low<lb/>
Governor's Palace where General Wood now had his headquarters, the<lb/>
nearby cathedral which had once held the bones of Columbus, the<lb/>
forts, the leper hospital and the parks. The massive architecture<lb/>
of the buildings; the flat, tiled roofs; the ornate balconies and<lb/>
facades; the narrow streets; the shrubs and palm trees; the heat<lb/>
and the brilliance of the tropical coloring -all made Carroll<lb/>
feel as if he were in another world. But the doherty wagon and the<lb/>
lively mules, switching their tails impatiently at the flies, those<lb/>
belonged to the familiar, unchanging world of the United States<lb/>
Army.</p>
<p>The wagon turned off the Calzada Real in<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">to</add> the road to the<lb/>
hospital grounds and drew up in front of the officers' quarters.<lb/>
The porch was crowded with doctors waiting to welcome them. Cap-<lb/>
tain Alexander Stark, the chief surgeon of the post, Agramonte, La-<lb/>
zear, Truby, Pinto and Ames gathered enthusiastically around Reed.<lb/>
Carroll, lingering at the edge of the group, watched Reed's re-<lb/>
ception with almost personal pride, until Reed, taking him by the<lb/>
arm, introduced him to the men he did not already know. Glancing<lb/>
around as though looking for someone, Reed finally asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where's Kean? Busy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Kean's got it, sir,&rdquo; Ames told him. &ldquo;Yellow jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! How is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad. Would you like to see him? He's been looking<lb/>
forward to your coming. It would do him no end of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means, doctor. Right away, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger Post Ames, a contract doctor who was unusually suc-<lb/>
cessful in the treatment of yellow fever, always attended the<lb/>
218.<lb/>
<pb n="219" id="f06114219"/>
cases that occurred in the camp. He and Reed walked through the<lb/>
hospital grounds and across the foot bridge over the railroad cut<lb/>
to the group of small buildings composing the isolation ward.</p>
<p>Reed was startled by Kean's yellow and shrunken appearance.<lb/>
He stayed with him only a few minutes, long enough to twit him<lb/>
affectionately about taking the trouble to demonstrate in person<lb/>
the first case of yellow fever he, Reed, had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he had a very severe attack, doctor?&rdquo; Reed asked Ames<lb/>
when they left. &ldquo;I'm not able to judge, never having seen it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was bad enough to worry us,&rdquo; Ames admitted. &ldquo;Some<lb/>
bleeding from the gums, but he's over the worst now. He's going<lb/>
to be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven! You've cheated yellow jack; no<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">w</add> it's up to<lb/>
us to eliminate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same afternoon, June 25th, the Yellow Fever Commission,<lb/>
as it came to be known, met for the first time as a body on the<lb/>
veranda of the bachelor officers' quarters. The wind swept in cool<lb/>
from the sea, and they could look across the grounds to the frame<lb/>
shacks, picked out clearly in the brilliant tropical light, in<lb/>
which Kean and other yellow fever victims were lying.</p>
<p>It was a serious meeting, but it is hardly likely that any<lb/>
of the doctors realized that it was a historic one. Their first<lb/>
decision was undramatic. They agreed to start by looking for the<lb/>
germ of yellow fever; then they would try to discover how it got<lb/>
from person to person. First they would work again on <hi rend="italic">bacillus</hi>-Rom<lb/>
Rom/-<hi rend="italic">icteroides</hi>, to check their previous conclusion<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del> about it. Agra-<lb/>
monte would continue to work in his laboratory at Military Hospital<lb/>
Number One in Havana, and the rest of them would work at Lazear's<lb/>
laboratory on the post hospital grounds.</p>
<p>219.</p>
<pb n="220" id="f06114220"/>
<p>&ldquo;I think we're going to solve it, gentlemen,&rdquo; Reed told them<lb/>
confidently. &ldquo;Everything is in our favor: we're well equipped,<lb/>
well trained and a congenial working unit. And our accomplish-<lb/>
ments whatever they may be, will be the result of cooperative ef-<lb/>
fort; the credit for them will belong to the entire board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The epidemic was rampant <del hand="unknown_hand">both</del> in both Quemados and Havana.<lb/>
Reed and Carroll, who had never before seen yellow fever cases, had<lb/>
a full opportunity to study them at the Camp Columbia hospital and<lb/>
at Las Animas, the Havana hospital under the direction of Dr. Juan<lb/>
Guiteras, an authority on tropical diseases.</p>
<p>So completely had the experience of the first half of the<lb/>
century been forgotten, that Reed learned with surprise, for the<lb/>
first time, that non-immune nurses who came in closest contact<lb/>
with patients in all stages of the disease seemed to be in<lb/>
no more danger of catching it than anybody else. It made him won-<lb/>
der if <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> were as dangerous as they were generally thought to be.</p>
<p>Concentrating on its efforts to find <hi rend="italic">bacillus icteroides</hi>, the<lb/>
board examined the blood of eighteen people sick with yellow fever<lb/>
in every phase of its progress. No <hi rend="italic">bacillus icteroides</hi>. As the<lb/>
epidemic progressed, more people died. The board autopsied<lb/>
eleven cases, and examined the organs with the utmost care. Still<lb/>
no <hi rend="italic">icteroides</hi>.</p>
<p>Rom<lb/>
Rom/</p>
<p>Lazear was not greatly interested in the search for Sanar-<lb/>
elli's germ. He had found an exciting new clue that supported the<lb/>
mosquito theory. It was in a paper by Dr. Henry R. Carter, of the<lb/>
Marine Hospital Service, who was then stationed in Cuba. Dr. Carter,<lb/>
during a recent yellow fever epidemic in Mississippi, had observed<lb/>
that it took two or three weeks for the first case of yellow fever<lb/>
220.<lb/>
<pb n="221" id="f06114221"/>
in a community to produce the next case. After that, non-immunes<lb/>
would fall victim within one week of visiting the infected region.<lb/>
The thing that struck Lazear was the two or three weeks that elapsed<lb/>
between the initial case, and the first one to develop from it.<lb/>
Apparently during this period the original case was powerless to<lb/>
spread the infection. His suspicion was strengthened that an in-<lb/>
sect might be involved in the spread of yellow fever, an insect<lb/>
called, in scientific terms, an intermediate host.</p>
<p>Knowledge that insects were the intermediate hosts of cer-<lb/>
tain disease germs was twenty years old. In 1880 Dr. Patrick Man-<lb/>
son had established that a certain kind of mosquito spread elephan-<lb/>
tiasis. First it fed on the blood of a person with the disease,<lb/>
taking the germs into its own body, where they developed for a time<lb/>
then it deposited them in the blood stream of a well person by bit-<lb/>
ing him, thus giving him the matured germs -and the disease. Thir-<lb/>
teen years later Dr. Theobald Smith of the Department<lb/>
of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Industry had demonstrated how a<lb/>
particular kind of tick, by a like process, spread Texas cattle<lb/>
fever. In 1898 Dr. Ronald Ross had shown how the <hi rend="italic">anopheles</hi> mosqui-<lb/>
to similarly spreads malaria. <hi rend="italic">In each of these three cases the in-<lb/>
sect host, even after biting the sick individual, remained harmless<lb/>
for a definite length of time, while the germs it had swallowed<lb/>
ripened, so to speak, inside it</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Only when the germs reached a<lb/>
certain stage of development could the insect convey the in-<lb/>
fection by its bite</hi>.</p>
<p>The insect host theory, Lazear realized, might account for<lb/>
the time that elapsed between the first yellow fever case in a com-<lb/>
munity, and the next: maybe the mosquito bit the first case, re-<lb/>
mained harmless for a couple of weeks while the germs it had swal-<lb/>
221.<lb/>
<pb n="222" id="f06114222"/>
lowed ripened, and, once they were ripe, gave the pest to everyone<lb/>
it bit. It was just a guess, just a possibility, but what an ex-<lb/>
citing one!'</p>
<p>He told Reed about Carter's paper and the train of thought<lb/>
it had suggested to him. Frowning with interest, the older man<lb/>
listened attentively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That does seem to lend color to your favorite theory, La-<lb/>
zear,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;But if an insect host spreads yellow jack,<lb/>
then <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> probably don't -and that <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> do spread it is the<lb/>
one thing that practically every expert agrees on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody agreed that contaminated water was the only cause<lb/>
of typhoid, sir,&rdquo; Lazear pointed out, &ldquo;until your board proved<lb/>
otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You're right, of course,&rdquo; Reed agreed. &ldquo;Popular beliefs<lb/>
aren't necessarily Gospel, even when they're held by scientific<lb/>
men. I'll have a talk with Carter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hadn't<lb/>
Carter<lb/>
left Cuba?</p>
<p>Reed was a good scientist, a man who could change his mind<lb/>
when he had reasons. His talk with Carter was one reason. Then<lb/>
something happened which provided another.</p>
<p>There had been an extraordinary increase in sickness among<lb/>
the soldiers stationed at Pinar del Rio, the capital of the west-<lb/>
ernmost privince of Cuba. The death rate from &ldquo;pernicious malar-<lb/>
ia,&rdquo; as the doctor in charge called it, was remarkably high. Sus-<lb/>
piciously high, it seemed to Captain Stark, acting as chief sur-<lb/>
geon of the district now that Kean had gone home to recuperate.<lb/>
After consulting Reed, Star<del hand="unknown_hand">t</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">k</add> ordered Agramonte to Pinar del Rio<lb/>
to investigate.</p>
<p>Traveling by the narrow gauge railroad across the tropical<lb/>
interior of the island, Agramonte arrived on July 19th and im-<lb/>
222.<lb/>
<pb n="223" id="f06114223"/>
mediately did an autopsy on a &ldquo;malaria&rdquo; victim who had just died.<lb/>
Stark's suspicions were woefully confirmed. The &ldquo;malaria&rdquo; was<lb/>
yellow fever. The post medical officer was hopelessly incom-<lb/>
petent, and the Commanding Officer refused to believe that he had<lb/>
yellow jack at his camp. Agramonte, a contract doctor without<lb/>
authority, wired Stark for official support, and Stark promptly<lb/>
saw to it that he had full authority to enforce precautions. By<lb/>
the time Reed arrived on the 21st, Agramonte had established a tent<lb/>
hospital for yellow fever and put it under quarantine.</p>
<p>The two doctors together questioned everyone who might<lb/>
throw light on the source of the epidemic and examined the sick<lb/>
reports for two months back in an effort to identify the first<lb/>
cases. There had been thirty-five, altogether, with eleven<lb/>
deaths, and the original infection had apparently come from the<lb/>
town of Pinar del Rio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here's the interesting thing,&rdquo; Reed pointed out to<lb/>
his colleague as they sat in their tent working over the records,<lb/>
&ldquo;none of the usual precautions of disinfecting bedding and clothes<lb/>
were taken here, since yellow fever wasn't suspected. Yet you'll<lb/>
notice that the nurses, and the other patients in the wards, and<lb/>
the three men who do the hospital laundry all escaped infection.<lb/>
Some of them, at least, must have been exposed to <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, of course, confirms what we've already observed<lb/>
in Havana and Camp Columbia. It's certainly mys<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">t</add>ifying.&rdquo; Agra-<lb/>
monte, puzzled, twisted the upturned end of his long mustache<lb/>
and ran an agitated hand through his dark pompadour. &ldquo;And then<lb/>
the guardhouse case, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one, I think,&rdquo; Reed spoke slowly and carefully,<lb/>
&ldquo;presents our problem very nicely. Here we have a soldier,&rdquo; he<lb/>
223.<lb/>
<pb n="224" id="f06114224"/>
placed a penny on the table, &ldquo;under close guard for six days with<lb/>
eight other men.&rdquo; He arranged eight coins around the penny and<lb/>
traced an imaginary line around them with his finger. &ldquo;Neither<lb/>
he, nor any of them, has been in contact with a case of yellow<lb/>
fever, or with <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi>. Our soldier, and he alone, gets yellow<lb/>
jack; he dies, poor fellow,&rdquo; Reed flipped the penny back in his<lb/>
pocket, &ldquo;after six more days, and his eight cell mates remain in<lb/>
perfect health. Now, how did the infection get to this one man,<lb/>
and how did it happen to spare the rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agramonte sighed. &ldquo;It looks as if yellow jack just flew<lb/>
in the window and tagged him, and flew out again,&rdquo; he said, discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that's what it did do, doctor,&rdquo; Reed said thought-<lb/>
fully, &ldquo;and maybe a mosquito brought it. Dr. Finlay's theory looks<lb/>
much less incredible to me today than it did a month ago. We must<lb/>
see him as soon as we return to Havana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On August <del hand="unknown_hand">first,</del> 1st, shortly after the return of Reed and<lb/>
Agramonte from Pinar del Rio, the board again met on the veranda<lb/>
of the officers' quarters. Reed described the epidemic they had<lb/>
just investigated, and told them <del hand="unknown_hand">in full detail</del> of their obser-<lb/>
vations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;we've seen that nurses<lb/>
and others who come in close contact with <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> are no more like-<lb/>
ly than anybody else to get yellow jack; and in this guard house<lb/>
case we've seen that a man who had no contact at all with <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi><lb/>
somehow picked up a fatal case. These facts suggest that <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi><lb/>
probably don't spread the fever, and that something else does.<lb/>
What?&rdquo; He smiled at Lazear, who was listening eagerly. &ldquo;Our best<lb/>
bet, I think, it a mosquito. Dr. Carter's paper suggests an in-<lb/>
sect host: and all the circumstances surrounding an epidemic -<lb/>
224.<lb/>
<pb n="225" id="f06114225"/>
low, moist location, warm weather, the way the disease skips around -<lb/>
suggest that the mosquito <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be the carrier. It seems to me now<lb/>
that we should tackle our problem from a new angle -try to find<lb/>
out how the germ is spread, rather than what it is. We must prove,<lb/>
or disprove, an insect host.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to do that,&rdquo; Lazear interposed quietly, &ldquo;we will<lb/>
have to experiment on human beings, as you and the Surgeon General<lb/>
foresaw. Unless, Agramonte......?&rdquo; he ended on a question.</p>
<p>Agramonte shook his head. &ldquo;No. I've been trying them<lb/>
all -guinea pigs, dogs, cats, rats, even a rhesus monkey I got in<lb/>
town. I can't infect any of them. My results are all negative,<lb/>
just like General Sternberg's. I think yellow jack likes only<lb/>
human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it appears,&rdquo; Reed agreed. &ldquo;No one has ever succeeded<lb/>
in giving it to a laboratory animal. I don't have to point out to<lb/>
you the dreadful responsibility we all assume in experimenting with<lb/>
men's lives,&rdquo; he went on.<lb/>
&ldquo;If we lose any cases we'll be ruined, branded as murderers. But<lb/>
if we find out how yellow fever is spread, the benefit we'll con-<lb/>
fer on humanity will make the risk, grave as it is, seem trivial.<lb/>
Hundreds, sometimes thousands, of lives are lost every year, and<lb/>
a huge amount of valuable property is destroyed. By risking a<lb/>
dozen lives we may be able to put a stop to that forever. Do you<lb/>
think we can take such a chance to gain such an end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don't see how there can be any question about it,&rdquo; Car-<lb/>
roll said. &ldquo;I think, though, that the board members must take<lb/>
the first risk. We can't expect other men to do it if we don't.<lb/>
Agramonte, you're immune, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agramonte s<del hand="unknown_hand">g</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">h</add>rugged. &ldquo;Perhaps. I don't know. Many Cubans<lb/>
225.<lb/>
<pb n="226" id="f06114226"/>
are, from unrecognized light cases in childhood. I wasn't much<lb/>
more than a baby when we went to the United States, so it's poss-<lb/>
ible that I've never had it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In any case,&rdquo; Reed asked them, &ldquo;we're all agreed to make<lb/>
the first experiments on ourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agreement was unanimous. Carroll smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow, Major,&rdquo; he said to Reed, &ldquo;I can't feel very alarmed<lb/>
at the prospect. It's going to take a lot of proof to convince<lb/>
me that <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> aren't responsible. Even the Surgeon General's sure<lb/>
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll see,&rdquo; Lazear grinned happily. He was delighted at<lb/>
the new turn in the work.</p>
<p>In the end they agreed that <del hand="unknown_hand">and</del> Reed should supervise all<lb/>
the work; Lazear, because of his experience with malarial mosqui-<lb/>
toes, should do all the mosquito work; Carroll should continue<lb/>
the earlier line of bacteriological investigation; and Agramonte,<lb/>
whose time was already filled by his duties at the Military Hos-<lb/>
pital in Havana, should do autopsies and pathological study. The<lb/>
first move would be to call on Finlay and ask him about the mos-<lb/>
quito.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Dr. Carlos Finlay, trying to prove that mosquitoes carried<lb/>
yellow fever, had made about a hundred experimental efforts to in-<lb/>
oculate human beings. His results had been unconvincing, since he<lb/>
had not guarded the subjects of his experiments against other<lb/>
sources of infection. Only his wife and his assistant, Dr. Claudio<lb/>
Delgado, believed in his theory. Yet, although he had not sup-<lb/>
ported it by convincing demonstration, he had good reasons, based<lb/>
on the observation of many epidemics, for holding it. It explained<lb/>
226.<lb/>
<pb n="227" id="f06114227"/>
the frequently <del hand="unknown_hand">marked</del> remarked presence of mosquitoes during an<lb/>
epidemic; the fact that the epidemic, along with the mosquitoes,<lb/>
disappeared with the first cool weather; that the disease existed<lb/>
only near water and in warm weather; that it moved jumpily, often<lb/>
skipping over houses occupied by non-immunes and attacking people<lb/>
who had had no contact with the sick or with <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi>; that no<lb/>
sanitary measures had ever been able to arrest it; and that the<lb/>
high and breezy sections of a city were not subject to it, even<lb/>
though it might be flourishing along the waterfront.</p>
<p>Finlay had been a middle-aged man when he first advanced<lb/>
his theory. Now he was sixty-seven, with white side whiskers and<lb/>
a benevolent face. The son of a French mother and a Scottish<lb/>
father, he had been born in Cuba, and educated in France, England,<lb/>
Havana and the United States. As a medical student at Jefferson<lb/>
College in Philadelphia, he had made a friend of S. Weir Mitchell,<lb/>
a distinguished doctor noted also as a writer of historical novels.<lb/>
All through his life he had many friends among the top rank <del hand="unknown_hand">men<lb/>
of the medical profession</del> <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">doctors</add> in the United States. Although everyone<lb/>
smiled at his theory, the smile was kindly: his personality was<lb/>
gentle and endearing, and his professional standing was high.</p>
<p>The board members found the elderly Cuban doctor in the<lb/>
study of his pleasant home in suburban Vedado. When he heard that<lb/>
they proposed to test his beloved theory, all the more cherished<lb/>
for the ridicule it had always drawn, his kindly face lighted<lb/>
with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am perfectly sure, gentlemen,&rdquo; Finlay told them, and<lb/>
in his delight and earnestness his slight stammer became a shade<lb/>
more pronounced, &ldquo;that you will end by convincing yourselves. If<lb/>
only you can also convince the rest of the profession, and the<lb/>
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>227.</p>
<pb n="228" id="f06114228"/>
<p>&ldquo;It's your opinion, isn't it, Dr. Finlay,&rdquo; Reed asked,<lb/>
&ldquo;that only one type of mosquito spreads the malady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. The female of <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Fasciatus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pungens</hi><lb/>
are the common mosquitoes down here, and <hi rend="italic">pungens</hi> is harmless -in<lb/>
yellow fever, anyway. Our villainess is an interesting little crea-<lb/>
ture, with distinctive habits. She's a <del hand="unknown_hand">day time</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">daytime</add> mosquito and does<lb/>
not bite after dark. The male doesn't suck blood at all, and the<lb/>
female does it only after mating -she has to have a meal of blood<lb/>
before she <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">can</add> lay<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del> her eggs. I have some here.&rdquo; He took a bowl, part-<lb/>
ly full of water, from the window sill and set it on the table<lb/>
before them. Leaning over it, the doctors saw a number of tiny,<lb/>
jet black cylinders clinging to the side of the bowl where e-<lb/>
vaporation of the water had left them stranded. <del hand="unknown_hand">&ldquo;If you look at<lb/>
them under a microscope,&rdquo; Finlay went on, &ldquo;you'll see that their<lb/>
surface is made up of fairly regular six-sided plates, each with<lb/>
a little round bump in its center.&rdquo;</del></p>
<p>Lazear picked one of the tiny eggs up and rolled it between<lb/>
his fingers thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do they breed, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rainbarrels, the pan of water you put on the porch for<lb/>
the dog, a sagging gutter, a vase of flowers that's been standing<lb/>
in your parlor -any container holding stagnant water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she's not a roughneck like <hi rend="italic">anopheles</hi>? She's more a<lb/>
domestic mosquito, and you don't find her in swamps and woods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finlay beamed. &ldquo;That's right. She's a fragile, domestic<lb/>
little thing. She sticks close to the house. Her wings are deli-<lb/>
cate, and she can't stand wind. She's rather striking looking, too,<lb/>
handsomely striped across the back and legs. You've undoubtedly<lb/>
noticed plenty of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all nodded <del hand="unknown_hand">ruefully</del>. It was impossible not to notice<lb/>
228.<lb/>
<pb n="229" id="f06114229"/>
mosquitoes in Cuba unless you were armor<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">-</add>plated.</p>
<p>Finlay was absorbed in his subject, and thrilled to meet,<lb/>
after almost twenty years, serious attention instead of good-<lb/>
natured skepticism. He explained how the female lays her eggs, at<lb/>
night, on the surface of the water; and how the eggs, very resis-<lb/>
tant to outside influences, can be hatched even after drying for<lb/>
three months or freezing, when restored to proper conditions of<lb/>
warmth and moisture. It took them, he told <del hand="unknown_hand">the</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">his</add> attentive audience,<lb/>
about three days to hatch; the larva stage lasted about a week;<lb/>
and the pupa, usually called the &ldquo;wiggler,&rdquo; lasted to more days.<lb/>
Then you had the full grown mosquito, ready to mate, bite, lay, <del hand="unknown_hand">-</del><lb/>
and, if it had bitten a yellow fever case, to spread yellow jack.</p>
<p>When they left, Finlay gave them the bowl of mosquito eggs<lb/>
and promised to help them in any way he could.</p>
<p>Reed had to smile at Lazear's elation. Carrying the little<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">black</del> bowl as though it held a million dollars, he looked as if<lb/>
he could hardly keep from skipping. What a dear, enthusiastic<lb/>
fellow, Reed thought warmly, and what a keen man -here was one who<lb/>
would make his mark in the scientific world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look as though you'd swallowed the canary, Lazear,&rdquo;<lb/>
he teased him. &ldquo;You know, there may be nothing in it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lazear laughed. &ldquo;We're on the right track, Major, and<lb/>
I believe you're convinced of it yourself. Cheer up, Carroll,<lb/>
we've as good as got yellow jack in our pockets already. You won't<lb/>
be skeptical much longer.&rdquo;</p>

<head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
<p>Reed had been worrying about the typhoid study. Shortly<lb/>
before he was to have met Vaughan in Atlantic City to write the re-<lb/>
port, Shakespeare had died. The board had not yet published any-<lb/>
thing except its recommendations on the Army's sanitary reorganiz-<lb/>
ation. Reed therefore requested Sternberg to order him back to the<lb/>
United States so that he and Vaughan could, finally, announce their<lb/>
conclusions in a formal report. Sternberg did so, and the first<lb/>
week in August, just after the visit to Finlay, Reed returned to<lb/>
Washington, traveling on a transport with Truby, who was able to<lb/>
230.<lb/>
<pb n="231" id="f06114231"/>
cheer him somewhat during his usual seasickness.</p>
<p>The Quemados epidemic was subsiding, so the three remaining<lb/>
members of the board had to rely on the cases which kept coming into<lb/>
Las Animas and Military Hospital Number one in Havana. Lazear had<lb/>
hatched the eggs given them by Finlay and sent some of the mosquitoes<lb/>
for further information to Dr. L.O. Howard, the insect expert who<lb/>
was head of the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Entomology. With<lb/>
the mosquitoes he kept, and their offspring, <del hand="unknown_hand">he</del> Lazear made almost dai-<lb/>
ly trips to Las Animas where, <del hand="unknown_hand">accompanied by</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">with</add> Guiteras or Agramonte<lb/>
or Carroll, he would go into the yellow fever ward and feed his &ldquo;birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The technique, which Finlay had worked out, was simple. Each<lb/>
mosquito was carried in a test tube stoppered with a piece of gauze.<lb/>
When he was going to feed one, Lazear would turn the test tube upside<lb/>
down so that the mosquito flew upward, toward its bottom. He would<lb/>
then pull the stopper and press the open end against a patient's arm<lb/>
or abdomen. When the mosquito had settled and drawn blood, Lazear<lb/>
would tap the tube, causing it to fly up again, and replace the gauze.<lb/>
Each tube was label<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del>ed, and Lazear kept careful track of each biting.</p>
<p>Being reluctant to introduce mosquitoes of whose dangerous<lb/>
powers he was already half convinced among Camp Columbia's fourteen<lb/>
hundred non-immunes, He kept them at Agramonte's laboratory and<lb/>
carried them in their test tubes to and from Las Animas, where he<lb/>
tried to infect them.</p>
<p>Pinto, one of the Camp Columbia doctors, was bitten by these<lb/>
presumably infected mosquitoes without result. On August 16th La-<lb/>
zear himself fed one that twelve days earlier had bitten a victim on<lb/>
the fifth day of his attack. Altogether, nine men volunteered for the<lb/>
experiment and were bitten. Nothing happened. Finlay was upset -<lb/>
surely it was the technique of the board, not his precious theory,<lb/>
231.<lb/>
<pb n="232" id="f06114232"/>
that was at fault. The Cuban doctors, who earlier had watched their<lb/>
own &ldquo;mosquito man&rdquo; try similar experiments, observed the efforts of<lb/>
the American board with keen, and skeptical, interest. When the<lb/>
insects failed to produce any infections, it began to look, even<lb/>
to Lazear, as though the skepticism, rather than the interest, was<lb/>
justified.</p>
<p>His scruples about taking the mosquitoes to Camp Columbia<lb/>
dwindled. Apparently they were not dangerous; even if they were,<lb/>
he could trust the hospital steward assigned to his laboratory, John<lb/>
Neate, an intelligent and capable man, to take conscientious care of<lb/>
them.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was after lunch on the 27th of August, and Carroll and La-<lb/>
zear were at work in the Camp Columbia laboratory. Lazear was<lb/>
preparing the stomach of a mosquito for microscopic study, and<lb/>
Carroll, at the work bench, was examining <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">a</add> blood <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">culture</add> that he had got<lb/>
three days earlier in Agramonte's autopsy room. The little rhesus<lb/>
monkey, <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">which</add> had resisted Agramonte's efforts to infect him, watched<lb/>
the two scientists with alert and meaningless curiosity and scratched<lb/>
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn't seem to be a very fruitful line of investigation,<lb/>
so far at least, you'll have to admit,&rdquo; Carroll was remarking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's far from exhausted when we've made only nine<lb/>
tries,&rdquo; Lazear argued, scowling into the eye piece of his microscope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's one hundred percent failure,&rdquo; Carroll observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, and it's discouraging,&rdquo; Lazear admitted. &ldquo;that re-<lb/>
minds me -I was in a hurry before lunch and didn't leave my mos-<lb/>
quitoes at Agramonte's lab. One of them didn't bite at Las Animas -<lb/>
seemed listless. I'd hate to lose her.&rdquo; He went over to the<lb/>
232.<lb/>
<pb n="233" id="f06114233"/>
bench where the mosquitoes, each transferred to a large jar from<lb/>
the test tube in which she<del hand="unknown_hand">travelled</del> traveled, were kept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She's looking dopey, all right. Too bad.&rdquo; He took<lb/>
his little record book out of his pocket, and <del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">c</add>onsulted it. "<lb/>
&ldquo;Twelve days ago she bit a case <del hand="unknown_hand">of</del> in its second day. The<del hand="unknown_hand">y</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add> she<lb/>
bit <del hand="unknown_hand">four</del> cases again on the 21st and <del hand="unknown_hand">on the</del> 23rd and <del hand="unknown_hand">last time<lb/>
on the</del> 25th. If there's anything in this theory of Finlay's she<lb/>
ought to be well loaded with yellow jack after all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carroll left his microscope and walked over to look at the<lb/>
ailing insect. &ldquo;Maybe she is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How about trying her<lb/>
out on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may give you yellow fever,&rdquo; Lazear warned him soberly.</p>
<p>Carroll smiled. &ldquo;I'm seriously afraid, old man, that<lb/>
there's not much danger of it. Whatever risk there is, I'm will-<lb/>
ing to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The top of the jar was covered with a gauze sleeve closed<lb/>
by a <del hand="unknown_hand">draw string</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">drawstring</add>. Reaching in, Lazear captured the mosquito in<lb/>
a test tube and brought her out. Carroll rolled up his sleeve<lb/>
and sat on a high stool, while Lazear held the mouth of the tube<lb/>
to his arm.</p>
<p>The mosquito clung to the side for a moment, then dropped<lb/>
onto Carroll<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del>'s skin. Lazear, his face intent, watched her and<lb/>
held the tube steady so as not to disturb her. The mosquito sat<lb/>
motionless. No one spoke. Neate move<del hand="unknown_hand">r</del>d closer to see, and the<lb/>
monkey in a sudden frenzy of activity sprang screeching across<lb/>
his cage. Carroll, perched uncomfortably on the stool, shifted<lb/>
a little and the mosquito hopped and settled again.</p>
<p>Lazear sighed. &ldquo;It looks as if she wouldn't bite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; Carroll suggested, &ldquo;let me hold it a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>233.</p>
<pb n="234" id="f06114234"/>
<p>Lazear relinquished the tube. Carroll held it a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>The mosquito, her legs drawn up, had assumed her biting<lb/>
position and introduced her sting. When she finished, Lazear put<lb/>
her back in the jar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is going to make a monkey out of you, Lazear,&rdquo; Car-<lb/>
roll assured him good-humoredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost hope it does,&rdquo; Lazear answered seriously. &ldquo;I'd<lb/>
hate to think I'd given you yellow jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two afternoons later, Carroll didn't finish the tour of the<lb/>
Las Animas ward with Lazear and Agramonte. &ldquo;I'll wait for you on<lb/>
the porch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm feeling rather used up today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next evening Lazear telephoned Agramonte. His voice<lb/>
sounded strained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Carroll's sick,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;He went swimming at the<lb/>
beach this afternoon, and had a chill when he got back.&rdquo; He<lb/>
paused, and added, &ldquo;He thinks he's got a touch of malaria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose I come out in the morning,&rdquo; Agramonte suggested,<lb/>
&ldquo;and we'll take a look at his blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Agramonte arrived at the camp he found Carroll in the<lb/>
laboratory examining his blood for the malaria plasmodium. He<lb/>
did not find it. His friends made him go to bed in the officers'<lb/>
quarters. Two days later he was carried off to the yellow fever<lb/>
ward, feebly insisting that he must have picked up his yellow jack<lb/>
in Agramonte's dead room or the Las Animas ward.</p>
<p>Neither Agramonte nor Lazear doub<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">t</add>ed that Carroll's attack<lb/>
was due to the mosquito bite. Agramonte was almost bowled over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lazear,&rdquo; he exclaimed solemnly, &ldquo;do you realize what<lb/>
234.<lb/>
<pb n="235" id="f06114235"/>
this means? You, <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, have produced the first case of yellow fe-<lb/>
ver experimentally, by the bite of a mosquito! It's momentous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lazear was distraught. Maybe he had produced the first case<lb/>
of experimental yellow fever on record, but maybe he had killed<lb/>
his colleague doing it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <hi rend="italic">offered</hi> to feed it,&rdquo; he exclaimed repeatedly. &ldquo;It<lb/>
was his own idea. He even held the test tube himself!<lb/>
How can I forgive myself if he doesn't get well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agramonte tried to comfort him. &ldquo;Take it easy, old man.<lb/>
Ames will bring him through.&rdquo; He hoped his words didn't sound<lb/>
hollow. Carroll, rather frail at best, was dangerously sick, and<lb/>
yellow fever went hard with a man past forty. They were both get-<lb/>
ting a new idea of what it meant to assume the terrible respon-<lb/>
sibility of taking chances with another man's life.</p>
<p>But when the next opportunity for human experimentation<lb/>
came, Lazear did not shirk it, even though the outcome of<lb/>
Carroll's illness was still doubtful.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>On the morning of August 31st, Private William H. Dean of<lb/>
the Seventh Cavalry strolled, with nothing much on his mind, past<lb/>
the laboratory. He saw the bearded doctor, the nice young one,<lb/>
standing in the doorway, trying to persuade a mosquito to go from<lb/>
one test tube to another.</p>
<p>Dean saluted. &ldquo;You still fooling with mosquitoes, sir?&rdquo;<lb/>
he asked. It was certainly funny, he thought, the things grown<lb/>
men did for a living.</p>
<p>Lazear admitted he was. Learning that Dean had not been<lb/>
outside the camp or exposed to any infection for many days, he<lb/>
235.<lb/>
<pb n="236" id="f06114236"/>
explained the risk to him fully and asked if he would take a bite.<lb/>
Dean said he wouldn't mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is serious, you understand, Dean,&rdquo; Lazear warned. &ldquo;This<lb/>
one here,&rdquo; he showed the young man the mosquito sitting innocently<lb/>
on the side of its jar, &ldquo;I truly believed almost killed Dr. Carroll,<lb/>
and can do as much -or more -for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's all right, sir,&rdquo; Dean was skeptical. &ldquo;I'm not afraid<lb/>
of any little old gnat. Put him on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her,&rdquo; Lazear corrected him mechanically, as he reached in the<lb/>
jar and captured the mosquito. He applied that insect and three<lb/>
others to the doubting cavalryman's arm.</p>
<p>Seven days later Dean joined Carroll in the yellow fever ward.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Reed ran up the steps of the brick building at Seventh and<lb/>
B Streets. Beechner, the museum messenger, looked after him as<lb/>
he strode briskly into his office, and reflected that it was nice<lb/>
to see the major looking cheerful again -he had seemed so wor-<lb/>
ried for a while over Dr. Carroll.</p>
<p>The major had reason to feel cheerful. The preliminary ty-<lb/>
phoid report was finished. Carroll was out of danger and writing<lb/>
glowing letters about his recovery; convinced by Dean's case,<lb/>
he was proud, too, that his was the first case of experimental<lb/>
yellow fever on record. Dean's illness, which seemed almost<lb/>
certainly due to mosquitoes, was mild and progressing satisfac-<lb/>
torily. How, if only Lazear would get well fast! It had been<lb/>
a shock to learn that he had an attack. But he was only thirty-<lb/>
four, in good health, and under <del hand="unknown_hand">Ame's</del> Ames' excellent care he<lb/>
should pull out of it easily, Reed thought confidently.</p>
<p>He reached for the stationery and looked at the calendar.<lb/>
236.<lb/>
<pb n="237" id="f06114237"/>
&ldquo;September 25th, 1900,&rdquo; he wrote in his clear, quick hand. &ldquo;Dear<lb/>
Kean:.... I am so distressed to hear that Lazear is down with yel-<lb/>
low fever.... I shall await your next [cable] with much anxiety....<lb/>
I somehow feel that Lazear will pull through, as he is such a good,<lb/>
brave fellow.&rdquo; He frowned and moved impatiently as he wrote on.<lb/>
&ldquo;I am so ashamed of myself for being here in a safe country while<lb/>
my associates have been coming down with Yellow Jack. The<lb/>
[Surgeon] General has suggested that I do not return, but somehow<lb/>
I feel that as the senior member of a Board investigating yellow<lb/>
fever my place is in Cuba....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how far Carroll's and Lazear's cases go to support<lb/>
that conclusion [that a mosquito carrie<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add> yellow fever] I don't<lb/>
know, but hope to find out when I get there. Personally, I feel<lb/>
that we are on the eve of an important &lsquo;find&rsquo;.....&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were, but Lazear did not share it with them. Toward<lb/>
evening that same day he died.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Reed arrived at Camp Columbia about noon on October 4th.<lb/>
This time the greetings on the veranda of the officers' quarters<lb/>
were subdued. The shadow of Lazear's death was too heavy for any<lb/>
gai<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">e</add>ty. None of the younger men had ever before seen Reed look<lb/>
so sad and stern. In this tired<del hand="unknown_hand">,</del> face there was no hint of the<lb/>
quick smile, the kindly humor, that usually made the blue eyes<lb/>
sparkle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You've heard about Lazear,&rdquo; Truby stated. There was no<lb/>
need to ask. Truby himself had returned to Cuba just a few days<lb/>
before his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We touched at Matanzas yesterday,&rdquo; Reed explained.</p>
<p>Truby nodded. Kean and Havard, the Chief Surgeon of Cuba,<lb/>
237.<lb/>
<pb n="238" id="f06114238"/>
had gone there on an inspection trip. They, of course, had met<lb/>
Reed and told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'd like to see Carroll, first of all, Ames,&rdquo; Reed re-<lb/>
quested.</p>
<p>When he rejoined the others on the porch, he looked almost<lb/>
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was quite unprepared for Carroll,&rdquo; he said wearily.<lb/>
&ldquo;His letters have been so cheerful, so full of energy -he even<lb/>
said he'd done an autopsy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were lucky to save him,&rdquo; Ames said. &ldquo;He came within<lb/>
an inch of goi<del hand="unknown_hand">og</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">ng</add> out, and he's still quite shattered. He didn't<lb/>
want to worry you, Major, with the news that he<lb/>
wasn't convalescing well, and he's been terribly anxious to<lb/>
spare his wife <del hand="unknown_hand">anxiety.</del> alarm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We'll have to send him home on sick leave as soon as<lb/>
he can travel. Now I'd like to have the details of<lb/>
these cases, particularly poor Lazear's.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They first suspected Lazear wasn't feeling well, Ames<lb/>
and Truby told him, when he missed a couple of meals. But he<lb/>
went about his work and didn't complain until the evening of<lb/>
September 18th, when he had a chill. Ames, Truby and Pinto had<lb/>
immediately diagnosed his illness as yellow fever, and had him<lb/>
carried on a litter to the isolation ward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what a reticent fellow he was, Major,&rdquo; Ames<lb/>
said. &ldquo;All he'<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">d</add> say was that he &lsquo;might&rsquo; have got it from a mos-<lb/>
quito. Although now that I come to think of it, he made quite<lb/>
a point of telling Carroll and Major Gorgas when they visited<lb/>
him that a mosquito bit him on the hand in the ward at Las Ani-<lb/>
mas on the 13th. He didn't bother to brush it off because he<lb/>
238.<lb/>
<pb n="239" id="f06114239"/>
didn't suppose it was a <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>, he said; anyway, he<lb/>
thought he was immune -he was bitten in August, you know, and<lb/>
nothing happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed nodded thoughtfully. It occurred to him that it<lb/>
was strange that a man as familiar with <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi> as La-<lb/>
zear should &ldquo;suppose&rdquo; the mosquito was not of that species. Sure-<lb/>
ly, he would <hi rend="italic">know</hi>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see all Lazear's records,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Reed, going over Lazear's papers, struggled between<lb/>
depression and elation. Lazear,-dear, brilliant Lazear, the first<lb/>
man on the board to scent the mosquito clue -was dead; and Car-<lb/>
roll, his almost indispensable assistant, was too ill <del hand="unknown_hand">now</del> to work<lb/>
on the probability so strikingly and disastrously revealed.</p>
<p>But the probability was almost a certainty! The secret<lb/>
of yellow jack was in their grasp, Reed was sure. He was con-<lb/>
fident now that <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi> spread the fever. Of course,<lb/>
Lazear's and Carroll's cases were not conclusive, since both had<lb/>
repeatedly been exposed to possible infection in the wards and<lb/>
the autopsy room; but Dean's case was a different story.</p>
<p>He had been outside of Camp Columbia only once<del hand="unknown_hand">in the</del><lb/>
in the last fifty-seven days, and then just for a short horseback<lb/>
ride toward the shore. It seemed that he could have contracted<lb/>
the disease only through the mosquitoes that Lazear put on him.<lb/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">There was no other possible way in which he could have picked<lb/>
it up.</del></p>
<p>Sitting at the portable field desk in his two room<lb/>
suite in the officers' quarters, Reed frowned, puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if a mosquito does carry yellow fever, why didn't<lb/>
239.<lb/>
<pb n="240" id="f06114240"/>
the first nine experimental bitings produce a single case?&rdquo; he<lb/>
wondered. &ldquo;Certainly not because the volunteers all happened to<lb/>
be immune; Lazear was one of them -his case settles that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where was the explanation?</p>
<p>Reed searched Lazear's papers for his records of<lb/>
the bitings. In the little notebook that the dead doctor had al-<lb/>
ways carried in his military blouse pocket, he found the answer.</p>
<p>Lazear had carefully recorded, in each experiment, how<lb/>
far along the yellow fever case was when the mosquito fed on it,<lb/>
and how many days then elapsed until the insect bit a volunteer.<lb/>
Studying the rows of figures, Reed's well trained mind suddenly<lb/>
caught at the critical point. There was the answer, staring at<lb/>
him out of the neat figures written in a dead man's hand! How<lb/>
obvious, how beautifully simple, it was! Eagerly he checked t<lb/>
through the figures again, to be sure he had made no mistake.<lb/>
No, that must be it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;A yellow fever victim has the active agent of the disease<lb/>
circulating in his blood stream <hi rend="italic">only in the first two or three<lb/>
days of his illness</hi>! After that, even when he's dying, it's gone,&rdquo;<lb/>
he exclaimed aloud, slowly. &ldquo;And at least twelve days must elapse<lb/>
between the time the mosquito bites a yellow fever case in its<lb/>
early stage, and the time it can pass on yellow jack to the next<lb/>
vict<del hand="unknown_hand">o</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">i</add>m. I thank God, I believe that this is our answer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nine experiments that had failed had been performed<lb/>
with mosquitoes that had bitten yellow fever cases at least five<lb/>
days old, or with insects that had fed on yellow jack less<lb/>
than twelve days earlier. Finlay's hundred failures, and Lazear's<lb/>
nine, were explained. Lazear's success with Carroll and Dean, too,<lb/>
was explained. The mosquito that bit Carroll had fed on a yellow<lb/>
240.<lb/>
<pb n="241" id="f06114241"/>
fever patient in the second day of his illness; it had bitten<lb/>
the skeptical doctor twelve days later, and the incredulous<lb/>
cavalryman four days after that. It had met all the conditions.</p>
<p>What agency spreads yellow fever, and how does it work<lb/>
was a question two hundred and fifty years old. Walter Reed,<lb/>
studying Lazear's pocket notebook that October afternoon, hit<lb/>
on the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only,&rdquo; he thought sadly, &ldquo;Lazear could be with us<lb/>
still! But even if he can't share our work any more, at least<lb/>
he shall always share the credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>There was something curious about the notebook, Reed<lb/>
noticed: its final entries were incomplete, and they seemed to<lb/>
indicate that Lazear had himself secretly undergone experimental<lb/>
bitings. It was not like Lazear, an accurate scientist, to keep<lb/>
incomplete records; nor, for that matter, was it like an accur-<lb/>
ate scientist, who knew the danger involved, to allow himself<lb/>
to be bitten by an unidentified mosquito. How account for these<lb/>
two strangely unscientific pieces of carelessness? Reed could<lb/>
think of only one explanation: both were deliberate.</p>
<p>When he confided his suspicion to Truby and one or two<lb/>
others, they agreed with him: Lazear, realizing that he had<lb/>
given Carroll and Dean yellow fever, determined to take the same<lb/>
risk to which he had subjected them. He must have inoculated<lb/>
himself secretly; then, ill, he had worried lest his insurance be<lb/>
for<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">f</add>eited and his wife and two small children left destitute, if<lb/>
it became known that he had purposely exposed himself to a dan-<lb/>
gerous disease. He had decided, they guessed, to withhold the<lb/>
241.<lb/>
<pb n="242" id="f06114242"/>
facts, and had told Gorgas and Carroll about the stray mosquito<lb/>
so as to lend the fatal experiment the air of accident.</p>
<p>If Lazear wanted his death to appear an accident, an ac-<lb/>
cident it should appear. They would respect their dead<lb/>
friend's unspoken wish, and help to protect his family. This bene-<lb/>
volent conspiracy of silence remained in force for more than forty<lb/>
years. Not until the danger feared by the dying doc-<lb/>
tor was long past were the facts revealed, even to his family.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Reed cast aside his usual deliberation and worked like a<lb/>
whirlwind writing a report of these first yellow fever experi-<lb/>
ments. He was to leave for the United States October 13th to at-<lb/>
tend the meeting of the American Public Health Association at In-<lb/>
dianapolis, where he intended to read it. Before going, he had,<lb/>
as a formality, to ask the military governor's permission to<lb/>
leave the island, and Kean offered to drive him into Havana to<lb/>
see Wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why I borrowed the general's team and am<lb/>
going to the city with you?&rdquo; <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">Kean asked as the carriage, driven by Fitzhugh Lee's fine<lb/>
horses, rolled along the road.</add></p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Kean, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something serious to talk to you about, Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to persuade you to ask General Wood for a<lb/>
considerable sum of money to pay the expenses of a series of<lb/>
yellow fever experiments, and give bonuses to volunteers. That<lb/>
way I believe you can get a number of Spanish immigrants to of-<lb/>
fer themselves, especially since they almost always expect an<lb/>
attack when they come to Cuba.&rdquo;</p>
<p>242.</p>
<pb n="243" id="f06114243"/>
<p>Reed wouldn't commit himself, and all the way to General<lb/>
Wood's office Kean wondered what he would do.</p>
<p>Wood's greeting was cordial. Reed received permission to<lb/>
leave the following day for the United States. Then he said,<lb/>
&ldquo;General, I have something else I want to discuss with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two officers moved into the window embrasure which<lb/>
looked over the plaza and the blue harbor, flanked on the one side<lb/>
by Morro Castle and on the other by La Fuerze, forts harmless with<lb/>
antiquity.</p>
<p>Kean, silently watching, caught the quick sense of a histor-<lb/>
ic moment. This informal meeting in the old Governor's Palace<lb/>
between the Army doctor and the military governor could change<lb/>
the medical history of the world, the course of<lb/>
millions of lives. Reed, slender and animated, confronted the<lb/>
massive Wood and told him, with the irresistible clarity already<lb/>
familiar to his former pupil, about the three yellow fever<lb/>
cases. Wood's cool blue eyes did not shift, nor his expression<lb/>
change, as he listened. Reed, his eyes sprakling with enthusi-<lb/>
asm, summed up the evidence. He paused a moment, and said very<lb/>
earnestly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Wood, will you give me ten thousand dollars to<lb/>
continue and complete these experiments? I know we have the<lb/>
answer, but we must have conclusive proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wood's answer was unhesitating. &ldquo;I have this morning<lb/>
signed a warrant for that amount to aid the police in the capture<lb/>
of criminals. Surely this work is of more importance to Cuba<lb/>
than the catching of a few thieves. I will give you ten thousand<lb/>
dollars. If that isn't enough, I will give you ten thousand more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed and Kean, toasting their success in a bottle of claret<lb/>
243.<lb/>
<pb n="244" id="f06114244"/>
at lunch, congratulated each other that the military governor was<lb/>
also a medical man who could appreciate the vast implications of<lb/>
the proposed experiments.</p>
<p>Two days later, on October 15th, Kean issued a circular<lb/>
for the departments of Havana and Pinar del Rio, of which he was<lb/>
chief surgeon, stating that it was now believed that mosquitoes<lb/>
spread yellow fever and directing that their breeding places be<lb/>
eliminated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Kean, I'm a little worried,&rdquo; General Lee told him<lb/>
confidentially. He was a short, fat man with a little goatee.<lb/>
He had known Kean's father well, and was devoted to the son.<lb/>
&ldquo;This <del hand="unknown_hand">nothing</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">notion</add> of Reed's about mosquitoes -I hope you won't iden-<lb/>
tify yourself with it. If you'd seen as many yellow fever<lb/>
theories come and go as I have,&rdquo; he shook his head, &ldquo;you'd hesi-<lb/>
tate a long time before you'd commit yourself. If it blows up<lb/>
under you, it can damage your professional standing badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Lee,&rdquo; Kean assured him, &ldquo;I'm willing to risk<lb/>
all the professional standing I may ever have on the theory that<lb/>
the mosquito is the villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>244.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="22" id="d27"><pb n="245" id="f06114245"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXII</head>

<p>Reed's announcement at the Public Health meeting of his<lb/>
belief that mosquitoes spread yellow fever set no rivers afire -<lb/>
too many claims had been advanced in the past few years, only to<lb/>
be scrapped later. His case was far from established, he knew.<lb/>
One clear demonstration, Dean's, was not enough to break down<lb/>
error entrenched for half a century. It would take the series of<lb/>
experiments, conducted on human subjects, for which Wood had pro-<lb/>
mised funds, to establish this revolutionary theory beyond question.</p>
<p>245.</p>
<pb n="246" id="f06114246"/>
<p>After consultations with Sternberg, the insect expert <del hand="unknown_hand">Dr.</del><lb/>
Howard, Welch and other Hopkins friends, Reed hurried back to Cuba,<lb/>
where he landed the end of October. He immediately set to work on<lb/>
plans <del hand="unknown_hand">for</del> to establish an isolation camp for his experiments. <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">Camp Lazear, it was to be called, in honor of their dead colleague.</add></p>
<p>On the opposite side of the Calzada Real from Camp Colum-<lb/>
bia, about a mile from Quemados, was the farm of Dr. Ignacio Rojas.<lb/>
Agramonte thought one of his uncultivated fields would be a good<lb/>
place for the camp. Reed, seeing<del hand="unknown_hand">,</del> it, agreed, and they rented it.<lb/>
It was secluded, well drained, and being almost bare of shrubs<lb/>
and trees, was open to the sun and the wind, <del hand="unknown_hand">Expxex Experience had<lb/>
shown that yellow fever could be kept out of a military reservation<lb/>
less than a mile from an epidemic center, so the site's distance<lb/>
from Camp Columbia was both safe and convenient.</del><lb/>
<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">and free from mosquitoes</add></p>
<p>Carroll was on sick leave until the middle of November, but<lb/>
Agramonte came to Camp Columbia often to discuss the iso-<lb/>
lation camp with Reed. Truby and the other young doctors, keenly<lb/>
interested in the coming experiments, followed the plans closely<lb/>
and gave Reed all the help they could, while Kean consulted with<lb/>
him at every step.</p>
<p>There were, Reed explained to them as they sat on the veranda<lb/>
after dinner, to be three phases to the experiments. They would try<lb/>
to infect non-immunes by the bites of mosquitoes which had fed on<lb/>
yellow fever cases in their first stage, by exposure to <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi>,<lb/>
and by injection of blood taken from yellow fever cases in the first<lb/>
two or three days of illness. In this way he hoped to prove that<lb/>
yellow jack was spread by mosquitoes, that <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> were harmless,<lb/>
and that the specific agent of the disease was in the blood. Each<lb/>
experiment was to be carefully controlled, to exclude exposure to<lb/>
any other source of infection than the one directly in question.<lb/>
246.<lb/>
<pb n="247" id="f06114247"/>
E<unclear>a</unclear>ch case would be seen by the Havana Yellow Fever Board, composed<lb/>
of Doctors Finlay, Guiteras, Albertini and Gorgas, so that the diag-<lb/>
nosis of yellow fever could not be questioned.</p>
<p>Reed drew up the plans for the camp, and the Hospital Corps<lb/>
erected seven tents, while the Quartermaster's Department started<lb/>
to put up two small wooden buildings that Reed ordered. The work<lb/>
was progressing well when Reed had an unexpected setback.</p>
<p>A violent tropical storm, striking in mid-November with heavy<lb/>
wind and rain, dropped the temperature to the low sixties. <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear"><hi rend="italic">Culex</hi></add><lb/>
<hi rend="italic">fasciatus</hi>, a delicate insect in spite of its fatal power, cannot<lb/>
survive wind or chill. Most of Reed's laboratory mosquitoes died,<lb/>
and he was greatly alarmed that the sudden cold might put an <del hand="unknown_hand">abrupt</del><lb/>
end to the mosquito season and leave him without insects <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">for</add> the<lb/>
experiments.</p>
<p>The younger doctors reassured him: there would still be<lb/>
plenty of warm weather, plenty of mosquitoes to go with it, and<lb/>
plenty of yellow fever. Truby could see, however, that he was<lb/>
still anxious, and wanted mosquitoes, not promises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; he suggested after lunch one day. &ldquo;Let's<lb/>
lay in a supply of mosquito eggs for the major, so he can stop<lb/>
worrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and several of the other doctors set off toward Quemados<lb/>
on a mosquito hunt. As they passed the Quartermaster's dump it oc-<lb/>
curred to them to investigate there for discarded buckets or uten-<lb/>
sils holding water. To the deep embarrassment of young Dr. Amador,<lb/>
the post sanitary officer, the dump was a regular mosquito mine,<lb/>
in spite of the mosquito control measures he was enforcing. Most<lb/>
of the utensils had the sanitary inspector's axe hole in the bottom,<lb/>
247.<lb/>
<pb n="248" id="f06114248"/>
but enough still held water to make the dump an ideal breeding place.<lb/>
Eagerly scooping up wigglers and eggs to keep Reed in stock indef-<lb/>
initely, they hurried with their find to his laboratory. Reed,<lb/>
Neate and John H. Andrus, a Hospital Corps man who had recently<lb/>
been assigned to the laboratory, joyfully set to work to rear the<lb/>
wigglers and dry the eggs for future use.</p>
<p><del hand="unknown_hand">The Quartermaster's dump thereafter received closer attention<lb/>
from the sanitary inspectors.</del></p>
<p>Agramonte, meanwhile, was rounding up volunteers among the<lb/>
Spaniards at Tiscornia, the immigration station on Havana bay. Se-<lb/>
lecting only men who were of age, in good health, and without de-<lb/>
pendents, the board asked them if them would <del hand="unknown_hand">&ldquo;</del>take a bite.<del hand="unknown_hand">&rdquo;</del> Many<lb/>
of them, attracted by the money, the prospect of being cared for by<lb/>
the &ldquo;senoritas Americanas,&rdquo; as they called the nurses, and the re-<lb/>
flection that they were likely to get yellow fever anyway, signed<lb/>
contracts with the board consenting to be bitten for the reward.</p>
<p>Reed, oppressed by Lazear's death, and by the heavy respon-<lb/>
sibility that he and his board were assuming, was dubious, too,<lb/>
about relying on the Spanish immigrants. Their cooperation, he<lb/>
feared, captured by the money involved, might not survive the proof<lb/>
that the &ldquo;harmless little gnats&rdquo; which they were paid to let bite<lb/>
them would give them yellow jack.</p>
<p>His anxieties were unexpectedly relieved.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Breakfast at Camp Columbia was at seven, and by eight Reed<lb/>
was at his desk, working on plans for the isolation camp. <del hand="unknown_hand">Camp Lazear,<lb/>
it was to be called, so that their dead colleague's name should<lb/>
continue to be associated with the experiments.</del></p>
<p>The knock at the door, so early in the morning, surprised him.</p>
<p>248.</p>
<pb n="249" id="f06114249"/>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>John R. Kissinger and John J. Moran stepped into the room,<lb/>
stepping at the same time, although no one knew it then, into<lb/>
history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; Reed greeted them. &ldquo;What can I do<lb/>
for you?&rdquo; He was slightly acquainted with both young men. Kissinger<lb/>
was a private in the Hospital Corps. Moran, who shared quarters<lb/>
with him, also had been in the Hospital Corps until his term of en-<lb/>
listment expired. Now he was a clerk at General Lee's headquarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heard you wanted volunteers, sir,&rdquo; Moran said, &ldquo;to sub-<lb/>
mit to some yellow fever experiments. We talked it over, and we<lb/>
thought we'd like to go in for it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It's good of you to offer,&rdquo; Reed said cordially. &ldquo;I don't<lb/>
know if you understand just what you're getting into. This is the<lb/>
situation.&rdquo; He described the dangers of the experiment to them<lb/>
carefully, emphasizing that he himself had no doubt that mosquitoes<lb/>
spread the disease. &ldquo;And of course,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;every volunteer<lb/>
gets a hundred dollars; if he comes down with yellow jack he gets<lb/>
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Major Reed,&rdquo; Kissinger explained, &ldquo;we<del hand="unknown_hand">r</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">'</add>re not<lb/>
interested in being paid. The money isn't the point -it's the oppor-<lb/>
tunity,&rdquo; he flushed a little, &ldquo;to do something for humanity and<lb/>
science.&rdquo; Moran nodded emphatically. &ldquo;That's right, sir,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Reed, silent with astonishment, stared at them. He saw two<lb/>
young men in their early twenties -two pleasant, intelligent, un-<lb/>
remarkable looking boys about the age of his own son, with the best<lb/>
part of their lives before them. And they were offering to risk<lb/>
those lives not for military glory, not for reward -certainly not<lb/>
for two hundred dollars -but for &ldquo;.&rdquo;<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">&ldquo;humanity and science!&rdquo;</add> He saw,<lb/>
249.<lb/>
<pb n="250" id="f06114250"/>
too, that they meant it. On the verge of explaining that the money<lb/>
was already appropriated, that they might as well take it, he<lb/>
checked himself. Money could never reward this unselfish gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boys,<del hand="unknown_hand">2</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">&rdquo;</add> he said, and they could tell by his voice<lb/>
that the quiet, self-possessed doctor was moved, &ldquo;I am proud to<lb/>
accept your brave offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Greatly cheered by the <del hand="unknown_hand">volunteering</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">offer</add> of Kissinger and Moran,<lb/>
Reed no longer feared a shortage of volunteers. American boys,<lb/>
motivated by interest in the experiments themselves, rather than<lb/>
by the prospect of reward, would not back out, no matter what the<lb/>
danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when everything's running smoothly,&rdquo; he remarked to<lb/>
Truby, &ldquo;and my personal direction isn't necessary any longer, then<lb/>
I'll take the mosquito test myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truby's face clouded at the announcement. He hoped ar-<lb/>
dently that Reed could be dissuaded. The major was not robust,<lb/>
and he had to eat sparingly. The strain of preparation and re-<lb/>
sponsibility showed now and then through his usual composure. It<lb/>
would be a dangerous thing for the doctor approaching his half<lb/>
century mark to tempt yellow jack.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Camp Lazear opened the morning of November 20th, without<lb/>
fanfare. Agramonte was busy at the Military Hospital, and Carroll,<lb/>
just back from sick leave, was needed for important bacteriological<lb/>
studies, so Reed selected Ames to take charge of the camp. Dr.<lb/>
Robert P. Cooke, a tall young contract doctor with straight lanky<lb/>
hair and a humorous expression, had volunteered for the <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi><lb/>
250.<lb/>
<pb n="251" id="f06114251"/>
experiments and was the only other doctor at the camp. A hospital<lb/>
steward, a Hospital Corps private and an am<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">b</add>ulance driver, all im-<lb/>
mune; Moran, Kissinger and six other Hospital Corps privates, all<lb/>
non-immune; and several non-immune Spaniards completed the camp<lb/>
personnel.</p>
<p>The experiments began immediately. At 10:30 on the morning<lb/>
of the 20th, Kissinger rolled up his sleeve and watched with<lb/>
mixed feelings while the mosquito, in the test tube pressed against<lb/>
his arm, took a leisurely bite. He wondered if the fragile little<lb/>
thing would really give him yellow jack. It was funny -he could<lb/>
squash her with a finger tip, and maybe <hi rend="italic">she</hi> could kill <hi rend="italic">him</hi> just as<lb/>
easily. As he rolled down his sleeve, he sighed. It was a beauti-<lb/>
ful day, he realized.</p>
<p>The principal rule of Camp Lazear was simple and rigid: no<lb/>
one could leave or enter without Reed's permission. Only the im-<lb/>
munes could go out on such necessary errands as getting supplies<lb/>
from Camp Columbia.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, whose only duty was to gather stones off the<lb/>
ground for a low wall about the camp, could take all the time they<lb/>
wanted to rest, and were mystified <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">and</add> delighted with their<lb/>
life in this strange new world. The soldiers, with nothing to<lb/>
do but keep their quarters neat, passed the time in reading, play-<lb/>
ing cards and taking naps. Kissinger passed it in waiting for<lb/>
his yellow jack. It did not develop.</p>
<p>Three days later he was bitten again; then, on the 26th<lb/>
and 29th, mosquitoes were held to Moran's willing arm. Still no<lb/>
yellow jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you're a natural immune, Moran, but I'm going to<lb/>
251.<lb/>
<pb n="252" id="f06114252"/>
find out before I'm through with you,&rdquo; Reed warned, only half<lb/>
jokingly. &ldquo;I'm going to save you now for another test, a very<lb/>
important one. You're still game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For anything you want, Major,&rdquo; Moran told him. Reed was<lb/>
his hero; he would have done anything for him. He slaved over<lb/>
the confidential letters to Sternberg that Reed entrusted to him<lb/>
to type, tossing away sheet after sheet of letter-head to get a<lb/>
perfect copy, and considered himself well rewarded when the doc-<lb/>
tor praised his neatness.</p>
<p>The failure of his first four experiments did not discour-<lb/>
age Reed. The weather was cool now, and he suspected, rightly,<lb/>
that the germ took longer to ripen within the mosquito than it did<lb/>
in hot weather. By the end of the month he still had not<lb/>
produced experimental yellow fever, but life was not without in-<lb/>
cident. A local newspaper on November 21st loosed a broadside<lb/>
against the heartless Americans who were enticing foreign in-<lb/>
nocents to submit to the injection of deadly poison. The board<lb/>
had foreseen that some such trouble might arise, and it was for<lb/>
that reason that they had drawn up a contract with each immi-<lb/>
grant. Reed, Carroll and Agramonte, armed with the contracts,<lb/>
immediately called on the Spanish consul and explained the con-<lb/>
ditions on which the Spaniards had consented to take the risk. <lb/>
An intelligent and courteous gentleman, the consul smilingly<lb/>
advised the three doctors that, under the circumstances, he had<lb/>
no objection to their experiments.</p>
<p>Agramonte, because his regular work kept him in Havana,<lb/>
was in charge of infecting the mosquitoes at the Las Animas<lb/>
ward. As he was driving out one day to the experimental camp<lb/>
with his pockets bulging with  test tubes full of the lethal<lb/>
insects, his horse, frightened by a road building outfit, bolted<lb/>
252.<lb/>
<pb n="253" id="f06114253"/>
and overturned the buggy. His laboratory assistant, Loud, was<lb/>
pitched out at the first plunge, and the doctor, desperately<lb/>
clutching his infectious mosquitoes, was dumped in a sand pile.<lb/>
He arrived at the camp dusty and disheveled, but loudly rejoicing<lb/>
that his misadventure <unclear>had</unclear> not turned a number of loaded mosquitoes<lb/>
loose in the countryside.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The two little wooden buildings, situated at some distance<lb/>
from the tents, were completed by November 30th. Reed had dire<lb/>
and special plans for them. Building Number One, known as the<lb/>
infected bedding and clothing building, was a one room shack four-<lb/>
teen by twenty feet. The walls were two boards thick, the inner<lb/>
one made of close-fitting tongue-and-groove lumber. Its two win-<lb/>
dow<del hand="unknown_hand">n</del>s, both placed in the south wall to prevent through ventila-<lb/>
tion, were covered with very fine screening, and fitted with<lb/>
woode<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">n</add> shutters to keep out fresh air and sunlight. The building,<lb/>
entered through a doubly screened vestibule, was constructed in<lb/>
every particular to prevent the accidental entrance of mosquitoes.<lb/>
It was closed tightly in the daytime, and its temperature was<lb/>
kept <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">at</add> about ninety degrees by a coal oil stove, while care was taken<lb/>
to keep the atmosphere humid.</p>
<p>In it was undertaken one of the <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">most</add> revolting experiments to<lb/>
which scientific curiosity and loyalty to his superiors ever<lb/>
goaded a hero. On November 30th, the day the building was ready,<lb/>
three large boxes containing bedding used by yellow fever patients<lb/>
were carried to it. These articles, foul<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">l</add>y soiled, had been packed<lb/>
for two weeks in tightly closed boxes.</p>
<p>At six o'clock that Friday evening, Cooke and two pri-<lb/>
253.<lb/>
<pb n="254" id="f06114254"/>
vates of the Hospital Corps, Levi E. Folk and Warren G. Jernegan,<lb/>
 all non-immunes, entered the hot and stuffy little building<lb/>
and started to unpack the loathsome articles. Reed, with inter-<lb/>
est and commiseration in his face, watched from outside. The<lb/>
three young men opened the boxes, pulled out and shook several<lb/>
sheets and blankets, as they had been instructed to do, then made<lb/>
an unscheduled bolt through the door. G<del hand="unknown_hand">o</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">u</add>lping for air, they<lb/>
stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, poor fellows!&rdquo; Reed exclaimed sympathetically.</p>
<p>It was terrible in the little house, but the three volun-<lb/>
teers weren't quitting. Shaking <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">their</add> heads and grinning ruefully,<lb/>
Cooke <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">and</add> the two others stubbornly re-entered it, made<lb/>
up their cots with the filthy bedding, and gingerly crawled into<lb/>
them.</p>
<p>The major might be confident that <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> were harmless,<lb/>
but they still could not help feeling that their experiment was<lb/>
not only much more disagreeable, but much more dangerous, than<lb/>
the mosquito test; &ldquo;everybody knew&rdquo; -still -that <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> car-<lb/>
ried yellow fever. They spent a bad night between their horrid<lb/>
sheets, disturbed by evil smells and somber and uneasy thoughts.<lb/>
But for science -and the major -they willingly spent <del hand="unknown_hand">twenty</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">nineteen</add><lb/>
more nights like it.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Kissinger was a determined young man. He had already been<lb/>
bitten twice without result, but he had volunteered for a case of<lb/>
yellow jack, and he intended to get it.</p>
<p>On December 5th, at two in the afternoon, he rolled up his<lb/>
sleeve for the third time and watched the mosquito bite. This was<lb/>
getting monotonous, he thought.</p>
<p>254.</p>
<pb n="255" id="f06114255"/>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she'll take this time, sir?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I<lb/>
certainly hope so!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'll tell you in a couple of days,&rdquo; Reed replied, smiling.</p>
<p>By evening three days later, the young volunteer had a<lb/>
headache; the next day, December 9th, he was carried on his bed to<lb/>
the yellow fever ward. Kissinger, at last, had his yellow jack. &ldquo;In<lb/>
my opinion this exhibition of moral courage has never been surpassed<lb/>
in the annals of the Army of the United States,&rdquo; Reed said.</p>
<p>Reed, his belief in the mosquito as intermediate host of<lb/>
yellow fever finally confirmed, was overjoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rejoice with me, sweetheart,&rdquo; he happily wrote his wife<lb/>
that night, &ldquo;as, aside from the <unclear>anti-oxin</unclear> of diphtheria and Koch's<lb/>
discovery of the tubercle bacillus, it will be regarded as the most<lb/>
important piece of work, scientifically, during the 19th century.<lb/>
I do not exaggerate, and I could shout for very joy that heaven has<lb/>
permitted me to establish this wonderful way of propagating yellow<lb/>
fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no self-satisfaction or personal pride in his<lb/>
modest and generous spirit, only thankfulness. <del hand="unknown_hand">All his efforts ever<lb/>
since he  began <unclear>prietice</unclear> had been directed toward relieving suffer-<lb/>
ing, but it had never occurred to the young doctor, starting on his<lb/>
career a quarter of a century before, that he would be the one to<lb/>
solve the riddle of one of the cruelest plagues that afflicted humanity.</del> Too <unclear>excited</unclear> and happy to sleep, he was up early the next<lb/>
morning and dashed off a note announcing the news to Truby, who had<lb/>
been sent across the island to Rowell Barracks at Cienfuegos as<lb/>
post surgeon. Truby told the news to Lawrence Reed, who was now a<lb/>
second lieutenant and shared quarters with him. Kean, almost be-<lb/>
255.<lb/>
<pb n="256" id="f06114256"/>
side himself with joy at his friend's conclusive demonstration,<lb/>
carried the tidings to General Wood. The good news was on the<lb/>
wing.</p>
<p>When the volunteers for the <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> experiment heard it,<lb/>
the gravity of their bearing disappeared in a rush of uproarious<lb/>
high spirits. They felt as if a death sentence had been lifted.<lb/>
Reed was feeling wonderful. The Havana Yellow Fever Board de-<lb/>
clared that Kissinger had unmistakable yellow fever -one of its<lb/>
members had earlier declared the mosquito theory &ldquo;wild and im-<lb/>
probable&rdquo; and reluctantly ate his words -and, to make every-<lb/>
thing perfect, Kissinger was getting well.</p>
<p>Reed was deeply grateful for his recovery. As a good of-<lb/>
ficer he hated to expose one of his men to a danger he did not<lb/>
share; as a good doctor he hated to gamble with a human<lb/>
life; and as a scientist he feared that the experiments could not<lb/>
continue if one of the cases died. Volunteers would probably be<lb/>
frightened away, and public opinion would force him to stop the work.<lb/>
He desperately hoped that his luck -and his volunteers' luck -<lb/>
would hold.</p>
<p>Within the next week three Spaniards, exposed to mosquito<lb/>
bites just as Kissinger had been, came down with yellow fever.<lb/>
All recovered. One of them, an engaging young man named Antonio<lb/>
Benigno, whom Reed always called Boniato, Spanish for sweet potatoe,<lb/>
because of his liking for that vegetable, was overjoyed when he<lb/>
received his reward, which represented huge wealth to him, in ten<lb/>
and twenty dollar gold pieces. Several of the Spaniards, however,<lb/>
were convinced by their countrymen's illness that the &ldquo;little<lb/>

flies&rdquo; were really dangerous. They forgot, as Reed put it, &ldquo;their<lb/>
256.<lb/>
<pb n="257" id="f06114257"/>
own personal aggrandizement and incontinently severed their<lb/>
connection with Camp Lazear. Personally,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;while lament-<lb/>
ing to some extent their departure, I could not but feel that in<lb/>
placing themselves beyond our control they were exercising the<lb/>
soundest judgment.&rdquo; No shadow of doubt as to the guilt of mosqui-<lb/>
toes could linger now.</p>
<p>Nor could anyone but a thorough skeptic doubt the harmless-<lb/>
ness of <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi>. On December 19th, after twenty nights passed in<lb/>
the most contaminated surroundings, Cooke and Folk and Jernegan<lb/>
emerged from the infected bedding building in their usual good<lb/>
health. They had even put on a few pounds. Two more non-immunes,<lb/>
James Hanberry and Edward Weatherwalks, took their place as sub-<lb/>
jects of the revolting but harmless demonstration, and were themselves<lb/>
later relieved by James Hildebrand and Thomas M. England.<lb/>
This line of experimentation, having failed to produce a single<lb/>
case of yellow fever, was finally abandoned after two months.</p>
<p>The seven brave and patient men who underwent this horrible<lb/>
ordeal were at no time in danger of contracting yellow fever, but<lb/>
that comforting fact was something of which they could not be sure<lb/>
until it was all over. It took just as much courage to disprove<lb/>
the virulence of <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi>, <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">in</add> which the best authorities <del hand="unknown_hand">were con-<lb/>
vinced,</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">believed,</add> as it did to prove that of mosquitoes. The practical value<lb/>
of the experiment was immense, since it clearly showed the uselessness<lb/>
of destroying valuable property in an effort to check the spread of<lb/>
yellow fever.</p>
<p>The Havana medical men, abruptly won over by Reed's con-<lb/>
clusive results, hurried to do belated honor to their own neglected<lb/>
prophet, Dr. Finlay. They gave him a banquet on the night of Decem-<lb/>
257.<lb/>
<pb n="258" id="f06114258"/>
ber 22nd, which was attended by seventy or eighty Havana doctors,<lb/>
Reed's board, Wood, Kean, Gorgas and other military doctors. Dr.<lb/>
Juan Guiteras tactfully distributed the honors to everyone's satis-<lb/>
faction. Dr. Finlay, he said, was like Sir Patrick Manson, who had<lb/>
advanced the theory that mosquitoes carried malaria; and Reed was<lb/>
like Sir Ronald Ross, who proved Manson's theory and gave it prac-<lb/>
tical value.</p>
<p>Finlay, benign and happy, smiled around at the doctors gath-<lb/>
ered in his honor, doctors who had laughed at him until a few days<lb/>
ago. After twenty years, thanks to the clear, brilliant demonstra-<lb/>
tion of the middle-aged American medical officer, his cherished<lb/>
theory was accepted. They had been long years, and discouraging<lb/>
sometimes, but this -the cheers and applause roared musically in<lb/>
his ears -this wiped out every painful recollection.</p>
<p>Reed, happy as Finlay, was looking ahead -far ahead to a<lb/>
day when his demonstration would bear fruit, when mosquito control<lb/>
measures would wipe the plague from the earth.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Reed was ready for the next step in <unclear>his</unclear> demonstration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we want to show that the difference between an infected<lb/>
and an uninfected house is due only to the presence of loaded mos-<lb/>
quitoes. This is the experiment I've been saving you for, Moran,&rdquo;<lb/>
he told his only civilian volunteer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Moran said. He was determined, too, like Kiss-<lb/>
inger. He had bargained for yellow jack, and he meant to get it.</p>
<p>Across a slight depression and eighty yards distant from<lb/>
the infected bedding building, was the second of the small houses<lb/>
that Reed had had built. Building Number Two, or the infected mos-<lb/>
quito building, was like Building Number One, except that its win-<lb/>
258.<lb/>
<pb n="259" id="f06114259"/>
dows were placed so as to afford good ventilation, and it was par-<lb/>
titioned inside by a very fine wire screen through which mosquitoes<lb/>
could not pass. <del hand="unknown_hand">Built against one side of it, also, was a room in<lb/>
which the board now kept its mosquitoes, to avoid the risks involved<lb/>
in carrying them back and forth to Havana. Agramonte's runaway<lb/>
had been too close a call.</del></p>
<p>Into one of the two rooms formed by the screen partition Reed<lb/>
liberated, on December 21st, fifteen insects which had previously<del hand="unknown_hand">,<lb/>
at various times,</del> fed on yellow fever cases. Moran, fresh from a<lb/>
bath and in a clean nightshirt -he felt a little like a sacrificial<lb/>
lamb -promptly at noon went into the mosquito infested room and lay<lb/>
down on a clean cot. The board members, with two non-immune volun-<lb/>
teers who were to remain on the mosquito less side of the partition,<lb/>
watched through the screen.</p>
<p>In a few moments the insects were buzzing close about Moran.<lb/>
Repressing an almost overwhelming impulse to swat them, he winced as<lb/>
they bit him about the face and hands. He lay still for half an<lb/>
<unclear>hous</unclear>, while they deliberately settled on him and fed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo; Reed commended him. &ldquo;That should just about<lb/>
do for now. We'll do it again this afternoon and tomorrow. And I<lb/>
think you'll have that yellow jack you've been asking for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">When Moran's three ordeals were over</add> the two non-immunes who had watched the ceremonies with the<lb/>
doctors remained on the other side of the room, separated from the<lb/>
mosquitoes only by the wire screen, but otherwise exposed to exactly<lb/>
the same influences as Moran had been. Moran went back to his tent,<lb/>
took his temperature and pulse every three hours, and waited as pa-<lb/>
tiently as he could for his yellow jack. He felt pretty sure of it<lb/>
this time.</p>
<p>Chrsitmas was warm and cl<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">o</add>udy. Reed, unable to get to Camp<lb/>
259.<lb/>
<pb n="260" id="f06114260"/>
Lazear in the morning, drove out in the afternoon. He wondered how<lb/>
Moran was feeling. It was about time for him to come down with the<lb/>
fever, he reflected, as he approac<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">h</add>ed the young man's tent. He had<lb/>
already made a stop at the mosquito building, and found the non-<lb/>
immune controls in excellent health and Christmas spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merry Christmas, Moran!&rdquo; Reed said as he entered the vol-<lb/>
unteer's tent. Moran, lying on his cot, struggled to his feet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&ldquo; And to you, sir,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>"Anything new?</p>
<p>Moran, blinking with headache, pointed to his temperature<lb/>
and pulse chart. Reed glanced quickly at it -fever a hundred and<lb/>
one, pulse fast, he saw -and looked closely at Moran, noting his<lb/>
flushed face and bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>Concern and jubilation struggled in his face. He had done<lb/>
it again, he had proved his point! Moran was sick, the controls<lb/>
were well -this <unclear><del hand="unknown_hand"></del></unclear> demonstrated that the mosquito was the essential,<lb/>
the single, factor in making a house infected!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back into bed,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Moran,&rdquo; he rubbed his<lb/>
hands gleefully, &ldquo;this is one of the happiest days of my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moran, ill as he felt, could not help grinning sympathetic-<lb/>
ally. The major acted as pleased as a young interne -it was almost<lb/>
worth a bout of the fever to see him so elated.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon Stark and his wife, and Kean and Mrs.<lb/>
Kean, who had come with him to Cuba when he returned from sick leave,<lb/>
had a Christmas party for a few of the officers. A guava bush,<lb/>
brightly trimmed, acted as Christmas tree, and all the children un-<lb/>
der six on the post were invited to receive presents. Reed was the<lb/>
gayest person there.</p>
<p>260.</p>
<pb n="261" id="f06114261"/>
<p>When the children's gifts had been distributed, the two<lb/>
hostesses produced comic ones, accompanied by doggerel verse, for<lb/>
several of the men. A major of convivial habits was given a toy<lb/>
water-wagon, and Stark, a skeleton of a man, got a cake of &ldquo;obesity<lb/>
soap,&rdquo; capable, so its makers alleged, of washing away the unwanted<lb/>
pounds.</p>
<p>And the great new discovery in yellow fever was suitably<lb/>
recognized. Dr. Amador, the sanitary officer, was presented with a<lb/>
can of kerosene, fatal to mosquito wiggle<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">r</add>s, with the jingle:</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>&ldquo;Sing a song of kerosene,</l>
<l>Of barrels deep and wide.</l>
<l>Doctors have become so mean</l>
<l>Mosquitoes have to hide.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>She thinks she finds a haven</l>
<l>But the doctor's eagle eye</l>
<l>Falls on the poor mosquito</l>
<l>And she will have to die.&rdquo;</l>
</lg>
<p>For Reed there was a fragile package that seemed to be all<lb/>
ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a work of art!&rdquo; he laughingly exclaimed, as he got the<lb/>
wrapper off, and held it up for everyone to see. It was a handsome<lb/>
mosquito, fashioned of a champagne cork and toothpicks, with a for-<lb/>
midable stinger, and legs and body realistically striped to resemble<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>. He read his rhymes out loud:</p>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>&ldquo;Over the plains of Cuba</l>
<l>Roams the Mosquito wild.</l>
<l>No one can catch o<del hand="unknown_hand">f</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">r</add> tame him</l>
<l>For he is Nature's child.</l>
</lg>
<p>261.</p>
<pb n="262" id="f06114262"/>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>With Yellow Jack he fills himself</l>
<l>And none his pleasure mar</l>
<l>Till Major Reed does capture him</l>
<l>And put him in a jar.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And now, alas for <hi rend="italic">Culex</hi>.</l>
<l>He has our sympathy,</l>
<l>For since the Major spotted him</l>
<l>He longs to be a flea!"</l>
</lg>
<p>It was a happy Christmas, Reed thought as he went to bed,<lb/>
one of the happiest of hi<del hand="unknown_hand">m</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add> life. The guilt was firmly pinned on<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi>, and they knew how to deal with mosquitoes. &ldquo;With<lb/>
Howard and kerosene,&rdquo; as he wrote the insect expert, Dr. Howard,<lb/>
they could practically eliminate the yellow fever mosquito. <hi rend="italic">Culex</hi><lb/>
and <hi rend="italic">anopheles</hi>, what a gay old pair of troublemakers they had<lb/>
been! But now their days were numbered.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Moran slowly emerged from his feverish stupor to realize<lb/>
that the quiet, insistent voice of which he had been faintly aware<lb/>
for some time was Major Reed's, and that it was speaking to him.<lb/>
He <unclear>squinted</unclear>, focusing his aching eyes, and tried to catch the sense<lb/>
of the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in pain, Moran?&rdquo; the doctor repeated the question.</p>
<p>Moran weighed the form of his answer, whether to nod his<lb/>
bursting head, or speak through the dreadful taste in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you localize the pain?&rdquo; Reed persisted, &ldquo;back, legs, head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man noticed that there were other men in the room<lb/>
besides Reed, and his attention wandered briefly to the white side<lb/>
262.<lb/>
<pb n="263" id="f06114263"/>
whiskers framing the benevolent face of an old gentleman watching him<lb/>
from the foot of the cot. It was his first glimpse of Finlay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, a little more clearly, &ldquo;it's just everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can groan, Moran, or even yell if you want to. It's all<lb/>
right to make a fuss. It may relieve you some,&rdquo; Reed advised him<lb/>
sympathetically. He bent down to catch the mumbled words, &ldquo;...knew<lb/>
what I was getting into.... not a cry-baby....&rdquo; and straightened<lb/>
smiling.</p>
<p>Moran, slipping away into stupor again, was still conscious<lb/>
of the murmur of the doctors' voices, and caught the one<lb/>
clear phrase, &ldquo;a very pretty case.&rdquo; Pretty! He shut his teeth<lb/>
tight against a groan, and turned his head away.</p>
<p>It might be a pretty case, but that didn't mean Reed liked it.<lb/>
He was terribly anxious. Moran knew the major came to see him early<lb/>
and late, but he never knew how often. It was everal days before<lb/>
Reed was sure his volunteer would recover from the experiment through<lb/>
which he had put him. &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;It will be a Happy<lb/>
New Year after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It was New Year's Eve. Reed was seated at his field desk-<lb/>
the same desk at which, three brief months before, he had found the<lb/>
vital clue in Lazear's pocket notebook. He was writing a letter to<lb/>
his wife. His face was tired, and the lines in it were deep and<lb/>
grave from the long strain, but it had the serenity of a man who<lb/>
has accomplished an unselfish purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prayer that has been mine for twenty years,&rdquo; he was<lb/>
writing, &ldquo;that I might be permitted in some way or at some time to<lb/>
do something to alleviate human suffering has been granted! A<lb/>
thousand Happy New Years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>263.</p>
<pb n="264" id="f06114264"/>
<p>He stopped, his pen poised over the paper, at the first<lb/>
ringing note. The twenty-four bugles, blown in concert, were<lb/>
sounding taps for the old year. There was a moment's quiet, then<lb/>
they sounded reveille -reveille for a new year, and a new century,<lb/>
to which yellow fever would be not a scourge, but a fading memory.</p>
<p>264.</p>

<p>Kissinger and the three Spaniards had proved that mosqui-<lb/>
toes carried yellow fever. Cooke and the six other volunteers<lb/>
had proved that <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> did not. Moran, now happily well, and the<lb/>
two non-immune controls had shown that a house was infected with<lb/>
the fever only when it contained loaded yellow fever mosquitoes.</p>
<p>With all that accomplished, Reed thought thankfully, the<lb/>
265.<lb/>
<pb n="266" id="f06114266"/>
end of the experiments was in sight. Next <unclear>they</unclear> would inject the<lb/>
blood of a yellow fever patient into non-immunes to prove that the<lb/>
parasite was in the blood, and to find out if passage through the<lb/>
mosquito was necessary to its development. Then they would see how<lb/>
long a loaded mosquito kept the ability to spread<lb/>
yellow jack by continuing the biting experiments with old <lb/>
mosquitoes. And finally, he would himself undergo one of these ex-<lb/>
periments in which he had risked other men's lives.</p>
<p>So far, they had not lost a single one of their five exper-<lb/>
imental cases, a remarkable achievement in a disease with<lb/>
as high a death rate as yellow fever. Reed still looked forward to<lb/>
each experiment with dread, and held his breath over every<lb/>
one until the patient was well on the mend. If only their perfect<lb/>
record would hold to the end of this dangerous gamble!</p>
<p>He looked forward longingly to February when his exhausting<lb/>
work would be over and he could go home. After the Pan-American<lb/>
Medical Congress in Havana the beginning of the month, at which he<lb/>
was going to read a paper on the board's work, he would return to<lb/>
the United States -to Emilie and Blossom, to the beloved<lb/>
cottage in the Pennsylvania mountains, to the laboratory and the<lb/>
examining boards, to his classes at the Army school and Columbian.<lb/>
Taking up his old duties, he would finally be relieved of this<lb/>
crushing responsibility.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he had to get on with his job.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Twenty nights contact with <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> and a number of mosquito<lb/>
bites late in December had not given Jernegan yellow fever, but he<lb/>
kept on trying. Two cubic centimeters of blood from a yellow fe-<lb/>
266.<lb/>
<pb n="267" id="f06114267"/>
ver patient brought him down with it in four days, on January 1st.<lb/>
Three days later, William Olson, injected with Jernegan's infected<lb/>
blood, was carried to the yellow fever ward. Wallace Forbes, with<lb/>
half a centimeter from a case of natural yellow fever, was put to<lb/>
bed on the 24th. Just one more case, Reed decided, and the board<lb/>
would stop the injection experiments.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>John H. Andrus had swept out the laboratory, given the<lb/>
guinea pigs and the monkey fresh food and water, and was busy with<lb/>
his mosquitoes when the door was thrown open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;.... impossible!&rdquo; Carroll's voice was raised, his tone<lb/>
pleading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not only not im<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">p</add>ossible, but it is necessary,&rdquo; Reed<lb/>
answered with a touch of sharpness. He sat down at his microscope<lb/>
but made no move to uncover it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn't necessary! We can find another volunteer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can't wait. Forbes' blood should be <hi rend="italic">right for the next<lb/>
test tomorrow</hi>. When our volunteer got frightened and backed out,<lb/>
he left us in a hole. We can't waste time trying to line up some-<lb/>
body else, so I'll take his place. I'm not asking these men to<lb/>
do something I won't do myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major, you are almost fifty years old. You haven't been<lb/>
well lately. You're tired and run down. If you persist in<lb/>
submitting to this inoculation, you're inviting grave and maybe<lb/>
fatal results.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense, Carroll! With a specialist of Ames' ability<lb/>
to look after me, it's perfectly safe. He hasn't lost a single<lb/>
one of these experimental cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He couldn't save Lazear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>267.</p>
<pb n="268" id="f06114268"/>
<p>&ldquo;Lazear didn't go to him until he'd been sick two days. Any-<lb/>
way, there's a chance that I'm immune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's what Lazear thought, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrus, going quietly about his work, glanced quickly at Reed.<lb/>
His face was set, and he looked as if he were trying not to get angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There's a chance I'm immune,&rdquo; he repeated with irritation,<lb/>
&ldquo;if Finlay's new theory is correct that the offspring of loaded mos-<lb/>
quitoes are themselves loaded. I've fed a dozen next generation<lb/>
mosquitoes, without any bad result.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that theory of Finlay's?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next generation of ticks are loaded with cattle fever,<lb/>
aren't they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. Do you believe Finlay's theory?&rdquo; Carroll in-<lb/>
sisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, no. But that's all the more reason for<lb/>
my being inoculated. If I get yellow jack, it will prove there's<lb/>
nothing in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carroll groaned. &ldquo;Really, Major! I thought we'd convinced<lb/>
you -Kean and Truby and Stark and Agramonte and the rest of us -<lb/>
that you are too necessary to this work to take this dangerous,<lb/>
needless risk. You have no right to sacrifice yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm not going to discuss it any more, Carroll. I'll be in-<lb/>
oculated tomorrow, and that's the end of it.&rdquo; Reed got up abruptly<lb/>
and strode out of the laboratory.</p>
<p>Andrus spent the rest of the day, and most of the night, think-<lb/>
ing hard.</p>
<p>The next morning, January 25th, Carroll arrived first at the<lb/>
laboratory. He looked worried and tired. Andrus wondered if he had<lb/>
slept badly, too.</p>
<p>268.</p>
<pb n="269" id="f06114269"/>
<p>"Dr. Carroll,<del hand="unknown_hand">"</del> he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Andrus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I've been thinking -won't I do just as well for this blood<lb/>
injection as Major Reed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carroll's face brightened for a moment, then he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I'm afraid not. Major Reed wants to test Dr. Finlay's<lb/>
second generation theory, too, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I've fed more mosquitoes hatched from the eggs of in-<lb/>
fected insects than the major has, sir,&rdquo; Andrus objected. &ldquo;I do it<lb/>
all the time, just to keep them laying.&rdquo; (The mosquito needed, as<lb/>
Finlay had told the board, blood before she could lay her eggs.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;That's perfectly true. So you do.&rdquo; Carroll looked at the<lb/>
laboratory attendant with fresh interest. &ldquo;Have you any dependents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I'll ask the major.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed, composed again and cheerful, came in a few minutes later.<lb/>
Carroll sent Andrus out on an errand. The private wondered what the<lb/>
two medical men were saying. Would Reed yield? Would he let a<lb/>
younger, stronger man replace him? He hoped so. He knew what<lb/>
the work of the board would mean to the world, and he knew that Reed<lb/>
was the engine that made the apparatus run. In trying to take over<lb/>
the risk that Reed had selected for himself, Andrus felt that he<lb/>
was being practical, in an impersonal sort of way. Somebody had to<lb/>
take the chance. He could better be spared than Reed, so it was<lb/>
only sensible that he should take it. It did not occur to<lb/>
him that this was a high order of unselfishness.</p>
<p>When he came back to the laboratory Reed questioned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand, Andrus, what you're getting into?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrus' heart jumped. So the major was going to let<lb/>
him take the injection!</p>
<p>269.</p>
<pb n="270" id="f06114270"/>
<p>&ldquo;<unclear>I've</unclear> nursed yellow fever, sir, and seen men die of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you volunteering then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm interested in your work, Major Reed. I'd like to take<lb/>
some part in it, even just a little one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That afternoon at Camp Lazear, Andrus, with a cubic centi-<lb/>
meter of Forbes' fever-laden blood circulating poisonously in his<lb/>
blood stream, sat on the edge of his cot, a block of paper on his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mother,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;you won't hear from me for two or<lb/>
three weeks, because I have been detailed to accompany a troop of<lb/>
the Seventh Cavalry on a practice march into the interior. I didn't<lb/>
want you to worry....&rdquo; He finished writing and sealed the letter.<lb/>
He felt awful -he had lied to his mother, lied to her in what might<lb/>
be the last letter he would ever write her. But at least he was<lb/>
sparing her worry.</p>
<p>There was nothing he could do, though, to spare Reed worry<lb/>
when his temperature hung around a hundred and four degrees for<lb/>
three days. Would the boy live or die? Reed wondered desper-<lb/>
ately. &ldquo;Should he die,&rdquo; he wrote the Surgeon General, &ldquo;I shall re-<lb/>
gret that I ever undertook the work. The responsibility for the<lb/>
life of a human being weighs upon me very heavily at present, and I<lb/>
am dreadfully melancholic.&rdquo; The melancholy, happily, passed; Andrus<lb/>
slowly recovered.</p>
<p>Since the offspring of loaded mosquitoes had failed to in-<lb/>
fect the non-immune Andrus, Finlay's theory of their infectiousness<lb/>
was definitely disproved. The injection experiments also showed,<lb/>
among other things, that the parasite of yellow fever was in the blood<lb/>
during the first few days of illness, and that passage through a<lb/>
mosquito, although Nature's ingenious way of spreading it, was not<lb/>
necessary to its development.</p>
<p>His scare over Andrus did not prevent Reed from pushing<lb/>
270.<lb/>
<pb n="271" id="f06114271"/>
<del hand="unknown_hand">pushing</del> the other phase of the experiments to a conclusion. Levi<lb/>
Folk, who had undergone the <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> test, came down with yellow jack<lb/>
from the bite of a mosquito that had fed on yellow fever thirty-nine<lb/>
days before. Another insect which had bitten a patient fifty-one<lb/>
days earlier proved its virulence of Clyde West. James Hanberry,<lb/>
a gradua<del hand="unknown_hand">l</del>te like Folk and Jernegan of the <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi> experiment, re-<lb/>
ceived an attack from a mosquito fifty-seven days after its contam-<lb/>
ination. Charles Sonntag was the last subject of this series. The<lb/>
last loaded mosquito finally died seventy-one days after its meal<lb/>
of yellow jack. This demonstration showed<lb/>
why a house or region could remain infectious even after its sick<lb/>
occupants had been gone for more than two months.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Yellow Fever Commission had, in all, produced at will and<lb/>
under perfect control fourteen cases of unmistakable yellow fever<lb/>
between the opening of Camp Lazear on November 20th and <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">February</add> 10th,<lb/>
without the loss of a single life. Their skill and good for-<lb/>
tune in saving every case was pointed up a few months later when<lb/>
another board, under Dr. Guiteras, conducted further experiments.<lb/>
The death of three out of their first seven cases put an abrupt stop<lb/>
to the work.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Reed, facing the delegates to the Pan-American Medical Con-<lb/>
gress on February 6th, turned the page and glanced at his audience.<lb/>
It was a large one -even the door were packed with listeners -and<lb/>
it was motionless with attention. After reading the report of the<lb/>
experiments, he was ready to announce the conclusions, the conclusions<lb/>
at which he and his board had arrived with such risk and labor.</p>
<p>271.</p>
<pb n="272" id="f06114272"/>
<p>Raising his voice so that those in the back of the room should<lb/>
miss nothing, he read clearly, "The mosquito <hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi> serves<lb/>
as the intermediate host for the parasite of yellow fever.</p>
<p>"Yellow fever is transmitted to the non-immune individual by<lb/>
means of the bite of the mosquito that has previously fed on the<lb/>
blood of those sick of the disease.</p>
<p>"An interval of about twelve days or more after contamination<lb/>
appears to be necessary before the mosquito is capable of conveying<lb/>
the disease.</p>
<p>"Yellow fever can also be experimentally produced by the sub-<lb/>
cutaneous injection of blood taken from the general circulation<lb/>
during the first and second days of this disease.</p>
<p><del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>,<lb/>
</unclear></del></p>
<p>"Yellow fever is not conveyed by <hi rend="italic">fomites</hi>, and hence disinfec-<lb/>
tion of articles of clothing, bedding or merchandise, supposedly<lb/>
contaminated by contact with those sick of this disease, is unnecessary.</p>
<p>"A house may be said to be infected with yellow fever only when<lb/>
there are present within its walls contaminated mosquitoes capable<lb/>
of conveying the parasite of this disease.</p>
<p>"The spread of yellow fever can be most effectually controlled<lb/>
by measures directed to the destruction of mosquitoes and the pro-<lb/>
tection of the sick against the bites of these insects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the mode of propagation of yellow fever has now been<lb/>
definitely determined, the specific cause of this disease remains to<lb/>
be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not the applause that resounded in the crowded hall, or<lb/>
the congratulations of enthusiastic doctors from two continents that<lb/>
gratified Reed most. It was the certainty that the burdensome and<lb/>
272.<lb/>
<pb n="273" id="f06114273"/>
momentous work which he and his colleagues had faithfully performed<lb/>
would mean a safer and a happier life for humanity in future years.</p>
<p>273.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="24" id="d29"><pb n="274" id="f06114274"/>
<head>CHAPTER XXIV</head>
<p>Invitations to read papers on yellow fever before medical<lb/>
societies, a dinner in his honor given by the Medical and Chirur-<lb/>
gical Faculty of the State of Maryland, congratulations from<lb/>
friends and colleagues and strangers, general acclaim -the<del hand="unknown_hand">r</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add>e were<lb/>
the things that met Reed on his return to the United States. Popsy<lb/>
Welch, bursting with pride in his student's achievement, was of the<lb/>
opinion that Reed's researches in yellow fever were the most impor-<lb/>
tant contribution to medicine ever made in this country, with the<lb/>
274.<lb/>
<pb n="275" id="f06114275"/>
exception of the discovery of anaesthesia. The praise was not ex-<lb/>
travagant. Modest although he was, Reed could not have been sur-<lb/>
prised: he appreciated very well the meaning of the work he had<lb/>
directed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lucky man!&rdquo; Sternberg greeted him feelingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn't been the Surgeon General, if the military gover-<lb/>
nor <del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>of</unclear></del> hadn't backed us to the limit morally and financially, if<lb/>
Kean and the other medical officers hadn't cooperated so generously,<lb/>
if we hadn't had a number of br<del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>e</unclear></del>ave volunteers, if -well,&rdquo; Reed<lb/>
returned the warm hand clasp, &ldquo;we have so much, so much, to be<lb/>
thankful for. We were very fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><del hand="unknown_hand">"</del>Self-effacing, he smilingly declined to let the newspapers<lb/>
take his picture. &ldquo;Fools' names and fools' faces, you know, little<lb/>
daughter,&rdquo; he told Blossom.</p>
<p>But when one of his students, thrilled with a new<lb/>
camera, coaxed him to pose, he yielded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; he agreed laughing. &ldquo;Just for practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went up on the museum roof. Reed smoothed his uniform<lb/>
coat, straightened his collar and patted his hair flat with his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this all right?&rdquo; he inquired, looking into the camera.</p>
<p>The young man adjusted him to the light. &ldquo;Look across <del hand="unknown_hand">b</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">m</add>y<lb/>
right shoulder, sir,&rdquo; he directed him. &ldquo;A little more this way -<lb/>
that's fine. Hold it!&rdquo; He squeezed the bulb. Reed's image was<lb/>
committed to the sensitive plate. That was his last photograph.</p>
<p>He was pleased by the recognition he received for his work -<lb/>
an M. A. from Harvard in the summer of 1902, an<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del> LL. D. from the Uni-<lb/>
versity of Michigan a little later -more pleased by the results al-<lb/>
ready apparent in Cuba. Gorgas, at first unconvinced that <hi rend="italic">Culex</hi><lb/>
275.<lb/>
<pb n="276" id="f06114276"/>
<hi rend="italic">fasciatus</hi> was the only agent that spread yellow fever, had been con-<lb/>
verted when his own mosquito control measures made Havana totally<lb/>
free of the disease for the first time in more than two centuries.<lb/>
Already the research was paying dividends in lives and money.</p>
<p>Not content to rest on his accomplishment, Reed worked as<lb/>
hard as ever. His life returned naturally into its accustomed<lb/>
groove, and he continued, too, with Carroll to do yellow fever re-<lb/>
search.</p>
<p>His children were grown. Blossom, happy to have her favor-<lb/>
ite companion back again, still came to meet him in the evenings at<lb/>
the corner where he got off the horse car. Lawrence, at the prom-<lb/>
ising beginning of his military career, had married one of the Black-<lb/>
ford girls, Landon, and in the usual Army routine was being moved<lb/>
from post to post.</p>
<p>Reed was delighted when Kean was transferred to Washington in<lb/>
September, 1902, and persuaded him to move into the apartment house<lb/>
on Nineteenth Street near Q, where the Reed family then lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it's so expensive here!&rdquo; Kean complained. &ldquo;Isn't there<lb/>
some cheaper section of town where I can live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kean,&rdquo; Reed explained, smiling, &ldquo;there are three things every<lb/>
Army officer ha<del hand="unknown_hand">d</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">s</add> to do: he has to live north of Pennsylvania Avenue<lb/>
and west of Fourteenth Street; he has to have a charge account at<lb/>
Woodward and Lothrop; and he has to keep his money at the Riggs Bank.<lb/>
You might just as well reconcile yourself to it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kean, seeing Reed frequently at home and at work, noticed that<lb/>
he seemed tired, and once or twice heard him refer, lightly, to his<lb/>
indigestion. It occurred to no one, however, that he was seriously<lb/>
ill. He continued his usual duties and received, in addition, the<lb/>
appointment as Librarian of the Surgeon General's Library on Novem-<lb/>
276.<lb/>
<pb n="277" id="f06114277"/>
ber 1st, 1902. Mental exertion, however, was becoming strangely<lb/>
painful to the alert mind that had always before approached it so<lb/>
buoyantly; and the heavy schedule of teaching and research <del hand="unknown_hand">had</del><lb/>
seemed unbearably taxing to him when he came back in the fall to<lb/>
resume it after a rest at his little mountain home near Monterey,<lb/>
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Characteristically, however, he exerted himself to maintain<lb/>
his usual urbanity and cheerfulness -no one should be distressed<lb/>
on his account if he could help it -but he was unable to conceal<lb/>
his suddenly falling strength from his wife. Finally, he consulted<lb/>
his doctor, Major W. C. Borden.</p>
<p>When, on November 17th, Borden removed his ruptured appendix,<lb/>
it was already too late. Reed could not rally. The doctor whose<lb/>
brilliant work had saved humanity from a cruel plague could<lb/>
not himself be saved. At the Washington Barracks hospital, where<lb/>
he had <del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>brought</unclear></del> so many times brought healing and comfort to others,<lb/>
early in the dark morning of November 23rd, Walter Reed quietly died.</p>
<p>The stone that marks his grave, on a high knoll in Arlington<lb/>
National Cemetery, is, fittingly, simple. On it is inscribed the<lb/>
citation pronounced by President Eliot of Harvard University in con-<lb/>
ferring on him the degree of Master of Arts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gave to man control over that dreadful scourge, yellow<lb/>
fever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>277.</p>
<pb n="278" id="f06114278"/>
<p>EPILOGUE</p>
<p>William Crawford Gorgas ha<del hand="unknown_hand">s</del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">d</add> responded to Reed's con-<lb/>
gratulations on his success in stamping out yellow fever in Havana<lb/>
by saying, &ldquo;I am very happy to serve in the more humble role of<lb/>
being the first to put your discovery to extensive, practical ap-<lb/>
plication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gorgas' own name took on independent luster when, applying<lb/>
Reed's discovery on a larger scale, he brought yellow fever and<lb/>
malaria under control in the Canal Zone, and thus made possible<lb/>
the building of the Canal by Americans after disease had forced<lb/>
the French to abandon it as a costly failure. Modest like Reed<lb/>
278.<lb/>
<pb n="279" id="f06114279"/>
and generous, Gorgas, when lauded as a great man for this work,<lb/>
disclaimed the praise. &ldquo;Not a great man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;merely one<lb/>
who is trying to follow in the footsteps of a great man, Walter<lb/>
Reed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reed's memory is one <add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">of</add> which the United States Army is proud.<lb/>
Its medical center in Washington, built while George Torney -the<lb/>
same George Torney who had urged Reed to join the Army -was Sur-<lb/>
geon General, is named the Walter Reed Memorial Hospital. The<lb/>
Army Register publishes annually a Roll of Honor contain-<lb/>
ing the names of the Yellow Fever Commission and of the American<lb/>
volunteers whose interest and courage made the experiments possible.<lb/>
The name of Walter Reed stands first on the list.</p>
<p>Congress, briefly mindful of the country's debt to the sol-<lb/>
dier whose work saved countless lives that would otherwise have<lb/>
been sacrificed to yellow fever, shortly after his death granted<lb/>
Mrs. Reed a modest pension. Reed's associates in the <del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>experiments</unclear></del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">work</add><lb/>
it forgot, except for a niggardly pittance here and there, until<lb/>
1929, when it granted the survivors and the widows of those who had<lb/>
died the same pension as Mrs. Reed, and a gold medal. <del hand="unknown_hand"><unclear>Most</unclear></del><add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">All</add> of the<lb/>
brave young men who submitted to the yellow fever experiments are<lb/>
elderly now, and lost in undeserved obscurity, or dead: and Agra-<lb/>
monte and Carroll, too, are dead.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reed, now a very old woman, still lives, like her son<lb/>
and daughter, in Washington. Aside from his wife and children, the<lb/>
only near relative who survives Reed is his half-sister, Annie, now<lb/>
Mrs. D. T. Elam, of Farmville, Virginia.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The search for the specific agent of yellow fever is not yet<lb/>
ended. Before Reed's death, Carroll, working in Cuba, strained in-<lb/>
279.<lb/>
<pb n="280" id="f06114280"/>
fected blood through a filter fine enough to catch the smallest<lb/>
known bacteria. Injecting the serum thus obtained into non-im-<lb/>
<add hand="unknown_hand" place="supralinear">munes,</add> he produced yellow fever. This experiment explained<lb/>
at last why the microscopic examination of the blood, pursued so<lb/>
painstakingly by Sternberg, Reed's board and other workers, had<lb/>
had negative results: the agent is sub-microscopic, a filterable<lb/>
virus. The volunteers who submitted to this experiment were<lb/>
John R. Bullard, Albert W. Govington and Paul Hamann, whose names<lb/>
appear on the Roll of Honor.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of any subject, no matter how wide, can al-<lb/>
ways be extended. With the discovery in 1927 of the suscepti-<lb/>
bility of certain monkeys -among them the rhesus (the one the<lb/>
board tried to infect must have been, by the unluckiest chance,<lb/>
immune) -a new era in yellow fever research opened, and by 1931<lb/>
the yellow fever vaccine was developed, the most important piece<lb/>
of yellow fever work since Walter Reed's experiments thirty years<lb/>
before.</p>
<p>The original and permanent home of yellow fever is the Con-<lb/>
go region in Africa. Recent investigations have established, also,<lb/>
that it persists in certain rural and jungle areas of South Amer-<lb/>
ica in endemic form, even in the absence of <hi rend="italic">Aedes aegypti</hi>, as<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Culex fasciatus</hi> is now called. It is thought that this jungle<lb/>
fever, maintained by man and probably by other animals and spread<lb/>
possibly by several kinds of mosquitoes, is the source of the<lb/>
