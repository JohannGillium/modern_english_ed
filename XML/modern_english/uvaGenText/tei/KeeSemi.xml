<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

<p>
<hi rend="italic">Semimaru,</hi> a work of the fourth category, was
written by Zeami.  The story of Semimaru, the blind <hi rend="italic">biwa</hi>
player&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">biwa</hi>
is a kind of lute&mdash;appears as early as the
twelfth-century collection of tales, <hi rend="italic">Konjaku
Monogatari</hi>, but apparently has no historical basis.  The <hi rend="italic">Konjaku
Monogatari</hi> version relates that Semimaru lived
near the barrier of &Omacr;saka, between Kyoto and Lake Biwa.  Once he had been
in the service of a courtier, a famous <hi rend="italic">biwa</hi>
master, and learned to play by listening to his master.  Minamoto Hakuga,
the son of a prince, heard of Semimaru's skill and wished to bring him to
the Capital.  Semimaru, however, refused.  So eager was he to hear
Semimaru's <hi rend="italic">biwa</hi> that Hakuga journeyed to Mt.
Osaka, a wild and distant place in those days, though today a half-hour
journey from Kyoto.
</p>

<p>
By the time of the writing of the <hi rend="italic">Heike Monogatari,
</hi>a century later, Semimaru had become known as the fourth son of the
Emperor Daigo (r. 897-930).  Like the Semimaru of the <hi rend="italic">Konjaku
Monogatari</hi>, he lived by a barrier, but it was
the one at Shinomiya Kawara.  A man named Hakuga no Sammi was so anxious
to hear him play that he visited Semimaru's hut every day, rain or shine,
for three years without fail.
</p>


<pb n="101"/>
<p>
Zeami borrowed from various versions of the legend of Semimaru as known in
his day, but especially from the <hi rend="italic">Heike Monogatari</hi>.
No previous version of the story, however, mentions Princess Sakagami, who
was apparently Zeami's creation.  <hi rend="italic">Semimaru</hi> is one
of the rare plays in which the <hi rend="italic">tsure</hi>
(Semimaru) is nearly as important as the <hi rend="italic">shite</hi>
(Sakagami); another such play is <hi rend="italic">Komachi of the Hundred Nights.</hi>
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="italic">Semimaru</hi> is perhaps the most tragic play of the
entire No repertory.  Unlike <hi rend="italic">The Sought-for Grave</hi>,
in which Unai returns to earth to tell of her endless torments in hell,
the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Semimaru</hi> takes place in this world,
and involves two human beings who are nearly as real and immediate to us
as characters in Western drama.
</p>

<p>
During the height of the fanatical nationalism of the 1930s and 1940s <hi rend="italic">Semimaru</hi>
was banned from the stage for its alleged
disrespect to the Imperial Family, but today it is performed by all
schools of N&omacr;.

<ref target="n108.10">[10]</ref></l>
<l>The river ducks?  Not knowing where I went</l>

<l>How sad it was to leave the Capital!</l>
<l>Pine crickets, bell crickets, grasshoppers,</l>
<l>How they cried in the dusk at Yamashina!</l>
<l>I begged the villagers, "Don't scold me, too!"</l>
<l>I may be mad, but you should know</l>
<l>My heart is a pure rushing stream:</l>

<l>The tribute horse from Mochizuki</l>

<ref target="n108.12">[12]</ref></l>
<l>Have my wanderings brought me to the same place?</l>
<l>In the running stream I see my reflection.</l>
<l>Though my own face, it horrifies me:</l>
<l>Hair like tangled briers crowns my head</l>
<l>Eyebrows blackly twist&mdash;yes, that is really</l>

<note id="n104.1"><seg type="note-symbol">1.</seg> <p> In certain Buddhist texts the rarity of meeting a Buddha is compared to
the difficulty of a blind sea-turtle's chances of bumping into a log to
float on.  The turtle emerges to the surface only once a century and tries
to clutch the log, but it has a hole and eludes his grasp; this was a
simile for the difficulty of obtaining good fortune.
</p></note>

<note id="n105.2"><seg type="note-symbol">2.</seg> <p> The poem referred to is by Li Ho and is actually a description of
Hsi-shih (Seishi) rather than a poem by her.  The meaning of the original
verses was that Seishi's fragrant locks rivaled the perfume of cloves or
sandalwood; however, the dramatist here misunderstood the Chinese and
interpreted it as meaning she had cut her locks and now would have to rest
her head on a hard pillow of sandalwood. (See commentary by Tanaka Makoto
in <hi rend="italic">Y&omacr;kyoku Sh&umacr;</hi>, 111, 205 [Nihon Koten Zensho

concept that even casual contact in a previous existence might bring a
