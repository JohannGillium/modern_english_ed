<p>THE author says,<hi rend="italic"> "Silver yielding the proposed 2d. or 3d. 
more by the ounce, than it will do by being coined into money, 
there will be none coined into money; and matter of fact shows 
there is none."</hi> 
</p><p>It would be hard to know what he means, when he says,<hi rend="italic"> "silver 
yields 2d. or 3d. more by the ounce, than it will do by being 
coined into money:"</hi> but that he tells us in plain words at the 
bottom of the leaf, "that <hi rend="italic">an ounce of silver uncoined is of 2d. 
more value than after it is coined it will be;"</hi> which, I take the 
liberty to say, is so far from being true, that I affirm it is 
impossible to be so. For which I shall only give this short 
reason, viz. because the stamp neither does nor can take away any 
of the intrinsic value of the silver; and therefore an ounce of 
coined standard silver must necessarily be of equal value to an 
ounce of uncoined standard silver. For example, suppose a 
goldsmith has a round plate of standard silver, just of the 
shape, size, and weight of a coined crown-piece, which, for 
brevity's sake, we will suppose to be an ounce; this ounce of 
standard silver is certainly of equal value to any other ounce of 
unwrought standard silver in his shop; away he goes with his 
round piece of silver to the Tower, and has tee the stamp set 
upon it; when he brings this numerical piece back again to his 
shop coined, can any one imagine that it is now 2<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> less worth 
than it as when he carried it out smooth, a quarter of an hour 
before; or, that it is not still of equal value to any other 
ounce of unwrought standard silver in his shop? He that can say 
it is 2<hi rend="italic">d.</hi> less worth than it was before it had the king's image 
and inscription on it, may as well say, that sixty grains of 
silver, brought from the Tower, are worth but fifty-eight grains 
of silver in <hi rend="italic">Lombard-street.</hi> 
</p><p>But the author very warily limits this ill effect of coinage 
only to England; why it is in England, and not every where, would 
deserve a reason. 
</p><p>But let us grant it to be true, as our author affirms, that 
coined silver in <hi rend="italic">England</hi> is one-thirtieth worse, or of less 
value, than uncoined; the natural consequence from this, if it be 
true, is, that it is very unfit that the mint should be employed 
in <hi rend="italic">England,</hi> where it debases the silver one-thirtieth; for, if 
the stamp lessens the value of our silver this year, it will also 
do so the next, and so on to the end of the world, it always 
working the same way. Nor will the altering the denomination, as 
is proposed, at all help it. 
</p><p>But yet he thinks he has some proof for his proposition, 
because it is <hi rend="italic">matter of fact</hi> that there is <hi rend="italic">no money coined at the 
mint.</hi> This is the great grievance, and is one indeed, but for a 
different reason from what seems to inspire that paper. 
</p><p>The matter in short is this; <hi rend="italic">England</hi> sending more consumable 
commodities to <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi> than it receives from thence, the merchants, 
who manage their trade, bring back the <hi rend="italic">overplus</hi> in bullion, 
which, at their return, they sell as a commodity. The chapmen, 
that give highest for this, are, as in all cases of buying and 
selling, those who can make most profit by it; and those are the 
returners of our money, by exchange, into those countries where 
our debts, any way contracted, make a need of it: for they 
getting 6, 8, 10,<hi rend="italic"> &amp;c. per cent</hi> according to the want and demand 
of money from <hi rend="italic">England</hi> there, an according to the risk of the sea, 
buy up this bullion, as soon as it comes in, to send it to their 
correspondents in those parts, to make good their credit for the 
bills they have drawn on them, and so can give more for it than 
the mint-rate, i.e. more than equal weight of milled money for an 
equal weight of standard bullion; they being able to make more 
profit of it by returns. 
</p><p>Suppose the balance of our trade with <hi rend="italic">Holland</hi> were in all 
other commodities equal, but that in the last <hi rend="italic">East India</hi> sale we 
bought of them of <hi rend="italic">East India</hi> commodities to the value of a 
million, to be paid in a month; within a month a million must be 
returned into <hi rend="italic">Holland</hi> this presently raises the exchange, and 
the traders in exchange sell their bills at high rates; but the 
balance of trade being (as is supposed in the case) equal in all 
other commodities, this million can no way be repaid to their 
correspondents, on whom those bills were drawn, but by sending 
them money or bullion to reimburse them. 
</p><p>This is the true reason why the bullion brought from <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi> is 
not carried to the mint to be coined, but bought by traders in 
foreign exchange, and exported by them, to supply the <hi rend="italic">overplus</hi> of 
our expenses there, which are not paid for by our commodities. 
Nor will the proposed <hi rend="italic">raising</hi> of our money, as it is called, 
whether we coin our money for the future one-thirtieth, or 
one-twentieth, or one-half lighter than now it is, bring one 
ounce more to the mint than now, whilst our affairs in this 
respect remain in the same posture. And I challenge the author to 
show that it will; for saying is but saying. Bullion can never 
come to the mint to be coined, whilst the over-balance of trade 
and foreign expenses are so great, that to satisfy them, not only 
the bullion your trade in some parts now yearly brings in, but 
also some of your formerly coined money is requisite, and must be 
sent out: but when a change in that brings in and lodges bullion 
here, (for now it seems it only passes through <hi rend="italic">England</hi>) the 
increase of silver and gold staying in <hi rend="italic">England</hi> will again bring 
it to the mint to be coined. 
</p><p>This makes it easily intelligible how comes it to pass that, 
when now at the mint they can give but 5s. 2d. per ounce for 
silver, they can give 5s. 4d. the ounce <hi rend="italic">in Lombard-street,</hi> (which 
is what our author means when he says, <hi rend="italic">"silver is now worth but 
5s. 2d. the ounce at the mint, and is worth 5<hi rend="italic">s. 4d.</hi> elsewhere.")</hi> 
The reason whereof is plain, viz, Because the mint, giving 
weighty money for bullion, can give so much and no more for 
silver than it is coined at, which is 5s. 2d. the ounce, the 
public paying all the odds that is between coined and uncoined 
silver, which is the manufacture of coinage: but the banker, or 
returner of money, having use for silver beyond sea, where he can 
make his profit of it, by answering bills of exchange, which he 
sells dear, must either send our money in <hi rend="italic">specie,</hi> or melt down 
our coin to transport, or else with it buy bullion. 
</p><p>The sending or money in <hi rend="italic">specie,</hi> or melting it down, has some 
hazard, and therefore, if he could have bullion for 5s, 2d. <hi rend="italic">per</hi> 
ounce, or a little dearer, it is like he would always rather 
choose to exchange corn for bullion, with some little loss, 
rather than run the risk of melting it down for exportation. 
</p><p>But this would scarce make him pay 2d. in the crown, which is 
almost three and a half <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi>., if there were not something 
more in it than barely the risk of melting, or exportation; and 
that is the lightness of the greatest part of our current coin. 
For example, N. has given bills for thirty thousand pounds 
sterling in <hi rend="italic">Flanders,</hi> and so has need of ten thousand weight of 
silver to be transported thither; he has thirty thousand pounds 
<hi rend="italic">sterling</hi> by him in ready money, whereof five thousand pounds is 
weighty milled money; what shall hinder him then from throwing 
that into his melting-pot, and so reducing it to bullion to be 
transported? But what shall he do for the other twenty-five 
thousand pounds, which, though he has by him, is yet clipped and 
light money, that is at least twenty <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi>. lighter than the 
standard? If he transports or melts down this, there is so much 
clear loss to him; it is therefore more advantage to him to buy 
bullion at 5s. 4d. the ounce with that light money, than to 
transport or melt it down; wherein, though the seller of the 
bullion has less weight in silver than he parts with, yet he 
finds his account, as much as if he received it in weighty coin, 
whilst a clipped crown-piece, or shilling, passes as well in 
payment for any commodity here in <hi rend="italic">England</hi> as a milled one. Thus 
our mint is kept from coining. 
</p><p>But this paper, <hi rend="italic">For encouraging the coining,</hi> &amp;c. would fain 
have the mill at work, though there be no grist to be had, unless 
you grind over again what is ground already, and pay toll for it 
a second time: a proposition fit only for the miller himself to 
make; for the meanest housewife in the country would laugh at it, 
as soon as proposed. However, the author pleases himself, and 
thinks he has a good argument to make it pass, viz, because the 
toll to be paid for it will not amount to three hundred and 
thirty thousand pounds, as is said in a late treatise about 
raising the value of money, p. 170; for, he says, that writer is 
mistaken in saying that <hi rend="italic">"3s. and 6d. is allowed at the mint for 
the coinage of every pound troy,</hi> "whereas <hi rend="italic">there is but sixteen 
pence halfpenny there allowed for the same;</hi> which sixteen pence 
halfpenny being above one-third of 3s. 6d. it follows by his own 
computation, that the new coining our money will cost the nation 
above one hundred and ten thousand pounds; a small sum, in this 
our plenty of riches, to be laid out for the purchasing these 
following inconveniencies, without any the least advantage. 
</p><p>1. A loss to the king of one-thirtieth (if you coin your 
money 2d. <hi rend="italic">per crown,</hi> one-twentieth, if you coin your money 3d. 
per crown lighter) of all his standing revenue. 
</p><p>2. A like loss of one-twentieth, or one-thirtieth, in all 
rents that are settled; for these have, during the term, the 
nature of rent-sec: but five <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> loss in a man's income he 
thinks so little, <hi rend="italic">it will not be perceived.</hi> 
</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Trouble to merchants in their trade.</hi> These inconveniencies 
he is forced to allow. He might have said disorder to all people 
in their trade, though he says it will be but a <hi rend="italic">little trouble to 
merchants,</hi> and without any <hi rend="italic">real damage to trade.</hi> The author would 
have done well to have made out this, and a great many other 
assertions in that paper; but saying is much easier, if that may 
pass for proof. 
</p><p>Indeed he has, by a short way, answered the book 
above-mentioned, in the conclusion of his paper, in these words: 
<hi rend="italic">"And he that so grossly mistakes in so material points of what he 
would assert, it is plain is not free from mistakes."</hi> It does not 
appear that he who published that book ever thought himself free 
from mistakes; but he that mistakes in two material points ay be 
in the right in two others, and those will still need an answer. 
But one of these material points will, I think, by what is 
already said, appear not to be a mistake; and for any thing the 
author of the paper hath said, or can say, it will always be 
true, that an ounce of silver coined, or not coined is, and 
eternally will be, of equal value to any other ounce of silver. 
As to any other mistake concerning the rate of coinage, it is 
like he had his information from some disinterested person, whom 
he thought worthy of credit. And whether it be 3s. 6d., as he was 
told, or only sixteen-pence halfpenny per pound troy, as the 
paper says, whether the reader will believe the one or the other, 
or think it worth his more exact inquiry, this is certain, the 
kingdom ought not to be at that, or any other charge, where there 
is no advantage, as there will be none in this proposed coinage, 
but quite the contrary. 
</p><p>In his answer to 
</p><p>Object. 1. He says from Edw. III. <hi rend="italic">"Silver has from time to 
time (as it grew in esteem) been by degrees raised in all mints.</hi> 
"If an ounce of silver now not exchanging or paying for what 
one-tenth of an ounce would have purchased in Edward the Third's 
time, and so being ten times less worth now than it was then, be 
growing in esteem, this author is in the right; else silver has 
not, since Edward the Third's reign, <hi rend="italic">from time to time grown in 
esteem.</hi> Be that as it will, he assigns a wrong cause <hi rend="italic">of raising 
of silver,</hi> as he calls it, in our mint. For if <hi rend="italic">growing thus in 
request,</hi> i.e. by lessening its value, has been the reason of 
altering our money, this change of coin, or raising the 
denomination of silver in ours, and other mints, ought to have 
been greater by much, since <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> the Seventh's time, than it was 
between that and <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> the Third's; because the great change of 
the value of silver has been made by the plenty of it poured into 
this part of the world from the <hi rend="italic">West Indies,</hi> not discovered till 
Henry the Seventh's reign. So that I think I may say, that the 
value of silver from <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> III. to Henry VII. changed not 
one-tenth, but from Henry VII. till now it changed above 
seven-tenths; and yet, money having been raised in our mint 
two-thirds since <hi rend="italic">Edward</hi> the Third's time, the far greater part of 
the raising of it was before <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> the Seventh's time, and a very 
small part of it since; so that the cause, insinuated by our 
author, it is evident, was not the cause of lessening our coin so 
often, whatever it was: and it is possible there wanted not men 
of projects in those days, who for private ends, by wrong 
suggestions, and false reasonings, covered with mysterious terms, 
led those into mistakes, who had not the time and will nicely to 
examine; though a crown-piece three times as big as one of ours 
now, might, for its size alone, deserve to be reformed. 
</p><p>To Object. 2 he says, <hi rend="italic">"The raising the denomination of money 
in <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi> and Portugal, was making it go for more when coined than 
its true value."</hi> 
</p><p>This, I say, is impossible, and desire the author to prove 
it. It did in <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Portugal,</hi> just what it will do here and 
every where; it made not the silver coined go for more than its 
value, in all things to be bought, but just so much as the 
denomination was raised, just so much less of commodity had the 
buyer in exchange for it: as it would be here, if you should coin 
sixpences into shillings; if any one went to market with this new 
money, he would find that, whereas he had a bushel of wheat last 
week for eight shillings of the former coin, he would have now 
but half a bushel for eight of the new shillings, when the same 
denomination had but half the quantity of silver. Indeed those 
who were to receive money upon former contracts would be 
defrauded of half their due, receiving, in their full tale of any 
denomination contracted for, but half the silver they should 
have; the cheat whereof they would find, when they went to market 
with their new money. For this I have above proved, that one 
ounce of silver is, and eternally will be, equal in value to 
another ounce of silver; and all that can possibly put a 
difference between them is only the different value of the 
workmanship bestowed on one more than another which in coinage, 
our author tells in this paper, is but sixteen-pence halfpenny 
<hi rend="italic">per pound troy.</hi> I demand therefore of our author, to show that 
any sort or, as he calls it, raising of money, can raise value of 
coined silver, or make it go for more than uncoined, bating the 
charge of coinage; unless it be to those who, being to receive 
money upon former contracts, will, by receiving the tale agreed 
for, receive less than they should of silver, and so be defrauded 
of what they really contracted for. 
</p><p>What effect such a raising of their money had in one 
particular, I will tell our author. In <hi rend="italic">Portugal</hi> they count their 
money by reys, a very small, or rather imaginary coin, just as if 
we here should count all our sums by farthings. It pleased the 
government, possibly being told that it would raise the value of 
their money, to raise in denomination the several species, and 
make them go for a greater (let us suppose double) the number of 
reys than formerly. What was the consequence? It not only 
confounded the property of the subject, and disturbed affairs to 
no purpose; but treaties of commerce having settled the rates of 
the customs at so many reys on the several commodities, the king 
immediately lost in the value half his customs. The same that in 
proportion will happen in the settled revenue of the crown here, 
upon the proposed change. 
</p><p>For though our author in these words, <hi rend="italic">"whereas all now 
desired by this act is to keep silver, when coined, of the same 
value it was before,"</hi> would insinuate, that this raising the 
denomination, or lessening our coin, as is proposed, will do no 
such thing; yet it is demonstration, that when our coin is 
lessened 3d. in 5s., the king will receive five <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> less in 
value in his customs, excise, and all his settled revenue, and so 
proportionably, as the quantity of silver in every species of our 
coin, shall be made less than now it is coined in those of the 
same denomination. 
</p><p>But, whatever our author means by <hi rend="italic">"making money go for more 
when coined than its true value, or by keeping silver, when 
coined, of the same value it was before;"</hi> this is evident, that 
raising their money thus, by coining it with less silver in it 
than it had before, had not the effect in Portugal and <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi>, 
which our author proposes from it here: from it has not brought 
one penny more to the mint there, nor kept their money, or 
silver, from exportation since, though forfeiture and death be 
the penalties joined in aid to this trick of <hi rend="italic">raising</hi> to keep it 
in. 
</p><p>But our author tells us in answer to Object 4. This <hi rend="italic">"will 
scarce ever at all be perceived."</hi> If of 100 guineas a man has in 
his pocket, five should be picked out, so he should not perceive 
it, the fraud and the loss would not be one jot the less; and 
though he perceived it not when, or how it was done, yet he will 
find it in his accounts, and the going so much back in his estate 
at the end of the year. 
</p><p>To Object 3 he says, The <hi rend="italic">"raising</hi> your coin <hi rend="italic">(it may be) may 
raise the price of bullion</hi> here in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>." An ounce of silver 
will always be equal in value to an ounce of silver every where, 
bating the workmanship. I say it is impossible to be otherwise, 
and require our author to show it possible in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, or any 
where, or else hereafter to spare his <hi rend="italic">"may be."</hi> To avoid 
fallacies, I desire to be understood, when I use the word silver 
alone, to mean nothing but silver, and to lay aside the 
consideration of baser metals that may be mixed with it: for I do 
not say that an ounce of standard, that has almost one-twelfth of 
copper in it, is of equal value with an ounce of fine silver that 
has no alloy at all; but that any two ounces of equally alloyed 
silver will always be of equal value; the silver being the 
measure of commerce, it is the quantity of silver that is in 
every piece he receives, and not the denomination of it, which 
the merchant looks after, and values it by.</p> 
<p>But this raising of the denomination our author would have 
pass, because it will be <hi rend="italic">"better for the possessors of 
bullion,"</hi> as he says, Answer 3. But who are they who now in <hi rend="italic">England</hi> are orwhat private men are there in of that consideration, that for 
their advantage all money should be new coined, and of a less 
great a charge to the nation, and loss to revenue? 
</p> 
<p>He farther adds, Answer 3, <hi rend="italic">It not thence inevitably follow, 
it will raise "the price of bullion beyond sea."</hi> 
</p><p>It will as inevitably follow, as that nineteen ounces of 
silver will never be equal in weight, or worth, to twenty ounces 
of silver: so much as you lessen your coin, so much more you must 
pay in tale, as will make the quantity of silver the merchant 
expects for his commodity; under what denomination soever he 
receives it. 
</p><p>The clothier, thus buying his <hi rend="italic">Spanish</hi> wool, oil, and labour, 
at five <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> more in denomination, sells his woollen 
manufacture proportionably dearer to the <hi rend="italic">English</hi> merchant, who, 
exporting it to <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi>, where their money is not changed, sells it 
at the usual market rate, and so brings home the same quantity of 
bullion for it which he was wont; which, therefore, he must sell 
to yoU at the same raised value your money is at: and what then 
is gained by all this? The denomination is only changed to the 
prejudice of the public; but as to all the great matters of your 
trade, the same quantity of silver is paid for commodities as 
before, and they sold in their several foreign markets for the 
same quantity of silver. But whatever happens in the rate of 
foreign bullion, the raising of the denomination of our money 
will bring none of it to our mint to be coined; that depends on 
the balance of our trade, and not on lessening our coin under the 
same denomination: for whether the pieces we call crowns be 
coined 16, 24, or 100 grains lighter, it will be all one as to 
the value of bullion, or the bringing more or less of it into 
<hi rend="italic">England</hi> or to our mint. 
</p><p>What he says in his answer to <hi rend="italic">Object.</hi> 4, besides what we have 
already taken notice of, is partly against his bill, and partly 
mistake. 
</p><p>1. He says, <hi rend="italic">"It may be some (as it is now) gain to those, 
that will venture to melt down the milled and heavy money now 
coined."</hi> That men do venture to melt down the milled and heavy 
money is evident, from the small part of milled money is now to 
be found of that great quantity of it that has been coined; and a 
farther evidence is this, that milled money will now yield four 
or five more <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> than the other, which must be to melt down 
and use as bullion, and not as money in ordinary payments. The 
reason whereof is, the shameful and horrible debasing, (or as our 
author would have it, <hi rend="italic">raising</hi>) our unmilled money by clipping. 
</p><p>For the odds betwixt milled and unmilled money being now, 
modestly speaking, above twenty <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi>, and bullion, for 
reasons elsewhere given, being not to be had, refiners, and such 
as have need of silver, find it the cheapest way to buy milled 
money for clipped, at four, five, or more <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> loss. 
</p><p>I ask, therefore, this gentleman, What shall become of all 
our present milled and heavy money, upon the passing of this act? 
To which his paper almost confesses, what I will venture to 
answer for him, viz. that, as soon as such a law is passed, the 
milled and heavy money will all be melted down; for it being five 
<hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> heavier i.e. more worth than what is to be coined in 
the mint, nobody will carry it thither to receive five <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> 
less for it, but sell it to such as will give four, or four and a 
half <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> more for it, and at that rate melt it down with 
advantage: for <hi rend="italic">Lombard-street</hi> is too quick-sighted, to give sixty 
ounces of silver for fifty seven ounces of silver, when bare 
throwing it into the melting-pot will make it change for its 
equal weight. So that by this law five <hi rend="italic">per cent</hi> gain on all our 
milled money will be given to be shared between the possessor and 
the melter of our milled money, out of the honest creditor and 
landlord's pocket, who had the guaranty of the law, that under 
such a tale of pieces, of such a denomination as he let his land 
for, he should have to such a value, i.e. such a weight in 
silver. Now I ask, Whether it be not a direct and unanswerable 
reason against this bill, that he confesses, that it will be <hi rend="italic">"a 
gain to those, who will melt down the milled and heavy money,"</hi> 
with so much loss to the public; and not, as he says, <hi rend="italic">"with very 
small loss to those, that shall be paid in the new,"</hi> unless he 
calls five <hi rend="italic">per cent very small loss;</hi> for just so much is it to 
receive but fifty-seven grains, or ounces of silver, for sixty, 
which is the proportion in making your crowns 3d. lighter. This 
is certain, nobody will pay away milled or weighty crowns for 
debts, or commodities, when it will yield him four or five per 
cent. more; so that which is now left of weighty money, being 
scattered up and down the kingdom, into private hands, which 
cannot tell how to melt it down, will be kept up and lost to our 
trade. And, as to your clipped and light money, will you make a 
new act for coinage, without taking any care for that? The making 
a new standard for your money cannot do less than make all money, 
which is lighter than that standard, unpassable; and thus the 
milled and heavy money not coming into payment, and the light and 
clipped not being lawful money, according to the new standard, 
there must needs be a sudden stop of trade, and it is to be 
feared, a general confusion of affairs; though our author says, 
<hi rend="italic">"it will not any ways interrupt trade."</hi> 
</p><p>2. The latter part of the section, about raising the value of 
land, I take the liberty to say is a mistake; which, though a 
sufficient reply to an assertion without proof, yet I shall not 
so far imitate this author as barely to say things: and 
therefore, I shall add this reason for what I say, viz. Because 
nothing can truly raise the value, i.e. the rent of land, but the 
increase of your money; but because <hi rend="italic">raising the value of land</hi> is 
a phrase, which, by its uncertain sense, may deceive others, we 
may reckon up these several, meanings of it. 
</p><p>1. The value of land is raised, when its intrinsic worth is 
increased, i.e. when it is fitted to bring forth a greater 
quantity of any valuable product. And thus the value of land is 
raised only by good husbandry. 
</p><p>2. The value of land is raised, when, remaining of the same 
fertility, it comes to yield more rent, and thus its value is 
raised only by a greater plenty of money and treasure. 
</p><p>3. Or it may be raised in our author's way, which is, by 
raising the rent in tale of pieces, but not in the quantity of 
silver received for it; which, in truth, is no raising it at all, 
any more than it could be accounted the raising of a man's rent, 
if he let his land this year for forty sixpences, which last year 
he let for twenty shillings. Nor would it alter the case, if he 
should call those forty sixpences forty shillings; for having but 
half the silver of forty shillings in them, they would be but of 
half the value, however their denomination were changed. 
</p><p>In his answer to the fifth <hi rend="italic">objection,</hi> there is this dangerous 
insinuation, That coin, in any country where it is coined, <hi rend="italic">goes 
not by weight,</hi> i.e. has its value from the stamp and 
denomination, and not the quantity of silver in it. Indeed in 
contracts already made, if your species be by law coined a fifth 
part lighter, under the same denomination, the creditor must take 
a hundred such light shillings, or twenty such light crown-pieces 
for 5l. if the law calls them so, but he loses one-fifth, in the 
intrinsic value of his debt. But, in bargains to be made, and 
things to be purchased, money has, and will always have, its 
value from the quantity of silver in it, and not from the stamp 
and denomination, as has been already proved, and will, some time 
or other, be evidenced with a witness, in the clipped money. And 
if it were not so, that the value of money were not according to 
the quantity of silver in it, i.e. that it goes by weight, I see 
no reason why clipping should be so severely punished. 
</p><p>As to foreigners, he is forced to confess, that it is all one 
what our money is, greater or less, who regard only the quantity 
of silver they sell their goods for; how then can the lessening 
our money bring more plenty of bullion into <hi rend="italic">England</hi> or to the 
mint? 
</p><p>But he says, <hi rend="italic">"The owners and importers of silver will find a 
good mArket at the mint,"</hi> &amp;c. But always a better in 
<hi rend="italic">Lombard-street,</hi> and not a grain of it will come to the mint, as 
long as by an under-balance of trade, or which other foreign 
expenses, we contract debts beyond sea, which require the 
remitting of greater sums thither, than are imported in bullion." 
<hi rend="italic">If for above forty years after silver was raised, in the 
forty-third year of queen Elizabeth, from 5s. to 5s. 2d. the 
ounce, uncoined silver was not worth above 4s. 10d. per ounce;"</hi> 
-- the cause was not that raising of silver in the mint, but an 
over-balance of trade, which bringing in an increase of silver 
yearly, for which men having no occasion abroad, brought it to 
the mint to be coined, rather than let it lie dead by them in 
bullion: and whenever that is the case again in <hi rend="italic">England</hi>, it will 
occasion coining again, and not till then. <hi rend="italic">"No money was in those 
days exported,"</hi> says he; no, nor bullion neither, say I; why 
should, or how could it, when our exported merchandize paid for 
all the commodities we brought home, with an overplus of silver 
and gold, which, staying here, set the mint on work. But the 
passing this bill will not hinder the exportation of one ounce 
either of bullion or money, which must go, if you contract debts 
beyond sea; and how its having been <hi rend="italic">once melted in England</hi>, which 
is another thing proposed in this bill, shall hinder its 
exportation, is hard to conceive, when even coining has not been 
able to do it, as is demonstrable, if it be examined what vast 
sums of milled money have been coined in the two last reigns, and 
how little of it is now left. Besides, if the exportation of 
bullion should be brought under any greater difficulty than of 
any other commodity, it is to be considered whether the 
management of that trade, which is in skilful hands, will not 
thereupon be so ordered, -- as to divert it from coming to 
<hi rend="italic">England</hi> for the future, and cause it to be sent from <hi rend="italic">Spain</hi> 
directly to those places where they know <hi rend="italic">English</hi> debts will make 
it turn to best account, to answer bills of exchange sent 
thither.
