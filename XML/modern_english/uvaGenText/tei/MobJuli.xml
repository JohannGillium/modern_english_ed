<p><stage>Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:<lb/>
Is this a holiday? what! know you not,<lb/>
Being mechanical, you ought not walk<lb/>
Upon a labouring day without the sign<lb/>
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Commoner</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, a carpenter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARULLUS</speaker>
<p>Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?<lb/>
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?<lb/>
You, sir, what trade are you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Commoner</speaker>
<p>Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,<lb/>
as you would say, a cobbler.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARULLUS</speaker>
<p>But what trade art thou? answer me directly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Commoner</speaker>
<p>A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe<lb/>
conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARULLUS</speaker>
<p>What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Commoner</speaker>
<p>Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,<lb/>
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARULLUS</speaker>
<p>What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Commoner</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, cobble you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Thou art a cobbler, art thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Commoner</speaker>
<p>Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I<lb/>
meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's<lb/>
matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon<lb/>
to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I<lb/>
recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon<lb/>
neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>But wherefore art not in thy shop today?<lb/>
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Commoner</speaker>
<p>Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself<lb/>
into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,<lb/>
to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARULLUS</speaker>
<p>Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?<lb/>
What tributaries follow him to Rome,<lb/>
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?<lb/>
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!<lb/>
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,<lb/>
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft<lb/>
Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,<lb/>
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,<lb/>
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat<lb/>
The livelong day, with patient expectation,<lb/>
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:<lb/>
And when you saw his chariot but appear,<lb/>
Have you not made an universal shout,<lb/>
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,<lb/>
To hear the replication of your sounds<lb/>
Made in her concave shores?<lb/>
And do you now put on your best attire?<lb/>
And do you now cull out a holiday?<lb/>
And do you now strew flowers in his way<lb/>
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!<lb/>
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,<lb/>
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague<lb/>
That needs must light on this ingratitude.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,<lb/>
Assemble all the poor men of your sort;<lb/>
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears<lb/>
Into the channel, till the lowest stream<lb/>
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all the Commoners</stage></p>


<p>
See whether their basest metal be not moved;<lb/>
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.<lb/>
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;<lb/>
This way will I	disrobe the images,<lb/>
If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARULLUS</speaker>
<p>May we do so?<lb/>
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLAVIUS</speaker>
<p>It is no matter; let no images<lb/>
Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,<lb/>
And drive away the vulgar from the streets:<lb/>
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.<lb/>
These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing<lb/>
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,<lb/>
Who else would soar above the view of men<lb/>
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<p><stage>A public place.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;	CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,	CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among	them a Soothsayer</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Calpurnia!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Calpurnia!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALPURNIA</speaker>
<p>Here, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Stand you directly in Antonius' way,<lb/>
When he doth run his course. Antonius!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Caesar, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,<lb/>
To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,<lb/>
The barren, touched in this holy chase,<lb/>
Shake off their sterile curse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I shall remember:<lb/>
When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Set on; and leave no ceremony out.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Flourish</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>Caesar!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Ha! who calls?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Who is it in the press that calls on me?<lb/>
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,<lb/>
Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>Beware the ides of March.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>What man is that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Set him before me; let me see his face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>Beware the ides of March.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Will you go see the order of the course?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Not I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I pray you, do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part<lb/>
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.<lb/>
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;<lb/>
I'll leave you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:<lb/>
I have not from your eyes that gentleness<lb/>
And show of love as I was wont to have:<lb/>
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand<lb/>
Over your friend that loves you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Cassius,<lb/>
Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,<lb/>
I turn the trouble of my countenance<lb/>
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am<lb/>
Of late with passions of some difference,<lb/>
Conceptions only proper to myself,<lb/>
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;<lb/>
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved&mdash;<lb/>
Among which number, Cassius, be you one&mdash;<lb/>
Nor construe any further my neglect,<lb/>
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,<lb/>
Forgets the shows of love to other men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;<lb/>
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried<lb/>
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.<lb/>
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,<lb/>
But by reflection, by some other things.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis just:<lb/>
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,<lb/>
That you have no such mirrors as will turn<lb/>
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,<lb/>
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,<lb/>
Where many of the best respect in Rome,<lb/>
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus<lb/>
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,<lb/>
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,<lb/>
That you would have me seek into myself<lb/>
For that which is not in me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:<lb/>
And since you know you cannot see yourself<lb/>
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,<lb/>
Will modestly discover to yourself<lb/>
That of yourself which you yet know not of.<lb/>
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:<lb/>
Were I a common laugher, or did use<lb/>
To stale with ordinary oaths my love<lb/>
To every new protester; if you know<lb/>
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard<lb/>
And after scandal them, or if you know<lb/>
That I profess myself in banqueting<lb/>
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Flourish, and shout</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people<lb/>
Choose Caesar for their king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, do you fear it?<lb/>
Then must I think you would not have it so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.<lb/>
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?<lb/>
What is it that you would impart to me?<lb/>
If it be aught toward the general good,<lb/>
Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,<lb/>
And I will look on both indifferently,<lb/>
For let the gods so speed me as I love<lb/>
The name of honour more than I fear death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,<lb/>
As well as I do know your outward favour.<lb/>
Well, honour is the subject of my story.<lb/>
I cannot tell what you and other men<lb/>
Think of this life; but, for my single self,<lb/>
I had as lief not be as live to be<lb/>
In awe of such a thing as I myself.<lb/>
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:<lb/>
We both have fed as well, and we can both<lb/>
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:<lb/>
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,<lb/>
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,<lb/>
Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now<lb/>
Leap in with me into this angry flood,<lb/>
And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,<lb/>
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in<lb/>
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.<lb/>
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it<lb/>
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside<lb/>
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;<lb/>
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,<lb/>
Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'<lb/>
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,<lb/>
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder<lb/>
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<lb/>
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man<lb/>
Is now become a god, and Cassius is<lb/>
A wretched creature and must bend his body,<lb/>
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<lb/>
He had a fever when he was in Spain,<lb/>
And when the fit was on him, I did mark<lb/>
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;<lb/>
His coward lips did from their colour fly,<lb/>
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<lb/>
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:<lb/>
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans<lb/>
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,<lb/>
Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'<lb/>
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me<lb/>
A man of such a feeble temper should<lb/>
So get the start of the majestic world<lb/>
And bear the palm alone.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Shout. Flourish</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Another general shout!<lb/>
I do believe that these applauses are<lb/>
For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<lb/>
Like a Colossus, and we petty men<lb/>
Walk under his huge legs and peep about<lb/>
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.<lb/>
Men at some time are masters of their fates:<lb/>
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<lb/>
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<lb/>
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?<lb/>
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?<lb/>
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;<lb/>
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;<lb/>
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,<lb/>
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.<lb/>
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,<lb/>
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,<lb/>
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!<lb/>
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!<lb/>
When went there by an age, since the great flood,<lb/>
But it was famed with more than with one man?<lb/>
When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,<lb/>
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?<lb/>
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,<lb/>
When there is in it but one only man.<lb/>
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,<lb/>
There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd<lb/>
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome<lb/>
As easily as a king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;<lb/>
What you would work me to, I have some aim:<lb/>
How I have thought of this and of these times,<lb/>
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,<lb/>
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,<lb/>
Be any further moved. What you have said<lb/>
I will consider; what you have to say<lb/>
I will with patience hear, and find a time<lb/>
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.<lb/>
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:<lb/>
Brutus had rather be a villager<lb/>
Than to repute himself a son of Rome<lb/>
Under these hard conditions as this time<lb/>
Is like to lay upon us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I am glad that my weak words<lb/>
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>The games are done and Caesar is returning.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;<lb/>
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you<lb/>
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,<lb/>
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,<lb/>
And all the rest look like a chidden train:<lb/>
Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero<lb/>
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes<lb/>
As we have seen him in the Capitol,<lb/>
Being cross'd in conference by some senators.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Casca will tell us what the matter is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Antonius!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Caesar?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Let me have men about me that are fat;<lb/>
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:<lb/>
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;<lb/>
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;<lb/>
He is a noble Roman and well given.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:<lb/>
Yet if my name were liable to fear,<lb/>
I do not know the man I should avoid<lb/>
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;<lb/>
He is a great observer and he looks<lb/>
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,<lb/>
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;<lb/>
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort<lb/>
As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit<lb/>
That could be moved to smile at any thing.<lb/>
Such men as he be never at heart's ease<lb/>
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,<lb/>
And therefore are they very dangerous.<lb/>
I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd<lb/>
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.<lb/>
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,<lb/>
And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,<lb/>
That Caesar looks so sad.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Why, you were with him, were you not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Why, there was a crown offered him: and being<lb/>
offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,<lb/>
thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>What was the second noise for?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Why, for that too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Why, for that too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Was the crown offered him thrice?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every<lb/>
time gentler than other, and at every putting-by<lb/>
mine honest neighbours shouted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Who offered him the crown?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Why, Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:<lb/>
it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark<lb/>
Antony offer him a crown;&mdash;yet 'twas not a crown<lb/>
neither, 'twas one of these coronets;&mdash;and, as I told<lb/>
you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my<lb/>
thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he<lb/>
offered it to him again; then he put it by again:<lb/>
but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his<lb/>
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third<lb/>
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he<lb/>
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their<lb/>
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps<lb/>
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because<lb/>
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked<lb/>
Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and<lb/>
for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of<lb/>
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at<lb/>
mouth, and was speechless.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,<lb/>
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,<lb/>
Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not<lb/>
clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and<lb/>
displeased them, as they use to do the players in<lb/>
the theatre, I am no true man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>What said he when he came unto himself?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the<lb/>
common herd was glad he refused the crown, he<lb/>
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his<lb/>
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any<lb/>
occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,<lb/>
I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so<lb/>
he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,<lb/>
If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired<lb/>
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three<lb/>
or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good<lb/>
soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but<lb/>
there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had<lb/>
stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Ay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Did Cicero say any thing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Ay, he spoke Greek.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>To what effect?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the<lb/>
face again: but those that understood him smiled at<lb/>
one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own<lb/>
part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more<lb/>
news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs<lb/>
off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you<lb/>
well. There was more foolery yet, if I could<lb/>
remember it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>No, I am promised forth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Will you dine with me to-morrow?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner<lb/>
worth the eating.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Good: I will expect you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Do so. Farewell, both.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!<lb/>
He was quick mettle when he went to school.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>So is he now in execution<lb/>
Of any bold or noble enterprise,<lb/>
However he puts on this tardy form.<lb/>
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,<lb/>
Which gives men stomach to digest his words<lb/>
With better appetite.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>And so it is. For this time I will leave you:<lb/>
To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,<lb/>
I will come home to you; or, if you will,<lb/>
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I will do so: till then, think of the world.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit BRUTUS</stage></p>


<p>
Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,<lb/>
Thy honourable metal may be wrought<lb/>
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet<lb/>
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;<lb/>
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?<lb/>
Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:<lb/>
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,<lb/>
He should not humour me. I will this night,<lb/>
In several hands, in at his windows throw,<lb/>
As if they came from several citizens,<lb/>
Writings all tending to the great opinion<lb/>
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely<lb/>
Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:<lb/>
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;<lb/>
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p></div2><div2 type="scene" n="3" id="d8">
<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>The same. A street.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides,	CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CICERO</speaker>
<p>Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?<lb/>
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth<lb/>
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,<lb/>
I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds<lb/>
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen<lb/>
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,<lb/>
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:<lb/>
But never till to-night, never till now,<lb/>
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.<lb/>
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,<lb/>
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,<lb/>
Incenses them to send destruction.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CICERO</speaker>
<p>Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>A common slave&mdash;you know him well by sight&mdash;<lb/>
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn<lb/>
Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,<lb/>
Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.<lb/>
Besides&mdash;I ha' not since put up my sword&mdash;<lb/>
Against the Capitol I met a lion,<lb/>
Who glared upon me, and went surly by,<lb/>
Without annoying me: and there were drawn<lb/>
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,<lb/>
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw<lb/>
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.<lb/>
And yesterday the bird of night did sit<lb/>
Even at noon-day upon the market-place,<lb/>
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies<lb/>
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say<lb/>
'These are their reasons; they are natural;'<lb/>
For, I believe, they are portentous things<lb/>
Unto the climate that they point upon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CICERO</speaker>
<p>Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:<lb/>
But men may construe things after their fashion,<lb/>
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.<lb/>
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>He doth; for he did bid Antonius<lb/>
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CICERO</speaker>
<p>Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky<lb/>
Is not to walk in.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Farewell, Cicero.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit CICERO</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter CASSIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Who's there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>A Roman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Casca, by your voice.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>A very pleasing night to honest men.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Who ever knew the heavens menace so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Those that have known the earth so full of faults.<lb/>
For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,<lb/>
Submitting me unto the perilous night,<lb/>
And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,<lb/>
Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;<lb/>
And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open<lb/>
The breast of heaven, I did present myself<lb/>
Even in the aim and very flash of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?<lb/>
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,<lb/>
When the most mighty gods by tokens send<lb/>
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life<lb/>
That should be in a Roman you do want,<lb/>
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze<lb/>
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,<lb/>
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:<lb/>
But if you would consider the true cause<lb/>
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,<lb/>
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,<lb/>
Why old men fool and children calculate,<lb/>
Why all these things change from their ordinance<lb/>
Their natures and preformed faculties<lb/>
To monstrous quality,&mdash;why, you shall find<lb/>
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,<lb/>
To make them instruments of fear and warning<lb/>
Unto some monstrous state.<lb/>
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man<lb/>
Most like this dreadful night,<lb/>
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars<lb/>
As doth the lion in the Capitol,<lb/>
A man no mightier than thyself or me<lb/>
In personal action, yet prodigious grown<lb/>
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Let it be who it is: for Romans now<lb/>
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;<lb/>
But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,<lb/>
And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;<lb/>
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow<lb/>
Mean to establish Caesar as a king;<lb/>
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,<lb/>
In every place, save here in Italy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I know where I will wear this dagger then;<lb/>
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:<lb/>
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;<lb/>
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:<lb/>
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,<lb/>
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,<lb/>
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;<lb/>
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,<lb/>
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.<lb/>
If I know this, know all the world besides,<lb/>
That part of tyranny that I do bear<lb/>
I can shake off at pleasure.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Thunder still</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>So can I:<lb/>
So every bondman in his own hand bears<lb/>
The power to cancel his captivity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?<lb/>
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,<lb/>
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:<lb/>
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.<lb/>
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire<lb/>
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,<lb/>
What rubbish and what offal, when it serves<lb/>
For the base matter to illuminate<lb/>
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,<lb/>
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this<lb/>
Before a willing bondman; then I know<lb/>
My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,<lb/>
And dangers are to me indifferent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>You speak to Casca, and to such a man<lb/>
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:<lb/>
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,<lb/>
And I will set this foot of mine as far<lb/>
As who goes farthest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>There's a bargain made.<lb/>
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already<lb/>
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans<lb/>
To undergo with me an enterprise<lb/>
Of honourable-dangerous consequence;<lb/>
And I do know, by this, they stay for me<lb/>
In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,<lb/>
There is no stir or walking in the streets;<lb/>
And the complexion of the element<lb/>
In favour's like the work we have in hand,<lb/>
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;<lb/>
He is a friend.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CINNA</stage></p>


<p>
Cinna, where haste you so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>No, it is Casca; one incorporate<lb/>
To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!<lb/>
There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Am I not stay'd for? tell me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>Yes, you are.<lb/>
O Cassius, if you could<lb/>
But win the noble Brutus to our party&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,<lb/>
And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,<lb/>
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this<lb/>
In at his window; set this up with wax<lb/>
Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,<lb/>
Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.<lb/>
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone<lb/>
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,<lb/>
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit CINNA</stage></p>


<p>
Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day<lb/>
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him<lb/>
Is ours already, and the man entire<lb/>
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:<lb/>
And that which would appear offence in us,<lb/>
His countenance, like richest alchemy,<lb/>
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Him and his worth and our great need of him<lb/>
You have right well conceited. Let us go,<lb/>
For it is after midnight; and ere day<lb/>
We will awake him and be sure of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>

<p>What, Lucius, ho!<lb/>
I cannot, by the progress of the stars,<lb/>

I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.<lb/>
When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Call'd you, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>It must be by his death: and for my part,<lb/>
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,<lb/>
But for the general. He would be crown'd:<lb/>
How that might change his nature, there's the question.<lb/>
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;<lb/>
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?&mdash;that;&mdash;<lb/>
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,<lb/>
That at his will he may do danger with.<lb/>
The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins<lb/>
Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,<lb/>
I have not known when his affections sway'd<lb/>
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,<lb/>
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,<lb/>
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;<lb/>
But when he once attains the upmost round.<lb/>
He then unto the ladder turns his back,<lb/>
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees<lb/>
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.<lb/>
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel<lb/>
Will bear no colour for the thing he is,<lb/>
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,<lb/>
Would run to these and these extremities:<lb/>
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg<lb/>
Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,<lb/>
And kill him in the shell.<lb/>

'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.<lb/>

Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'<lb/>
Such instigations have been often dropp'd<lb/>
Where I have took them up.<lb/>
'Shall Rome, &amp;c.' Thus must I piece it out:<lb/>
Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?<lb/>
My ancestors did from the streets of Rome<lb/>
The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.<lb/>
'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated<lb/>

So let high-sighted tyranny range on,<lb/>
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,<lb/>
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough<lb/>
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour<lb/>
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,<lb/>
What need we any spur but our own cause,<lb/>
To prick us to redress? what other bond<lb/>
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,<lb/>
And will not palter? and what other oath<lb/>
Than honesty to honesty engaged,<lb/>
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?<lb/>
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,<lb/>
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls<lb/>
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear<lb/>
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain<lb/>
The even virtue of our enterprise,<lb/>
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,<lb/>
To think that or our cause or our performance<lb/>
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood<lb/>
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,<lb/>
Is guilty of a several bastardy,<lb/>
If he do break the smallest particle<lb/>
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?<lb/>
I think he will stand very strong with us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Let us not leave him out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>No, by no means.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>METELLUS CIMBER</speaker>
<p>O, let us have him, for his silver hairs<lb/>
Will purchase us a good opinion<lb/>
And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:<lb/>
It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;<lb/>
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,<lb/>
But all be buried in his gravity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>O, name him not: let us not break with him;<lb/>
For he will never follow any thing<lb/>
That other men begin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Then leave him out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Indeed he is not fit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,<lb/>
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,<lb/>
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him<lb/>
A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,<lb/>
If he improve them, may well stretch so far<lb/>
As to annoy us all: which to prevent,<lb/>
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,<lb/>
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,<lb/>
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;<lb/>
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:<lb/>
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.<lb/>
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;<lb/>
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:<lb/>
O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,<lb/>
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,<lb/>
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,<lb/>
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;<lb/>
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,<lb/>
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:<lb/>
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,<lb/>
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,<lb/>
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make<lb/>
Our purpose necessary and not envious:<lb/>
Which so appearing to the common eyes,<lb/>
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.<lb/>
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;<lb/>
For he can do no more than Caesar's arm<lb/>
When Caesar's head is off.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Yet I fear him;<lb/>
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:<lb/>
If he love Caesar, all that he can do<lb/>
Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:<lb/>
And that were much he should; for he is given<lb/>
To sports, to wildness and much company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TREBONIUS</speaker>
<p>There is no fear in him; let him not die;<lb/>
For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Clock strikes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Peace! count the clock.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>The clock hath stricken three.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TREBONIUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis time to part.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>But it is doubtful yet,<lb/>
Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;<lb/>
For he is superstitious grown of late,<lb/>
Quite from the main opinion he held once<lb/>
Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:<lb/>
It may be, these apparent prodigies,<lb/>
The unaccustom'd terror of this night,<lb/>
And the persuasion of his augurers,<lb/>
May hold him from the Capitol to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Never fear that: if he be so resolved,<lb/>
I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear<lb/>
That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,<lb/>
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,<lb/>
Lions with toils and men with flatterers;<lb/>
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,<lb/>
He says he does, being then most flattered.<lb/>
Let me work;<lb/>
For I can give his humour the true bent,<lb/>
And I will bring him to the Capitol.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>METELLUS CIMBER</speaker>
<p>Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,<lb/>
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:<lb/>
I wonder none of you have thought of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Now, good Metellus, go along by him:<lb/>
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;<lb/>
Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.<lb/>
And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember<lb/>
What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;<lb/>
Let not our looks put on our purposes,<lb/>
But bear it as our Roman actors do,<lb/>
With untired spirits and formal constancy:<lb/>
And so good morrow to you every one.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but BRUTUS</stage></p>


<p>
Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;<lb/>
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:<lb/>
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,<lb/>
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;<lb/>
Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PORTIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Brutus, my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?<lb/>
It is not for your health thus to commit<lb/>
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,<lb/>
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,<lb/>
You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,<lb/>
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,<lb/>
And when I ask'd you what the matter was,<lb/>
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;<lb/>
I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,<lb/>
And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;<lb/>
Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,<lb/>
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,<lb/>
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;<lb/>
Fearing to strengthen that impatience<lb/>
Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal<lb/>
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,<lb/>
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.<lb/>
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,<lb/>
And could it work so much upon your shape<lb/>
As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,<lb/>
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,<lb/>
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I am not well in health, and that is all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,<lb/>
He would embrace the means to come by it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Is Brutus sick? and is it physical<lb/>
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours<lb/>
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,<lb/>
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,<lb/>
To dare the vile contagion of the night<lb/>
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air<lb/>
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;<lb/>
You have some sick offence within your mind,<lb/>
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,<lb/>
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,<lb/>
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,<lb/>
By all your vows of love and that great vow<lb/>
Which did incorporate and make us one,<lb/>
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,<lb/>
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night<lb/>
Have had to resort to you: for here have been<lb/>
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces<lb/>
Even from darkness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Kneel not, gentle Portia.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.<lb/>
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,<lb/>
Is it excepted I should know no secrets<lb/>
That appertain to you? Am I yourself<lb/>
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,<lb/>
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,<lb/>
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs<lb/>
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,<lb/>
Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>You are my true and honourable wife,<lb/>
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops<lb/>
That visit my sad heart<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>If this were true, then should I know this secret.<lb/>
I grant I am a woman; but withal<lb/>
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:<lb/>
I grant I am a woman; but withal<lb/>
A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.<lb/>
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,<lb/>
Being so father'd and so husbanded?<lb/>
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:<lb/>
I have made strong proof of my constancy,<lb/>
Giving myself a voluntary wound<lb/>
Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.<lb/>
And not my husband's secrets?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>O ye gods,<lb/>
Render me worthy of this noble wife!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking within</stage></p>


<p>
Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;<lb/>
And by and by thy bosom shall partake<lb/>
The secrets of my heart.<lb/>
All my engagements I will construe to thee,<lb/>
All the charactery of my sad brows:<lb/>
Leave me with haste.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit PORTIA</stage></p>


<p>
Lucius, who's that knocks?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>He is a sick man that would speak with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.<lb/>
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LIGARIUS</speaker>
<p>Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,<lb/>
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LIGARIUS</speaker>
<p>I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand<lb/>
Any exploit worthy the name of honour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,<lb/>
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LIGARIUS</speaker>
<p>By all the gods that Romans bow before,<lb/>
I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!<lb/>
Brave son, derived from honourable loins!<lb/>
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up<lb/>
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,<lb/>
And I will strive with things impossible;<lb/>
Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>A piece of work that will make sick men whole.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LIGARIUS</speaker>
<p>But are not some whole that we must make sick?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>That must we also. What it is, my Caius,<lb/>
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going<lb/>
To whom it must be done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LIGARIUS</speaker>
<p>Set on your foot,<lb/>
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,<lb/>
To do I know not what: but it sufficeth<lb/>
That Brutus leads me on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Follow me, then.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:<lb/>

'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Go bid the priests do present sacrifice<lb/>
And bring me their opinions of success.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>I will, my lord.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter CALPURNIA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALPURNIA</speaker>
<p>What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?<lb/>
You shall not stir out of your house to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me<lb/>
Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see<lb/>
The face of Caesar, they are vanished.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALPURNIA</speaker>
<p>Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,<lb/>
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,<lb/>
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,<lb/>
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.<lb/>
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;<lb/>
And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;<lb/>
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,<lb/>
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,<lb/>
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;<lb/>
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,<lb/>
Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,<lb/>
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.<lb/>
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,<lb/>
And I do fear them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>What can be avoided<lb/>
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?<lb/>
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions<lb/>
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALPURNIA</speaker>
<p>When beggars die, there are no comets seen;<lb/>
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Cowards die many times before their deaths;<lb/>
The valiant never taste of death but once.<lb/>
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.<lb/>
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;<lb/>
Seeing that death, a necessary end,<lb/>
Will come when it will come.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Servant</stage></p>


<p>
What say the augurers?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>They would not have you to stir forth to-day.<lb/>
Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,<lb/>
They could not find a heart within the beast.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>The gods do this in shame of cowardice:<lb/>
Caesar should be a beast without a heart,<lb/>
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.<lb/>
No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well<lb/>
That Caesar is more dangerous than he:<lb/>
We are two lions litter'd in one day,<lb/>
And I the elder and more terrible:<lb/>
And Caesar shall go forth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALPURNIA</speaker>
<p>Alas, my lord,<lb/>
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.<lb/>
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear<lb/>
That keeps you in the house, and not your own.<lb/>
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:<lb/>
And he shall say you are not well to-day:<lb/>
Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Mark Antony shall say I am not well,<lb/>
And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DECIUS BRUTUS</stage></p>


<p>
Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:<lb/>
I come to fetch you to the senate-house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>And you are come in very happy time,<lb/>
To bear my greeting to the senators<lb/>
And tell them that I will not come to-day:<lb/>
Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:<lb/>
I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALPURNIA</speaker>
<p>Say he is sick.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Shall Caesar send a lie?<lb/>
Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,<lb/>
To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?<lb/>
Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,<lb/>
Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>The cause is in my will: I will not come;<lb/>
That is enough to satisfy the senate.<lb/>
But for your private satisfaction,<lb/>
Because I love you, I will let you know:<lb/>
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:<lb/>
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,<lb/>
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,<lb/>
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans<lb/>
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:<lb/>
And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,<lb/>
And evils imminent; and on her knee<lb/>
Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>This dream is all amiss interpreted;<lb/>
It was a vision fair and fortunate:<lb/>
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,<lb/>
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,<lb/>
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck<lb/>
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press<lb/>
For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.<lb/>
This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>And this way have you well expounded it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I have, when you have heard what I can say:<lb/>
And know it now: the senate have concluded<lb/>
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.<lb/>
If you shall send them word you will not come,<lb/>
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock<lb/>
Apt to be render'd, for some one to say<lb/>
'Break up the senate till another time,<lb/>
When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'<lb/>
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper<lb/>
'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?<lb/>
Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love<lb/>
To our proceeding bids me tell you this;<lb/>
And reason to my love is liable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!<lb/>
I am ashamed I did yield to them.<lb/>
Give me my robe, for I will go.<lb/>

<p>Welcome, Publius.<lb/>
What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?<lb/>
Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,<lb/>
Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy<lb/>
As that same ague which hath made you lean.<lb/>

Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,<lb/>
To see him pass on to the Capitol.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar<lb/>
To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,<lb/>
I shall beseech him to befriend himself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Soothsayer</speaker>
<p>None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.<lb/>
Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:<lb/>
The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,<lb/>
Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,<lb/>
Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:<lb/>
I'll get me to a place more void, and there<lb/>
Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PORTIA</speaker>
<p>I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing<lb/>
The heart of woman is! O Brutus,<lb/>
The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!<lb/>
Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit<lb/>
That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.<lb/>
Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;<lb/>
Say I am merry: come to me again,<lb/>
And bring me word what he doth say to thee.<lb/>

I fear our purpose is discovered.<lb/>

<p>Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.<lb/>
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,<lb/>
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,<lb/>
For I will slay myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Cassius, be constant:<lb/>
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;<lb/>
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.<lb/>
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,<lb/>
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>He is address'd: press near and second him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>Are we all ready? What is now amiss<lb/>
That Caesar and his senate must redress?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>METELLUS CIMBER</speaker>
<p>Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,<lb/>
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat<lb/>
An humble heart,&mdash;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kneeling</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>I must prevent thee, Cimber.<lb/>
These couchings and these lowly courtesies<lb/>
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,<lb/>
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree<lb/>
Into the law of children. Be not fond,<lb/>
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood<lb/>
That will be thaw'd from the true quality<lb/>
With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,<lb/>
Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.<lb/>
Thy brother by decree is banished:<lb/>
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,<lb/>
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.<lb/>
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause<lb/>
Will he be satisfied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>METELLUS CIMBER</speaker>
<p>Is there no voice more worthy than my own<lb/>
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear<lb/>
For the repealing of my banish'd brother?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;<lb/>
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may<lb/>
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>
<p>What, Brutus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:<lb/>
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,<lb/>
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I could be well moved, if I were as you:<lb/>
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:<lb/>
But I am constant as the northern star,<lb/>
Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality<lb/>
There is no fellow in the firmament.<lb/>
The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,<lb/>
They are all fire and every one doth shine,<lb/>
But there's but one in all doth hold his place:<lb/>
So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,<lb/>
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;<lb/>
Yet in the number I do know but one<lb/>
That unassailable holds on his rank,<lb/>
Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,<lb/>
Let me a little show it, even in this;<lb/>
That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,<lb/>
And constant do remain to keep him so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>O Caesar,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAESAR</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Speak, hands for me!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and	BRUTUS stab CAESAR</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!<lb/>
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Some to the common pulpits, and cry out<lb/>
'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>People and senators, be not affrighted;<lb/>
Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASCA</speaker>
<p>Go to the pulpit, Brutus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>And Cassius too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Where's Publius?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA</speaker>
<p>Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>METELLUS CIMBER</speaker>
<p>Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's<lb/>
Should chance&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;<lb/>
There is no harm intended to your person,<lb/>
Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,<lb/>
Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Do so: and let no man abide this deed,<lb/>
But we the doers.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter TREBONIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Where is Antony?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TREBONIUS</speaker>
<p>Fled to his house amazed:<lb/>
Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run<lb/>
As it were doomsday.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Fates, we will know your pleasures:<lb/>
That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time<lb/>
And drawing days out, that men stand upon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life<lb/>
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Grant that, and then is death a benefit:<lb/>
So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged<lb/>
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,<lb/>
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood<lb/>
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:<lb/>
Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,<lb/>
And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,<lb/>
Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence<lb/>
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over<lb/>
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,<lb/>
That now on Pompey's basis lies along<lb/>
No worthier than the dust!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>So oft as that shall be,<lb/>
So often shall the knot of us be call'd<lb/>
The men that gave their country liberty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DECIUS BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>What, shall we forth?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, every man away:<lb/>
Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels<lb/>
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:<lb/>
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;<lb/>
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:<lb/>
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;<lb/>
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:<lb/>
Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;<lb/>
Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.<lb/>
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony<lb/>
May safely come to him, and be resolved<lb/>
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,<lb/>
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead<lb/>
So well as Brutus living; but will follow<lb/>
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus<lb/>
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state<lb/>
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;<lb/>
I never thought him worse.<lb/>
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,<lb/>
He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,<lb/>
Depart untouch'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>I'll fetch him presently.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I know that we shall have him well to friend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I wish we may: but yet have I a mind<lb/>
That fears him much; and my misgiving still<lb/>
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>But here comes Antony.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter ANTONY</stage></p>


<p>
Welcome, Mark Antony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?<lb/>
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,<lb/>
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.<lb/>
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,<lb/>
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:<lb/>
If I myself, there is no hour so fit<lb/>
As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument<lb/>
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich<lb/>
With the most noble blood of all this world.<lb/>
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,<lb/>
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,<lb/>
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,<lb/>
I shall not find myself so apt to die:<lb/>
No place will please me so, no mean of death,<lb/>
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,<lb/>
The choice and master spirits of this age.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>O Antony, beg not your death of us.<lb/>
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,<lb/>
As, by our hands and this our present act,<lb/>
You see we do, yet see you but our hands<lb/>
And this the bleeding business they have done:<lb/>
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;<lb/>
And pity to the general wrong of Rome&mdash;<lb/>
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity&mdash;<lb/>
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,<lb/>
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:<lb/>
Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts<lb/>
Of brothers' temper, do receive you in<lb/>
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Your voice shall be as strong as any man's<lb/>
In the disposing of new dignities.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Only be patient till we have appeased<lb/>
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,<lb/>
And then we will deliver you the cause,<lb/>
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,<lb/>
Have thus proceeded.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>I doubt not of your wisdom.<lb/>
Let each man render me his bloody hand:<lb/>
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;<lb/>
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;<lb/>
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;<lb/>
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;<lb/>
Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.<lb/>
Gentlemen all,&mdash;alas, what shall I say?<lb/>
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,<lb/>
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,<lb/>
Either a coward or a flatterer.<lb/>
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:<lb/>
If then thy spirit look upon us now,<lb/>
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,<lb/>
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,<lb/>
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,<lb/>
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?<lb/>
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,<lb/>
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,<lb/>
It would become me better than to close<lb/>
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.<lb/>
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;<lb/>
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,<lb/>
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.<lb/>
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;<lb/>
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.<lb/>
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,<lb/>
Dost thou here lie!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Mark Antony,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, Caius Cassius:<lb/>
The enemies of Caesar shall say this;<lb/>
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I blame you not for praising Caesar so;<lb/>
But what compact mean you to have with us?<lb/>
Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;<lb/>
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,<lb/>
Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.<lb/>
Friends am I with you all and love you all,<lb/>
Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons<lb/>
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Or else were this a savage spectacle:<lb/>
Our reasons are so full of good regard<lb/>
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,<lb/>
You should be satisfied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>That's all I seek:<lb/>
And am moreover suitor that I may<lb/>
Produce his body to the market-place;<lb/>
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,<lb/>
Speak in the order of his funeral.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>You shall, Mark Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Brutus, a word with you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside to BRUTUS</stage></p>


<p>
You know not what you do: do not consent<lb/>
That Antony speak in his funeral:<lb/>
Know you how much the people may be moved<lb/>
By that which he will utter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>By your pardon;<lb/>
I will myself into the pulpit first,<lb/>
And show the reason of our Caesar's death:<lb/>
What Antony shall speak, I will protest<lb/>
He speaks by leave and by permission,<lb/>
And that we are contented Caesar shall<lb/>
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.<lb/>
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I know not what may fall; I like it not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.<lb/>
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,<lb/>
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,<lb/>
And say you do't by our permission;<lb/>
Else shall you not have any hand at all<lb/>
About his funeral: and you shall speak<lb/>
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,<lb/>
After my speech is ended.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Be it so.<lb/>
I do desire no more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Prepare the body then, and follow us.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but ANTONY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,<lb/>
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!<lb/>
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man<lb/>
That ever lived in the tide of times.<lb/>
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!<lb/>
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,&mdash;<lb/>
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,<lb/>
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue&mdash;<lb/>
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;<lb/>
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife<lb/>
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;<lb/>
Blood and destruction shall be so in use<lb/>
And dreadful objects so familiar<lb/>
That mothers shall but smile when they behold<lb/>
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;<lb/>
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:<lb/>
And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,<lb/>
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,<lb/>
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice<lb/>
Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;<lb/>
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth<lb/>
With carrion men, groaning for burial.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Servant</stage></p>


<p>
You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>I do, Mark Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>He did receive his letters, and is coming;<lb/>
And bid me say to you by word of mouth&mdash;<lb/>
O Caesar!&mdash;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Seeing the body</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.<lb/>
Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,<lb/>
Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,<lb/>
Began to water. Is thy master coming?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:<lb/>
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,<lb/>
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;<lb/>
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;<lb/>
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse<lb/>
Into the market-place: there shall I try<lb/>
In my oration, how the people take<lb/>
The cruel issue of these bloody men;<lb/>
According to the which, thou shalt discourse<lb/>
To young Octavius of the state of things.<lb/>
Lend me your hand.<lb/>

<p><stage>The Forum.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Citizens</speaker>
<p>We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.<lb/>
Cassius, go you into the other street,<lb/>
And part the numbers.<lb/>
Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;<lb/>
Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;<lb/>
And public reasons shall be rendered<lb/>
Of Caesar's death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>I will hear Brutus speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,<lb/>
When severally we hear them rendered.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS	goes into the pulpit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Be patient till the last.<lb/>
Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my<lb/>
cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me<lb/>
for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that<lb/>
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and<lb/>
awake your senses, that you may the better judge.<lb/>
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of<lb/>
Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar<lb/>
was no less than his. If then that friend demand<lb/>
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:<lb/>
&mdash;Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved<lb/>
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and<lb/>
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live<lb/>
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;<lb/>
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was<lb/>
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I<lb/>
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his<lb/>
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his<lb/>
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a<lb/>
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.<lb/>
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If<lb/>
any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so<lb/>
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;<lb/>
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>None, Brutus, none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Then none have I offended. I have done no more to<lb/>
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of<lb/>
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not<lb/>
extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences<lb/>
enforced, for which he suffered death.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body</stage></p>


<p>
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,<lb/>
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive<lb/>
the benefit of his dying, a place in the<lb/>
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this<lb/>
I depart,&mdash;that, as I slew my best lover for the<lb/>
good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,<lb/>
when it shall please my country to need my death.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Good countrymen, let me depart alone,<lb/>
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:<lb/>
Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech<lb/>
Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,<lb/>
By our permission, is allow'd to make.<lb/>
I do entreat you, not a man depart,<lb/>
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Let him go up into the public chair;<lb/>
We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Goes into the pulpit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>What does he say of Brutus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>He says, for Brutus' sake,<lb/>
He finds himself beholding to us all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>This Caesar was a tyrant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's certain:<lb/>
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>You gentle Romans,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Citizens</speaker>
<p>Peace, ho! let us hear him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;<lb/>
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<lb/>
The evil that men do lives after them;<lb/>
The good is oft interred with their bones;<lb/>
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<lb/>
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:<lb/>
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<lb/>
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.<lb/>
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest&mdash;<lb/>
For Brutus is an honourable man;<lb/>
So are they all, all honourable men&mdash;<lb/>
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.<lb/>
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<lb/>
But Brutus says he was ambitious;<lb/>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<lb/>
He hath brought many captives home to Rome<lb/>
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<lb/>
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<lb/>
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:<lb/>
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<lb/>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<lb/>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<lb/>
You all did see that on the Lupercal<lb/>
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<lb/>
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<lb/>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<lb/>
And, sure, he is an honourable man.<lb/>
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<lb/>
But here I am to speak what I do know.<lb/>
You all did love him once, not without cause:<lb/>
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?<lb/>
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<lb/>
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<lb/>
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<lb/>
And I must pause till it come back to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>If thou consider rightly of the matter,<lb/>
Caesar has had great wrong.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Has he, masters?<lb/>
I fear there will a worse come in his place.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;<lb/>
Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>If it be found so, some will dear abide it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>Now mark him, he begins again to speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>But yesterday the word of Caesar might<lb/>
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.<lb/>
And none so poor to do him reverence.<lb/>
O masters, if I were disposed to stir<lb/>
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<lb/>
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,<lb/>
Who, you all know, are honourable men:<lb/>
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose<lb/>
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,<lb/>
Than I will wrong such honourable men.<lb/>
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;<lb/>
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:<lb/>
Let but the commons hear this testament&mdash;<lb/>
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read&mdash;<lb/>
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds<lb/>
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,<lb/>
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,<lb/>
And, dying, mention it within their wills,<lb/>
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy<lb/>
Unto their issue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;<lb/>
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.<lb/>
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;<lb/>
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,<lb/>
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:<lb/>
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;<lb/>
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;<lb/>
You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?<lb/>
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:<lb/>
I fear I wrong the honourable men<lb/>
Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>They were traitors: honourable men!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>The will! the testament!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>You will compel me, then, to read the will?<lb/>
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,<lb/>
And let me show you him that made the will.<lb/>
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Several Citizens</speaker>
<p>Come down.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>Descend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>You shall have leave.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>ANTONY comes down</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>A ring; stand round.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>Room for Antony, most noble Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Several Citizens</speaker>
<p>Stand back; room; bear back.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.<lb/>
You all do know this mantle: I remember<lb/>
The first time ever Caesar put it on;<lb/>
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,<lb/>
That day he overcame the Nervii:<lb/>
Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:<lb/>
See what a rent the envious Casca made:<lb/>
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;<lb/>
And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,<lb/>
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,<lb/>
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved<lb/>
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;<lb/>
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:<lb/>
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!<lb/>
This was the most unkindest cut of all;<lb/>
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,<lb/>
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,<lb/>
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;<lb/>
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,<lb/>
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,<lb/>
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.<lb/>
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!<lb/>
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,<lb/>
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.<lb/>
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel<lb/>
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.<lb/>
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold<lb/>
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,<lb/>
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>O piteous spectacle!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>O noble Caesar!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>O woful day!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>O traitors, villains!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>O most bloody sight!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>We will be revenged.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!<lb/>
Let not a traitor live!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Stay, countrymen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Peace there! hear the noble Antony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up<lb/>
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.<lb/>
They that have done this deed are honourable:<lb/>
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,<lb/>
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,<lb/>
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.<lb/>
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:<lb/>
I am no orator, as Brutus is;<lb/>
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,<lb/>
That love my friend; and that they know full well<lb/>
That gave me public leave to speak of him:<lb/>
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,<lb/>
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,<lb/>
To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;<lb/>
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;<lb/>
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,<lb/>
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,<lb/>
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<lb/>
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue<lb/>
In every wound of Caesar that should move<lb/>
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>We'll mutiny.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>We'll burn the house of Brutus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:<lb/>
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?<lb/>
Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:<lb/>
You have forgot the will I told you of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.<lb/>
To every Roman citizen he gives,<lb/>
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>O royal Caesar!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Hear me with patience.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Peace, ho!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,<lb/>
His private arbours and new-planted orchards,<lb/>
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,<lb/>
And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,<lb/>
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.<lb/>
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Never, never. Come, away, away!<lb/>
We'll burn his body in the holy place,<lb/>
And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.<lb/>
Take up the body.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>Go fetch fire.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Pluck down benches.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Citizen</speaker>
<p>Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Citizens with the body</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,<lb/>
Take thou what course thou wilt!<lb/>

<p>
How now, fellow!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Where is he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>And thither will I straight to visit him:<lb/>
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,<lb/>
And in this mood will give us any thing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius<lb/>
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Belike they had some notice of the people,<lb/>
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.<lb/>

<p>What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I<lb/>
dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to<lb/>
answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and<lb/>
truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:<lb/>
you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CINNA THE POET</speaker>
<p>Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>As a friend or an enemy?<lb/>

<p>He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.<lb/>
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;<lb/>
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine<lb/>
How to cut off some charge in legacies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEPIDUS</speaker>
<p>What, shall I find you here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>This is a slight unmeritable man,<lb/>
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,<lb/>
The three-fold world divided, he should stand<lb/>
One of the three to share it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>So you thought him;<lb/>
And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,<lb/>
In our black sentence and proscription.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Octavius, I have seen more days than you:<lb/>
And though we lay these honours on this man,<lb/>
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,<lb/>
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,<lb/>
To groan and sweat under the business,<lb/>
Either led or driven, as we point the way;<lb/>
And having brought our treasure where we will,<lb/>
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,<lb/>
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,<lb/>
And graze in commons.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>You may do your will;<lb/>
But he's a tried and valiant soldier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>So is my horse, Octavius; and for that<lb/>
I do appoint him store of provender:<lb/>
It is a creature that I teach to fight,<lb/>
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,<lb/>
His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.<lb/>
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;<lb/>
He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;<lb/>
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds<lb/>
On abjects, orts and imitations,<lb/>
Which, out of use and staled by other men,<lb/>
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,<lb/>
But as a property. And now, Octavius,<lb/>
Listen great things:&mdash;Brutus and Cassius<lb/>
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:<lb/>
Therefore let our alliance be combined,<lb/>
Our best friends made, our means stretch'd<lb/>
And let us presently go sit in council,<lb/>
How covert matters may be best disclosed,<lb/>
And open perils surest answered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Let us do so: for we are at the stake,<lb/>
And bay'd about with many enemies;<lb/>
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,<lb/>
Millions of mischiefs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>He is at hand; and Pindarus is come<lb/>
To do you salutation from his master.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,<lb/>
In his own change, or by ill officers,<lb/>

Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,<lb/>
I shall be satisfied.<lb/>

It useth an enforced ceremony.<lb/>
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Cassius, be content.<lb/>
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.<lb/>
Before the eyes of both our armies here,<lb/>
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,<lb/>
Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;<lb/>
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,<lb/>
And I will give you audience.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Pindarus,<lb/>
Bid our commanders lead their charges off<lb/>
A little from this ground.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man<lb/>
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.<lb/>
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>Brutus's tent.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:<lb/>
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella<lb/>
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;<lb/>
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,<lb/>
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>You wronged yourself to write in such a case.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>In such a time as this it is not meet<lb/>
That every nice offence should bear his comment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself<lb/>
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;<lb/>
To sell and mart your offices for gold<lb/>
To undeservers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I an itching palm!<lb/>
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,<lb/>
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>The name of Cassius honours this corruption,<lb/>
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Chastisement!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Remember March, the ides of March remember:<lb/>
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?<lb/>
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,<lb/>
And not for justice? What, shall one of us<lb/>
That struck the foremost man of all this world<lb/>
But for supporting robbers, shall we now<lb/>
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,<lb/>
And sell the mighty space of our large honours<lb/>
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?<lb/>
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,<lb/>
Than such a Roman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Brutus, bay not me;<lb/>
I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,<lb/>
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,<lb/>
Older in practise, abler than yourself<lb/>
To make conditions.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Go to; you are not, Cassius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I am.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I say you are not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;<lb/>
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Away, slight man!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Is't possible?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Hear me, for I will speak.<lb/>
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?<lb/>
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;<lb/>
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,<lb/>
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?<lb/>
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch<lb/>
Under your testy humour? By the gods<lb/>
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,<lb/>
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,<lb/>
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,<lb/>
When you are waspish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Is it come to this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>You say you are a better soldier:<lb/>
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,<lb/>
And it shall please me well: for mine own part,<lb/>
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;<lb/>
I said, an elder soldier, not a better:<lb/>
Did I say 'better'?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>If you did, I care not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I durst not!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>What, durst not tempt him!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>For your life you durst not!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Do not presume too much upon my love;<lb/>
I may do that I shall be sorry for.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>You have done that you should be sorry for.<lb/>
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,<lb/>
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty<lb/>
That they pass by me as the idle wind,<lb/>
Which I respect not. I did send to you<lb/>
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:<lb/>
For I can raise no money by vile means:<lb/>
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,<lb/>
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring<lb/>
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash<lb/>
By any indirection: I did send<lb/>
To you for gold to pay my legions,<lb/>
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?<lb/>
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?<lb/>
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,<lb/>
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,<lb/>
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;<lb/>
Dash him to pieces!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I denied you not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>You did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I did not: he was but a fool that brought<lb/>
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:<lb/>
A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,<lb/>
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I do not, till you practise them on me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>You love me not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I do not like your faults.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>A friendly eye could never see such faults.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>A flatterer's would not, though they do appear<lb/>
As huge as high Olympus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,<lb/>
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,<lb/>
For Cassius is aweary of the world;<lb/>
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;<lb/>
Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,<lb/>
Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,<lb/>
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep<lb/>
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,<lb/>
And here my naked breast; within, a heart<lb/>
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:<lb/>
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;<lb/>
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:<lb/>
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,<lb/>
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better<lb/>
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Sheathe your dagger:<lb/>
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;<lb/>
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.<lb/>
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb<lb/>
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;<lb/>
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,<lb/>
And straight is cold again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Hath Cassius lived<lb/>
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,<lb/>
When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>And my heart too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>O Brutus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Have not you love enough to bear with me,<lb/>
When that rash humour which my mother gave me<lb/>
Makes me forgetful?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,<lb/>
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,<lb/>
He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Let me go in to see the generals;<lb/>
There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet<lb/>
They be alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  You shall not come to them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Nothing but death shall stay me.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>How now! what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Poet</speaker>
<p>For shame, you generals! what do you mean?<lb/>
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;<lb/>
For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:<lb/>
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?<lb/>
Companion, hence!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Away, away, be gone.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Poet</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders<lb/>
Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you<lb/>
Immediately to us.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Lucius, a bowl of wine!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit LUCIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I did not think you could have been so angry.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Of your philosophy you make no use,<lb/>
If you give place to accidental evils.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Ha! Portia!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>She is dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?<lb/>
O insupportable and touching loss!<lb/>
Upon what sickness?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Impatient of my absence,<lb/>
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony<lb/>
Have made themselves so strong:&mdash;for with her death<lb/>
That tidings came;&mdash;with this she fell distract,<lb/>
And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>And died so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Even so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>O ye immortal gods!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.<lb/>
In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.<lb/>
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;<lb/>
I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Come in, Titinius!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit LUCIUS</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA</stage></p>


<p>
Welcome, good Messala.<lb/>
Now sit we close about this taper here,<lb/>
And call in question our necessities.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Portia, art thou gone?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>No more, I pray you.<lb/>
Messala, I have here received letters,<lb/>
That young Octavius and Mark Antony<lb/>
Come down upon us with a mighty power,<lb/>
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>With what addition?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>That by proscription and bills of outlawry,<lb/>
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,<lb/>
Have put to death an hundred senators.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Therein our letters do not well agree;<lb/>
Mine speak of seventy senators that died<lb/>
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Cicero one!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Cicero is dead,<lb/>
And by that order of proscription.<lb/>
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>No, Messala.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Nothing, Messala.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>That, methinks, is strange.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>No, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:<lb/>
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:<lb/>
With meditating that she must die once,<lb/>
I have the patience to endure it now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Even so great men great losses should endure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I have as much of this in art as you,<lb/>
But yet my nature could not bear it so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Well, to our work alive. What do you think<lb/>
Of marching to Philippi presently?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I do not think it good.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Your reason?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>This it is:<lb/>
'Tis better that the enemy seek us:<lb/>
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,<lb/>
Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,<lb/>
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.<lb/>
The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground<lb/>
Do stand but in a forced affection;<lb/>
For they have grudged us contribution:<lb/>
The enemy, marching along by them,<lb/>
By them shall make a fuller number up,<lb/>
Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;<lb/>
From which advantage shall we cut him off,<lb/>
If at Philippi we do face him there,<lb/>
These people at our back.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Hear me, good brother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Under your pardon. You must note beside,<lb/>
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,<lb/>
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:<lb/>
The enemy increaseth every day;<lb/>
We, at the height, are ready to decline.<lb/>
There is a tide in the affairs of men,<lb/>
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;<lb/>
Omitted, all the voyage of their life<lb/>
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.<lb/>
On such a full sea are we now afloat;<lb/>
And we must take the current when it serves,<lb/>
Or lose our ventures.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Then, with your will, go on;<lb/>
We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>The deep of night is crept upon our talk,<lb/>
And nature must obey necessity;<lb/>
Which we will niggard with a little rest.<lb/>
There is no more to say?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>No more. Good night:<lb/>
Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Lucius!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter LUCIUS</stage></p>


<p>
My gown.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit LUCIUS</stage></p>


<p>
Farewell, good Messala:<lb/>
Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,<lb/>
Good night, and good repose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>O my dear brother!<lb/>
This was an ill beginning of the night:<lb/>
Never come such division 'tween our souls!<lb/>
Let it not, Brutus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Every thing is well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Good night, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Good night, good brother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITINIUS, MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Good night, Lord Brutus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Farewell, every one.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but BRUTUS</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown</stage></p>


<p>
Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Here in the tent.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>What, thou speak'st drowsily?<lb/>
Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.<lb/>
Call Claudius and some other of my men:<lb/>
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Varro and Claudius!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VARRO</speaker>
<p>Calls my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;<lb/>
It may be I shall raise you by and by<lb/>
On business to my brother Cassius.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VARRO</speaker>
<p>So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;<lb/>
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.<lb/>
Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;<lb/>
I put it in the pocket of my gown.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>I was sure your lordship did not give it me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.<lb/>
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,<lb/>
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, my lord, an't please you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>It does, my boy:<lb/>
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>It is my duty, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>I should not urge thy duty past thy might;<lb/>
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>I have slept, my lord, already.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;<lb/>
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,<lb/>
I will be good to thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Music, and a song</stage></p>


<p>
This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,<lb/>
Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,<lb/>
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;<lb/>
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:<lb/>
If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;<lb/>
I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.<lb/>
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down<lb/>
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter the Ghost of CAESAR</stage></p>


<p>
How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?<lb/>
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes<lb/>
That shapes this monstrous apparition.<lb/>
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?<lb/>
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,<lb/>
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?<lb/>
Speak to me what thou art.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GHOST</speaker>
<p>Thy evil spirit, Brutus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Why comest thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GHOST</speaker>
<p>To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Well; then I shall see thee again?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GHOST</speaker>
<p>Ay, at Philippi.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Ghost</stage></p>

Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:<lb/>
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.<lb/>
Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!<lb/>

<p>The strings, my lord, are false.<lb/>

Lucius, awake!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, I do not know that I did cry.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCIUS</speaker>
<p>Nothing, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!<lb/>

<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VARRO, CLAUDIUS</speaker>
<p>Did we, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Ay: saw you any thing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VARRO</speaker>
<p>No, my lord, I saw nothing.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:<lb/>
You said the enemy would not come down,<lb/>
But keep the hills and upper regions;<lb/>
It proves not so: their battles are at hand;<lb/>
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,<lb/>
Answering before we do demand of them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know<lb/>
Wherefore they do it: they could be content<lb/>
To visit other places; and come down<lb/>
With fearful bravery, thinking by this face<lb/>
To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;<lb/>
But 'tis not so.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Prepare you, generals:<lb/>
The enemy comes on in gallant show;<lb/>
Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,<lb/>
And something to be done immediately.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Octavius, lead your battle softly on,<lb/>
Upon the left hand of the even field.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Why do you cross me in this exigent?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>I do not cross you; but I will do so.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>March</stage>



</p><p><stage>Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army;	LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>They stand, and would have parley.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.<lb/>
Make forth; the generals would have some words.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Stir not until the signal.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Not that we love words better, as you do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:<lb/>
Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,<lb/>
Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Antony,<lb/>
The posture of your blows are yet unknown;<lb/>
But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,<lb/>
And leave them honeyless.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Not stingless too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>O, yes, and soundless too;<lb/>
For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,<lb/>
And very wisely threat before you sting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers<lb/>
Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:<lb/>
You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,<lb/>
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;<lb/>
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind<lb/>
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:<lb/>
This tongue had not offended so to-day,<lb/>
If Cassius might have ruled.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,<lb/>
The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;<lb/>
I draw a sword against conspirators;<lb/>
When think you that the sword goes up again?<lb/>
Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds<lb/>
Be well avenged; or till another Caesar<lb/>
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,<lb/>
Unless thou bring'st them with thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>So I hope;<lb/>
I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,<lb/>
Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,<lb/>
Join'd with a masker and a reveller!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>Old Cassius still!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Come, Antony, away!<lb/>
Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:<lb/>
If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;<lb/>
If not, when you have stomachs.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!<lb/>
The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>

<p><stage>[Standing forth]</stage></p>

<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Messala!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p><stage>[Standing forth]</stage></p><p>  What says my general?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Messala,<lb/>
This is my birth-day; as this very day<lb/>
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:<lb/>
Be thou my witness that against my will,<lb/>
As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set<lb/>
Upon one battle all our liberties.<lb/>
You know that I held Epicurus strong<lb/>
And his opinion: now I change my mind,<lb/>
And partly credit things that do presage.<lb/>
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign<lb/>
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,<lb/>
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;<lb/>
Who to Philippi here consorted us:<lb/>
This morning are they fled away and gone;<lb/>
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,<lb/>
Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,<lb/>
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem<lb/>
A canopy most fatal, under which<lb/>
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Believe not so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>I but believe it partly;<lb/>
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved<lb/>
To meet all perils very constantly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Even so, Lucilius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Now, most noble Brutus,<lb/>
The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,<lb/>
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!<lb/>
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,<lb/>
Let's reason with the worst that may befall.<lb/>
If we do lose this battle, then is this<lb/>
The very last time we shall speak together:<lb/>
What are you then determined to do?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Even by the rule of that philosophy<lb/>
By which I did blame Cato for the death<lb/>
Which he did give himself, I know not how,<lb/>
But I do find it cowardly and vile,<lb/>
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent<lb/>
The time of life: arming myself with patience<lb/>
To stay the providence of some high powers<lb/>
That govern us below.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Then, if we lose this battle,<lb/>
You are contented to be led in triumph<lb/>
Thorough the streets of Rome?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,<lb/>
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;<lb/>
He bears too great a mind. But this same day<lb/>
Must end that work the ides of March begun;<lb/>
And whether we shall meet again I know not.<lb/>
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:<lb/>
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!<lb/>
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;<lb/>
If not, why then, this parting was well made.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!<lb/>
If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;<lb/>
If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know<lb/>
The end of this day's business ere it come!<lb/>
But it sufficeth that the day will end,<lb/>
And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!<lb/>
Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:<lb/>
This ensign here of mine was turning back;<lb/>
I slew the coward, and did take it from him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITINIUS</speaker>
<p>O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;<lb/>
Who, having some advantage on Octavius,<lb/>
Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,<lb/>
Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PINDARUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PINDARUS</speaker>
<p>Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;<lb/>
Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord<lb/>
Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;<lb/>
Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITINIUS</speaker>
<p>They are, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>
<p>Titinius, if thou lovest me,<lb/>
Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,<lb/>
Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,<lb/>
And here again; that I may rest assured<lb/>
Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITINIUS</speaker>
<p>I will be here again, even with a thought.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSIUS</speaker>

My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,<lb/>
And tell me what thou notest about the field.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>PINDARUS ascends the hill</stage></p>


<p>
This day I breathed first: time is come round,<lb/>

<p>
Come hither, sirrah:<lb/>
In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;<lb/>
And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,<lb/>
That whatsoever I did bid thee do,<lb/>
Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;<lb/>
Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,<lb/>
That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.<lb/>
Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;<lb/>
And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,<lb/>
Guide thou the sword.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>PINDARUS stabs him</stage></p>


<p>
Caesar, thou art revenged,<lb/>
Even with the sword that kill'd thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PINDARUS</speaker>
<p>So, I am free; yet would not so have been,<lb/>

Far from this country Pindarus shall run,<lb/>
Where never Roman shall take note of him.<lb/>

<p>These tidings will well comfort Cassius.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Where did you leave him?<lb/>

<p>All disconsolate,<lb/>
With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>

<p>He lies not like the living. O my heart!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Is not that he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITINIUS</speaker>
<p>No, this was he, Messala,<lb/>
But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,<lb/>
As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,<lb/>
So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;<lb/>
The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;<lb/>
Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!<lb/>
Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.<lb/>
O hateful error, melancholy's child,<lb/>
Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men<lb/>
The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,<lb/>
Thou never comest unto a happy birth,<lb/>
But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITINIUS</speaker>
<p>What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet<lb/>
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report<lb/>
Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;<lb/>
For piercing steel and darts envenomed<lb/>
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus<lb/>
As tidings of this sight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TITINIUS</speaker>
<p>Hie you, Messala,<lb/>
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit MESSALA</stage></p>


<p>
Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?<lb/>
Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they<lb/>
Put on my brows this wreath of victory,<lb/>
And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?<lb/>
Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!<lb/>
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;<lb/>
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I<lb/>
Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,<lb/>
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.<lb/>
By your leave, gods:&mdash;this is a Roman's part<lb/>
Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.<lb/>

Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!<lb/>

<p>Are yet two Romans living such as these?<lb/>
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!<lb/>
It is impossible that ever Rome<lb/>
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears<lb/>
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.<lb/>
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.<lb/>
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:<lb/>
His funerals shall not be in our camp,<lb/>
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;<lb/>
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.<lb/>
Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:<lb/>
'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night<lb/>
We shall try fortune in a second fight.<lb/>

Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,<lb/>
While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STRATO</speaker>
<p>Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRUTUS</speaker>
<p>Farewell, good Strato.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Runs on his sword</stage></p>


<p>
Caesar, now be still:<lb/>
I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dies</stage>



</p><p><stage>Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA,	LUCILIUS, and the army</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>What man is that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STRATO</speaker>
<p>Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:<lb/>
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;<lb/>
For Brutus only overcame himself,<lb/>
And no man else hath honour by his death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LUCILIUS</speaker>
<p>So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,<lb/>
That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.<lb/>
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STRATO</speaker>
<p>Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>Do so, good Messala.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>How died my master, Strato?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STRATO</speaker>
<p>I held the sword, and he did run on it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MESSALA</speaker>
<p>Octavius, then take him to follow thee,<lb/>
That did the latest service to my master.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONY</speaker>
<p>This was the noblest Roman of them all:<lb/>
All the conspirators save only he<lb/>
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;<lb/>
He only, in a general honest thought<lb/>
And common good to all, made one of them.<lb/>
His life was gentle, and the elements<lb/>
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up<lb/>
And say to all the world 'This was a man!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>OCTAVIUS</speaker>
<p>According to his virtue let us use him,<lb/>
With all respect and rites of burial.<lb/>
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,<lb/>
Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.<lb/>
So call the field to rest; and let's away,<lb/>
To part the glories of this happy day.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>
