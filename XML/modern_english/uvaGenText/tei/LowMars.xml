I.  ATMOSPHERE.</head> 
 
<p>AMID the seemingly countless stars that on a clear night 
spangle the vast dome overhead, there appeared last autumn to be a 
new-comer, a very large and ruddy one, that rose at sunset through 
the haze about the eastern horizon.  That star was the planet Mars, 
so conspicuous when in such position as often to be taken for a 
portent.  Large as he then looked, however, he is in truth but a 
secondary planet traveling round a secondary sun; but his interest 
for us is out of all proportion to his actual size or his relative 
importance in the cosmos.  For that sun is our own; and that planet 
is, with the exception of the moon, our next to nearest neighbor in 
space, Venus alone ever approaching us closer.  From him, 
therefore, of all the heavenly bodies, may we expect first to learn 
something beyond celestial mechanics, beyond even celestial 
chemistry; something in answer to the mute query that man 
instinctively makes as he gazes at the stars, whether there be life 
in worlds other than his own. 
</p><p>Hitherto the question has received no affirmative reply, 
although the trend of all latter-day investigation has been to such 
affirmation; for science has been demonstrating more and more 
clearly the essential oneness of the universe.  Matter proves to be 
common property.  We have learnt that the very same substances with 
which we are familiar on this our earth, iron, magnesium, calcium, 
and the rest, are present in the far-off stars that strew the 
depths of space.  Nothing new under the sun!  Indeed, there is 
nothing new above it but ever-varying detail. 
</p><p>So much for matter.  As for mind beyond the confines of our 
tiny globe, modesty, backed by a probability little short of 
demonstration, forbids the thought that we are the sole thinkers in 
this great universe. 
</p><p>That we are the only minds in space it takes indeed a very 
small mind to fancy.  Our relative insignificance commonly escapes 
us.  If we reduce the universe to a scale on which we can conceive 
it, that on which the earth shall be represented by a good-sized 
pea, with a grain of mustard seed, the moon, circling about it at 
a distance of seven inches, the sun would be a globe two feet in 
diameter, two hundred and twenty feet away.  Mars, a much smaller 
pea, would circle round the two-foot globe, three hundred and fifty 
feet from its surface; Jupiter, an orange, at a distance of a 
quarter of a mile; Saturn, a small orange, at two fifths of a mile; 
and Uranus and Neptune, 
 
   <pb n="595"/>   
 
good-sized plums, three quarters of 
a mile and a mile and a quarter away, respectively.  The nearest 
star would lie two hundred and thirty thousand miles off, or at 
about the actual distance of our own moon, and the other stars at 
corresponding distances beyond that; that is, on a scale upon which 
the moon should be but seven inches off, the nearest star would 
still be as far from us as the moon is now.  When we think that 
each of these stars is probably the centre of a solar system on a 
grander scale than our own, we cannot seriously take ourselves to 
be the only minds in the universe. 
</p><p>But improbable as the absence of ultra-terrestrial life in a 
general way is, up to the present time we have had no proof of its 
particular existence in worlds beyond our own.  Whether the 
observations I am now to describe have revealed something on the 
point I shall leave the reader himself to judge, after laying the 
facts before him; for it is with this in view that the present 
papers will deal with Mars, since any answer on this point is the 
most generally interesting outcome of a study of the planet.  That 
the observations also disclose the fact that the hitherto accepted 
period of its rotation proves to be too small by the hundredth of 
a second is a matter of far greater moment, of course, but one 
which leaves the average man comparatively cool.  That Mars, 
however, should be peopled by intelligent beings, although 
physically they be utterly unlike us, more goblins than men or 
animals, is a suggestion which appeals romantically, at least, to 
everybody. 
</p><p>To determine whether a planet be the abode of life, two 
questions about it must be answered in turn: first, are its 
physical conditions such as to render it habitable? and secondly, 
are there any signs of its actual habitation?  Unless we can answer 
the first point satisfactorily, it were futile to seek for evidence 
of the second. 
</p><p>Of such planets as doubtless circle round other suns we as yet 
know nothing.  Our search is perforce confined at present to the 
members of our own solar family.  Now, when we scan them for answer 
to our first query, we find but two that promise even the 
possibility of an affirmative reply, Mars and Venus.  All the 
others turn out, upon scrutiny, to lie beyond the pale, either 
because they are too big, or because they are too little; for, 
curiously enough, mere size settles the matter. 
</p><p>The giant Jupiter piques inquiry first by showing us great 
cloud-belts that recall our own equatorial and temperate cloud-zones.  But further study discloses that his clouds are in kind 
quite unlike those of our earth.  Neither the hour of his day nor 
the season of his year brings changes in them.  They slowly, very 
slowly, alter in appearance, indeed, but not in obedience to that 
central ruler that gathers and dispels our own.  In short, the 
Jovian clouds are not sun-raised, but self-raised ones.  It is heat 
inherent in Jupiter himself, not heat from the sun, that belts him 
about with his great girdles of cloud.  We can even see, in all 
probability, his glowing inner self; for Jupiter shows brick-red 
between his belts, like a molten mass. 
</p><p>The same state of things is yet more strikingly instanced by 
Saturn; for the tilt of Saturn's pole is not very unlike that of 
the earth, and in consequence his equatorial regions are at times 
raised far above the plane of his orbit; at others, dipped far 
below it.  Yet unlike the earth's cloud-belts, his never travel 
northward when the sun goes north, nor follow the sun when he 
journeys south again.  So far as the sun is concerned, the 
Saturnian cloud-belts are invariable.  Like the Jovian, they owe 
their formation to the planet's own heat.  Like Jupiter, too, 
Saturn shows red beneath.<ref target="n1.1">[1]</ref>  From all this it is pretty plain that 
the giant 
 
 
 
   <pb n="596"/>   
 
 
planets are far from pleasurable abodes, as yet midway in evolution 
between actual suns and tenantable worlds; too cooled down for the 
one state, and not yet cooled down enough for the other. 
</p><p>Uranus and Neptune give evidence, also of being in a chaotic 
condition, orbs <hi rend="italic">informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum</hi>,&mdash;no longer 
suns, but as yet quite unfit to support beings even distantly 
analogous to ourselves. 
</p><p>With Mercury littleness is even more fatal to life; for though 
the giant planets may perhaps, at some future day, grow to be life-supporting, a small one apparently never was, nor ever can be, 
peopled by beings in the least resembling us.  Incapacity to 
quarter folk is included in the more general incapacity to hold an 
atmosphere; for absence of atmosphere precludes the possibility of 
life as we know it.  That a planet may be too small to have an 
atmospheric envelope we shall see more definitely later.  That 
life, however, of a type of which we have no conception may not 
exist in all these orbs we must be wary of stating, for nothing is 
more dangerous than a general denial, except a particular 
statement. 
</p><p>We are limited, therefore, in our present inquiry, to Venus 
and Mars.  But Venus, contrary to her name, proves provokingly 
modest, the most modest of all the company of heaven, keeping 
herself so constantly veiled in cloud that we seldom, if ever, are 
permitted a peep at her actual surface.  In consequence, beyond the 
fact that she has an atmosphere of considerable though not 
excessive density, we know little about her. 
</p><p>With Mars, on the other hand, no such false modesty balks us 
at the outset.  The planet named after the old God of War&mdash;satirically, it would seem, since he turns out to present 
characteristics quite the reverse of warlike&mdash;lets himself be seen 
as well as thirty-five millions of miles of separation will allow. 
</p><p>Now, to all forms of life of which we have any conception, two 
things in nature are vital, air and water.  A planet must possess 
these two things to be able to support any life at all upon its 
surface.  Some articles that we might deem essential to well-being 
fall cosmically under the head of luxuries; but air and water are 
necessities of existence.  There is no creature which is not in 
some measure dependent upon both of them.  How then is Mars off for 
air? 
</p><p>Fortunately for an answer to this question, air is as vital to 
change in the inorganic processes of nature as it is to those other 
changes which we call peculiarly life.  Atmosphere is essential not 
only to life upon a planet, but to the production of any change 
whatever upon that planet's surface.  Without it, not only 
development, but decay would come to a standstill, when once all 
that was friable had crumbled to pieces under the alternate 
roasting and refrigerating to which the planet's surface would be 
exposed as it revolved upon its axis toward and away from the sun.  
Disintegration once effected, the planet would roll, a mummy world, 
through space.  Since atmosphere, therefore, is a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> 
to any change upon a planet's surface, reversely, any change upon 
a planet's surface is proof positive of the presence of an 
atmosphere, however incapable of detection such atmosphere be by 
direct means. 
</p><p>Now changes take place upon the surface of Mars, changes vast 
enough to be visible from the earth.  When properly observed they 
turn out to be most marked.  We will begin with the look of the 
planet last June.  Its general aspect then was tripartite.  Upon 
the top part of the disc, round what we know to be the planet's 
pole, appeared a great white cap, the south polar cap.  The south 
lay at the top, because all astronomical views are, for optical 
reasons, upside down; but inasmuch as we never see the features 
otherwise, to have them right side up is not vital to the effect.  
Below the white cap lay a region chiefly bluish-green, 
interspersed, however, with portions more or less reddish-ochre. 
 
   <pb n="597"/>   
 
Below this, again, came a vast reddish-ochre stretch, 
the great continental deserts of the planet. 
</p><p>The first sign of change occurred in the polar cap.  It 
proceeded slowly to dwindle in size.  Such obliteration it has, 
with praiseworthy regularity, undergone once every two years for 
the last two hundred.  Since the polar cap was first seen it has 
waxed and waned with clock-like precision, a precision timed to the 
change of season in the planet's year.  During the spring, these 
snow-fields, as analogy at once guesses them to be, and as beyond 
doubt they really are, stretch in the southern hemisphere, the one 
presented to us at this last opposition, down to latitude seventy, 
and even sixty-five south; covering thus more than the whole of the 
planet's south frigid zone.  As summer comes on they dwindle 
gradually away, till by early autumn they present but tiny patches, 
a few hundred miles across.  This year, for the first time in human 
experience, they melted, apparently, completely.  This 
unprecedented event happened on October 13, or forty-three days 
after the summer solstice of the southern hemisphere, a date 
corresponding to about the middle of July on earth.  Evidently it 
was a phenomenally hot season on Mars, for the minimum of the polar 
patch is reached usually about three months after Martian 
midsummer.  It will be noticed how nearly such melting parallels 
what takes place with our arctic ice-cap on earth. 
</p><p>But the disappearance of the polar snows is by no means the 
only change discernible upon the surface of the planet.  Several 
years ago Schiaparelli noticed differences in tint at successive 
oppositions, both in the dark areas and in the bright ones.  These, 
he suggested, might be due to the seasons.  This year it has been 
possible to watch the change take place.  From the Martian last of 
April to the Martian middle of August, the bluish-green areas have 
been steadily undergoing a most marked transformation.  There 
proves, in fact, to be a wave of seasonal change that sweeps over 
the face of the planet from pole to pole.  We will examine this 
more in detail when we take up the question of water.  For the 
present point it suffices that it takes place; for it constitutes 
proof positive of the presence of an atmosphere. 
</p><p>A moment's consideration will show how absolutely positive 
this proof is; for it is the inevitable deduction from the simplest 
of observed facts.  Its cogency consists in its simplicity.  It is 
independent of difficult detail or of doubtful interpretation.  It 
is not concerned with what may be the constitution of the polar 
caps, nor with the character of the transformation that sweeps, 
wavelike, over the rest of the planet.  It merely states that 
change occurs, and that statement is conclusive. 
</p><p>Having thus seen with the brain as much as with the eye, and 
in the simplest possible manner, that a Martian atmosphere exists, 
we will go on to consider what it is like. 
</p><p>The first and most conspicuous of its characteristics is its 
cloudlessness.  A cloud is an event on Mars, a rare and unusual 
phenomenon, which should make it more fittingly appreciated there 
than Ruskin lamented was the case on earth.  For it is almost 
perpetually fine weather on our neighbor in space.  From the day's 
beginning to its close, and from one end of a year to the other, 
nothing appears to veil the greater part of the planet's surface. 
</p><p>This is more completely the case than has hitherto been 
supposed.  We read sometimes in astronomical books and articles 
picturesque accounts of clouds and mist gathering over certain 
regions of the disc, hiding the coast lines and continents from 
view, and then, some hours later, clearing off again.  No instance 
of such blotting out of detail has been seen this year at 
Flagstaff.  Though the planet's face has been scanned there almost 
every night, from the last day of May to the end of November, not 
a case of obscuration of any part of the central portions of the  
 
   <pb n="598"/>   
 
planet, from any Martian cause, has been detected by any one 
of three observers.  Certain peculiar brightish patches have from 
time to time been noted, but, with a courtesy uncommon in clouds, 
they have carefully refrained from obscuring in the slightest 
degree any detail the observer might be engaged in looking at. 
</p><p>The only dimming of detail upon the Martian disc has been 
along its bright edge, what is technically called its limb.  
Fringing this is a permanent lune of light that swamps all except 
the very darkest markings in its glare.  This limb-light has 
commonly been taken as evidence of sunrise or sunset mists on Mars.  
But observations of mine during last June show that such cannot be 
the case.  In June Mars was gibbous,&mdash;that is, he showed a face 
like the moon between the quarter and the full,&mdash;and along his 
limb, then upon his own western side, lay the bright limb-light, 
stretching inward about thirty degrees.  Since the face turned 
toward us was only in part illumined by the sun, the centre of it 
did not stand at noon, but some hours later, and the middle of the 
limb consequently not at sunrise, but at about nine o'clock of a 
Martian morning.  As the limb-light extended in from this thirty 
degrees, or two hours in time, the mist, if mist it was, must have 
lasted till eleven o'clock in the day.  Furthermore, it must have 
been mist of a singularly mathematical turn of mind, for it made a 
perfect semi-ellipse from one pole to the other, quite oblivious of 
the fact that every hour from sunrise to sunset lay represented 
along its edge, including high noon.  What is more, as the disc 
passed, in course of time, from the gibbous form on the other side, 
the limb-light obligingly clung to the limb, regardless of 
everything except its geometric curve.  But as it did so, the 
eleven o'clock meridian swung from one side of the centre of the 
disc to the other.  As it crossed the centre its regions showed 
perfectly clear; not a trace of obscuration as it passed directly 
under the eye.  It was evident, therefore, that Martian morning 
mists were not responsible for the phenomenon. 
</p><p>To what, then, was the limb-light due?  At first sight, it 
would seem as if the moon might help us; for the moon's limb is 
similarly ringed by a lune of light.  In her case the effect has 
been attributed to mountain slopes catching the sun's light at 
angles beyond the possibilities of plains.  But Mars has few 
mountains worthy the name.  His terminator&mdash;that is, the part of 
the disc which is just passing in or out of sunlight, and discloses 
mountains by the way in which they catch the coming light before 
the plains at their feet are illuminated&mdash;shows irregularities 
quite inferior to the lunar ones, proving that his elevations and 
depressions are relatively insignificant. 
</p><p>On the whole, the best explanation of the phenomenon seems to 
be that the Martian atmosphere itself is somewhat of a veil, and 
that this veiling effect, though practically imperceptible in the 
centre of the disc, becomes noticeable as we go from the centre to 
the edge, owing to the greater thickness of the stratum through 
which we look.  At thirty degrees in from the limb the observer 
would look through twice as much of it as when he looked plumb down 
upon the centre of the disc; in consequence, what would be 
diaphanous at the centre might well seem opaque toward the edge.  
The effect we are familiar with on earth in the haze that always 
borders the horizon,&mdash;a haze most noticeable in places where there 
is much water in the air.  Here, then, we have a hint of what is 
the matter on Mars.  Were his atmosphere charged with water-vapor, 
just such an effect as is observed should take place. 
</p><p>This first hint receives independent support from another 
Martian phenomenon.  Contrary to what the distance of the planet 
from the sun and the thinness of its atmospheric envelope would 
lead us to expect, the climate of Mars proves  
 
   <pb n="599"/>   
 
astonishingly 
mild.  Whereas calculation from distance and atmospheric density 
puts its average temperature below freezing, thus relegating it to 
perpetual ice, the planet's surface features show that the 
temperature is relatively high.  Observation reveals the fact that 
the mean temperature must actually be above that of the earth; for 
not only is there practically no snow or ice outside the frigid 
zone at any time, but the polar snow-caps melt to a minimum quite 
beyond that of our own, affording the Martians rare chance for 
quixotic polar expeditions.  Such pleasing amelioration of the 
climate must be accounted for, and aqueous vapor seems the most 
likely thing for the purpose; for aqueous vapor is quite specific 
as a planetary comforter, being the very best of blankets.  It 
acts, indeed, like the glass of a conservatory, letting the light 
rays in, and opposing the passage of the heat rays out. 
</p><p>The state of things thus disclosed by observation, the 
cloudlessness and the rim of limb-light, turns out to agree in a 
most happy manner with what probability would lead us to expect; 
for the most natural supposition to make <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> about the 
Martian atmosphere is the following.  When each planet was produced 
by fission from the parent nebula, we may suppose that it took with 
it as its birthright its proportion of chemical constituents; that 
is, that its amount of oxygen, nitrogen, and so forth was 
proportional to its mass.  Doubtless its place in the primal nebula 
would to a certain extent modify the ratio, just as the size of the 
planet would to a certain extent modify the relative amount of 
these elements that would thereupon enter into combination.  
Supposing, however, that the ratio of free oxygen and so forth to 
the other elements remained substantially the same, we should have 
in the case of any two planets the same relative quantity of 
atmosphere.  But the size of the planet would entirely alter the 
distribution of this air. 
</p><p>Three causes would all combine to rob the smaller planet of 
efficient covering, on the general principle that he that hath 
little shall have less. 
</p><p>In the first place, the smaller the planet, the greater would 
be its volume in proportion to its mass, because the materials of 
which it was composed, being subjected to less pressure owing to a 
lesser pull, would not be crowded so closely together.  This is one 
reason why Mars should have a thinner atmosphere than is the case 
with our earth. 
</p><p>Secondly, of two similar bodies, spheres or others, the 
smaller has the greater surface for its volume, since the one 
quantity is of two dimensions only, the other of three.  An onion 
will give us a good instance of this.  By stripping off layer after 
layer we reach eventually a last layer which is all surface, 
inclosing nothing.  We may, if we please, observe something 
analogous in men, among whom the most superficial have the least in 
them.  In consequence of this principle, the atmosphere of the 
smaller body finds itself obliged to cover relatively more surface, 
which still further thins it out. 
</p><p>Lastly, gravity being less on the surface of the smaller body, 
the atmosphere is less compressed, and, being a gas, seizes that 
opportunity to spread out to a greater height, which renders it 
still less dense at the planet's surface. 
</p><p>Thus for three reasons Mars should have a thinner air at his 
surface than is found on the surface of the earth. 
</p><p>Calculating the effect of the above causes numerically, we 
find that on this a priori supposition Mars would have at his 
surface an atmosphere of about fourteen hundredths, or one seventh 
the density of our terrestrial one. 
</p><p>Observation supports this general supposition; for the 
cloudless character of the Martian skies is precisely what we 
should look for in a rare air.  Clouds are congeries of globules of 
water or particles of ice buoyed up by the air about them.  The 
smaller these are, the more easily are they buoyed up, because  
 
   <pb n="600"/>   
 
gravity, which tends to pull them down, acts upon their mass, 
while the resistance they oppose to it varies as their surface, and 
this, as we saw just now, is relatively greater in the smaller 
particles.  The result is that the smaller particles can float in 
thinner air.  We see the principle exemplified in our terrestrial 
clouds; the low nimbus being formed of comparatively large 
globules, while the high cirrus is made up of very minute 
particles.  If we go yet higher, we reach a region incapable of 
supporting clouds of any kind, so rarefied is its air.  This occurs 
about five miles above the earth's surface; and yet even at this 
height the density of our air is greater than is the probable 
density of the air at the surface of Mars.  We see, therefore, that 
the Martian atmosphere should from its rarity prove cloudless, just 
as we observe it to be. 
</p><p>So far in this our investigation of the Martian atmosphere we 
have been indebted solely to the principles of mathematics and 
molar physics for help, and these have told us something about the 
probable quantity of that atmosphere, though silent as to its 
possible quality.  On this latter point, however, molecular physics 
turns out to have something to say; for an Irish gentleman, Dr. G. 
Johnstone Stoney, has recently made an ingenious deduction from the 
kinetic theory of gases bearing upon the atmosphere envelope which 
any planet can retain.  His deduction is as acute as it appears 
from observation to be in keeping with the facts.  It is this:&mdash; 
</p><p>The molecular theory of gases supposes them to be made up of 
myriads of molecules in incessant motion.  What a molecule may be 
nobody knows; some scientists supposing it to be a vortex ring in 
miniature,&mdash;something like the swirl produced by a teaspoon when 
drawn through a cup of tea.  But whatever it be, the idea of it 
accounts for the facts.  The motion of the molecules is almost 
inconceivably swift as they dart hither and thither throughout the 
space occupied by the gas, and their speed differs for different 
gases.  It is calculated that the molecules of oxygen travel, on 
the average, at the rate of fifteen miles a minute, those of water 
vapor about twenty miles a minute, and those of hydrogen, which are 
the fastest known, at the enormous speed of a mile a second.  But 
this average velocity may, in any particular case, be increased by 
collisions of the molecules among themselves something like 
sevenfold.  What is more, each molecule of the gas is bound, sooner 
or later, to attain this maximum velocity of its kind merely on the 
doctrine of chances.  When it is attained, the molecule of oxygen 
travels at the rate of one and three fourths miles a second, the 
molecule of water vapor at the rate of two and one third miles a 
second, and the molecule of hydrogen actually at seven miles a 
second, six hundred times as fast as our fastest express train. 
</p><p>Now, if a body, whether it be a molecule or a cannon-ball, be 
projected away from the earth's surface, the earth will at once try 
to pull it down again: this instinctive holding on of Mother Earth 
to what she has we call gravity.  In the cases with which we are 
personally familiar, her endeavor is eminently successful; what 
goes up usually coming down again, either on the thrower or on some 
other person.  But even the earth is not omnipotent.  As the 
velocity with which the body is projected increases, it takes the 
earth longer and longer to overcome it and compel the body's 
return.  Finally there comes a speed which the earth is just able 
to overcome, if she take an infinite time about it.  In that case, 
the body would continue to travel away from her, at a constantly 
diminishing rate, but still at some rate, on and on into the depths 
of space, till it attained infinity, at which point the truant 
would stop, and reluctantly begin to return again.  This velocity 
we may call the critical velocity.  It is the velocity which the 
earth would cause in a body falling to it from an  
 
   <pb n="601"/>   
 
infinite 
distance, since gravity is able to destroy on the way up just the 
speed it is able to create on the way down.  But now, if the body's 
departure were even hastier than this, the earth would never be 
able wholly to annihilate its speed, and the body would travel 
forever away out and out, till it fell, probably, under the sway of 
some distant star.  In any case, the earth would know the vagabond 
no more. 
</p><p>As gravity depends upon mass, the larger the attracting 
planet, the greater is its critical velocity, the velocity it can 
just control; and, reversely, the smaller the planet, the less its 
restraining power.  With the earth the critical velocity is between 
six and seven miles a second.  If any of us, therefore, could 
manage to become faster than this, socially or otherwise, we could 
bid defiance to the whole earth, and begin to voyage on our own 
account through space. 
</p><p>This is actually what happens, as we have seen, to the 
molecules of hydrogen.  If, therefore, free hydrogen were present 
at the surface of the earth, and met with no other gas attractive 
enough to tie it down by uniting with it, the rover would, in 
course of time, attain a speed sufficient to allow it to bid good-by to earth, and start on interspacial travels of its own.  That it 
should reach its maximum speed is all that is essential to liberty, 
the direction of its motion being immaterial.  To each molecule in 
turn would come this happy dispatch, till the earth stood deprived 
of every atom of free hydrogen she possessed. 
</p><p>It is a highly significant fact that there is no free hydrogen 
found in the earth's atmosphere.  With oxygen and water vapor, and 
indeed all the other gases we know, the case is different; for 
their maximum speed falls far short of the possibility of escape.  
So they have stayed with us solely because they must.  And, as a 
matter of fact, the earth's atmosphere contains plenty of free 
oxygen, nitrogen, and the like.  The actions of the heavenly bodies 
confirm this conclusion.  The moon, for example, possesses no 
atmosphere, and calculation shows that the velocity it can control 
falls short of the maximum of any of these gases.  All were, 
therefore, at liberty to leave it, and all have promptly done so.  
Whatever the moon's attraction for lovers, no gas was sufficiently 
attracted by it to stay.  On the other hand, the giant planets give 
evidence of very dense atmospheres.  They have kept all they ever 
had. 
</p><p>But the most striking confirmation of the theory comes from 
the cusps of Venus and Mercury; for an atmosphere would prolong, by 
its refraction, the cusps of a crescent beyond their true limits.  
Length of cusp becomes, consequently, a criterion of the presence 
of an atmosphere.  Now, in the appearance of their cusps there is 
a notable difference between Venus and Mercury.  The cusps of Venus 
extend beyond the semi-circle; Mercury's do not.  We see, 
therefore, that Mercury has no appreciable atmospheric envelope. 
</p><p>Turning to the case of Mars, we find with him the critical 
velocity to be about three miles a second.  This is, like the 
earth's, below the maximum for the molecules of hydrogen, but also, 
like the earth's, above that of any other gas; from which we have 
reason to suppose that, except for possible chemical combinations, 
his atmosphere is in quality not unlike our own. 
</p><p>Having seen what the atmosphere of Mars is probably like, we 
may draw certain interesting inferences from it as to its 
capabilities for making life comfortable.  The first consequence is 
that Mars is blissfully destitute of weather.  Unlike New England, 
which has more than it can accommodate, Mars has none of the 
article.  What takes its place as the staple topic of conversation 
for empty-headed folk there remains one of the Martian mysteries 
yet to be solved.  What takes its place in fact is a perpetual 
serenity, such as we can scarcely conceive of.  Although 
 
   <pb n="602"/>   
 
over what we shall later see to be the great continental deserts 
the air must at midday be highly rarefied, and cause vacuums into 
which the surrounding air must rush, the actual difference of 
gradient owing to the initial thinness of the air must be very 
slight.  With a normal barometer of four and a half inches, a very 
great relative fall is a very slight actual one.  In consequence, 
storms would be such mild-mannered things that, for objectionable 
purposes, they might as well not be.  In the first place, if we are 
right, there can be no rain, nor hail, nor snow in them, for the 
particles would be deposited before they gained the dignity of such 
separate existence.  Dew or frost would be the maximum of 
precipitation that Mars could support.  The polar snow-cap or ice-cap, therefore, is doubtless formed, not by the falling of snow, 
but by successive depositions of dew.  Secondly, there would be 
about the Martian storms no very palpable wind.  Though the gale 
might blow at fairly respectable rates, so flimsy is the substance 
moved that it might buffet a man unmercifully without reproach. 
</p><p>Another interesting result of the rarity of the air would be 
its effect upon the boiling-point of water.  Reynault's experiments 
have shown that, in air at a density of 14/100 of our own, water 
would boil at about 127&deg; Fahrenheit.  This, then, would be the 
temperature at which water would be converted into steam on Mars.  
So low a boiling-point would make it impossible to cook anything in 
the open air.  Boiled eggs could be prepared only under cover, and 
such people as liked their meat boiled would probably find it 
convenient to prefer it done differently.  Fortunately, roasts 
would still remain possible.  The lowering of the boiling-point 
would raise the relative amount of aqueous vapor held in suspension 
by the air at any temperature.  At about 127&deg; the air would be 
saturated, and even at lower temperatures much more of it would 
evaporate and load the surrounding air than happens at similar 
temperatures on earth.  Thus at the heels of similarity treads 
contrast. 
</p><p>We may now go on to such phenomena bearing on the Martian 
atmosphere as show it to differ from ours.  Some of them we are 
able more or less imperfectly to explain; some we are not. 
</p><p>Although no case of obscuration has been seen at Flagstaff 
this summer, certain bright patches have been observed on special 
portions of the planet's disc.  That they are not storm-clouds, 
like those which, by a wavelike process of generation, travel 
across the American continent, for example, is shown by the fact 
that they do not travel, but are local fixtures.  Commonly, they 
appear day after day, and even year after year, in the same spots; 
for identical patches have been observed by different astronomers 
at successive oppositions.  To this category belong the regions 
known as Elysium, Ophir, Memnonia, Eridania, and Tempe.  Still 
smaller patches, apparently more fugitive in character, have been 
seen this year by Professor W. H. Pickering.  But the most marked 
instance of variability was detected in September last by Mr. 
Douglass, in the western part of Elysium.  On September 22 and 23 
he found this blissfully named region, as usual, equally bright 
throughout.  But on September 24 he noticed that the western half 
of it had suddenly increased in brightness, and far outshone the 
eastern half, being almost as brilliant as the polar cap.  When he 
looked at it again the next night, September 25, the effect of the 
night before had vanished, the western half being now actually the 
darker of the two.  So fugitive an effect suggests cloud, forming 
presumably over high ground, and subsequently dissipating; it also 
suggests a deposition of frost that melted on the next day.  It is 
specially noteworthy that the canals inclosing the region, Galaxias 
and Hyblaeus, were not in any way obscured by the bright 
apparition.  On the contrary, Mr. Douglass  
 
   <pb n="603"/>   
 
found them 
perceptibly darker than they had been, an effect attributable 
perhaps to contrast. 
</p><p>Although not storm-clouds, it is possible that these 
appearances may have been due to cloud capping high land.  There 
are objections, however, to this view, as, in the first place, 
there is evidence that the Martian mountains are low; in the second 
place that they would have to be phenomenally high to produce a 
change in temperature sufficient to condense the air about them and 
so cap them with cloud; and in the third place that the air is not 
dense enough to support clouds, anyway.  Nevertheless a most 
singular phenomenon was seen by Mr. Douglass on November 24, a 
bright detached projection, for which from measurement he deduced 
a height of thirty miles.  This would seem to have been cloud.  
With regard to its enormous height, it is not to be forgotten that 
a few years ago, on the earth, phenomenal dust-clouds were observed 
as high as one hundred miles. 
</p><p>Something more in the line of the explicable was a phenomenon 
observed in 1879 and in 1881 by Schiaparelli.  From October, 1879, 
to January, 1880, he noticed certain bright patches which appeared 
to surround the north pole in a sort of crown, the pole itself 
being invisible.  In 1881 he saw the same ramifications again, in 
apparently the same place.  At this latter opposition the north 
pole was much better placed for observation, and he was able to 
mark a curious subsequent action in these spots; for as time went 
on they gradually contracted toward the pole, till finally they 
consolidated into the north polar patch, which up to that time had 
been absent.  The polar patch proper did not thus appear till more 
than a month after the vernal equinox of the northern hemisphere. 
</p><p>Here, then, we have a very curious phenomenon, a phenomenon 
which seems to indicate that the seasonal wave of change acts as a 
unit across the planet's face; that instead of a more or less 
continuous deposit of moisture at the pole, such as occurs on 
earth, Martian atmospheric conditions oblige such deposit to creep 
gradually with the season up into polar latitudes, where it appears 
first as a crown of frost, and does not envelop the pole and become 
a polar cap till it has got higher.  No sooner has this happened 
than the advance of following warmer isotherms causes it to begin 
to melt.  One deduction from this thin air we must, however, be 
careful not to make: that because it is thin it is incapable of 
supporting intelligent life.  That beings constituted physically as 
we are would find it a most uncomfortable habitat is pretty 
certain.  But lungs are not wedded to logic, and there is nothing 
in the world or beyond it to prevent, so far as we know, a being 
with gills, for example, from being a most superior person.  A fish 
doubtless imagines life out of water to be impossible; and 
similarly, to argue that life of an order as high as our own, or 
higher, is impossible, because of less air to breathe than that to 
which we are locally accustomed, is, as Flammarion happily 
expresses it, to argue, not as a philosopher, but as a fish. 
</p><p>To sum up, now, what we know about the atmosphere of Mars: we 
have proof positive that Mars has an atmosphere; we have reason to 
believe that this atmosphere is very thin,&mdash;thinner at least by 
half than the air upon the summit of the Himalayas,&mdash;that in 
constitution it does not differ greatly from our own, and that it 
is relatively heavily charged with water vapor.

the planet.</p>

II.  THE WATER PROBLEM.</head> 
 
<p>AFTER air, water.  If Mars be capable of supporting life, 
there must be water upon his surface; for to all forms of life 
water is as vital a matter as air.  To all organisms water is 
absolutely essential.  On the question of habitability, therefore, 
it becomes all-important to know whether there be water on Mars. 
</p><p>Any one looking through a telescope at the planet, early last 
summer, would at once have been struck by the fact that its surface 
was diversified by markings in three colors,&mdash;white, blue-green, 
and reddish-ochre; the white lying in a great oval at the top of 
the disc.  The white oval was the south polar ice-cap.  In this 
polar cap our water problem takes its rise. 
</p><p>On the 31st of May, 1894, the south polar cap stretched, 
practically one unbroken waste of ice, over about fifty degrees of 
latitude; that is, it covered nearly the whole frigid zone.  
Although due, in all probability, to successive depositions of 
frost rather than snow, the result, both in appearance and in 
behavior, makes striking counterpart to the antarctic ice-sheet of 
our own earth.  Its visible contour was almost perfectly 
elliptical, showing it to be, in truth, nearly circular.  That it 
was already in active process of melting was evident from its 
slowly lessening size.  It was the most interesting feature on the 
disc, being peculiarly well placed for observation, owing to the 
tilt of the polar axis; for the Martian south pole was at the time 
bowed toward the earth at an angle of 24&deg;, a southern 
inclination which has not been equaled since 1877.  The dip of the 
pole displayed the snow-cap to great advantage, and enabled the 
metamorphosis it underwent to be specially well seen. 
</p><p>Through June and July the snows were melting very fast, at the 
rate of  
 
   <pb n="750"/>   
 
 hundreds of square miles a day.  Such waning of 
them under the summer sun has been regularly observed to take place 
for the past two hundred years.  At every Martian summer they 
shrink away to next to nothing, as systematically as the Martian 
summer comes on,&mdash;an action on their part highly indicative of 
their character.  But another bit of behavior in their immediate 
surroundings is yet more significant, and in the case of the 
southern hemisphere has never, apparently, been noticed before. 
</p><p>Practically at the first observation made at Flagstaff in 
June, there showed, bordering the edge of the snow, a narrow, dark 
blue band or ribbon of color encircling the cap.  The band varied 
in width at different places, being widest where the blue-green 
areas to the north of it were widest, and narrowest where they were 
narrowest.  Its greatest breadth was about two hundred and twenty 
miles, its least about one hundred.  In two places it expanded into 
great bays, the more prominent of them being just above the largest 
blue-green area on the disc.  That the width of this antarctic 
girdle was proportionate to the width of the blue-green areas below 
it is a highly suggestive fact.  Both bays were blue, the larger 
and more striking one especially so, appearing in good seeing of a 
beautiful cobalt blue, like some Martian grotto of Capri. 
</p><p>Both the band and its bays were contrasted with the blue-green 
areas contiguous to them, somewhat in tint, but yet more in tone.  
They were bluer, and distinctly darker.  This hinted at a 
difference of constitution, which hint was emphasized by the action 
of the band; for as the snow shrank back toward the pole the blue 
belt followed it, keeping pace with its retreat.  Instead of 
remaining in the place where it had first appeared, as it must have 
done had it been a permanent marking upon the surface of the 
planet, it withdrew steadily southward, so as always to border the 
melting snow. 
</p><p>At about the same time a rift made its appearance in the midst 
of the ice-cap.  On June 9, when on the meridian early in the 
morning it looked like a huge cart-track coming down toward one 
through the snow.  It proved to be three hundred and fifty miles 
wide, and debouched into the dark encircling band.  A second 
narrower rift ran into it near the centre of the cap. 
</p><p>On the same morning, about half past five o'clock, starlike 
points suddenly shone out upon the snow, between the great bay and 
the first rift.  After shining there for a few minutes they as 
suddenly vanished.  It is evident what these were,&mdash;not fabled 
flash-lights of the Martians, but the glint of snow-slopes tilted 
at just the angle to reflect the sun toward the earth.  On 
subsequent mornings others appeared, not so brilliant, the position 
of the planet with regard to the earth having slightly shifted in 
the mean time.  There is something romantic in the thought of these 
far-off glistens from other-world antarctic snows, and in the sight 
there is corroboration of the snow's character. 
</p><p>As the Martian spring progressed, the rifts spread, until at 
last they cut the ice-cap in two.  The smaller portion then 
proceeded to disappear, while the larger shrank correspondingly in 
size.  The relative times of disappearance of different parts of 
the cap give us some information about the relative elevations and 
depressions of the south circumpolar regions.  In consequence, I 
have been able to construct a contour map of these polar portions 
of the planet.  There are advantages in thus conducting polar 
expeditions astronomically.  One not only lives like a civilized 
being through it all, but he brings back something of the knowledge 
he went out to acquire. 
</p><p>There has even been vouchsafed the realization of that dream 
of explorers, an open polar sea; for as the first rift widened, 
Professor W. H. Pickering marked a large lake develop in the midst 
 
 
   <pb n="751"/>   
 
 of it, in position almost over the pole.  It seems cynical 
of fate thus to permit a Martian open polar sea to be seen before 
granting our earthly explorers a similar sight. 
</p><p>As the snows dwindled in size, the blue band about them shrank 
to correspond.  By August it was a barely discernible thread drawn 
round the tiny white patch which was all that remained of the 
enormous snow-fields of some months before.  Finally, on October 
13, the snow entirely disappeared, and the spot where it and its 
girdle, long since grown too small for detection, had been became 
one yellow stretch. 
</p><p>That the blue was water at the edge of the melting snow seems 
unquestionable.  That it was of the color of water, that it so 
persistently bordered the melting snow, and that it subsequently 
vanished are three facts mutually confirmatory of this deduction.  
Professor W. H. Pickering made the polariscope tell the same tale; 
for, on scrutinizing the great bay through it, he found the light 
coming from the bay to be polarized.  Now, to polarize the light it 
reflects is a property, as we know, of a water surface. 
</p><p>From all this we may conclude that we have here a polar sea, 
a real body of water.  There is, therefore, water on the surface of 
Mars.  We also mark that this body of water is ephemeral.  It 
exists while the snow-cap is melting, and then it somehow vanishes.  
What becomes of it, and whether there be other bodies of water on 
the planet, either permanent or temporary, we shall now go on to 
inquire. 
</p><p>While it existed in any size, the polar sea was bordered on 
the north, all the way round and during all the time it was 
visible, by blue-green areas.  These blue-green areas were strewn 
with several more or less bright regions, while below them came the 
great reddish-ochre stretches of the disc.  Now, the blue-green 
areas have generally been considered to be seas, just as the 
reddish-ochre regions have been held to be land.  That the latter 
are land there is very little doubt; not only land, but nothing but 
land,&mdash;land very pure and simple; that is, deserts.  For they 
behave just as deserts should behave, chiefly by not behaving at 
all; remaining, except for certain phenomena to be specified later, 
unchangeable. 
</p><p>With the so-called seas, however, the case is different.  
Several important facts conspire to throw grave doubt, and worse, 
upon their aquatic character.  To begin with, they are of every 
grade of tint,&mdash;a very curious feature for seas to exhibit, unless 
they were everywhere but a few feet deep; which again is a most 
singular characteristic for seas that cover hundreds of thousands 
of square miles in extent,&mdash;seas, that is, as big as the Bay of 
Bengal.  The Martian surface would have to be amazingly flat for 
this to be possible.  We know it to be relatively flat, but to be 
as flat as all this would seem to pass the bounds of credible 
simplicity.  Here also Professor W. H. Pickering's polariscope 
investigations come in with effect, for he found the light from the 
supposed seas to show no trace of polarization.  Hence these were 
probably not water. 
</p><p>In parenthesis we may here take notice of the absence of a 
certain phenomenon whose presence, apparently, should follow upon 
water surfaces such as the so-called seas would offer us.  Although 
its absence is not perhaps definitive as to their marine character, 
it is certainly curious, and worth nothing.  If a planet were 
covered by a sheet of water, that water surface would, mirror-like, 
reflect the sun in one more or less definite spot.  Looked at from 
a distance, this spot would, were it bright enough, be seen as a 
high light on the dark background of the ocean about it.  It would 
seem to be a fixed star at a certain point on the disc, the surface 
features rotating under it.  The necessary position is easily 
calculated, and this shows that parts of the so- 
   <pb n="752"/>   
 
called seas, 
especially at oppositions like the last one, pass under the point.  
There remains merely the question of sufficient brilliancy in the 
spot for visibility; but as in the case of Mars its brilliancy 
should be equal to that of a star of the third magnitude, it would 
seem brilliant enough to be seen.  No such starlike effect in such 
position has ever been noticed coming from the blue-green regions.  
From this bit of negative evidence, to be taken for what it is 
worth, we return again to what there is of a positive sort. 
</p><p>Not only do different parts of the so-called seas contrast in 
tint with one another, but the same part of the same sea varies in 
tint at different times.  Schiaparelli noticed that, at successive 
oppositions, the same sea showed different degrees of darkness, and 
he suggested that the change in tone was dependent in some way upon 
the Martian seasons. 
</p><p>Observations at Flagstaff have demonstrated this to be the 
case, for it has been possible to see the tints occur 
consecutively.  In consequence, we know not only that changes take 
place on the surface of Mars other than in the polar cap, and very 
conspicuous ones too, but that these are due to the changing 
seasons of the planet's year.  We will now see what they look like. 
</p><p>To the transubstantiation of changes of the sort it is a prime 
essential that the drawings from whose comparison the contrast 
appears should all have been made by the same person, at the same 
telescope, under as nearly as possible the same atmospheric 
conditions, since otherwise the personal equation of the observer, 
the impersonal inequalities of instruments, and the special 
atmosphere of the station play so large a part in the result as to 
mask that other factor in the case, any change in the planet 
itself.  How easily this masking is accomplished appears from 
drawings made by different observers of the same Martian features 
at substantially the same moment.  Several interesting specimens of 
such personal peculiarities may be seen by the curious in 
Flammarion's admirable thesaurus, La Planete Mars.  In some of 
these likenesses of the planet it is pretty certain that Mars would 
never recognize himself. 
</p><p>To have drawings simply swear at one another across a page is, 
in the interests of deduction, objectionable.  For their testimony 
to be worth having they must agree to differ.  If, therefore, Mars 
is to be many, his draughtsman must be one.  So much, at least, is 
fulfilled by the drawings in which the changes now to be described 
are recorded; for they were all made by me, at the same instrument, 
under the same general atmospheric conditions.  As the same 
personality enters all of them, it stands, as between them, 
eliminated from all, to increased certainty of deduction.  Since, 
furthermore, the drawings were all made in the months preceding and 
following one opposition, change due to secular variation is 
reduced to a minimum.  As a matter of fact, the changes are such as 
to betray their own seasonal character.  They constitute a 
kinematical as opposed to a statical study of the planet's surface. 
</p><p>The changes are much more evident than might be supposed.  
Indeed, they are quite unmistakable.  As for their importance, it 
need only be said that that deduction from them furnishes, in the 
first place, strong inference that Mars is a living world, subject 
to an annual cycle of surface growth, activity, and decay; and 
shows, in the second place, that this Martian yearly round of life 
must differ in certain interesting particulars from that which 
forms our terrestrial experience.  The phenomena evidently make 
part of a definite chain of changes of annual development.  So 
consecutive, and, in their broad characteristics, apparently so 
regular are these changes that I have been able to find 
corroboration of what appears to be their general scheme in 
drawings made at previous oppositions.  In consequence, I  
 
   <pb n="753"/>   
 
 
believe it will be possible in future to foretell, with something 
approaching the certainty of our esteemed weather bureau's 
prognostications, not indeed what the weather will be on Mars,&mdash;for, as we have seen, it is more than doubtful whether Mars has 
what we call weather to prognosticate,&mdash;but the aspect of any part 
of the planet at any given time. 
</p><p>The changes in appearance now to be chronicled refer, not to 
the melting of the polar snows, except as such melting forms the 
necessary preliminary to what follows, but to the subsequent 
changes in look of the surface itself.  To their exposition, 
however, the polar phenomena become inseparable adjuncts, since 
they are inevitable ancillaries to the result. 
</p><p>With the familiar melting of the snow-cap begins the yearly 
round of the planet's life.  With the melting of our own arctic or 
antarctic cap might similarly be said to begin the earth's annual 
activity.  But here at the very outset there appears to be one 
important difference between the two planets.  On the earth the 
relation of the melting of the polar snows to the awakening of 
surface activity is a case of <hi rend="italic">post hoc</hi> simply; on Mars it seems 
to be a case of <hi rend="italic">propter hoc</hi> as well.  For, unlike the earth, 
which has water to spare, and to which, therefore, the unlocking of 
its polar snows is a matter of no direct economic value, Mars is 
apparently in straits for the article, and has to draw on its polar 
reservoir for its annual supply.  Upon the melting of its polar 
cap, and the transference of the water thus annually set free to go 
its rounds, seem to depend all the seasonal phenomena on the 
surface of the planet. 
</p><p>The observations upon which this deduction is based extend 
over a period of nearly six months, from the last day of May to the 
22d of November.  They cover the regions from the south pole to 
about latitude forty north.  That changes analogous to those 
recorded, differing, however, in details, occur six Martian months 
later in the planet's northern hemisphere is proved by what 
Schiaparelli has seen; for though the general system is, curiously, 
one for the whole planet, the particular character of different 
parts of the surface alters the action there to some extent. 
</p><p>For an appreciation of the meaning of the changes, it is to be 
borne in mind throughout that the vernal equinox of Mars' southern 
hemisphere occurred on April 17, 1894; the summer solstice of the 
same hemisphere on August 31; and its autumnal equinox on February 
7, 1895. 
</p><p>On the 31st of May, therefore, it was toward the end of April 
on Mars.  The south polar cap was, as we have seen, very large, and 
the polar sea in proportion.  That the polar sea was the darkest 
and the bluest marking on the disc implies that it was, at all 
events, the deepest body of water on the planet, whether the other 
so-called seas were seas or not.  This polar sea plays <hi rend="italic">deus ex 
machina</hi> to all that follows. 
</p><p>So soon as the melting of the snow was well under way, long 
straits, of deeper tint than their surroundings, made their 
appearance in the midst of the dark areas.  I did not see them 
come, but as I afterward saw them go, it is evident that they must 
have come.  They were already there on the last day of May.  The 
most conspicuous of them lay between Noachis and Hellas, in the 
Mare Australe.  It began in the great polar bay, and thence 
traversed the Mare Erythraeum to the Hour-Glass Sea (Syrtis Major).  
The next most conspicuous one started in the other bay, and came 
down between Hellas and Ausonia.  Although these straits were 
distinguishably darker than the seas through which they passed, the 
seas themselves were then at their darkest.  The fact that these 
straits traversed the seas suffices to raise a second doubt as to 
the genuineness of seas; the first suspicion as to their true 
character  
 
   <pb n="754"/>   
 
 coming from their being a little off color,&mdash;not 
so blue, that is, as what we practically know to be water, the 
polar sea, although even that must be anything but deep.  It will 
appear later that in all probability the straits too are impostors, 
and that we see is in neither case water. 
</p><p>The appearance of things at this initial stage of the Martian 
Nile-like inundation last June was most destructive to modern maps 
of Mars, for all the markings between the south polar cap and the 
continental coast-line seemed with one consent to have as nearly as 
might be obliterated themselves. 
</p><p>It was impossible to fix any definite boundaries to the south 
temperate chain of islands, so indistinguishably did the light 
areas and the dark ones merge into each other.  What was still more 
striking, the curious peninsulas which connect the continent with 
the chain of islands to the south of it, and form so singular a 
feature of the planet's geography, were invisible.  One continuous 
belt of blue-green stretched from the Syrtis Major to the Columns 
of Hercules. 
</p><p>For some time the dark areas continued largely unchanged in 
appearance; during, that is, the earlier and most extensive melting 
of the snow-cap.  After this their history became one long 
chronicle of fading out.  Their lighter parts grew lighter, and 
their darker ones less dark.  For, to start with, they were made up 
of many tints; various shades of blue-green interspersed with hints 
of orange-yellow.  The gulfs and bays bordering the continental 
coast were the darkest of these markings; the long straits between 
the polar sea and the Syrtis Major were the next deepest in tone. 
</p><p>The first marked sign of change was the reappearance of 
Hesperia.  Whereas in June it had been practically non-existent, by 
August it had become perfectly visible and in the place where it is 
usually depicted.  In connection with its reappearance two points 
are to be noted: first, the amount of the change, for Hesperia is 
a stretch of land over two hundred miles broad by six hundred miles 
long; and, secondly, the fact that its previous invisibility was 
not due to any sort of obscuration.  The persistent clear-cut 
character of the neighboring coast-line during the whole 
transformation showed that nothing in the way of mist or cloud had 
at any time hidden the peninsula from view.  A something was 
actually there in August which had not been there in June. 
</p><p>As yet nothing could be seen of Atlantis.  It was not until 
the 30th of October that I caught sight of it.  About the same 
time, the straits between the islands, Xanthus, Scamander, 
Ascanius, and Simois, came out saliently dark, a darkness due to 
contrast.  The line of south temperate islands and their separate 
identity were then for the first time apparent. 
</p><p>Meanwhile, the history of Hesperia continued to be 
instructive.  From having been absent in June and conspicuous in 
August, it returned in October to a mid-position of visibility.  
Vacillating as these fluctuations in appearance may seem at first 
sight, they were really quite consistent; for they were due to one 
progressive change in the same direction, a change that was 
manifested first in Hesperia itself, and then in the regions round 
about it.  From June to August, Hesperia changed from a previous 
blue-green, indistinguishable from its surroundings, to yellow, the 
parts adjacent remaining much as before.  As a consequence, the 
peninsula stood out in marked contrast to the still deep blue-green 
regions by its side.  Later, the surroundings themselves faded, and 
their change had the effect of once more partially obliterating 
Hesperia. 
</p><p>While Hesperia was thus causing itself to be noticed, the rest 
of the south temperate zone, as we may call it for identification's 
sake, was unobtrusively  
 
   <pb n="755"/>   
 
 pursuing the same course.  Whereas 
in June all that part of the disc comprising the two Thyle, Argyre 
II., and like latitudes was chiefly blue-green, by October it had 
become chiefly yellow.  Still further south, what had been first 
snow, and then water, turned to ochre land. 
</p><p>Certain smaller details of the change that came over the face 
of the dark regions at the time were as curious as they were 
marked.  For example, the Fastigium Aryn, the tip of the triangular 
cape which, by jutting out from the continent, forms the forked bay 
called the Sabaeus Sinus, and which, because of its easy 
identification, has been selected for the zero meridian of Martian 
longitudes, began in October to undergo strange metamorphosis.  On 
October 15 it shot out a sort of tail southward.  On the 16th this 
tail could be followed all the way to Deucalionis Regio, to which 
it made a bridge across from the continent, thus cutting the 
Sabaeus Sinus completely in two. 
</p><p>Another curious causeway of the same sort made its appearance 
in November, connecting the promontory known as Hammonis Cornu with 
Hellas.  Both of these necks of orange-ochre were of more or less 
uniform breadth throughout. 
</p><p>The long, dark streaks that in June had joined the Syrtis 
Major to the polar sea had nearly disappeared by October; in their 
southern parts they had vanished completely, and they had very much 
faded in their northern ones.  The same process of fading uncovered 
certain curious rhomboidal bright areas in the midst of the Syrtis 
Major. 
</p><p>It will be seen that the extent of these changes was enormous.  
Their size, indeed, was only second in importance to their 
character; for it will also have been noticed that the changes were 
all in one direction.  A wholesale transformation of the blue-green 
regions into orange-ochre ones was in progress upon that other 
world. 
</p><p>What can explain so general and so consecutive a change in 
hue?  Water suggests itself; for a vast transference of water from 
the pole to the equator might account for it.  But there are facts 
connected with the change which seem irreconcilable with the idea 
of water.  In the first place, Professor W. H. Pickering found that 
the light from the great blue-green areas showed no trace of 
polarization.  This tended to strengthen a theory put forth by him 
some years ago, that the greater part of the blue-green areas are 
not water, but something which at such a distance would also look 
blue-green, namely, vegetation.  Observations at Flagstaff not only 
confirm this, but limit the water areas still further; in fact, 
practically do away with them entirely.  Not only do the above 
polariscopic tests tend to this conclusion, but so does the 
following observation of mine in October. 
</p><p>Toward the end of October, a strange, and, for observational 
purposes, a distressing phenomenon took place.  What remained of 
the more southern dark regions showed a desire to vanish, so 
completely did those regions proceed to fade in tint throughout.  
This was first noticeable in the Cimmerian Sea, then in the Sea of 
the Sirens, and in November in the Mare Erythraeum about the Lake 
of the Sun.  The fading steadily progressed until it had advanced 
so far that in poor seeing the markings were almost imperceptible, 
and the planet presented a nearly uniform ochre disc. 
</p><p>This was not a case of obscuration; for in the first place it 
was general, and in the second place the coast-lines were not 
obliterated.  The change, therefore, was not due to clouds or mist. 
</p><p>What was suggestive about the occurrence was that it was 
unaccompanied by a corresponding increase of blue-green elsewhere.  
It was not simply that portions of the planet's surface changed 
tint, but that, taking the disc in its entirety, the whole amount 
of the blue-green upon it had diminished, and that  
 
   <pb n="756"/>   
 
 of the 
orange-yellow had proportionally increased.  Mars looked more 
Martian than he had in June.  The canals, indeed, began at the same 
time to darken; but, highly important as this was for other 
reasons, the whole area of their fine lines and associated patches 
did not begin to make up for what the dark regions lost. 
</p><p>If the blue-green color was due to water, where had all the 
water gone?  Nowhere on the visible parts of the planet; that is 
certain.  Nor could it very well have gone to those north 
circumpolar regions hid from view by the tilt of the disc; for 
there was no sign of a growing north polar cap, and, furthermore, 
Schiaparelli's observations upon that cap show that there should 
not have been.  As we saw in the last paper, he found that it 
developed late, apparently one month or so after the vernal equinox 
of its hemisphere, whereas at the time the above change occurred it 
was not long after that hemisphere's winter solstice. 
</p><p>But if, instead of being due to water, the blue-green tint had 
been due to leaves and grasses, just such a fading out as was 
observed should have taken place as autumn came on, and that 
without proportionate increase of green elsewhere; for the great 
continental areas, being desert, are incapable of supporting 
vegetation, and therefore of turning green. 
</p><p>There is thus reason to believe that the blue-green regions of 
Mars are not water, but, generally at least, areas of vegetation; 
from which it follows that Mars is very badly off for water, and 
that the planet is dependent on the melting of its polar snows for 
practically its whole supply. 
</p><p>Such scarcity of water on Mars is just what theory would lead 
us to expect.  Mars is a smaller planet than the earth, and 
therefore is relatively more advanced in his evolutionary career.  
He is older in age, if not in years; for whether his birth as a 
separate world antedated ours or not, his smaller size, by causing 
him to cool more quickly, would necessarily age him faster.  But as 
a planet grows old, its oceans, in all probability, dry up, the 
water retreating through cracks and caverns into its interior.  
Water thus disappears from its surface, to say nothing of what is 
being continually imprisoned by chemical combination.  Signs of 
having thus parted with its oceans we see in the case of the moon, 
whose so-called seas were probably seas in their day, but have now 
become old sea-bottoms.  On Mars the same process is going on, but 
would seem not yet to have progressed so far, the seas there being 
midway in their career from real seas to arid depressed deserts; no 
longer water surfaces, they are still the lowest portions of the 
planet, and therefore stand to receive what scant water may yet 
travel over the surface.  They thus become fertilized, while higher 
regions escape the freshet, and remain permanently barren.  That 
they were once seas we have something more than general inference 
to warrant us in believing. 
</p><p>There is a certain peculiarity about the surface markings of 
Mars, which is pretty sure to strike any thoughtful observer who 
examines the planet with a two or a three inch object-glass,&mdash;their 
singular sameness night after night.  With quite disheartening 
regularity, each evening presents him with the same appearance he 
noted the evening before,&mdash;a dark band obliquely belting the disc, 
strangely keeping its place in spite of the nightly progression of 
the meridians ten degrees to the east, in consequence of our faster 
rotation gaining on the slower rotation of Mars.  By attention, he 
will notice, however, that the belt creeps slowly upwards towards 
the pole in all other respects.  Then suddenly some night he finds 
that it has slipped bodily down, to begin again its Sisyphus-like, 
inconclusive spiral climb. 
</p><p>Often as this rhomb-line must have been noticed, no 
explanation of it has  
 
   <pb n="757"/>   
 
 ever, to my knowledge, been given.  
Yet so singular an arrangement points to something other than 
chance.  Suspicion of its non-fortuitous character is strengthened 
when it is scanned through a bigger glass.  Increase of aperture 
discloses details that help explain its significance.  With 
sufficient telescopic power, the continuity of the dark belt is 
seen to be broken by a series of parallel peninsulas or semi-peninsulas that jut out from the lower edge of the belt, all 
running with one accord in a southeasterly direction, and dividing 
the belt into a similar series of parallel dark areas.  Such oblong 
areas are the Mare Tyrrhenum, the Mare Cimmerium, the Mare Sirenum, 
and those unnamed straits that stretch southeasterly from the 
Aurorae Sinus, and Margaritifer Sinus, and the Sabaeus Sinus.  The 
islands and peninsulas trending in the same direction are Ausonia, 
Hesperia, Cimmeria, Atlantis, Pyrrhae Regio, Deucalionis Regio, and 
the two causeways from the Fastigium Aryn and Hammonis Cornu.  It 
will further be noticed that these areas lie more nearly north and 
south as they lie nearer the pole, and curve in general to the west 
as they approach the equator. 
</p><p>With this fact noted, let us return to the water formed by the 
melting of the ice-cap, at the time it is produced around the south 
pole.  We may be sure it would not stay there long.  No sooner 
liberated from its winter fetters than it would begin, under the 
pull of gravity, to run toward the equator.  The reason why it 
would flow away from the pole is that it would find itself in 
unstable equilibrium where it was.  Successive depositions of frost 
would have piled up a mound of ice which, so long as it remained 
solid, cohesion would keep in that unnatural position, but the 
moment it changed to a liquid this would flow out on all sides, 
seeking its level.  Once started, its own withdrawal would cause 
the centre of gravity to shift away from the pole, and this would 
pull the particles of the water yet more toward the equator.  Each 
particle would start due north; but its course would not continue 
in that direction, for at each mile it traveled it would find 
itself in a lower latitude, where, owing to the rotation of the 
planet, the surface would be whirling faster toward the east, 
inasmuch as a point on the equator has to get over much more space 
in twenty-four hours than one nearer the pole.  In short, supposing 
there was no friction, the surface would be constantly slipping 
away from under the particle toward the east.  As a result, the 
northerly motion of the particle would be continually changing with 
regard to the surface into a more and more westerly one.  If the 
surface were not frictionless, friction would somewhat reduce the 
westerly component, but could never wholly destroy it without 
stopping this particle. 
</p><p>We see, therefore, that any body, whether solid, liquid, or 
gaseous, must, in traveling away from the pole of a sphere or 
spheroid, necessarily deviate to the west as it goes on, if the 
spheroid itself revolve, as Mars does, in the opposite direction. 
</p><p>This inevitable trend induced in anything flowing from the 
pole to the equator is precisely the one that we notice stereotyped 
so conspicuously in the Martian south temperate markings.  Here, 
then, we have at once a suspiciously suggestive hint that they once 
held water, and that that water flowed. 
</p><p>Corroborating this deduction is the fact that the northern 
sides of all the dark areas are very perceptibly darker than the 
southern ones; for the northern side is the one which a descending 
current would plough out, since it is the northern coasts that 
would be constantly opposing the current's northerly inertia.  
Consequently, although at present the descending stream be quite 
inadequate to such task, it still finds its way, from preference, 
to these lowest levels, and makes them greener than the rest. 
 
   <pb n="758"/>   
 
</p><p>Though seas no longer, we perceive, then, that there is some 
reason to believe the so-called seas of Mars to have been seas in 
their day, and to be at the moment midway in evolution from the 
seas of the earth to the seas of the moon. 
</p><p>Now, if a planet were at any stage of its career able to 
support life, it is probable that a diminishing water supply would 
be the beginning of the end of that life, for the air would outlast 
the available water.  Those of its inhabitants who had succeeded in 
surviving would find themselves at last face to face with the 
relentlessness of fate,&mdash;a scarcity of water constantly growing 
greater, till at last they would all die of thirst, either directly 
or indirectly; for either they themselves would not have water 
enough to drink, or the plants or animals which constituted their 
diet would perish for lack of it,&mdash;an alternative of small choice 
to them, unless they were conventionally particular as to their 
mode of death.  Before this lamentable conclusion was reached, 
however, there would come a time in the course of the planet's 
history when water was not yet wanting, but simply scarce and 
requiring to be husbanded; when, for the inhabitants, the one 
supreme problem of existence would be the water problem,&mdash;how to 
get water enough to sustain life, and how best to utilize every 
drop of water they could get. 
</p><p>Mars is, apparently, in this distressing plight at the present 
moment, the signs being that its water supply is now exceedingly 
low.  If, therefore, the planet possess inhabitants, there is but 
one course open to them in order to support life.  Irrigation, and 
upon as vast a scale as possible, must be the all-engrossing 
Martian pursuit.  So much is directly deducible from what we have 
learned recently about the physical condition of the planet, quite 
apart from any question as to possible inhabitants.  What the 
physical phenomena assert is this: if there be inhabitants, then 
irrigation must be the chief material concern of their lives. 
</p><p>At this point in our inquiry, when direct deduction from the 
general physical phenomena observable on the planet's surface shows 
that were there inhabitants there a system of irrigation would be 
an all-essential of their existence, the telescope presents us with 
perhaps the most startling discovery of modern times,&mdash;the so-called canals of Mars.  These strange phenomena, together with the 
inferences to be drawn from them, will form the subject of the next 
paper.</p>

III.  CANALS.</head> 
 
<p>IN the last paper we saw how badly off for water Mars, to all 
appearance, is; so badly off that any inhabitants of that other 
world would have to irrigate to live.  As to the actual presence 
there of such folk, the broad physical characteristics of the 
planet have nothing to say beyond a general expression of 
acquiescence, but they do have something very vital to say about 
the conditions under which alone their life could be led.  They 
show that in these Martian minds there would be one question 
paramount to all the local labor, women's suffrage, and Eastern 
questions put together,&mdash;the water question.  How to procure water 
enough to support life would be the great communal problem of the 
day.  
 
   <pb n="107"/>   
 
</p><p>If Mars were the earth, we might well despair of detecting 
signs of any Martians for some time yet.  Across the gulf of space 
that separates us from Mars, an area thirty miles wide would just 
be perceptible as a dot.  It would, in such case, be hopeless to 
look for evidence of folk.  Anything like London or New York, or 
even Chicago in anticipation, would be too small to be seen.  So 
sorry a figure does man cut upon the earth he thinks to own.  From 
the standpoint of forty millions of miles' distance, probably the 
only sign of his presence here would be such semi-artificialities 
as the great grain-fields of the West when their geometric patches 
turned with the changing seasons from ochre to green, and then from 
green to gold.  By his crops we should know him,&mdash;a telltale fact 
of importance because probably the more so on Mars. 
</p><p>For Mars is not the earth.  Conditions hold there which would 
necessitate a different state of things, inorganic and organic, 
apparently a much more artificial one.  If cultivation there be, it 
must be cultivation upon a much more systematic scale, due in large 
part to a system of irrigation; just as any Martians must be quite 
different physically from men. 
</p><p>Now, at this point in our investigation, when the broad 
features of Mars disclose conditions which imply irrigation as 
their organic corollary, we are suddenly confronted on the planet's 
face with phenomena so startlingly suggestive of this very thing as 
to seem the uncanny realization of the deduction.  Indeed, so 
amazingly lifelike is their appearance that, had we possessed our 
present knowledge of the planet's physical condition before, we 
might almost have predicted what we see as criterion of the 
presence of living beings.  What confronts us is this:&mdash; 
</p><p>When the great continental areas, the reddish-ochre portions 
of the disc, are attentively examined in sufficiently steady air, 
their desert-like ground is seen to be traversed by a network of 
fine, straight dark lines.  The lines start from points on the 
coast of the blue-green regions, commonly well-marked bays, and 
proceed direct to other equally well-marked points in the middle of 
the continent.  At these latter termini the lines meet, very 
surprisingly, other lines that have come there from different 
starting-points in a similarly definite manner.  And this state of 
things exists all over the reddish-ochre regions. 
</p><p>All the lines, with the exception of a few that are curved in 
a regular manner, are absolutely straight from one end to the 
other.  They are arcs of great circles, taking the shortest 
distance between their termini.  The lines are as fine as they are 
straight.  As a rule, they are of scarcely any perceptible breadth, 
seeming on the average to be less than a Martian degree, or between 
twenty and thirty miles, wide.  Some are broader; some even finer, 
possibly not above fifteen miles across.  Their length, not their 
breadth, renders them visible; for though at such a distance we 
could not distinguish a dot less than about thirty miles in 
diameter, we could see a line of much less breadth, because of its 
length.  Speaking generally, however, the lines are all of 
comparable width. 
</p><p>Still greater uniformity is observable in the different parts 
of the same line; for each line maintains its individual width 
throughout.  Although at and near the point where it leaves the 
dark regions, or the Solis Lacus,&mdash;for the same phenomenon appears 
there,&mdash;some slight enlargement seems to take place, after it has 
fairly started on its course it remains substantially of the same 
size from one end to the other.  As to whether the lines are even 
on their edges or not, I should not like to say, but the better 
they are seen, the more even they look.  It is not possible to 
affirm positively on the point, as they are practically nearer one 
dimension than two. 
</p><p>On the other hand, their length is usually great, and in some 
cases enormous. 
 
   <pb n="108"/>   
 
A thousand or fifteen hundred miles may be 
considered about the average.  The Ganges, for example, which is 
not a long one as Martian canals go, is about 1450 miles in length.  
The Brontes, one of the newly discovered, radiating from the Gulf 
of the Titans, extends over 2400 miles.  Among really long ones, 
the Eumenides, with its continuation the Orcus, the two being in 
truth one line, runs 3540 miles from the point where it leaves the 
Phoenix Lake to the point where it enters the Trivium Charontis; 
throughout this great distance, nearly equal to a diameter of the 
planet, deviating neither to the right nor to the left from the 
great circle upon which it set out.  On the other hand, the 
shortest line is the Nectar, which is only about 250 miles in 
length; sweetness being, according to Schiaparelli its christener, 
as short-lived on Mars as elsewhere. 
</p><p>That with very few exceptions the lines all follow arcs of 
great circles is proved: first, by the fact that when near the 
centre of the disc they show as straight lines; second, that when 
seen toward its edges they appear curved, in keeping with the 
curvature of a spherical surface viewed obliquely; third, that when 
the several parts of some of the longer lines are plotted upon a 
globe they turn out to lie in one great circle.  Apparent 
straightness throughout is only possible in short lines.  For a 
very long arc upon the surface of a revolving globe tilted toward 
the observer to appear straight in its entirety it must lie in 
certain positions.  It so chances that these conditions are 
fulfilled by the canal called the Titan.  The Titan starts from the 
Gulf of the Titans, in south latitude 20&deg;, and runs due north 
almost exactly upon the 169th meridian for an immense distance.  I 
have followed it over 2300 miles down the disc to about 43&deg; 
north, as far as the tilt of the planet's axis would permit.  As 
the rotation of the planet swings it round, it passes the central 
meridian of the disc simultaneously throughout its length, and at 
that moment comes out strikingly straight, a substantialized 
meridian itself. 
</p><p>Although each line is the arc of a great circle, the direction 
taken by this great circle may be any whatsoever.  The Titan, as we 
have seen, runs nearly due north and south.  Certain canals 
crossing this run, on the contrary, almost due east and west.  
There are others, again, belting the disc at well-nigh every angle 
between the two.  Nor is there any preponderance, apparently, for 
one direction as against any other.  This indifference to direction 
is important as showing that the rotation of the planet has no 
direct effect upon the inclination of the canals. 
</p><p>But, singular as each line looks to be by itself, it is the 
systematic network of the whole that is most amazing.  Each line 
not only goes with wonderful directness from one point to another, 
but at this latter spot it contrives to meet, exactly, another line 
which has come with like directness from quite a different 
starting-point.  Nor do two only manage thus to rendezvous.  Three, 
four, five, and even seven will similarly fall in on the same 
spot,&mdash;a sociability which, to a greater or less extent, takes 
place all over the surface of the planet.  The disc is simply a 
network of such intersections.  Sometimes a canal goes only from 
one intersection to another; more commonly it starts with right of 
continuation, and, after reaching the first rendezvous, goes on in 
unchanged course to several more. 
</p><p>The result is that the whole of the great reddish-ochre 
portions of the planet is cut up into a series of spherical 
triangles of all possible sizes and shapes.  What their number may 
be lies quite beyond the possibility of count at present; for the 
better our own air, the more of them are visible.  About four times 
as many as are down on Schiaparelli's chart of the same regions 
have been seen  
 
   <pb n="109"/>   
 
 at Flagstaff.  But before proceeding further 
with a description of these Martian phenomena, the history of their 
discovery deserves to be sketched, since it is as strange as the 
canals themselves. 
</p><p>The first hint the world had of their existence was when 
Schiaparelli saw some of the lines in 1877, now eighteen years ago.  
The world, however, was anything but prepared for the revelation, 
and, when he announced what he had seen, promptly proceeded to 
disbelieve him.  Schiaparelli had the misfortune to be ahead of his 
times, and the yet greater misfortune to remain so; for not only 
did no one else see the lines at that opposition, but no one else 
succeeded in doing so at subsequent ones.  For many years fate 
allowed Schiaparelli to have them all to himself, a confidence he 
amply repaid.  While others doubted, he went from discovery to 
discovery.  What he had seen in 1877 was not so very startling in 
view of what he afterward saw.  His first observations might well 
have been of simple estuaries, long natural creeks running up into 
the continents, and so cutting them in two.  His later observations 
were too peculiar to be explained even by so improbable a 
configuration of the Martian surface.  In 1879, the <hi rend="italic">canali</hi>, as 
he called them (channels, or canals, the word may be translated, 
and it is in the latter sense that he now regards them), showed 
straighter and narrower than they had in 1877: this not in 
consequence of any change in them, but from his own improved 
faculty of detection; for what the eye has once seen it can always 
see better a second time.  As he gazed they appeared straighter, 
and he made out more.  Lastly, toward the end of the year, he 
observed, one evening, what struck even him as a most startling 
phenomenon, the twinning of one of the canals: two parallel canals 
suddenly showed where but a single one had showed before.  The 
paralleling was so perfect that he suspected optical illusion.  He 
could, however discover none by changing his telescopes or 
eyepieces.  The phenomenon, apparently, was real. 
</p><p>At the next opposition he looked to see if by chance he should 
mark a repetition of this strange event, and went, as he tells us, 
from surprise to surprise; for one after the other of his canals 
proceeded startlingly to become two, until some twenty of them had 
thus doubled.  This capped the climax to his own wonderment, and, 
it is needless to add, to other people's incredulity; for nobody 
else had yet succeeded in seeing the canals at all, let alone 
seeing them double.  Undeterred by the general skepticism, he 
confirmed, at each fresh opposition, his previous discoveries; 
which, in view of the fact that no one else did, rather tended in 
astronomical circles to the opposite result. 
</p><p>For nine years he labored thus alone, having his visions all 
to himself.  It was not till 1886 that any one but he saw the 
canals.  In April of that year Perrotin at Nice first did so.  The 
occasion was the setting-up of the great Nice glass of twenty-nine 
inches aperture.  In spite of the great size of the glass, however, 
a first attempt resulted in nothing but failure.  So did a second, 
and Perrotin was on the point of abandoning the search altogether 
when, on the 15th of the month, he suddenly detected one of the 
canals, the Phison.  His assistant, M. Thollon, saw it immediately 
afterward.  After this they managed to make out several others, 
some single, some double, substantially as Schiaparelli had drawn 
them; the slight discrepancies between their observations and his 
being, in point of fact, the best of confirmations. 
</p><p>Since then other observers have contrived to detect the 
canals, the list of the successful increasing at each opposition, 
although even now their number might almost be told on one's hands 
and feet.  The fact that so few men have yet seen these lines is 
due to poor air.  That in ordinary atmosphere the canals are  
 
 
   <pb n="110"/>   
 
 not easy objects is certain; while for the detection of their 
peculiar fineness and straightness a steady air is essential.  So 
also is attentive perception on the part of the observer, size of 
aperture being distinctly a secondary matter.  That Schiaparelli 
discovered the canals with an 8 1/2 object-glass, and that the 26-inch at Washington has refused to show them to this day, are facts 
that speak with emphasis on the point. 
</p><p>Although skepticism as to the existence of the so-called 
canals seems now pretty well dispelled, disbelief still makes a 
desperate stand against their peculiar appearance, dubbing accounts 
of their straightness and duplication as sensational, whatever that 
may mean in such connection; for that they are both straight and 
double, as described, is certain,&mdash;a statement I make after having 
seen them instead of before doing so, as is the case with the 
gifted objectors.  Doubt, however, will not wholly cease till more 
people have seen them, which will not happen till the importance of 
atmosphere in the study of planetary detail is more generally 
appreciated than it is to-day.  To look for the canals with a large 
instrument in poor air is like trying to read a page of fine print 
kept dancing before one's eyes, and increase of magnification 
increases the motion.  Advance in our study of other worlds depends 
upon choosing the very best atmospheric sites for our 
observatories. 
</p><p>As we shall now have to call these Martian things by their 
names,&mdash;our names, that is,&mdash;it may be well to consider cursorily 
the nomenclature which has been evolved on the subject.  
Unfortunately, the planet has been quite too much benamed,&mdash;benamed, indeed, out of all recognition.  There are no less than 
five or six systems current for its general topographical features.  
The result is that it has become something of a specialty just to 
know the names.  The Syrtis Major, for example, appears under the 
following aliases: the Syrtis Major, the Mer du Sablier, the Kaiser 
Sea, the Northern Sea, to say nothing of translations of these, 
such as the Hour-Glass Sea.  After which ample baptism it is a 
trifle disconcerting to have the sea turn out, apparently, not to 
be a sea at all.  Everybody has tried his hand at naming the 
planet, first and last; naming a thing being man's nearest approach 
to creating it.  Proctor made a chart of the planet, and named it 
thoroughly; Flammarion drew another chart, and also named it 
thoroughly, but differently; Green made a third map, and gave it a 
third set of names; Schiaparelli followed with a fourth, and 
furnished it with a brand-new set of his own; and finally W. H. 
Pickering found it necessary to give a few new names, just for 
particularization.  To know, therefore, what part of the planet 
anybody means when he mentions it, one has to keep in his head 
enough names for five worlds.  To cap which, it is to be remarked 
that not one of them is the thing's real&mdash;that is, its Martian&mdash;name, after all! 
</p><p>Fortunately, with the canals matters are not so desperate, 
because so few people have seen them.  Schiaparelli's monopoly of 
the sight pleasingly prevented, in their case, christening 
competition.  What is more, he named them very judiciously and most 
picturesquely after mythologic river names.  Where he got his names 
is another matter.  Whether he started by being as learned in such 
lore as he afterward became may well be doubted.  Certainly one of 
the greatest discoveries made at Flagstaff has been the discovery 
of the meaning of Schiaparelli's names; some of them still defying 
the penetrating power of the ordinary encyclopaedia.  Among them 
are classical mythologic ones of the class known only to that 
himself mythical character, Macaulay's every schoolboy, which 
speaks conclusively for their reconditeness.  Others, I firmly 
believe, even that omniscient schoolboy can never have heard of.  
Want of space here precludes instances; but  
 
   <pb n="111"/>   
 
 as a simple 
example I may say that the translation to Mars of the Phison and 
the Gehon, the two lost rivers of Mesopotamia, satisfactorily 
accounts for their not being found on earth by modern explorers. 
</p><p>With due mental reservation as to their meaning, I have 
adopted Schiaparelli's names, and where it has been necessary to 
name newly discovered canals have conformed as closely as possible 
to his general scheme.  If even in an instance or two I have hit 
upon names that are incomprehensible, I shall feel that I have not 
disgraced my illustrious predecessor.  For a brand-new thing no 
name is so good as one whose meaning nobody knows, except one that 
has no meaning at all. 
</p><p>Schiaparelli's scheme embraces all the other Martian features 
as well as the canals, and the same poetic imagination pervades the 
whole.  For example, the central promontory of what used to be 
known as Dawes' Forked Bay, a prominent point, since it has for 
some time been used as the zero meridian for Martian longitudes, he 
calls the Fastigium Aryn.  The Fastigium Aryn was, it appears, the 
cupola of the world, a mythic spot supposed to be the absolute 
centre of the earth regarded as a plane in mid-heaven,&mdash;a point 
midway between the north and south, the east and west, the zenith 
and nadir; an eminently suitable name, indeed, for the origin of 
longitudes and the beginning of time. 
</p><p>To return now to the objects of so much human incredulity.  
The first point worth noting about them is that their actual 
existence is quite beyond question; the second, that the better 
they are seen, the odder they look.  Observations at Arequipa in 
1892 not only confirmed Schiaparelli's, but extended the canal 
system considerably both in quantity and in character; observations 
last year at Flagstaff extended it still further, so that now we 
know of about half as many more canals as are down on 
Schiaparelli's chart, and of certain phenomena connected with them 
no less peculiar, to say the least, than themselves.  What these 
strange dependencies are we will note after we have considered the 
canals. 
</p><p>So far we have regarded the canals only statically, so to 
speak; that is, we have sketched them as they would appear to any 
one who observed them in sufficiently steady air, once, and once 
only.  But this is far from all that a systematic study of the 
lines will disclose.  Before, however, entering upon this second 
phase of their description, we may pause to note how, even 
statically regarded, the aspect of the lines is enough to put to 
rest all the theories of purely natural causation that have so far 
been advanced to account for them.  This negation is to be found in 
the supernaturally regular appearance of the system, upon three 
distinct counts: first, the straightness of the lines; second, 
their individually uniform width; and third, their systematic 
radiation from special points. 
</p><p>On the first two counts we observe that the lines exceed in 
regularity any purely natural regularity of which we commonly have 
cognizance.  Physical processes never, so far as we know, produce 
perfectly regular results; that is, results in which irregularity 
is not also plainly discernible.  Disagreement amid conformity is 
the inevitable outcome of the many factors simultaneously at work.  
>From the orbits of the heavenly bodies to philotaxis and human 
features, this diversity in uniformity is apparent.  As a rule, the 
divergences, though small, are quite perceptible; that is, the lack 
of absolute uniformity is comparable to the uniformity itself, and 
not of the negligible second order of unimportance.  In fact, it is 
by the very presence of uniformity and precision that we suspect 
things of artificiality.  It was the mathematical shape of the Ohio 
mounds that suggested mound-builders; and so with  
 
   <pb n="112"/>   
 
 the 
thousand objects of every-day life.  Too great regularity is in 
itself the most suspicious of circumstances that some finite 
intelligence has been at work. 
</p><p>If it be asked how, in the case of a body so far off as Mars, 
we can assert sufficient precision to imply artificiality, the 
answer is two fold: first, that the better we see these lines, the 
more regular they look; and second, that the eye is quicker to 
perceive irregularity than we commonly note.  It is indeed 
surprising to find what small irregularities will shock the eye. 
</p><p>The third count is, if possible, yet more conclusive.  That 
the lines form a system; that, instead of running any-whither, they 
join certain points to certain others, making thus, not a simple 
network, but one whose meshes connect centres directly with one 
another, is striking at first sight, and loses none of its 
peculiarity on second thought.  For the intrinsic improbability of 
such a state of things arising from purely natural causes becomes 
evident on consideration. 
</p><p>Were lines drawn haphazard over the surface of a globe, the 
chances are ever so many to one against more than two lines 
crossing each other at any point.  Simple crossings of two lines 
would of course be common in something like factorial proportion to 
the number of lines, but that any other line should contrive to 
cross at the same point would be a coincidence whose improbability 
only a mathematician can properly appreciate, so very great is it.  
If the lines were true lines, without breadth, the chances against 
such a coincidence would be infinite; and even had the lines some 
breadth, the chances would be enormous against a rendezvous.  In 
other words, we might search in vain for a single instance of such 
encounter.  On the surface of Mars, however, instead of searching 
in vain, we find the thing occurring <hi rend="italic">passim</hi>; this <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> 
most improbable rendezvousing proving the rule, not the exception.  
Of the crossings that are best seen, almost all are meeting-places 
for more than two canals. 
</p><p>To any one who had not seen the canals, it would at once occur 
that something of the same improbability might be fulfilled by 
cracks radiating from centres of explosion or fissure.  But such a 
supposition is at once negatived by the uniform breadth of the 
lines, a uniformity impossible in cracks, whose very mode of 
production necessitates their being bigger at one end than the 
other.  We see examples of what might result from such action in 
the cracks that radiate from Tycho, in the moon, or, as we now from 
Professor W. H. Pickering's observations, from the craterlets about 
it.  These cracks bear no resemblance whatever to the lines on 
Mars.  They look like cracks; the lines on Mars do not.  Indeed, it 
is safe to say that the Martian lines would never so much as 
suggest cracks to any one.  Lastly, the different radiations fit 
into one another absolutely, an utter impossibility were they 
radiating rifts from different centres. 
</p><p>In the same way, we may, while we are about it, show that the 
lines cannot be several other things which they have, more or less 
gratuitously, been taken to be.  They cannot, for example, be 
rivers; for rivers could not be so obligingly of the same size at 
source and mouth, nor would they run from preference on arcs of 
great circles.  To do so, practically invariably, would imply a 
devotion to pure mathematics not common in rivers.  They may, in 
some few instances, be rectified rivers, which is quite another 
matter.  Glaciation cracks are equally out of the question: first, 
for the causes above mentioned touching cracks in general; and 
second, because there is, unfortunately, no ice where they occur.  
Nor can the lines be furrows ploughed by meteorites,&mdash;another 
ingenious suggestion,&mdash;since in order to plough, invariably, a 
furrow from one centre to another, without either swerving from the 
course or overshooting the mark, the visitant meteorite  
 
   <pb n="113"/>   
 
 
would have to be carefully trained to the business. 
</p><p>Such are the chief purely natural theories of the lines, 
excluding the idea of canals,&mdash;theories advanced by persons who 
have not seen them.  No one who has seen the lines well has or 
could advance them, inasmuch as they are not only disproved by 
consideration of the character of the lines, but instantly confuted 
by the mere look of them. 
</p><p>Schiaparelli supposes the canals to be canals, but of geologic 
construction.  He suggests, however, no explanation of how this is 
possible; so that the suggestion is not, properly speaking, a 
theory.  That eminent astronomer further says of the idea that they 
are the work of intelligent beings, "Io mi quardero bene dal 
combattere questa supposizione la quale nulla include 
d'impossible."  (I should carefully refrain from combating this 
supposition, which involves no impossibility.)  In truth, no 
natural theory has yet been advanced which will explain these 
lines, while recent observations furnish material that seems to 
render artificial construction probable. 
</p><p>After so much necessary digression upon what the canals are 
not, we will resume our inquiry as to what they are. 
</p><p>So far we have considered their aspect at any one time, and we 
have seen that it is such as to defy natural explanation, and to 
hint that in these lines we are regarding something other than the 
outcome of purely natural causes.  Indeed, such is the first 
impression upon getting a good view of them.  How instant this 
inference is becomes patent from the way in which drawings of the 
canals are received by incredulously disposed persons.  The 
straightness of the lines is unhesitatingly attributed to the 
draughtsman.  Now it is to be remembered that accusation of design, 
if it prove inapplicable to the draughtsman, devolves <hi rend="italic">ipso 
facto</hi> upon the canals. 
</p><p>We come next to a consideration of their successive 
appearances night after night, and month after month.  After the 
fundamental fact that such curious phenomena as the canals are 
visible is the scarcely less important one that they are not always 
so.  At times the canals are invisible, and this invisibility is 
real, not apparent; that is, it is not an invisibility due to 
distance or obscuration of any kind between us and them, but an 
actual invisibility due to the condition of the canal itself.  With 
our present optical means, at certain seasons they cease to exist.  
For aught we can see, they simply are not there. 
</p><p>That distance is not responsible for the disappearance of the 
canals is shown by their relative conspicuousness at different 
times.  It is not always when Mars is nearest to us that the canals 
are best seen.  On the contrary, they show a sublime disregard for 
mere proximity.  This is evidenced both by the changes in 
appearance of any one canal and by the changes in relative 
conspicuousness of different canals.  Some instances of the 
metamorphosis will reveal this conclusively.  For example, during 
the end of August and the beginning of September, at this last 
opposition, the canals about the Lake of the Sun were conspicuous, 
while the canals to the north of them were almost invisible.  In 
November the relative intensities of the two sets had distinctly 
changed: the southern canals were much as before, but the northern 
ones had most perceptibly darkened. 
</p><p>Another instance of the same thing was shown in the case of 
the canals to the north of the Sinus Titanum when compared with 
those about the Solis Lacus.  In August the former were but faintly 
visible; in November they had become evident; and yet, during this 
interval, little change in conspicuousness had taken place in the 
canals in the Solis Lacus region. 
</p><p>With like disregard of the effect due to distance, the canals 
to the east of the Ganges showed better at the November  
 
   <pb n="114"/>   
 
 
presentation<ref target="n3.1">[1]</ref> of that region than they had at the October one, 
although the planet was actually farther off at the later date, in 
the proportion of 21 to 18. 
</p><p>A more striking instance of the irrelevancy of distance in the 
matter was observed in the same region by Schiaparelli in 1877.  It 
is additionally interesting as practically dating his discovery of 
the canals.  In early October of that year, on the evenings of the 
2d and the 4th, he tells us, under excellent definition, and with 
the diameter of the planet's disc 21" of arc, the continental 
region between the Pearl-Bearing Gulf and the Bay of the Dawn was 
quite uniformly, nakedly bright, and destitute of suspicion of 
markings of any sort.  A like state of things was the case with the 
same region at its next presentation, on the 7th of November.  Four 
months later, when the diameter of the disc had been reduced by 
distance to 5".7, or, in other words, when the planet had receded 
to four times its previous distance from the earth, the canal 
called the Indus appeared, perfectly visible, in the region 
mentioned.  At the next opposition, in 1881, similar effects 
occurred; the canals in this region remaining obstinately invisible 
while the planet was near the earth, and then coming out 
conspicuously when it had gone farther away.  Distance, therefore, 
is not, with the canals, the great obliterator. 
</p><p>As to their veiling by Martian cloud or mist, there is no 
evidence of any such obscuration.  The coast line of the dark areas 
appears as clear-cut when the canals are invisible as when they 
become conspicuous. 
</p><p>A canal, then, alters its visibility for some reason connected 
with itself.  It grows into recognition from intrinsic cause.  But 
during all its metamorphoses, in one thing, and in one thing only, 
it remains fixed,&mdash;in position.  Temporary in appearance, the 
canals are apparently permanent in place.  Not only do they not 
change in position during one opposition; they seem not to do so 
from one opposition to another.  The canals I have observed this 
year agree quite within the errors of observation with those 
figured on Schiaparelli's chart.  In general they conform to their 
representations, and failure to do so is explicable not only by 
errors of observation, but by certain other facts.  First, by 
seasonal variation in the canals themselves; the visibility or 
invisibility of a canal combined with the visibility or 
invisibility of a neighbor being capable of producing strange 
permutations in the region observed. 
</p><p>The Araxes is a case in point.  On Schiaparelli's chart there 
is but one original Araxes and one great and only Phasis.  But it 
turns out that these do not possess the land all to themselves.  No 
less than five canals traversing the region, including the Phasis 
itself, were visible this year at Flagstaff, and I have no doubt 
there are plenty of others waiting to be discovered.  These cross 
one another at all sorts of angles.  Unconscious combination of 
them is quite competent to give a turn to the Araxes one way or the 
other, and make it curved or straight at pleasure. 
</p><p>Unchangeable, apparently, in position, the canals are 
otherwise among the most changeable features of the Martian disc.  
From being invisible, they emerge gradually, for some reason 
inherent in themselves, into conspicuousness.  In short, 
phenomenally at least, they grow.  The order of their coming 
carries with it a presumption of cause, for it synchronizes with 
the change in the Martian seasons. 
 
<note id="n3.1"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg> <p>A presentation of any part of the planet is the 
occasion when that part of the disc is turned toward the observer.  Many 
causes combine to make the face presented each night vary, but the chief 
one is that the earth rotates about forty-one minutes faster than Mars, 
and consequently gains a little less than ten degrees on him daily. 
After about thirty-seven days, therefore, the two planets again present 
the same face to each other at the same hour.</p></note> 
 
 
 
   <pb n="115"/>   
 
 
Their first appearance is a matter of the Martian time of year. 
</p><p>To start with, the visible development of the canal system 
follows the melting of the polar snows.  Not until such melting has 
progressed pretty far do any of the canals, it would seem, become 
perceptible. 
</p><p>Secondly, when they do appear, it is, in the case of the 
southern hemisphere, the most southern ones that become visible 
first.  Last June, when the canals were first seen, those about the 
Lake of the Sun and the Phoenix Lake were easier to make out than 
any of the others.  Now, this region is the part of the reddish-ochre continent, as we may call it, that lies nearest the south 
pole.  It extends into the blue-green regions as far south as 40 
&deg; of south latitude.  Nor do any so-called islands&mdash;that is, 
smaller reddish-ochre areas&mdash;stand between it and the pole.  It 
lies first exposed, therefore, to any water descending toward the 
equator from the melting of the polar cap. 
</p><p>Having once become visible, these canals remained so, becoming 
more and more conspicuous as the season advanced.  By August they 
had darkened very perceptibly.  As yet those in other parts of the 
planet were scarcely more visible than they had been two months 
before.  Gradually, however, others became evident, farther and 
farther north, till by October all the canals bordering the north 
coast of the dark regions were recognizable; after which the 
latter, in their turn, proceeded to darken,&mdash;a state of things 
which continued up to the close of my observations toward the end 
of November. 
</p><p>The order in which the canals came out hinted that two factors 
were operative to the result, latitude and proximity to the dark 
regions.  Other things equal, the most southern ones showed first; 
beginning with the Solis Lacus region, and continuing with those 
about the Sea of the Sirens and the Titan Gulf, and so northward 
down the disc.  Other things were not, however, always equal in the 
way of topographical position.  Notably was this the case with the 
areas to the west of the Syrtis Major, which developed canals 
earlier than their latitudes would warrant.  Now, to the Syrtis 
Major descend from the pole the great straits spoken of before, 
which, although not in their entirety water, are probably lands 
fertilized by a thread of water running through them.  They connect 
the polar sea with the Syrtis Major in a tolerably straight line. 
</p><p>The direction of the canal also affects its time of 
appearance, though to a less extent.  Canals running north and 
south, such as the Gorgon, the Titan, the Brontes, and the like, 
became visible, as a rule, before those running east and west.  
Especially was this noticeable in the more northern portions of the 
disc.  Time of appearance was evidently a question of latitude 
tempered by ease of communication. 
</p><p>After the canals had appeared, their relative intensities 
changed with time, and the change followed the same order in which 
the initial change from invisibility to visibility had taken place.  
A like metamorphosis happened to each in turn from south to north, 
in accordance with, and continuance of, the seasonal change that 
affected all the blue-green areas. 
</p><p>To account for these phenomena, the explanation that at once 
suggests itself is, that a direct transference of water takes place 
over the face of the planet, and that the canals are so many 
waterways.  This explanation has the difficulty of involving 
enormously wide canals.  There is another objection to it: the time 
taken would appear to be too long, for some months elapsed between 
the apparent departure of the water from the pole and its apparent 
advent in the equatorial regions; furthermore, each canal did not 
darken all at once, but gradually.  We must therefore seek some 
explanation which accounts for this delay.  Now,  
 
   <pb n="116"/>   
 
 when we do 
so, we find that the explanation advanced above for the blue-green 
areas explains also the canals, namely, that what we see in both 
is, not water, but vegetation; for if the darkening be due to 
vegetation, time must elapse between the advent of the water and 
its perceptible effects,&mdash;time sufficient for the flora to sprout.  
If, therefore, we suppose what we call a canal to be, not the canal 
proper, but the vegetation along its banks, the observed phenomena 
stand accounted for.  This suggestion was first made some years ago 
by Professor W. H. Pickering. 
</p><p>That what we see is not the canal proper, but the line of land 
it irrigates, disposes incidentally of the difficulty of conceiving 
a canal several miles wide.  On the other hand, a narrow, 
fertilized strip of country is what we should expect to find; for, 
as we have seen, the general physical condition of the planet leads 
us to the conception, not of canals constructed for waterways,&mdash;like our Suez Canal,&mdash;but of canals dug for irrigation purposes.  
We cannot, of course, be sure that such is their character, 
appearances being often highly deceitful; we can only say that, so 
far, the supposition best explains what we see.  Further details of 
their development point to this same conclusion. 
</p><p>In emerging from invisibility into evidence, the canals first 
make themselves suspected rather than seen, as broad, faint streaks 
smooching the disc.  Such effect, however, seems to be an optical 
illusion, due to poor air and the difficulty inherent in detecting 
fine detail; for on improvement in the seeing I have observed these 
broad streaks contract to fine lines, not sensibly different in 
width from what they eventually become. 
</p><p>The parts of the canals which are nearest the dark areas show 
first, the line extending sometimes for a few hundred miles into 
the continent, sometimes for a thousand or more; then, in course of 
time, the canal becomes evident in its entirety.  Complete 
visibility takes place soon after the canal has once begun to show, 
although it show but faint throughout. 
</p><p>This tendency to being seen <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> is more strikingly 
displayed after a canal has attained its development.  It is then 
not commonly seen in part.  Either it is not seen at all, owing to 
the seeing not being good enough, or it is visible throughout its 
length from one junction to another. 
</p><p>Apart from their extension, the growth of the canals consists 
chiefly in depth of tint.  They darken rather than broaden,&mdash;a fact 
which tends to corroborate their vegetal character; for that long 
tracts of country should be thus simultaneously flooded all over to 
a gradually deepening extent is highly unlikely, while a growth of 
vegetation would deepen in appearance in precisely the way that the 
darkening takes place. 
</p><p>As for color, the lines would seem to be of the same tint as 
the blue-green areas.  But, owing to their narrowness, this is only 
an inference.  I have never chanced to see them of distinctive 
color. 
</p><p>At this point it is probable that a certain obstacle to such 
wholesale construction of canals, however, will arise in the mind 
of the reader, namely, the thought of mountains; for mountains are 
by nature antagonistic to canals.  Only the Czar of all the 
Russias&mdash;if we are to credit the account of the building of the 
Moscow railway&mdash;would be capable of running a canal regardless of 
topography.  Nor will the doings at our own antipodes help us to 
conceive such construction; for though the Japanese irrigate 
hillsides, the water in the case comes from slopes higher yet, 
whereas on Mars it does not. 
</p><p>Indeed, for the lines to contain canals we must suppose either 
that mountains prove no obstacles to Martians, or else that there 
are practically no mountains on Mars.  For the system seems 
sublimely superior to possible obstructions  
 
   <pb n="117"/>   
 
 in the way; the 
lines running, apparently, not where they may, but where they 
choose.  The Eumenides-Orcus, for example, pursues the even tenor 
of its unswerving course for nearly 3500 miles.  Now, it might be 
possible so to select one's country that one canal should be able 
to do this; but that every canal should be straight, and many of 
them fairly comparable in length, seems to be beyond the 
possibility of contrivance. 
</p><p>In this dilemma between mountains on the one hand and canals 
on the other, a certain class of observations most opportunely 
comes to our aid; for, from observations which have nothing to do 
with the lines, it turns out that the surface of the planet is, in 
truth, most surprisingly flat.  How this is known will most easily 
be understood from a word or two upon the manner in which 
astronomers have learnt the heights of the mountains in the moon. 
</p><p>The heights of the lunar mountains are found from measuring 
the lengths of the shadows they cast.  As the moon makes her 
circuit of the earth, a varying amount of her illuminated surface 
is presented to our view.  From a slender sickle she grows to a 
full moon, and then diminishes again to a crescent.  The 
illuminated portion is bounded by a semi-circle on the outside, and 
by a semi-ellipse on the inner.  The semicircle is called her limb, 
the semi-ellipse her terminator.  The former is the edge we see 
because we can see no further; the latter, the line upon her 
surface where the sun is just rising or setting.  Now, as we know, 
the shadows cast at sunrise or sunset are very long, much longer 
than the objects that cast them are high.  This is due to the 
obliquity at which the light strikes them; the same effect being 
produced by any sufficiently oblique light, such as an electric 
light at a distance.  Imperceptible in themselves, the heights 
become perceptible by their shadows.  A road illuminated by a 
distant arc light gives us a startling instance of this; the smooth 
surface taking on from its shadows the look of a ploughed field. 
</p><p>It is this indirect kind of magnification that enables 
astronomers to measure the lunar mountains, and even renders such 
vicariously visible to the naked eye.  Every one has noticed how 
ragged and irregular the inner edge of the moon looks, while her 
outer edge seems perfectly smooth.  In one place it will appear to 
project beyond the perfect ellipse, in another to recede from it.  
The first effect is due to mountain tops catching the sun's rays 
before the plains about them; the other, to mountain tops further 
advanced into the lunar day, whose shadows still shroud the valleys 
at their feet.  Yet the elevations and depressions thus rendered so 
noticeable vanish in profile on the limb. 
</p><p>Much as we see the moon with the naked eye do we see Mars with 
the telescope.  Mars being outside of us with regard to the sun, we 
never see him less than half illumined, but we do see him with a 
disc that lacks of being round,&mdash;about what the moon shows us when 
two days off from full.  It is when he is in quadrature&mdash;that is, 
a quarter way round the celestial circle from the sun&mdash;that he 
shows thus, and we see him then with the telescope at closer range 
than we ever see the moon.  When we so observe him, we notice at 
once that his terminator, or inner edge, presents a very different 
appearance from the lunar one.  Instead of looking like a saw, it 
looks comparatively smooth, like a knife.  From this we know that, 
relatively to his size, he has no elevations or depressions upon 
his surface comparable to the lunar peaks and craters. 
</p><p>His terminator, however, is not absolutely perfect.  
Irregularities are to be detected in it, although much less 
pronounced than those of the moon.  His irregularities are of two 
kinds.  The first, and by all odds the commonest phenomenon 
consists in showing himself on occasions 
 
   <pb n="118"/>   
 
surprisingly flat; 
not in this case an inferable flatness, but a perfectly apparent 
one.  In other words, his terminator does not show as a semi-ellipse, but as an irregular polygon.  It looks as if in places the 
rind had been pared off.  The peel thus taken from him, so to 
speak, is from twenty to forty degrees wide, according to the 
particular part of his surface that shows upon the terminator at 
the time. 
</p><p>Now it is a significant fact that this paring of his disc 
appears usually where the dark regions are coming into view or 
passing out of sight, according as it is the sunrise or the sunset 
terminator that is presented to observation.  And even in the few 
cases where it is not coincident with them, it is never far removed 
from their position.  Two causes undoubtedly combine to produce the 
effect.  One of them is irradiation.  It is a well-known fact that 
bright bodies look larger than they are, probably because of the 
sympathetic vibration of the rods in the retina adjoining those 
directly affected.  A familiar instance of the effect is the 
seemingly wizened look of the old moon seen in the new moon's arms.  
The lusty young moon seems a sixth the broader of the two.  The 
same thing would appear in the case of the Martian terminator; a 
bright area would seem to project beyond a dark one.  This accounts 
for a part of the loss.  The other part is doubtless due to an 
actual depression in the Martian surface.  Thus from the appearance 
of the terminator comes corroboration of the lower level at which 
we found reason (in the last paper) to suppose the dark markings 
upon the planet to lie. 
</p><p>That these long parings do not always coincide with the dark 
areas may help confirm, paradoxical as it sounds, their real 
depression; for it is only the relative, not the actual height that 
is projected on the terminator, and a more elevated area, if 
sloping at the proper angle, would be projected as a depression 
beside a lower one, in spite of being the higher surface of the 
two.  It may also, however, not be due to this cause, but to the 
presence of an actually elevated district; verdure, such as a 
forest, standing on high land. 
</p><p>Such long, low depressions are characteristic of the Martian 
terminator, which is thus in kind quite unlike the lunar one.  In 
addition to them there are elevations, some long and low, some 
short and sharp.  Both are relatively rare.  Of the former variety 
Professor W. H. Pickering discovered two striking specimens.  Each 
looked to be, and probably was, a plateau, very level on top, and 
sloping more or less equally on both sides.  Of the short and sharp 
variety Mr. Douglass has detected some noteworthy instances; but 
whether they mean high dust cloud or mountains is not yet 
predicable.  Mr. Douglass has very systematically observed the 
Martian terminator at every longitude, and is now busy upon a 
contour map of the planet.  His map may enable us to say something 
more definite as to whether the canals traverse low regions from 
preference or not.  But certain it is that Mars is a flat world; 
devoid, as we may note incidentally, of summer resorts, since it 
possesses, apparently, neither seas nor hills.  To canals we will 
now return. 
</p><p>The canals so far described all lie in the bright reddish-ochre portions of the disc,&mdash;those parts which bear every 
appearance of being desert.  But Mr. Douglass has made the 
discovery that they are not the only part of the planet thus 
privileged.  He finds, in the very midst of the dark regions 
themselves, straight, dark streaks not unlike in look to the 
canals, and still more resembling them in the systematic manner in 
which they run.  For they reproduce the same rectilinear 
arrangement that is so striking a characteristic of their bright-area fellows.  He has succeeded, indeed, in thus triangulating all 
the more important dark areas.  What is more, he finds that  
 
   <pb n="119"/>   
 
 
these canals in the dark regions end at the very points at which 
the others begin, so that they make continuations of them. 
</p><p>This fact is another telltale circumstance as to the true 
character of the so-called seas; for that the seas should be 
traversed by permanent dark lines is incompatible with a fluid 
constitution.  But the lines are even more suggestive from a 
positive than they are from a negative standpoint.  That they make 
continuations of the lines in the bright regions shows that the two 
sets are causally connected, and affords strong presumption that 
this causal relation is the very one demanded by the theory of 
irrigation.  For if the canals in the bright regions be strips of 
vegetation irrigated by a canal (too narrow to be itself visible at 
our distance), and there be a scarcity of water upon the surface of 
the planet, the necessary water would have to be conducted to the 
mouths of the canals across the more permanent areas of vegetation, 
thus causing bands of denser verdure athwart them, which we should 
see as dark lines upon the less dark background. 
</p><p>Before passing on to certain other phenomena connected with 
the canals of like significance, we may note here an <hi rend="italic">obiter</hi> 
dictum of the irrigation theory of some slight corroborative worth; 
for if a theory be correct, it will not only fit all the facts, but 
at times go out of its way to answer questions.  Such the present 
one seems to do.  If the seas be seas, and the canals canals, we 
stand confronted by the problem how to make fresh-water canals flow 
out of salt-water seas.  General considerations warrant us in 
believing that the Martian seas, like our own, would contain salts 
in solution, while irrigation ditches, there as here, should flow 
fresh water to be most effective, and we seem committed to the 
erection of distilleries upon a gigantic scale.  But if, on the 
contrary, the seas be not seas, but areas of vegetation, the 
difficulty vanishes at once; for if the planet be dependent upon 
the melting of its polar snows for its spring freshet, the water 
thus produced must necessarily be fresh, and the canals be directly 
provided with the water they want.  The polar sea is a temporary 
body of water, formed anew each year, not a permanent ocean; 
consequently there is no chance for saline matter to collect in it.  
>From it, therefore, fresh water flows, and, like our rivers, 
gathers nothing to speak of in the way of salt before it is drawn 
off into the canals. 
</p><p>We now come to some phenomena connected with the canals, of 
the utmost suggestiveness.  I have said that the junctions held in 
a twofold way the key to the unlocking of the mystery of the 
canals; in the first place, in the fact that such junctions exist.  
The second and more important reason remains to be given, for it 
consists in what we find at those junctions.  These phenomena will 
form the subject of the next paper.</p>

<p>SUGGESTIVE of irrigation as the strange network of lines that 
covers the surface of Mars appears to be, the suggestion takes on 
more definite shape yet with the last addition to our knowledge of 
the planet's surface detail,&mdash;the recognition of a singularly 
correlated system of spots. 
</p><p>The canals, as we have seen, show a remarkable attachment to 
their kind.  Not content with such casual meetings as chance would 
afford them in the course of their long careers, they make a point 
of rendezvousing as often and in as great numbers as possible.  
Indeed, the ingenuity with which they manage to combine unswerving 
rectitude with meetings by the way grows more and more marvelous, 
the more one studies it.  The meeting-places, or junctions, 
evidently possess an attraction for the canals.  The crossings, in 
fact, seem to be the end and aim of the whole system; the canals, 
but means to that end.  So much is at once inferable from the great 
intrinsic improbability that such crossings can be due to chance. 
</p><p>The inference receives, apparently, striking verification from 
a something which turns out to exist at these junctions.  This 
something shows itself as a round or ovate spot.  To such spot, 
planted there in the midst of the desert, do the neighboring canals 
converge. 
</p><p>Dotted all over the reddish-ochre ground of the great desert 
stretches of the planet, the so-called continents of Mars, are an 
innumerable number of dark circular or ovate spots.  They appear, 
furthermore, always in intimate association with the canals.  They 
constitute so many hubs to which the canals make  
 
   <pb n="224"/>   
 
 spokes.  
These spots, together with the canals that lead to them, are the 
only markings to be seen anywhere on the continental regions.  
Otherwise the great reddish-ochre areas are absolutely bare; of 
that pale fire-opal hue which marks our own deserts seen from far. 
</p><p>That these two things, straight lines and roundish spots, 
should, with our present telescopic means, be the sole markings to 
appear on the vast desert regions of the planet is suggestive in 
itself. 
</p><p>Another significant fact as to the character of either marking 
is the manifest association of the two.  In spite of the great 
number of the spots, not one of them stands isolate.  There is not 
a single instance of a spot that is not connected by a canal to the 
rest of the dark areas.  This remarkable inability to stand alone 
shows that the spots and the canals are not unrelated phenomena, 
for were there no tie between them they must occasionally exist 
apart. 
</p><p>Nor is this all.  There is, apparently, no spot that is not 
joined to the rest of the system, not only by a canal, but by more 
than one; for though some spots, such as the Fountain of Youth, 
have appeared at first to be provided with but a single canal 
connection, later observation has revealed concurrence in the case.  
The spots are, therefore, not only part and parcel of the canal 
system, but terminal phenomena of the same. 
</p><p>They are, generally speaking, more difficult features to see 
than the canals.  In consequence, they have been among the most 
recent details to be made out upon the planet's surface.  It was 
not until 1892, at Arequipa, that they were seen in anything like 
their real numbers.  Of them, indeed, are the forty lakes found by 
Professor W. H. Pickering.  This year, at Flagstaff, still others 
have been discovered, to detection of their character, as I think. 
</p><p>In the first place, as I have said, there appears to be no 
spot that has not two or more canals running to it; in the second 
place, I find, reversely, that apparently no canal junction is 
without its spot.  Such association is a most tell-tale 
circumstance.  I believe the rule to have no exception.  The more 
prominent junctions all show spots; and with regard to the less 
conspicuous ones, it is to be remembered that, as the canals are 
more easy to make out than the spots, the relative invisibility of 
the latter is to be expected.  From which it would seem that the 
spots are fundamental features of the junctions, and that for a 
junction to be spotless is, from its very nature, an impossibility. 
</p><p>Next to their regularity of position is to be remarked their 
regularity of form.  Their typical shape seems to be circular; for 
the better the atmosphere, the rounder they look.  Under poor 
seeing they show as irregular patches smooching the disc, much as 
the canals themselves show as streaks; the spots differing from the 
canals in being thicker and not so long.  As the seeing improves, 
the patches differentiate themselves into round dots and connecting 
lines.  Such is the shape of the spots associated with single 
canals; that is, canals not double.  In the case of the double 
canals, the spots look like rectangles with the corners rounded 
off.  One of the most striking of all of them is the Trivium 
Charontis, which is nearly square. 
</p><p>Now it will be noticed that these shapes are as unnatural as 
they are definite, and that they all agree in one peculiarity: they 
are all convex, not concave, to the entering canals.  They are not, 
therefore, mere enlargements of the canals, due to natural causes; 
for were the spots enlargements of the canals at their crossing 
points they should be more or less star-shaped, or concave to the 
canals, whereas they are round, or roundish rectangles,&mdash;that is 
convex to the same.  Such convexity negatives, at the outset, their 
being purely natural outgrowths of the canals. 
</p><p>The majority of the spots are from  
 
   <pb n="225"/>   
 
 120 to 150 miles in 
diameter; thus presenting a certain uniformity in size as well as 
in shape.  There are some smaller ones, not more than 75 miles 
across, or less. 
</p><p>To the spot category belong all the markings other than canals 
to be seen anywhere on the continental deserts of the planet, from 
the great Lake of the Sun, which is 540 miles long by 300 miles 
broad, to the tiny Fountain of Youth, which is barely 
distinguishable as a dot.  That all are fundamentally of a kind is 
hinted at by their shape and emphasized by their character, a point 
to which we shall come in a moment. 
</p><p>To this end, we will start with an account of where and how 
they begin to show; for, like the canals, they are not permanent 
markings, but temporary phenomena.  It is in the region about the 
Solis Lacus that they appear first.  The Solis Lacus, or Lake of 
the Sun, is perhaps the most striking marking on Mars.  It is an 
oval spot in lat. 28&deg; S., with its greater diameter nearly 
perpendicular to the meridians, and encircled by an elliptical ring 
of reddish-ochre land, which in turn is bordered on the south by 
the blue-green regions of the south temperate zone.  The whole 
configuration is such as to simulate a gigantic eye which uncannily 
turns round upon one as the planet slowly revolves.  It is so 
conspicuous a feature of the disc that it has been recognized for 
a great many years.  The resemblance to an eye is further borne out 
by a cordon of canals that surround it on the north.  Upon this 
cordon, composed chiefly of the Araxes and the Agathodaemon, are 
beaded a number of spots, two of them, the Phoenix and the Tithonus 
lakes, being conspicuously prominent.  Closer scrutiny reveals 
several more of the same sort, only smaller.  These are all 
interconnected by a network of canals.  Now just as it is in this 
region that the canals first show, so likewise is it here that the 
spots first make their appearance. 
</p><p>Although it was here that at this last opposition the spots 
were first seen, it was not here that their character and purpose 
became apparent.  It was not until later in the season, when the 
Eumenides-Orcus began to give evidence of being yet more peculiarly 
beaded, that the true nature of the spots suggested itself. 
</p><p>The Eumenides-Orcus is a very long and important canal, 
connecting the Phoenix Lake with the Trivium Charontis.  It is so 
long, 3540 miles from one end of it to the other, that although it 
starts in lat. 16&deg; N., and ends in lat. 12&deg; S., it belts 
the disc not many degrees inclined to the equator.  For a great 
distance it runs parallel to the northern coast of the Sea of the 
Sirens.  From this coast several canals strike down to it; some 
stopping at it, others continuing on down the disc.  Especially is 
the western end of the sea, called the Gulf of the Titans, a point 
of departure for canals; no less than six of them, and doubtless 
more, leaving the gulf in variously radiating directions.  At the 
place where these canals severally cross the Eumenides-Orcus, I 
began in November to see spots.  I also saw others along the 
Pyriphlegethon, an important canal leading in a more northerly 
direction from the Phoenix Lake; along the Gigas, a great canal 
running from the Gulf of the Titans all the way to the Lake of the 
Moon; and along other canals in the same region.  I then noticed 
that the spots to the north of the Solis Lacus region had darkened, 
since August, relatively to the more southern ones.  In short, I 
became aware both of a great increase in the number of spots, and 
of an increase in tint in the spots previously seen. 
</p><p>It was apparent that the spots were part and parcel of the 
canal system, and that in the matter of varying visibility they 
took after the canals,&mdash;chronologically, very closely after them; 
for a comparison of the two leads me to be- 
   <pb n="226"/>   
 
lieve that the 
spots make their appearance subsequent, although but little 
subsequent, to the canals which conduct to them. 
</p><p>Furthermore, the spots, like the canals, grow in 
conspicuousness with time.  Now when we consider that nothing, 
practically, has changed between us and them in the interval; that 
there has been no symptom of cloud or other obscuration, before or 
after, over the place where they eventually appear, we are led to 
the conclusion that, like the canals, they grow. 
</p><p>Indeed, in the history of their development the two features 
seem quite similar.  Both grow, and both follow the same order and 
method in their growth.  Both are affected by one progressive 
change that sweeps over the face of the planet from the pole to the 
equator, and then from the equator toward the other pole.  In the 
case of the southern hemisphere, it is, as we have just seen, the 
most southern spots, like the most southern canals, that appear 
first after the melting of the polar snows.  Then gradually others 
begin to show farther and farther north.  The quickening of the 
spots, like the quickening of the canals, is a seasonal affair.  
But there is more in it than this.  It takes place in a manner to 
imply that something more immediate than the change in the seasons 
is concerned in it; immediate not in time, but in relation to the 
result.  A comparison of the behavior of three spots&mdash;the Phoenix 
Lake, the spot at the junction of the Iris and the Gigas, at the 
upper extremity of Ceraunius, and a spot where the Steropes, a 
newly found canal, and the Nilus meet&mdash;will serve to point out what 
this something is.  The Phoenix Lake lies in lat. 17&deg; S., the 
upper Ceraunius in lat 12&deg; N., and the spot on the Steropes in 
lat. 28&deg; N.  In August of last year, the first of these 
markings was very conspicuous, the second but moderately so, while 
the third was barely discernible.  By November, the Phoenix Lake 
had become less salient, Ceraunius relatively more so, and the spot 
on the Steropes nearly as evident as Ceraunius had formerly been.  
In the Martian calendar, the August observation corresponded to our 
20th of June, the November one to our 1st of August, of the 
southern hemisphere; or to our 20th of December and 1st of 
February, respectively, of the northern one.  All three spots were 
practically within the equatorial regions.  Now, on earth, no such 
marked progression in seasonal change occurs within the tropics.  
With us, it is to all intents and purposes equally green there the 
year through.  On Mars it is not.  Clearly, some more definite 
factor than the seasons enters into the matter upon our neighbor 
world. 
</p><p>That this factor is water seems, from the behavior of the 
blue-green areas generally, to be pretty certain.  But just as the 
so-called seas are undoubtedly not seas, nor the canals waterways, 
so the spots are not lakes.  Their mode of growth, so far as it may 
be discerned, confirms this conclusion.  Apparently, it is not so 
much by an increase in size as by a deepening in tint that they 
gradually become recognizable.  They start, it would seem, as big 
as they are to be, but faint in tone, premonitory shades of their 
future selves.  They then proceed to substantialize by darkening in 
tint throughout.  Now, to deepen thus in color with one consent all 
over would be a peculiar thing for a lake to do.  For had the lake 
appreciable depth to start with, it should always be visible; and 
had it not, its bed would have to be phenomenally level to permit 
of its being all flooded at once.  If, however, the spots be not 
bodies of water, but areas of verdure, their deepening in tint 
throughout is perfectly explicable, since the darkening would be 
the natural result of a simultaneous growth of vegetation.  This 
inference is further borne out by the fact that to the spot class 
belong unquestionably those larger oval markings of which the Lake 
of the Sun is the most conspicuous  
 
   <pb n="227"/>   
 
 example.  For both are 
associated in precisely the same manner with the canal system.  
Each spot is a centre of canal connections in exactly the way in 
which the Solis Lacus or the Phoenix Lake itself is.  But the light 
coming from the Solis Lacus and the Phoenix Lake showed, in 
Professor W. H. Pickering's observations, no sign of polarization 
such as a sheet of water should show, and such as the polar sea 
actually did show. 
</p><p>When we put all these phenomena together,&mdash;the presence of the 
spots at the junctions of the canals, their strangely systematic 
shapes, their seasonal darkening, and last, but not least, the 
resemblance of the great continental regions of Mars to the deserts 
of the earth,&mdash;a solution of their character suggests itself at 
once: to wit, that they are oases in the midst of that desert, and 
not wholly innocent of design; for, in number, position, shape, and 
behavior, the oases turn out as typical and peculiar a feature of 
Mars as the canals themselves. 
</p><p>Each phenomenon is highly suggestive considered alone, but 
each acquires still greater significance from its association with 
the other; for here in the oases we have an end and object for the 
existence of canals, and the most natural one in the world, namely, 
that the canals are constructed for the express purpose of 
fertilizing the oases.  Thus the mysterious rendezvousing of the 
canals at these special points is at once explicable.  The canals 
rendezvous so entirely in defiance of the doctrine of chances 
because they were constructed to that end.  They are not purely 
natural developments, but cases of assisted nature, just as they 
look to be at first sight.  This, at least, is the only explanation 
that fully accounts for the facts.  Of course all such evidence of 
design may be purely fortuitous, with about as much probability, as 
it has happily been put, as that a chance collection of numbers 
should take the form of the multiplication table. 
</p><p>In addition to this general dovetailing of detail to one 
conclusion is to be noticed the strangely economic character of 
both the canals and the oases in the matter of form.  That the 
lines should follow arcs of great circles, whatever their 
direction, is as unnatural from a natural standpoint as it would be 
natural from an artificial one; for the arc of a great circle is 
the shortest distance from one point upon the surface of a sphere 
to another.  It would, therefore, if topographically possible, be 
the course to take to conduct water, with the least expenditure of 
time or trouble, from the one to the other. 
</p><p>The circular shape of the oases is as directly economic as is 
the straightness of the canals; for the circle is the figure which 
incloses the maximum area for the minimum average distance from its 
centre to any point situated within it.  In consequence, if a 
certain amount of country were to be irrigated, intelligence would 
suggest the circular form in preference to all others, in order 
thus to cover the greatest space with the least labor.  In the case 
of the double canals, the same labor-saving intent would lead as 
instantly to a rounded rectangle. 
</p><p>Even more markedly unnatural is another phenomenon of this 
most phenomenal system, of which almost every one has heard, and 
which almost nobody has seen,&mdash;the double canals. 
</p><p>To see them, however, all that is needed is a sufficiently 
steady air, a sufficiently attentive observer, and the suitable 
season of the Martian year.  When these conditions are observed, 
the sight may be seen without difficulty, and is every whit as 
strange as Schiaparelli, who first saw it, has described it. 
</p><p>So far as the observer is concerned, what occurs is this: Upon 
a part of the disc where up to that time a single canal has been 
visible, of a sudden some night, in place of the single canal 
appear twin canals,&mdash;as like, indeed, as twins, if not more so, 
similar both in character and in inclination, running side by side 
the  
 
   <pb n="228"/>   
 
 whole length of the original canal, usually for upwards 
of a thousand miles, of the same size throughout, and absolutely 
parallel to each other.  The pair may best be likened to the twin 
rails of a railroad track.  The regularity of the thing is 
startling. 
</p><p>In good air the phenomenon is quite unmistakable.  The two 
lines are as distinct and as distinctly parallel as possible.  No 
draughtsman could draw them better.  They are thoroughly Martian in 
their mathematical precision.  At the very first glance, they 
convey, like all the other details of the canal system, the 
appearance of artificiality.  It may be well to state this here 
definitely, for the benefit of such as, without having seen the 
canals, indulge in criticism about them.  No one who has seen the 
canals well&mdash;and the well is all-important for bringing out the 
characteristics that give the stamp of artificiality, the 
straightness and fineness of the lines&mdash;would ever have any doubt 
as to their seeming artificial, however he might choose to blind 
himself to the consequences.  An element akin to the comic enters 
criticism based not upon what the critics have seen, but upon what 
they have not.  Books are reviewed without being read, to prevent 
prejudice; but it is rash to carry the same admirable broad-mindedness into scientific subjects. 
</p><p>In detail the doubles vary, chiefly, it would seem, in the 
distance the twin lines lie apart.  In the widest I have seen, the 
Ganges, six degrees separate the two; in the narrowest, the Phison, 
four degrees and a quarter,&mdash;not a very great difference between 
the extremes.  Four degrees and a quarter on Mars amount to 156 
miles; six degrees, to 220.  These, then, are the distances between 
the centres of the twin canals.  Each canal seems a little less 
than a degree wide, or about 30 miles in the narrower instances; in 
the broader, a little more than a degree, or about 45 miles.  
Between the two lines, in the cases where the gemination, as it is 
called, is complete, lies reddish-ochre ground similar to the rest 
of the surface of the bright regions.  Deducting the two half-widths of the bordering canals, we have, therefore, from 120 to 175 
miles of clear country between the paralleling lines. 
</p><p>The gemination of a canal is a phenomenon individual to the 
particular canal.  Each canal differs from its neighbor not only in 
the distance the lines lie apart, but in the time at which the 
duplication occurs.  The event seems to depend both upon general 
seasonal laws governing all the duplications, and upon causes 
intrinsic to the canal itself.  Within limits, each canal doubles 
at its own good time and after its own fashion.  For example, 
although it seems to be a rule that north and south canals double 
before east and west ones, nevertheless, of two north and south 
lines, one will double, the other will not, synchronously with a 
doubling running east and west; the same is true of those running 
at any other inclination. 
</p><p>Now this shows that the duplication is not an optical illusion 
at this end of the line; for, by any double refraction here, all 
the lines running in the same direction over the disc should be 
similarly affected, which they are not.  On the contrary, there 
will be, say, two cases of doubling in quite different directions 
co-existent with several single canals. 
</p><p>Nor is there any probability of its being a case of double 
refraction at the other end of the line,&mdash;that is, in the 
atmosphere of Mars; for in that case it is hard to see why all the 
lines should not be affected, to say nothing of the fact that, to 
render such double refraction possible, we must call upon a 
noumenon to help us out, as we know of no substance capable of the 
quality upon so huge a scale.  Furthermore, what is cogent to the 
observer, though of no particular weight with his hearers, the 
phenomenon has no look of double refraction.  It looks to be, what 
it undoubtedly is, a double existence.  
 
   <pb n="229"/>   
 
 
</p><p>Strengthening this conclusion is the mode of development of 
the doubling.  This appears to take place in two ways, although it 
is possible that the two are but different instances of one and the 
same process.  Of the first kind, during this last opposition, the 
Ganges was an example. 
</p><p>The Ganges was in an interesting protoplasmic condition during 
the whole of last summer.  About to multiply by fission, it was not 
at first evident how this would take place.  Hints of gemination 
were visible when I first looked at it in August.  It showed then 
as a very broad but not dark swath of dusky color, of nearly 
uniform width from one extremity to the other, with sides 
suggestively even throughout.  It is probable that they were then, 
as afterward, parallel, and that the slight convergence apparent at 
the bottom was due simply to foreshortening.  The swath ran thus N. 
N. W. all the way from the Gulf of the Dawn to the Lake of the 
Moon.  By moments of better seeing its two sides showed darker than 
its middle; that is, it was already double in embryo, with a dusky 
middle-ground between the twin lines. 
</p><p>In October the doubling had sensibly progressed.  The double 
visions were more frequent, and the ground between the twin lines 
had grown lighter.  By November the doubling was unmistakable, and 
the mid-clarification had become nearly complete.  It is to be 
remarked that the doubling did not involve the Fons Juventae and 
the canal leading to it, both of which lay well to the right of the 
Ganges.  The space included between the East and West Ganges was 
very wide, some six degrees.  The canals themselves were, so far as 
could be seen, quite similar, and about a degree, or 37 miles wide.  
Both started in the Gulf of the Dawn, and ran down to the lower 
Lake of the Moon, one entering each side of the lake, or oasis.  
Two thirds of the way down both similarly touched the sides of 
another oasis, an upper Lacus Lunae.  The whole length of each was 
1200 miles. 
</p><p>Except for fleeting suspicions of gemination, and for possible 
doublings like the parallelism of the Styx and the Hades, the next 
canal to show double was the Nectar, which was so seen by Mr. 
Douglass on October 4, and under still better seeing, a few minutes 
later, the doubling was detected by him extending straight across 
the Solis Lacus.  In the Solis Lacus this was evidently a case of 
mid-clarification.  What occurred in the Nectar seems more allied 
to the second class of manifestations, such as happened later with 
the Euphrates and the Phison. 
</p><p>Glimpses of a dual state in these canals were caught during 
the summer and autumn, but it was not till the November 
presentation of the region that they came unmistakably twinned.  On 
the 18th of that month, just as the twilight was fading away, the 
air being very still and the definition exceptional, so soon as the 
sunset tremors subsided, the Euphrates and its neighbor the Phison 
showed beautifully doubled, exactly like two great railroad tracks 
with bright ground between, each set extending down the disc for a 
distance of 1600 miles. 
</p><p>After that evening, whenever the seeing was good enough, they 
continued to present the same appearance.  Now with them no process 
of midway clarification, such as had taken place in the Ganges, had 
previously made itself manifest.  They had indeed not been very 
well defined before duplication occurred, but apparently 
sufficiently so not to hide such broadening had it taken place; for 
though the twin canals were not as far apart as the two Ganges, 
they were quite comparably distant, being, instead of six, about 
four and a quarter degrees from each other.  Evidently, the process 
was, in the case of the Euphrates at least, under way in October, 
and even earlier, but was not well seen because the twin canals 
were not yet dark enough. 
</p><p>There seem, I may remark parentheti- 
   <pb n="230"/>   
 
cally, to be two 
other double canals in the region between the Syrtis Major and the 
Sabaeus Sinus, one to the east of the Phison, and another between 
the Phison and the Euphrates, both debouching at the same points as 
the Phison and the Euphrates themselves. 
</p><p>On the 19th of November I suspected duplication in the Typhon, 
another canal in the same region.  It looked to be double, with 
dusky ground between. 
</p><p>On the 21st I similarly suspected the Jamuna and the 
Nilokeras.  Both looked broad and dusky, with very ill-defined 
condensation at the sides.  But the seeing was not superlative.  On 
the 22d I brought my observations to an end, in consequence of 
having to return East. 
</p><p>Exactly what takes place, therefore, in this curious process 
of doubling I cannot pretend to say.  It has been suggested that a 
progressive ripening of vegetation from the centre to the edges 
might cause a broad swath of green to become seemingly two.  There 
are facts, however, that do not tally with this view.  For example, 
the Ganges was always broad, but fainter, not narrower, earlier in 
the season.  The Phison, on the other hand, went through no such 
process.  Indeed, we are here very much in the dark, certainly very 
far off from what does take place in Martian canal gemination.  
Perhaps we may learn considerably more about it at the next 
opposition.  At this the tendril end of our knowledge of our 
neighbor we cannot expect hard wood. 
</p><p>To return now from these outposts of investigation to our main 
subject matter.  We have seen what shows at one end of the canals, 
their inner end, namely, the oases.  But it seems that there is 
also something exceptional at the other.  At the mouth of each 
canal, at the edge of the so-called seas, appears a curious dark 
spot of the form of a half-filled angle; the sort of a mark with 
which one checks items on a list.  Its form is singularly 
appropriate, according to mundane ideas, for it appears before the 
canal itself is visible, as if to mark the spot where the canal 
will eventually be.  It lies in the so-called seas, and looks to be 
of the same color as they, but deeper in tint. 
</p><p>All the canals that debouch into the dark regions are provided 
with these terminal triangles, except those that lead out of long 
estuaries, like the Nilosyrtis, the Hiddekel, the Gehon, and so 
forth.  The double canals are provided with twin triangles.  That 
the triangular patches are phenomena connected with the canals is 
evident from the fact that they never appear elsewhere.  What exact 
purpose they serve is not so clear, but it would seem to be that of 
reservoirs or relay stations for the water before it enters the 
canals; what we see, upon this supposition, being not the station 
or reservoir itself, but the specially fertile area round it. 
</p><p>That, in addition to being in a way oases themselves, they 
serve some such purpose as the above is further hinted at by two 
facts: first, that whereas the oases develop, apparently, after the 
canals leading to them, the triangular spots develop before the 
canals that lead out of them; second, Mr. Douglass finds that it is 
in them that the canals in the dark regions terminate.  They are 
the end of the one system at the same time that they are the 
beginning of the other.  They would, therefore, seem to be 
waystations of some sort on the road taken by the water from the 
polar cap to the equator. 
</p><p>Paralleling in appearance the oases in the bright regions are 
round spots that occur at the junctions of the canals in the dark 
ones.  Speaking figuratively, these are the heads of the nails in 
the coffin of the idea that the seas are seas; since, if the blue-green color came from water, there could not be permanent darker 
dots upon it connected by equally dark streaks.  Speaking 
unfiguratively, this shows that the whole system of canals and 
specially fertilized spots is not confined to the deserts, but 
extends in a  
 
   <pb n="231"/>   
 
 modified form over the areas of more or less 
vegetation. 
</p><p>One of these specially fertile spots, situated upon the 
borderland betwixt the dark and the light regions, has a 
picturesque history.  It lies at the head of the Margaritifer 
Sinus, or Pearl-Bearing Gulf, so named some years ago by 
Schiaparelli; the name having been given by him to the gulf quite 
fortuitously.  But it turns out that the gulf was prophetically 
named, for there in it is this round spot which makes terminus to 
a short canal connecting it with the lower end of the western 
Sabaeus Sinus, and probably also terminus to a long canal coming 
from the Chrysorrhoas, across both branches of the Ganges.  Diving 
into the depths of space has thus brought up the pearl from the 
bottom of the gulf. 
</p><p>We thus perceive that the blue-green areas are subjected to 
the same engineering system as the bright ones.  In short, no part 
of the planet is allowed to escape from the all-pervasive 
trigonometric spirit.  If this be Nature's doing, she certainly 
runs her mathematics into the ground. 
 
</p><p>To review, now, the chain of reasoning by which we have been 
led to regard it probable that upon the surface of Mars we see the 
effects of local intelligence: we find, in the first place, that 
the broad physical conditions of the planet are not antagonistic to 
some form of life; secondly, that there is an apparent dearth of 
water upon the planet's surface, and therefore, if beings of 
sufficient intelligence inhabited it, they would have to resort to 
irrigation to support life; thirdly, that there turns out to be a 
network of markings covering the disc precisely counterparting what 
a system of irrigation would look like; and, lastly, that there is 
a set of spots placed where we should expect to find the lands thus 
artificially fertilized, and behaving as such constructed oases 
should.  All this, of course, may be a set of coincidences, 
signifying nothing; but the probability seems the other way.  As to 
details of explanation, any we may adopt will undoubtedly be found, 
on closer acquaintance, to vary from the actual Martian state of 
things; for any Martian life must differ markedly from our own. 
</p><p>The fundamental fact in the matter is the dearth of water.  If 
we keep this in mind, we shall see that many of the objections that 
spontaneously arise answer themselves.  The supposed Herculean task 
of constructing such canals disappears at once; for if the canals 
be dug for irrigation purposes, it is evident that what we see and 
call, by ellipsis, the canal is not really the canal at all, but 
the strip of fertilized land bordering it,&mdash;the thread of water in 
the midst of it, the canal itself, being far too small to be 
perceptible.  In the case of an irrigation canal seen at a 
distance, it is always the strip of verdure, not the canal, that is 
visible, as we see in looking from afar upon irrigated country on 
the earth. 
</p><p>Startling as the outcome of these observations may appear at 
first, in truth there is nothing startling about it whatever.  Such 
possibility has been quite on the cards ever since the existence of 
Mars itself was recognized by the Chaldean shepherds, or whoever 
the still more primeval astronomers may have been.  Its strangeness 
is a purely subjective phenomenon, arising from the instinctive 
reluctance of man to admit the possibility of peers.  Such would be 
comic were it not the inevitable consequence of the constitution of 
the universe.  To be shy of anything resembling himself is part and 
parcel of man's own individuality.  Like the savage who fears 
nothing so much as a strange man, like Crusoe who grows pale at the 
sight of footprints not his own, the civilized thinker 
instinctively turns from the thought of mind other than the one he 
himself knows.  To admit into his conception of the cosmos other 
finite minds as factors has in it something of the weird.  Any 
hypothesis to explain the  
 
   <pb n="232"/>   
 
 facts, no matter how improbable 
or even palpably absurd it be, is better than this.  Snowcaps of 
solid carbonic acid gas, a planet cracked in a positively 
monomaniacal manner, meteors ploughing tracks across its surface 
with such mathematical precision that they must have been educated 
to the performance, and so forth and so on, in hypotheses each more 
astounding than its predecessor, commend themselves to man, if only 
by such means he may escape the admission of anything approaching 
his kind.  Surely all this is puerile, and should be outgrown as 
speedily as possible.  It is simply an instinct like any other, the 
projection of the instinct of self-preservation.  We ought, 
therefore, to rise above it, and, where probably points to other 
things, boldly accept the fact provisionally, as we should the 
presence of oxygen, or iron, or anything else.  Let us not cheat 
ourselves with words.  Conservatism sounds finely, and covers any 
amount of ignorance and fear. 
</p><p>We must be just as careful not to run to the other extreme, 
and draw deductions of purely local outgrowth.  To talk of Martian 
beings is not to mean Martian men.  Just as the probabilities point 
to the one, so do they point away from the other.  Even on this 
earth man is of the nature of an accident.  He is the survival of 
by no means the highest physical organism.  He is not even a high 
form of mammal.  Mind has been his making.  For aught we can see, 
some lizard or batrachian might just as well have popped into his 
place in the race, and been now the dominant creature of this 
earth.  Under different physical circumstances he would have been 
certain to do so.  Amid the physical surroundings that exist on 
Mars, we may be practically sure other organisms have been evolved 
which would strike us as exquisitely grotesque.  What manner of 
beings they may be we have no data to conceive. 
</p><p>How diverse, however, they doubtless are from us will appear 
from such definite deduction as we are able to make from the 
physical differences between Mars and our earth.  For example, the 
mere difference of gravity on the surface of the two planets is 
much more far-reaching in its effects than might at first be 
thought.  Gravity on the surface of Mars is only a little more than 
one third what it is on the surface of the earth.  This would work 
in two ways to very different conditions of existence from those to 
which we are accustomed.  To begin with, three times as much work, 
as for example in digging a canal, could be done by the same 
expenditure of muscular force.  If we were transported to Mars, we 
should be pleasingly surprised to find all our manual labor 
suddenly lightened threefold.  But, indirectly, there might result 
a yet greater gain to our capabilities; for if Nature chose, she 
could afford there to build her inhabitants on three times the 
scale she does on earth, without their ever finding it out except 
by interplanetary comparison. 
</p><p>As we all know, a very large man is much more unwieldy than a 
very small one.  An elephant refuses to hop like a flea; not 
because he considers it undignified to do so, but simply because he 
cannot take the step.  If we could, we should all jump straight 
across the street, instead of painfully paddling through the mud.  
Our inability to do so depends partly on the size of the earth, and 
partly on the size of our own bodies, but not at all on what it at 
first seems entirely to depend on, the size of the street. 
</p><p>To see this, let us consider the very simplest case, that of 
standing erect.  To this every-day feat opposes itself the weight 
of the body simply, a thing of three dimensions, height, breadth, 
and thickness, while the ability to accomplish it resides in the 
cross-section of the muscles of the knee, a thing of only two 
dimensions, breadth and thickness.  Consequently, a person half as 
large again as another has about twice the supporting capacity of 
that other, but about three times as much to support.  Standing  
 
 
   <pb n="233"/>   
 
 therefore tires him out more quickly.  If his size were to go 
on increasing, he would at last reach a stature at which he would 
no longer be able to stand at all, but would have to lie down.  You 
shall see the same effect in quite inanimate objects.  Take two 
cylinders of paraffine wax, one made into an ordinary candle, the 
other into a gigantic facsimile of one, and then stand both upon 
their bases.  To the small one nothing happens.  The big one, 
however, begins to settle, the base actually made viscous by the 
pressure of the weight above. 
</p><p>Now apply this principle to a possible inhabitant of Mars, and 
suppose him to be constructed three times as large as a human being 
in every dimension.  If he were on earth, he would weigh twenty-seven times as much as the human being, but on the surface of Mars, 
since gravity there is only about one third of what it is here, he 
would weigh but nine times as much.  The cross-section of his 
muscles would be nine times as great.  Therefore the ratio of his 
supporting power to the weight he must support would be the same as 
ours.  Consequently, he would be able to stand with no more fatigue 
than we experience.  Now consider the work he might be able to do.  
His muscles, having length, breadth, and thickness, would all be 
twenty-seven times as effective as ours.  He would prove twenty-seven times as strong as we, and could accomplish twenty-seven 
times as much.  But he would further work upon what required, owing 
to decreased gravity, but one third the effort to overcome.  His 
effective force, therefore, would be eighty-one times as great as 
man's, whether in digging canals or in other bodily occupation.  As 
gravity on the surface of Mars is really a little more than one 
third that at the surface of the earth, the true ratio is not 
eighty-one, but about fifty; that is, a Martian would be, 
physically, fifty-fold more efficient than a man. 
</p><p>As the reader will observe, there is nothing problematical 
about this deduction whatever.  It expresses an abstract ratio of 
physical capabilities which must exist between the two planets, 
quite irrespective of whether there be denizens on either, or how 
other conditions may further affect their forms. 
</p><p>Something more we may deduce about the characteristics of 
possible Martians, dependent upon Mars itself, a result of the age 
of the world they would live in. 
</p><p>A planet may in a very real sense be said to have a life of 
its own, of which what we call life may or may not be a detail.  It 
is born, has its fiery youth, its sober middle age, its palsied 
senility, and ends at last in cold incapability of further change, 
its death.  The speed with which it runs through its gamut of 
change depends upon its size; for the larger the body, the longer 
it takes to cool, and with it loss of heat means loss of life.  It 
takes longer to cool because, as we saw in a previous paper, it has 
relatively more inside than outside, and it is through its outside 
that its inside cools.  Now, inasmuch as time and space are not, as 
some philosophers have from their too mundane standpoint supposed, 
forms of our intellect, but essential attributes of the universe, 
the time taken by any process affects the character of the process 
itself, as does also the size of the body undergoing it.  The 
changes brought about in a large planet by its cooling are not, 
therefore, the same as those brought about in a small one.  
Physically, chemically, and, to our present end, organically, the 
two results are quite diverse.  So different, indeed, are they that 
unless the planet have at least a certain size it will never 
produce what we call life, meaning our particular chain of changes 
or closely allied forms of it, at all.  As we saw in the case of 
atmosphere, it will lack even the premise to such conclusion. 
</p><p>Whatever the particular planet's line of development, however, 
in its own line it proceeds to greater and greater degrees of 
evolution, till the process is arrested by the planet's death, as 
above  
 
   <pb n="234"/>   
 
 described.  The point of development attained is, as 
regards its capabilities, precisely measured by the planet's own 
age, since the one is but a symptom of the other. 
</p><p>Now, in the special case of Mars, we have before us the 
spectacle of an old world, a world well on in years, a world much 
older relatively than the earth, halfway between it and the end we 
see so sadly typified by our moon, a body now practically past 
possibility of change.  To so much about his age Mars bears 
evidence on his face.  He shows unmistakable signs of being old.  
What we know would follow advancing planetary years is legible 
there.  His continents are all smoothed down; his oceans have all 
dried up.  If he ever had a <hi rend="italic">jeunesse orageuse</hi>, it has long 
since been forgotten.  Although called after the turbulent of the 
gods, he is, and probably always has been, one of the most peaceful 
of the heavenly bodies.  His name is a sad misnomer; indeed, the 
ancients seem to have been singularly unfortunate in their choice 
of planetary cognomens.  With Mars so peaceful, Jupiter so young, 
and Venus bashfully dropped in cloud, the planets' names accord but 
ill with their temperaments. 
</p><p>Mars being thus old himself, we know that evolution on his 
surface must be similarly advanced.  This only informs us of its 
condition relative to the planet's capabilities.  Of its actual 
state our data are not definite enough to furnish much deduction.  
But from the fact that our own development has been comparatively 
a recent thing, and that a long time would be needed to bring even 
Mars to his present geological condition, we may judge any life he 
may support to be not only relatively, but really, more advanced 
than our own. 
</p><p>From the little we can see, such appears to be the case.  The 
evidence of handicraft, if such it be, points to a highly 
intelligent mind behind it.  Irrigation, unscientifically 
conducted, would not give us such truly wonderful mathematical 
fitness in the several parts to the whole as we there behold.  A 
mind of no mean order would seem to have presided over the system 
we see,&mdash;a mind certainly of considerably more comprehensiveness 
than that which presides over the various departments of our own 
public works.  Party politics, at all events, have had no part in 
them; for the system is planet wide.  Quite possibly, such Martian 
folk are possessed of inventions of which we have not dreamed, and 
with them electrophones and kinetoscopes are things of a bygone 
past, preserved with veneration in museums as relics of the clumsy 
contrivances of the simple childhood of their kind.  Certainly, 
what we see hints at the existence of beings who are in advance of, 
not behind us, in the race of life. 
</p><p>For answers to such problems we must look to the future.  That 
Mars seems to be inhabited is not the last, but the first word on 
the subject.  More important than the mere fact of the existence of 
living beings there is the question of what they may be like.  
Whether we ourselves shall live to learn this cannot, of course, be 
foretold.  One thing, however, we can do, and that speedily: look 
at things from a standpoint raised above our local point of view; 
free our minds at least from the shackles that of necessity tether 
our bodies; recognize the possibility of others in the same light 
that we do the certainty of ourselves.  That we are the sum and 
substance of the capabilities of the cosmos is something so 
preposterous as to be exquisitely comic.  We pride ourselves upon 
being men of the world, forgetting that this is but objectionable 
singularity, unless we are in some wise men of more worlds than 
one.  For after all, we are but a link in a chain.  Man is merely 
this earth's highest production up to date.  That he in any sense 
gauges the possibilities of the universe is humorous.  He does not, 
as we can easily foresee, even gauge those  
 
   <pb n="235"/>   
 
 of this planet.  
He has been steadily bettering from an immemorial past, and will 
apparently continue to improve through an incalculable future.  
Still less does he gauge the universe about him.  He merely 
typifies in an imperfect way what is going on elsewhere, and what, 
to a mathematical certainty, is in some corners of the cosmos 
indefinitely excelled. 
</p><p>If astronomy teaches anything, it teaches that man is but a 
detail in the evolution of the universe, and that resemblant though 
diverse details are inevitably to be expected in the host of orbs 
around him.  He learns that though he will probably never find his 
double anywhere, he is destined to discover any number of cousins 
scattered through space.</p>
