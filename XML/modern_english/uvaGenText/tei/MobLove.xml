</p><p><stage>Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE	and DUMAIN</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,<lb/>
Live register'd upon our brazen tombs<lb/>
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;<lb/>
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,<lb/>
The endeavor of this present breath may buy<lb/>
That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge<lb/>
And make us heirs of all eternity.<lb/>
Therefore, brave conquerors,&mdash;for so you are,<lb/>
That war against your own affections<lb/>
And the huge army of the world's desires,&mdash;<lb/>
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:<lb/>
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;<lb/>
Our court shall be a little Academe,<lb/>
Still and contemplative in living art.<lb/>
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,<lb/>
Have sworn for three years' term to live with me<lb/>
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes<lb/>
That are recorded in this schedule here:<lb/>
Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,<lb/>
That his own hand may strike his honour down<lb/>
That violates the smallest branch herein:<lb/>
If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,<lb/>
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:<lb/>
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:<lb/>
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits<lb/>
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:<lb/>
The grosser manner of these world's delights<lb/>
He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:<lb/>
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;<lb/>
With all these living in philosophy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>I can but say their protestation over;<lb/>
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,<lb/>
That is, to live and study here three years.<lb/>
But there are other strict observances;<lb/>
As, not to see a woman in that term,<lb/>
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;<lb/>
And one day in a week to touch no food<lb/>
And but one meal on every day beside,<lb/>
The which I hope is not enrolled there;<lb/>
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,<lb/>
And not be seen to wink of all the day&mdash;<lb/>
When I was wont to think no harm all night<lb/>
And make a dark night too of half the day&mdash;<lb/>
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:<lb/>
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,<lb/>
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:<lb/>
I only swore to study with your grace<lb/>
And stay here in your court for three years' space.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.<lb/>
What is the end of study? let me know.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Why, that to know, which else we should not know.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Come on, then; I will swear to study so,<lb/>
To know the thing I am forbid to know:<lb/>
As thus,&mdash;to study where I well may dine,<lb/>
When I to feast expressly am forbid;<lb/>
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,<lb/>
When mistresses from common sense are hid;<lb/>
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,<lb/>
Study to break it and not break my troth.<lb/>
If study's gain be thus and this be so,<lb/>
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:<lb/>
Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>These be the stops that hinder study quite<lb/>
And train our intellects to vain delight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,<lb/>
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:<lb/>
As, painfully to pore upon a book<lb/>
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while<lb/>
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:<lb/>
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:<lb/>
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,<lb/>
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.<lb/>
Study me how to please the eye indeed<lb/>
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,<lb/>
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed<lb/>
And give him light that it was blinded by.<lb/>
Study is like the heaven's glorious sun<lb/>
That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:<lb/>
Small have continual plodders ever won<lb/>
Save base authority from others' books<lb/>
These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights<lb/>
That give a name to every fixed star<lb/>
Have no more profit of their shining nights<lb/>
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.<lb/>
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;<lb/>
And every godfather can give a name.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>How well he's read, to reason against reading!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>How follows that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Fit in his place and time.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>In reason nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Something then in rhyme.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,<lb/>
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast<lb/>
Before the birds have any cause to sing?<lb/>
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?<lb/>
At Christmas I no more desire a rose<lb/>
Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;<lb/>
But like of each thing that in season grows.<lb/>
So you, to study now it is too late,<lb/>
Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:<lb/>
And though I have for barbarism spoke more<lb/>
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,<lb/>
Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore<lb/>
And bide the penance of each three years' day.<lb/>
Give me the paper; let me read the same;<lb/>
And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'Item, That no woman shall come within a<lb/>
mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Four days ago.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Let's see the penalty.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Marry, that did I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Sweet lord, and why?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>To fright them hence with that dread penalty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>A dangerous law against gentility!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman<lb/>
within the term of three years, he shall endure such<lb/>
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'<lb/>
This article, my liege, yourself must break;<lb/>
For well you know here comes in embassy<lb/>
The French king's daughter with yourself to speak&mdash;<lb/>
A maid of grace and complete majesty&mdash;<lb/>
About surrender up of Aquitaine<lb/>
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:<lb/>
Therefore this article is made in vain,<lb/>
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>So study evermore is overshot:<lb/>
While it doth study to have what it would<lb/>
It doth forget to do the thing it should,<lb/>
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,<lb/>
'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>We must of force dispense with this decree;<lb/>
She must lie here on mere necessity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Necessity will make us all forsworn<lb/>
Three thousand times within this three years' space;<lb/>
For every man with his affects is born,<lb/>
Not by might master'd but by special grace:<lb/>
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;<lb/>
I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'<lb/>
So to the laws at large I write my name:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Subscribes</stage></p>


<p>
And he that breaks them in the least degree<lb/>
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:<lb/>
Suggestions are to other as to me;<lb/>
But I believe, although I seem so loath,<lb/>
I am the last that will last keep his oath.<lb/>
But is there no quick recreation granted?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted<lb/>
With a refined traveller of Spain;<lb/>
A man in all the world's new fashion planted,<lb/>
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;<lb/>
One whom the music of his own vain tongue<lb/>
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;<lb/>
A man of complements, whom right and wrong<lb/>
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:<lb/>
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,<lb/>
For interim to our studies shall relate<lb/>
In high-born words the worth of many a knight<lb/>
From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.<lb/>
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;<lb/>
But, I protest, I love to hear him lie<lb/>
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Armado is a most illustrious wight,<lb/>
A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;<lb/>
And so to study, three years is but short.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>Which is the duke's own person?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>This, fellow: what wouldst?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his<lb/>
grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person<lb/>
in flesh and blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>This is he.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>Signior Arme&mdash;Arme&mdash;commends you. There's villany<lb/>
abroad: this letter will tell you more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>A letter from the magnificent Armado.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>To hear? or forbear laughing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to<lb/>
forbear both.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to<lb/>
climb in the merriness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.<lb/>
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>In what manner?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>In manner and form following, sir; all those three:<lb/>
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with<lb/>
her upon the form, and taken following her into the<lb/>
park; which, put together, is in manner and form<lb/>
following. Now, sir, for the manner,&mdash;it is the<lb/>
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,&mdash;<lb/>
in some form.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>For the following, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend<lb/>
the right!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Will you hear this letter with attention?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>As we would hear an oracle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and<lb/>
sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,<lb/>
and body's fostering patron.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Not a word of Costard yet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'So it is,'&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in<lb/>
telling true, but so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Peace!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Be to me and every man that dares not fight!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>No words!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured<lb/>
melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour<lb/>
to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving<lb/>
air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to<lb/>
walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when<lb/>
beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down<lb/>
to that nourishment which is called supper: so much<lb/>
for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,<lb/>
I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then<lb/>
for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter<lb/>
that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth<lb/>
from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which<lb/>
here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;<lb/>
but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east<lb/>
and by east from the west corner of thy curious-<lb/>
knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited<lb/>
swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>This is not so well as I looked for, but the best<lb/>
that ever I heard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say<lb/>
you to this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Sir, I confess the wench.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Did you hear the proclamation?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I do confess much of the hearing it but little of<lb/>
the marking of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken<lb/>
with a wench.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>This maid will not serve your turn, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>This maid will serve my turn, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast<lb/>
a week with bran and water.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>And Don Armado shall be your keeper.<lb/>
My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:<lb/>
And go we, lords, to put in practise that<lb/>
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,<lb/>
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.<lb/>
Sirrah, come on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was<lb/>
taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true<lb/>
girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of<lb/>
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and<lb/>
till then, sit thee down, sorrow!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit<lb/>
grows melancholy?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>No, no; O Lord, sir, no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my<lb/>
tender juvenal?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Why tough senior? why tough senior?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton<lb/>
appertaining to thy young days, which we may<lb/>
nominate tender.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your<lb/>
old time, which we may name tough.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Pretty and apt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or<lb/>
I apt, and my saying pretty?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Thou pretty, because little.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>And therefore apt, because quick.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Speak you this in my praise, master?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>In thy condign praise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>I will praise an eel with the same praise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>What, that an eel is ingenious?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>That an eel is quick.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>I am answered, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I love not to be crossed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I have promised to study three years with the duke.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>You may do it in an hour, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Impossible.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>How many is one thrice told?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I confess both: they are both the varnish of a<lb/>
complete man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of<lb/>
deuce-ace amounts to.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>It doth amount to one more than two.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Which the base vulgar do call three.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>True.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here<lb/>
is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how<lb/>
easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and<lb/>
study three years in two words, the dancing horse<lb/>
will tell you.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>A most fine figure!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>To prove you a cipher.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is<lb/>
base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a<lb/>
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour<lb/>
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate<lb/>
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and<lb/>
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised<lb/>
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should<lb/>
outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men<lb/>
have been in love?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Hercules, master.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name<lb/>
more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good<lb/>
repute and carriage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great<lb/>
carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back<lb/>
like a porter: and he was in love.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do<lb/>
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in<lb/>
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's<lb/>
love, my dear Moth?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>A woman, master.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Of what complexion?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Tell me precisely of what complexion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Of the sea-water green, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Is that one of the four complexions?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a<lb/>
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason<lb/>
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>My love is most immaculate white and red.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under<lb/>
such colours.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Define, define, well-educated infant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and<lb/>
pathetical!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>If she be made of white and red,<lb/>
Her faults will ne'er be known,<lb/>
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred<lb/>
And fears by pale white shown:<lb/>
Then if she fear, or be to blame,<lb/>
By this you shall not know,<lb/>
For still her cheeks possess the same<lb/>
Which native she doth owe.<lb/>
A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of<lb/>
white and red.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>The world was very guilty of such a ballad some<lb/>
three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be<lb/>
found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for<lb/>
the writing nor the tune.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may<lb/>
example my digression by some mighty precedent.<lb/>
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the<lb/>
park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  To be whipped; and yet a better love than<lb/>
my master.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I say, sing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Forbear till this company be past.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard<lb/>
safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight<lb/>
nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.<lb/>
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she<lb/>
is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUENETTA</speaker>
<p>Man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I will visit thee at the lodge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUENETTA</speaker>
<p>That's hereby.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I know where it is situate.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUENETTA</speaker>
<p>Lord, how wise you are!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I will tell thee wonders.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUENETTA</speaker>
<p>With that face?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I love thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUENETTA</speaker>
<p>So I heard you say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>And so, farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUENETTA</speaker>
<p>Fair weather after you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>Come, Jaquenetta, away!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou<lb/>
be pardoned.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a<lb/>
full stomach.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt be heavily punished.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they<lb/>
are but lightly rewarded.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Take away this villain; shut him up.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Come, you transgressing slave; away!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation<lb/>
that I have seen, some shall see.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>What shall some see?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.<lb/>
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their<lb/>
words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank<lb/>
God I have as little patience as another man; and<lb/>
therefore I can be quiet.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I do affect the very ground, which is base, where<lb/>
her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which<lb/>
is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which<lb/>
is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And<lb/>
how can that be true love which is falsely<lb/>
attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:<lb/>
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so<lb/>
tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was<lb/>
Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.<lb/>
Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;<lb/>
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.<lb/>
The first and second cause will not serve my turn;<lb/>
the passado he respects not, the duello he regards<lb/>
not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his<lb/>
glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!<lb/>
be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,<lb/>
he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,<lb/>
for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;<lb/>
write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA,	KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:<lb/>
Consider who the king your father sends,<lb/>
To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:<lb/>
Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,<lb/>
To parley with the sole inheritor<lb/>
Of all perfections that a man may owe,<lb/>
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight<lb/>
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.<lb/>
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace<lb/>
As Nature was in making graces dear<lb/>
When she did starve the general world beside<lb/>
And prodigally gave them all to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,<lb/>
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:<lb/>
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,<lb/>
Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:<lb/>
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth<lb/>
Than you much willing to be counted wise<lb/>
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.<lb/>
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,<lb/>
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame<lb/>
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,<lb/>
Till painful study shall outwear three years,<lb/>
No woman may approach his silent court:<lb/>
Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,<lb/>
Before we enter his forbidden gates,<lb/>
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,<lb/>
Bold of your worthiness, we single you<lb/>
As our best-moving fair solicitor.<lb/>
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,<lb/>
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,<lb/>
Importunes personal conference with his grace:<lb/>
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,<lb/>
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Proud of employment, willingly I go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit BOYET</stage></p>


<p>
Who are the votaries, my loving lords,<lb/>
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Lord Longaville is one.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Know you the man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,<lb/>
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir<lb/>
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized<lb/>
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:<lb/>
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;<lb/>
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:<lb/>
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.<lb/>
The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,<lb/>
If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,<lb/>
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;<lb/>
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills<lb/>
It should none spare that come within his power.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>They say so most that most his humours know.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.<lb/>
Who are the rest?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,<lb/>
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:<lb/>
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;<lb/>
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,<lb/>
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.<lb/>
I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;<lb/>
And much too little of that good I saw<lb/>
Is my report to his great worthiness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Another of these students at that time<lb/>
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.<lb/>
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,<lb/>
Within the limit of becoming mirth,<lb/>
I never spent an hour's talk withal:<lb/>
His eye begets occasion for his wit;<lb/>
For every object that the one doth catch<lb/>
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,<lb/>
Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,<lb/>
Delivers in such apt and gracious words<lb/>
That aged ears play truant at his tales<lb/>
And younger hearings are quite ravished;<lb/>
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>God bless my ladies! are they all in love,<lb/>
That every one her own hath garnished<lb/>
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Here comes Boyet.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter BOYET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Now, what admittance, lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Navarre had notice of your fair approach;<lb/>
And he and his competitors in oath<lb/>
Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,<lb/>
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:<lb/>
He rather means to lodge you in the field,<lb/>
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,<lb/>
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,<lb/>
To let you enter his unpeopled house.<lb/>
Here comes Navarre.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and	Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have<lb/>
not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be<lb/>
yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,<lb/>
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.<lb/>
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:<lb/>
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,<lb/>
And sin to break it.<lb/>
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:<lb/>
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.<lb/>
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,<lb/>
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>You will the sooner, that I were away;<lb/>
For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>I know you did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>How needless was it then to ask the question!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>You must not be so quick.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Not till it leave the rider in the mire.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>What time o' day?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>The hour that fools should ask.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Now fair befall your mask!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Fair fall the face it covers!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>And send you many lovers!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Amen, so you be none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Nay, then will I be gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Madam, your father here doth intimate<lb/>
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;<lb/>
Being but the one half of an entire sum<lb/>
Disbursed by my father in his wars.<lb/>
But say that he or we, as neither have,<lb/>
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid<lb/>
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,<lb/>
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,<lb/>
Although not valued to the money's worth.<lb/>
If then the king your father will restore<lb/>
But that one half which is unsatisfied,<lb/>
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,<lb/>
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.<lb/>
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,<lb/>
For here he doth demand to have repaid<lb/>
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,<lb/>
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,<lb/>
To have his title live in Aquitaine;<lb/>
Which we much rather had depart withal<lb/>
And have the money by our father lent<lb/>
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.<lb/>
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far<lb/>
From reason's yielding, your fair self should make<lb/>
A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast<lb/>
And go well satisfied to France again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>You do the king my father too much wrong<lb/>
And wrong the reputation of your name,<lb/>
In so unseeming to confess receipt<lb/>
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>I do protest I never heard of it;<lb/>
And if you prove it, I'll repay it back<lb/>
Or yield up Aquitaine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>We arrest your word.<lb/>
Boyet, you can produce acquittances<lb/>
For such a sum from special officers<lb/>
Of Charles his father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Satisfy me so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>So please your grace, the packet is not come<lb/>
Where that and other specialties are bound:<lb/>
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>It shall suffice me: at which interview<lb/>
All liberal reason I will yield unto.<lb/>
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand<lb/>
As honour without breach of honour may<lb/>
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:<lb/>
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;<lb/>
But here without you shall be so received<lb/>
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,<lb/>
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.<lb/>
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:<lb/>
To-morrow shall we visit you again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!<lb/>

<p>Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.<lb/>

<p>Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>I would you heard it groan.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Is the fool sick?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Sick at the heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Alack, let it blood.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Would that do it good?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>My physic says 'ay.'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Will you prick't with your eye?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>No point, with my knife.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Pray you, sir, whose daughter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Her mother's, I have heard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>God's blessing on your beard!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Good sir, be not offended.<lb/>
She is an heir of Falconbridge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Nay, my choler is ended.<lb/>
She is a most sweet lady.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Not unlike, sir, that may be.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>What's her name in the cap?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Rosaline, by good hap.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Is she wedded or no?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>To her will, sir, or so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:<lb/>
Not a word with him but a jest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>And every jest but a word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>It was well done of you to take him at his word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>Two hot sheeps, marry.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>And wherefore not ships?<lb/>
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>So you grant pasture for me.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Offering to kiss her</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>Not so, gentle beast:<lb/>
My lips are no common, though several they be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Belonging to whom?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>To my fortunes and me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:<lb/>
This civil war of wits were much better used<lb/>
On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>If my observation, which very seldom lies,<lb/>
By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,<lb/>
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>With what?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>With that which we lovers entitle affected.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Your reason?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Why, all his behaviors did make their retire<lb/>
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:<lb/>
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,<lb/>
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:<lb/>
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,<lb/>
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;<lb/>
All senses to that sense did make their repair,<lb/>
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:<lb/>
Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,<lb/>
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;<lb/>
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,<lb/>
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:<lb/>
His face's own margent did quote such amazes<lb/>
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.<lb/>
I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,<lb/>
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>But to speak that in words which his eye hath<lb/>
disclosed.<lb/>
I only have made a mouth of his eye,<lb/>
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Do you hear, my mad wenches?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>What then, do you see?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Ay, our way to be gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>

</p><p><stage>Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Concolinel.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Singing</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,<lb/>
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately<lb/>
hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>How meanest thou? brawling in French?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at<lb/>
the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour<lb/>
it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and<lb/>
sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you<lb/>
swallowed love with singing love, sometime through<lb/>
the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling<lb/>
love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of<lb/>
your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly<lb/>
doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in<lb/>
your pocket like a man after the old painting; and<lb/>
keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.<lb/>
These are complements, these are humours; these<lb/>
betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without<lb/>
these; and make them men of note&mdash;do you note<lb/>
me?&mdash;that most are affected to these.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>How hast thou purchased this experience?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>By my penny of observation.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>But O,&mdash;but O,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>'The hobby-horse is forgot.'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your<lb/>
love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Almost I had.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Negligent student! learn her by heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>By heart and in heart, boy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>What wilt thou prove?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon<lb/>
the instant: by heart you love her, because your<lb/>
heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,<lb/>
because your heart is in love with her; and out of<lb/>
heart you love her, being out of heart that you<lb/>
cannot enjoy her.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I am all these three.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>And three times as much more, and yet nothing at<lb/>
all.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador<lb/>
for an ass.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha! what sayest thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,<lb/>
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>The way is but short: away!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>As swift as lead, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>The meaning, pretty ingenious?<lb/>
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I say lead is slow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>You are too swift, sir, to say so:<lb/>
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Sweet smoke of rhetoric!<lb/>
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:<lb/>
I shoot thee at the swain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Thump then and I flee.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!<lb/>
By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:<lb/>
Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.<lb/>
My herald is return'd.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the<lb/>
mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no<lb/>
l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly<lb/>
thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes<lb/>
me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!<lb/>
Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and<lb/>
the word l'envoy for a salve?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain<lb/>
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.<lb/>
I will example it:<lb/>
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,<lb/>
Were still at odds, being but three.<lb/>
There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,<lb/>
Were still at odds, being but three.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Until the goose came out of door,<lb/>
And stay'd the odds by adding four.<lb/>
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with<lb/>
my l'envoy.<lb/>
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,<lb/>
Were still at odds, being but three.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Until the goose came out of door,<lb/>
Staying the odds by adding four.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you<lb/>
desire more?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.<lb/>
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.<lb/>
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:<lb/>
Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.<lb/>
Then call'd you for the l'envoy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>True, and I for a plantain: thus came your<lb/>
argument in;<lb/>
Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;<lb/>
And he ended the market.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>I will tell you sensibly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:<lb/>
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,<lb/>
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>We will talk no more of this matter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Till there be more matter in the shin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,<lb/>
some goose, in this.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,<lb/>
enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,<lb/>
restrained, captivated, bound.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,<lb/>
in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:<lb/>
bear this significant<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Giving a letter</stage></p>


<p>
to the country maid Jaquenetta:<lb/>
there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine<lb/>
honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit MOTH</stage></p>


<p>
Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!<lb/>
O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three<lb/>
farthings&mdash;remuneration.&mdash;'What's the price of this<lb/>
inkle?'&mdash;'One penny.'&mdash;'No, I'll give you a<lb/>
remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!<lb/>
why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will<lb/>
never buy and sell out of this word.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BIRON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man<lb/>
buy for a remuneration?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>What is a remuneration?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I thank your worship: God be wi' you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Stay, slave; I must employ thee:<lb/>
As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,<lb/>
Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>When would you have it done, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>This afternoon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Thou knowest not what it is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I shall know, sir, when I have done it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Why, villain, thou must know first.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>It must be done this afternoon.<lb/>
Hark, slave, it is but this:<lb/>
The princess comes to hunt here in the park,<lb/>
And in her train there is a gentle lady;<lb/>
When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,<lb/>
And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;<lb/>
And to her white hand see thou do commend<lb/>
This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Giving him a shilling</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,<lb/>
a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I<lb/>
will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;<lb/>
A very beadle to a humorous sigh;<lb/>
A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;<lb/>
A domineering pedant o'er the boy;<lb/>
Than whom no mortal so magnificent!<lb/>
This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;<lb/>
This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;<lb/>
Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,<lb/>
The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,<lb/>
Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,<lb/>
Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,<lb/>
Sole imperator and great general<lb/>
Of trotting 'paritors:&mdash;O my little heart:&mdash;<lb/>
And I to be a corporal of his field,<lb/>
And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!<lb/>
What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!<lb/>
A woman, that is like a German clock,<lb/>
Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,<lb/>
And never going aright, being a watch,<lb/>
But being watch'd that it may still go right!<lb/>
Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;<lb/>
And, among three, to love the worst of all;<lb/>
A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,<lb/>
With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;<lb/>
Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed<lb/>
Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:<lb/>
And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!<lb/>
To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague<lb/>
That Cupid will impose for my neglect<lb/>
Of his almighty dreadful little might.<lb/>
Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:<lb/>
Some men must love my lady and some Joan.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Nay, never paint me now:<lb/>
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.<lb/>
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:<lb/>
Fair payment for foul words is more than due.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Forester</speaker>
<p>Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!<lb/>
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!<lb/>
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.<lb/>
But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,<lb/>
And shooting well is then accounted ill.<lb/>
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:<lb/>
Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;<lb/>
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,<lb/>
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.<lb/>
And out of question so it is sometimes,<lb/>
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,<lb/>
When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,<lb/>
We bend to that the working of the heart;<lb/>
As I for praise alone now seek to spill<lb/>
The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty<lb/>
Only for praise sake, when they strive to be<lb/>
Lords o'er their lords?<lb/>

<p>Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Which is the greatest lady, the highest?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>The thickest and the tallest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.<lb/>
An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,<lb/>
One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.<lb/>
Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>What's your will, sir? what's your will?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:<lb/>
Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;<lb/>
Break up this capon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;<lb/>
true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that<lb/>
thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful<lb/>
than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have<lb/>
commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The<lb/>
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set<lb/>
eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar<lb/>
Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,<lb/>
Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the<lb/>
vulgar,&mdash;O base and obscure vulgar!&mdash;videlicet, He<lb/>
came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;<lb/>
overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he<lb/>
come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to<lb/>
whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the<lb/>
beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The<lb/>
conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.<lb/>
The captive is enriched: on whose side? the<lb/>
beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose<lb/>
side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in<lb/>
both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:<lb/>
thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.<lb/>
Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce<lb/>
thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I<lb/>
will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;<lb/>
for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,<lb/>
expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,<lb/>
my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every<lb/>
part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,<lb/>
DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'<lb/>

Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar<lb/>
'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.<lb/>
Submissive fall his princely feet before,<lb/>
And he from forage will incline to play:<lb/>
But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?<lb/>
Food for his rage, repasture for his den.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony<lb/>
of a good conscience.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe<lb/>
as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in<lb/>
the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;<lb/>
and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,<lb/>
the soil, the land, the earth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly<lb/>
varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I<lb/>
assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of<lb/>
insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of<lb/>
explication; facere, as it were, replication, or<lb/>
rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his<lb/>
inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,<lb/>
uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,<lb/>
unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to<lb/>
insert again my haud credo for a deer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!<lb/>
O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred<lb/>
in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he<lb/>
hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not<lb/>
replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in<lb/>
the duller parts:<lb/>
And such barren plants are set before us, that we<lb/>
thankful should be,<lb/>
Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that<lb/>
do fructify in us more than he.<lb/>
For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,<lb/>
So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:<lb/>
But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,<lb/>
Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit<lb/>
What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five<lb/>
weeks old as yet?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>What is Dictynna?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,<lb/>
And raught not to five weeks when he came to<lb/>
five-score.<lb/>
The allusion holds in the exchange.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds<lb/>
in the exchange.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for<lb/>
the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside<lb/>
that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph<lb/>
on the death of the deer? And, to humour the<lb/>
ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall<lb/>
please you to abrogate scurrility.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.<lb/>
The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty<lb/>
pleasing pricket;<lb/>
Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made<lb/>
sore with shooting.<lb/>
The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps<lb/>
from thicket;<lb/>
Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.<lb/>
If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores<lb/>
one sorel.<lb/>
Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>A rare talent!<lb/>

<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws<lb/>
him with a talent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a<lb/>
foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,<lb/>
shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,<lb/>
revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of<lb/>
memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and<lb/>
delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the<lb/>
gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am<lb/>
thankful for it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my<lb/>
parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by<lb/>
you, and their daughters profit very greatly under<lb/>
you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall<lb/>
want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,<lb/>
I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca<lb/>
loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.<lb/>

<p>Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>

for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.<lb/>

If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?<lb/>
Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!<lb/>
Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:<lb/>
Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like<lb/>
osiers bow'd.<lb/>
Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,<lb/>
Where all those pleasures live that art would<lb/>
comprehend:<lb/>
If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;<lb/>
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,<lb/>
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;<lb/>
Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:<lb/>
Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,<lb/>
Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.<lb/>
Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,<lb/>
That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>

accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are<lb/>
only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,<lb/>
facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.<lb/>
Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,<lb/>
but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of<lb/>
fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:<lb/>
so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,<lb/>
the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,<lb/>
was this directed to you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JAQUENETTA</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange<lb/>
queen's lords.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>I will overglance the superscript: 'To the<lb/>
snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady<lb/>
Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of<lb/>
the letter, for the nomination of the party writing<lb/>
to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all<lb/>
desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this<lb/>
Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here<lb/>
he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger<lb/>
queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of<lb/>
progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my<lb/>
sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the<lb/>
king: it may concern much. Stay not thy<lb/>

<p>Ay me, I am forsworn!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!<lb/>

<p>Am I the first that have been perjured so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:<lb/>
Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,<lb/>
The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>

O sweet Maria, empress of my love!<lb/>

Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,<lb/>
'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,<lb/>
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?<lb/>
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.<lb/>
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,<lb/>
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:<lb/>
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;<lb/>
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.<lb/>
Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:<lb/>
Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,<lb/>
Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:<lb/>
If broken then, it is no fault of mine:<lb/>
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise<lb/>
To lose an oath to win a paradise?<lb/>

On a day&mdash;alack the day!&mdash;<lb/>
Love, whose month is ever May,<lb/>
Spied a blossom passing fair<lb/>
Playing in the wanton air:<lb/>
Through the velvet leaves the wind,<lb/>
All unseen, can passage find;<lb/>
That the lover, sick to death,<lb/>
Wish himself the heaven's breath.<lb/>
Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;<lb/>
Air, would I might triumph so!<lb/>
But, alack, my hand is sworn<lb/>
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;<lb/>
Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,<lb/>
Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!<lb/>
Do not call it sin in me,<lb/>
That I am forsworn for thee;<lb/>
Thou for whom Jove would swear<lb/>
Juno but an Ethiope were;<lb/>
And deny himself for Jove,<lb/>
Turning mortal for thy love.<lb/>
This will I send, and something else more plain,<lb/>
That shall express my true love's fasting pain.<lb/>
O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,<lb/>
Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,<lb/>
Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;<lb/>
For none offend where all alike do dote.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p><stage>[Advancing]</stage></p><p>  Dumain, thy love is far from charity.<lb/>
You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,<lb/>
To be o'erheard and taken napping so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p><stage>[Advancing]</stage></p><p>  Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;<lb/>
You chide at him, offending twice as much;<lb/>
You do not love Maria; Longaville<lb/>
Did never sonnet for her sake compile,<lb/>
Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart<lb/>
His loving bosom to keep down his heart.<lb/>
I have been closely shrouded in this bush<lb/>
And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:<lb/>
I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,<lb/>
Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:<lb/>
Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;<lb/>
One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To LONGAVILLE</stage></p>


<p>
You would for paradise break faith, and troth;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To DUMAIN</stage></p>


<p>
And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.<lb/>
What will Biron say when that he shall hear<lb/>
Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?<lb/>
How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!<lb/>
How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!<lb/>
For all the wealth that ever I did see,<lb/>
I would not have him know so much by me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Advancing</stage></p>


<p>
Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!<lb/>
Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove<lb/>
These worms for loving, that art most in love?<lb/>
Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears<lb/>
There is no certain princess that appears;<lb/>
You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;<lb/>
Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!<lb/>
But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,<lb/>
All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?<lb/>
You found his mote; the king your mote did see;<lb/>
But I a beam do find in each of three.<lb/>
O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,<lb/>
Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!<lb/>
O me, with what strict patience have I sat,<lb/>
To see a king transformed to a gnat!<lb/>
To see great Hercules whipping a gig,<lb/>
And profound Solomon to tune a jig,<lb/>
And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,<lb/>
And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!<lb/>
Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?<lb/>
And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?<lb/>
And where my liege's? all about the breast:<lb/>
A caudle, ho!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Too bitter is thy jest.<lb/>
Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:<lb/>
I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin<lb/>
To break the vow I am engaged in;<lb/>
I am betray'd, by keeping company<lb/>
With men like men of inconstancy.<lb/>
When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?<lb/>
Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time<lb/>
In pruning me? When shall you hear that I<lb/>
Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,<lb/>
A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,<lb/>
A leg, a limb?<lb/>

O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!<lb/>
As true we are as flesh and blood can be:<lb/>
The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;<lb/>
Young blood doth not obey an old decree:<lb/>
We cannot cross the cause why we were born;<lb/>
Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,<lb/>
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,<lb/>
At the first opening of the gorgeous east,<lb/>
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind<lb/>
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?<lb/>
What peremptory eagle-sighted eye<lb/>
Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,<lb/>
That is not blinded by her majesty?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?<lb/>
My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;<lb/>
She an attending star, scarce seen a light.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:<lb/>
O, but for my love, day would turn to night!<lb/>
Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty<lb/>
Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,<lb/>
Where several worthies make one dignity,<lb/>
Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.<lb/>
Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,&mdash;<lb/>
Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:<lb/>
To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,<lb/>
She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.<lb/>
A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,<lb/>
Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:<lb/>
Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,<lb/>
And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:<lb/>
O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Is ebony like her? O wood divine!<lb/>
A wife of such wood were felicity.<lb/>
O, who can give an oath? where is a book?<lb/>
That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,<lb/>
If that she learn not of her eye to look:<lb/>
No face is fair that is not full so black.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,<lb/>
The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;<lb/>
And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.<lb/>
O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,<lb/>
It mourns that painting and usurping hair<lb/>
Should ravish doters with a false aspect;<lb/>
And therefore is she born to make black fair.<lb/>
Her favour turns the fashion of the days,<lb/>
For native blood is counted painting now;<lb/>
And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,<lb/>
Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>And since her time are colliers counted bright.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Your mistresses dare never come in rain,<lb/>
For fear their colours should be wash'd away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,<lb/>
I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>No devil will fright thee then so much as she.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,<lb/>
Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies<lb/>
The street should see as she walk'd overhead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>But what of this? are we not all in love?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove<lb/>
Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>O, some authority how to proceed;<lb/>
Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Some salve for perjury.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>'Tis more than need.<lb/>
Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.<lb/>
Consider what you first did swear unto,<lb/>
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;<lb/>
Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.<lb/>
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;<lb/>
And abstinence engenders maladies.<lb/>
And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,<lb/>
In that each of you have forsworn his book,<lb/>
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?<lb/>
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,<lb/>
Have found the ground of study's excellence<lb/>
Without the beauty of a woman's face?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;	They are the ground, the books, the academes	From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire</stage></p>


<p>
Why, universal plodding poisons up<lb/>
The nimble spirits in the arteries,<lb/>
As motion and long-during action tires<lb/>
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.<lb/>
Now, for not looking on a woman's face,<lb/>
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes<lb/>
And study too, the causer of your vow;<lb/>
For where is any author in the world<lb/>
Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?<lb/>
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself<lb/>
And where we are our learning likewise is:<lb/>
Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,<lb/>
Do we not likewise see our learning there?<lb/>
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,<lb/>
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.<lb/>
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,<lb/>
In leaden contemplation have found out<lb/>
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes<lb/>
Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?<lb/>
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;<lb/>
And therefore, finding barren practisers,<lb/>
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:<lb/>
But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,<lb/>
Lives not alone immured in the brain;<lb/>
But, with the motion of all elements,<lb/>
Courses as swift as thought in every power,<lb/>
And gives to every power a double power,<lb/>
Above their functions and their offices.<lb/>
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;<lb/>
A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;<lb/>
A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,<lb/>
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:<lb/>
Love's feeling is more soft and sensible<lb/>
Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;<lb/>
Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:<lb/>
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,<lb/>
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?<lb/>
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical<lb/>
As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:<lb/>
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods<lb/>
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.<lb/>
Never durst poet touch a pen to write<lb/>
Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;<lb/>
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears<lb/>
And plant in tyrants mild humility.<lb/>
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:<lb/>
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;<lb/>
They are the books, the arts, the academes,<lb/>
That show, contain and nourish all the world:<lb/>
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.<lb/>
Then fools you were these women to forswear,<lb/>
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.<lb/>
For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,<lb/>
Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,<lb/>
Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,<lb/>
Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,<lb/>
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,<lb/>
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.<lb/>
It is religion to be thus forsworn,<lb/>
For charity itself fulfills the law,<lb/>
And who can sever love from charity?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;<lb/>
Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,<lb/>
In conflict that you get the sun of them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:<lb/>
Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>And win them too: therefore let us devise<lb/>
Some entertainment for them in their tents.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>First, from the park let us conduct them thither;<lb/>
Then homeward every man attach the hand<lb/>
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon<lb/>
We will with some strange pastime solace them,<lb/>
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;<lb/>
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours<lb/>
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Away, away! no time shall be omitted<lb/>
That will betime, and may by us be fitted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;<lb/>
And justice always whirls in equal measure:<lb/>
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;<lb/>
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner<lb/>
have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without<lb/>
scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without<lb/>
impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-<lb/>
out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with<lb/>
a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-<lb/>
nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his<lb/>
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye<lb/>
ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general<lb/>
behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is<lb/>
too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Most military sir, salutation.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to COSTARD]</stage></p><p>  They have been at a great feast<lb/>
of languages, and stolen the scraps.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.<lb/>
I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;<lb/>
for thou art not so long by the head as<lb/>
honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier<lb/>
swallowed than a flap-dragon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Peace! the peal begins.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p><stage>[To HOLOFERNES]</stage></p><p>  Monsieur, are you not lettered?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,<lb/>
b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Quis, quis, thou consonant?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or<lb/>
the fifth, if I.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>I will repeat them,&mdash;a, e, i,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>The sheep: the other two concludes it,&mdash;o, u.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet<lb/>
touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and<lb/>
home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>What is the figure? what is the figure?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Horns.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about<lb/>
your infamy circum circa,&mdash;a gig of a cuckold's horn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst<lb/>
have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very<lb/>
remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny<lb/>
purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an<lb/>
the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my<lb/>
bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!<lb/>
Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'<lb/>
ends, as they say.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the<lb/>
barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the<lb/>
charge-house on the top of the mountain?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Or mons, the hill.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>I do, sans question.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and<lb/>
affection to congratulate the princess at her<lb/>
pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the<lb/>
rude multitude call the afternoon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is<lb/>
liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:<lb/>
the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do<lb/>
assure you, sir, I do assure.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,<lb/>
I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is<lb/>
inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,<lb/>
remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy<lb/>
head: and among other important and most serious<lb/>
designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let<lb/>
that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his<lb/>
grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor<lb/>
shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally<lb/>
with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet<lb/>
heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no<lb/>
fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his<lb/>
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of<lb/>
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.<lb/>
The very all of all is,&mdash;but, sweet heart, I do<lb/>
implore secrecy,&mdash;that the king would have me<lb/>
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some<lb/>
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or<lb/>
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the<lb/>
curate and your sweet self are good at such<lb/>
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it<lb/>
were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to<lb/>
crave your assistance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.<lb/>
Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some<lb/>
show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by<lb/>
our assistants, at the king's command, and this most<lb/>
gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before<lb/>
the princess; I say none so fit as to present the<lb/>
Nine Worthies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,<lb/>
Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great<lb/>
limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the<lb/>
page, Hercules,&mdash;<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for<lb/>
that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in<lb/>
minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a<lb/>
snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>An excellent device! so, if any of the audience<lb/>
hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou<lb/>
crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an<lb/>
offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>For the rest of the Worthies?&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>I will play three myself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Thrice-worthy gentleman!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Shall I tell you a thing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>We attend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I<lb/>
beseech you, follow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>Nor understood none neither, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Allons! we will employ thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DULL</speaker>
<p>I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play<lb/>
On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>The same.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,<lb/>
If fairings come thus plentifully in:<lb/>
A lady wall'd about with diamonds!<lb/>
Look you what I have from the loving king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Madame, came nothing else along with that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme<lb/>
As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,<lb/>
Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,<lb/>
That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>That was the way to make his godhead wax,<lb/>
For he hath been five thousand years a boy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;<lb/>
And so she died: had she been light, like you,<lb/>
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,<lb/>
She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:<lb/>
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>A light condition in a beauty dark.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>We need more light to find your meaning out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;<lb/>
Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>So do not you, for you are a light wench.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.<lb/>
But Rosaline, you have a favour too:<lb/>
Who sent it? and what is it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>I would you knew:<lb/>
An if my face were but as fair as yours,<lb/>
My favour were as great; be witness this.<lb/>
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:<lb/>
The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,<lb/>
I were the fairest goddess on the ground:<lb/>
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.<lb/>
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Any thing like?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Fair as a text B in a copy-book.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,<lb/>
My red dominical, my golden letter:<lb/>
O, that your face were not so full of O's!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Madam, this glove.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Did he not send you twain?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Yes, madam, and moreover<lb/>
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,<lb/>
A huge translation of hypocrisy,<lb/>
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:<lb/>
The letter is too long by half a mile.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart<lb/>
The chain were longer and the letter short?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>Ay, or I would these hands might never part.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.<lb/>
That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:<lb/>
O that I knew he were but in by the week!<lb/>
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek<lb/>
And wait the season and observe the times<lb/>
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes<lb/>
And shape his service wholly to my hests<lb/>
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!<lb/>
So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state<lb/>
That he should be my fool and I his fate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,<lb/>
As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,<lb/>
Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school<lb/>
And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>The blood of youth burns not with such excess<lb/>
As gravity's revolt to wantonness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>Folly in fools bears not so strong a note<lb/>
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;<lb/>
Since all the power thereof it doth apply<lb/>
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter BOYET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Thy news Boyet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Prepare, madam, prepare!<lb/>
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are<lb/>
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,<lb/>
Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:<lb/>
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;<lb/>
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they<lb/>
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Under the cool shade of a sycamore<lb/>
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;<lb/>
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,<lb/>
Toward that shade I might behold addrest<lb/>
The king and his companions: warily<lb/>
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,<lb/>
And overheard what you shall overhear,<lb/>
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.<lb/>
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,<lb/>
That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:<lb/>
Action and accent did they teach him there;<lb/>
'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'<lb/>
And ever and anon they made a doubt<lb/>
Presence majestical would put him out,<lb/>
'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;<lb/>
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'<lb/>
The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;<lb/>
I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'<lb/>
With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,<lb/>
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:<lb/>
One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore<lb/>
A better speech was never spoke before;<lb/>
Another, with his finger and his thumb,<lb/>
Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'<lb/>
The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'<lb/>
The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.<lb/>
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,<lb/>
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,<lb/>
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,<lb/>
To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>But what, but what, come they to visit us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.<lb/>
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.<lb/>
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;<lb/>
And every one his love-feat will advance<lb/>
Unto his several mistress, which they'll know<lb/>
By favours several which they did bestow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;<lb/>
For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;<lb/>
And not a man of them shall have the grace,<lb/>
Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.<lb/>
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,<lb/>
And then the king will court thee for his dear;<lb/>
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,<lb/>
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.<lb/>
And change your favours too; so shall your loves<lb/>
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>But in this changing what is your intent?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:<lb/>
They do it but in mocking merriment;<lb/>
And mock for mock is only my intent.<lb/>
Their several counsels they unbosom shall<lb/>
To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal<lb/>
Upon the next occasion that we meet,<lb/>
With visages displayed, to talk and greet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>But shall we dance, if they desire to't?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>No, to the death, we will not move a foot;<lb/>
Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,<lb/>
But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,<lb/>
And quite divorce his memory from his part.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt<lb/>
The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out<lb/>
There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,<lb/>
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:<lb/>
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,<lb/>
And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Trumpets sound within</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>The Ladies mask</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND,	BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits,	and masked</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>A holy parcel of the fairest dames.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>The Ladies turn their backs to him</stage></p>


<p>
That ever turn'd their&mdash;backs&mdash;to mortal views!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to MOTH]</stage></p><p>  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!&mdash;Out&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>True; out indeed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe<lb/>
Not to behold&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to MOTH]</stage></p><p>  Once to behold, rogue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,<lb/>
&mdash;with your sun-beamed eyes&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>They will not answer to that epithet;<lb/>
You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>They do not mark me, and that brings me out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit MOTH</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:<lb/>
If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:<lb/>
That some plain man recount their purposes<lb/>
Know what they would.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>What would you with the princess?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>What would they, say they?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>She says, you have it, and you may be gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Say to her, we have measured many miles<lb/>
To tread a measure with her on this grass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>They say, that they have measured many a mile<lb/>
To tread a measure with you on this grass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>It is not so. Ask them how many inches<lb/>
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,<lb/>
The measure then of one is easily told.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>If to come hither you have measured miles,<lb/>
And many miles, the princess bids you tell<lb/>
How many inches doth fill up one mile.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>She hears herself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>How many weary steps,<lb/>
Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,<lb/>
Are number'd in the travel of one mile?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>We number nothing that we spend for you:<lb/>
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,<lb/>
That we may do it still without accompt.<lb/>
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,<lb/>
That we, like savages, may worship it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>My face is but a moon, and clouded too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!<lb/>
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,<lb/>
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;<lb/>
Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.<lb/>
Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Music plays</stage></p>


<p>
Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.<lb/>
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Our ears vouchsafe it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>But your legs should do it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Since you are strangers and come here by chance,<lb/>
We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Why take we hands, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Only to part friends:<lb/>
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>More measure of this measure; be not nice.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>We can afford no more at such a price.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Your absence only.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>That can never be.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;<lb/>
Twice to your visor, and half once to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>In private, then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>I am best pleased with that.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They converse apart</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,<lb/>
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!<lb/>
There's half-a-dozen sweets.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Seventh sweet, adieu:<lb/>
Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>One word in secret.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Let it not be sweet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Thou grievest my gall.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Gall! bitter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Therefore meet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>Name it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Fair lady,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>Say you so? Fair lord,&mdash;<lb/>
Take that for your fair lady.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Please it you,<lb/>
As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They converse apart</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>What, was your vizard made without a tongue?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>I know the reason, lady, why you ask.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>You have a double tongue within your mask,<lb/>
And would afford my speechless vizard half.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>A calf, fair lady!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>No, a fair lord calf.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Let's part the word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>No, I'll not be your half<lb/>
Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!<lb/>
Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>One word in private with you, ere I die.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They converse apart</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen<lb/>
As is the razor's edge invisible,<lb/>
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,<lb/>
Above the sense of sense; so sensible<lb/>
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings<lb/>
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors</stage></p>


<p>
Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!<lb/>
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?<lb/>
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?<lb/>
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>O, they were all in lamentable cases!<lb/>
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Biron did swear himself out of all suit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>Dumain was at my service, and his sword:<lb/>
No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;<lb/>
And trow you what he called me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Qualm, perhaps.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Yes, in good faith.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Go, sickness as thou art!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Well, better wits have worn statute-caps.<lb/>
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>And Longaville was for my service born.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:<lb/>
Immediately they will again be here<lb/>
In their own shapes; for it can never be<lb/>
They will digest this harsh indignity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Will they return?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>They will, they will, God knows,<lb/>
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:<lb/>
Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,<lb/>
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;<lb/>
Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,<lb/>
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,<lb/>
If they return in their own shapes to woo?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,<lb/>
Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:<lb/>
Let us complain to them what fools were here,<lb/>
Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;<lb/>
And wonder what they were and to what end<lb/>
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd<lb/>
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,<lb/>
Should be presented at our tent to us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty<lb/>
Command me any service to her thither?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,<lb/>
And utters it again when God doth please:<lb/>
He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares<lb/>
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;<lb/>
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,<lb/>
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.<lb/>
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;<lb/>
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;<lb/>
A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he<lb/>
That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;<lb/>
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,<lb/>
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice<lb/>
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing<lb/>
A mean most meanly; and in ushering<lb/>
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;<lb/>
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:<lb/>
This is the flower that smiles on every one,<lb/>
To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;<lb/>
And consciences, that will not die in debt,<lb/>
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,<lb/>
That put Armado's page out of his part!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou<lb/>
Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE,	MARIA, and KATHARINE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Construe my speeches better, if you may.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Then wish me better; I will give you leave.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>We came to visit you, and purpose now<lb/>
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:<lb/>
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:<lb/>
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;<lb/>
For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.<lb/>
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure<lb/>
As the unsullied lily, I protest,<lb/>
A world of torments though I should endure,<lb/>
I would not yield to be your house's guest;<lb/>
So much I hate a breaking cause to be<lb/>
Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>O, you have lived in desolation here,<lb/>
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;<lb/>
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:<lb/>
A mess of Russians left us but of late.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>How, madam! Russians!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Ay, in truth, my lord;<lb/>
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:<lb/>
My lady, to the manner of the days,<lb/>
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.<lb/>
We four indeed confronted were with four<lb/>
In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,<lb/>
And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,<lb/>
They did not bless us with one happy word.<lb/>
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,<lb/>
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,<lb/>
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,<lb/>
With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,<lb/>
By light we lose light: your capacity<lb/>
Is of that nature that to your huge store<lb/>
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>I am a fool, and full of poverty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>But that you take what doth to you belong,<lb/>
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>O, I am yours, and all that I possess!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>All the fool mine?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>I cannot give you less.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Which of the vizards was it that you wore?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case<lb/>
That hid the worse and show'd the better face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Let us confess and turn it to a jest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?<lb/>
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.<lb/>
Can any face of brass hold longer out?<lb/>
Here stand I	lady, dart thy skill at me;<lb/>
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;<lb/>
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;<lb/>
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;<lb/>
And I will wish thee never more to dance,<lb/>
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.<lb/>
O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,<lb/>
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,<lb/>
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,<lb/>
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!<lb/>
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,<lb/>
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,<lb/>
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies<lb/>
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:<lb/>
I do forswear them; and I here protest,<lb/>
By this white glove;&mdash;how white the hand, God knows!&mdash;<lb/>
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd<lb/>
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:<lb/>
And, to begin, wench,&mdash;so God help me, la!&mdash;<lb/>
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Sans sans, I pray you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Yet I have a trick<lb/>
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;<lb/>
I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:<lb/>
Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;<lb/>
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;<lb/>
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;<lb/>
These lords are visited; you are not free,<lb/>
For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>It is not so; for how can this be true,<lb/>
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Peace! for I will not have to do with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression<lb/>
Some fair excuse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>The fairest is confession.<lb/>
Were not you here but even now disguised?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Madam, I was.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>And were you well advised?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>I was, fair madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>When you then were here,<lb/>
What did you whisper in your lady's ear?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>That more than all the world I did respect her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Upon mine honour, no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Peace, peace! forbear:<lb/>
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,<lb/>
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear<lb/>
As precious eyesight, and did value me<lb/>
Above this world; adding thereto moreover<lb/>
That he would wed me, or else die my lover.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>God give thee joy of him! the noble lord<lb/>
Most honourably doth unhold his word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,<lb/>
I never swore this lady such an oath.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,<lb/>
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>My faith and this the princess I did give:<lb/>
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;<lb/>
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.<lb/>
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Neither of either; I remit both twain.<lb/>
I see the trick on't: here was a consent,<lb/>
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,<lb/>
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:<lb/>
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,<lb/>
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,<lb/>
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick<lb/>
To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,<lb/>
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,<lb/>
The ladies did change favours: and then we,<lb/>
Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.<lb/>
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,<lb/>
We are again forsworn, in will and error.<lb/>
Much upon this it is: and might not you<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To BOYET</stage></p>


<p>
Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?<lb/>
Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,<lb/>
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?<lb/>
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,<lb/>
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?<lb/>
You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;<lb/>
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.<lb/>
You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye<lb/>
Wounds like a leaden sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Full merrily<lb/>
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>

<p>
Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir, they would know<lb/>
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>What, are there but three?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>No, sir; but it is vara fine,<lb/>
For every one pursents three.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>And three times thrice is nine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.<lb/>
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know<lb/>
what we know:<lb/>
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Is not nine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living<lb/>
by reckoning, sir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>How much is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,<lb/>
sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine<lb/>
own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man<lb/>
in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Art thou one of the Worthies?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the<lb/>
Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of<lb/>
the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Go, bid them prepare.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take<lb/>
some care.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy<lb/>
To have one show worse than the king's and his company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>I say they shall not come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:<lb/>
That sport best pleases that doth least know how:<lb/>
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents<lb/>
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:<lb/>
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,<lb/>
When great things labouring perish in their birth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>A right description of our sport, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal<lb/>
sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.<lb/>

<p>Doth this man serve God?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Why ask you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>He speaks not like a man of God's making.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,<lb/>
I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding<lb/>
fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we<lb/>

Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,<lb/>
Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if<lb/>
these four Worthies in their first show thrive,<lb/>
These four will change habits, and present the other five.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>You are deceived; 'tis not so.<lb/>

<p>The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool<lb/>

Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I Pompey am,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>You lie, you are not he.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I Pompey am,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>With libbard's head on knee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends<lb/>
with thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>The Great.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>It is, 'Great,' sir:&mdash;<lb/>
Pompey surnamed the Great;<lb/>
That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make<lb/>
my foe to sweat:<lb/>
And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,<lb/>
And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,<lb/>
If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Great thanks, great Pompey.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I<lb/>
made a little fault in 'Great.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>When in the world I lived, I was the world's<lb/>
commander;<lb/>
By east, west, north, and south, I spread my<lb/>
conquering might:<lb/>
My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR NATHANIEL</speaker>
<p>When in the world I lived, I was the world's<lb/>
commander,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Pompey the Great,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Your servant, and Costard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p><stage>[To SIR NATHANIEL]</stage></p><p>  O, sir, you have overthrown<lb/>
Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of<lb/>
the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds<lb/>
his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given<lb/>
to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,<lb/>
and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>SIR NATHANIEL retires</stage></p>


<p>
There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an<lb/>
honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a<lb/>
marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good<lb/>
bowler: but, for Alisander,&mdash;alas, you see how<lb/>
'tis,&mdash;a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies<lb/>
a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Great Hercules is presented by this imp,<lb/>
Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;<lb/>
And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,<lb/>
Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.<lb/>
Quoniam he seemeth in minority,<lb/>
Ergo I come with this apology.<lb/>
Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>MOTH retires</stage></p>


<p>
Judas I am,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>A Judas!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Not Iscariot, sir.<lb/>
Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Judas I am,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>The more shame for you, Judas.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>What mean you, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>To make Judas hang himself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>Begin, sir; you are my elder.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>I will not be put out of countenance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Because thou hast no face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>What is this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>A cittern-head.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>The head of a bodkin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>A Death's face in a ring.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>The pommel of Caesar's falchion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>The carved-bone face on a flask.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Ay, and in a brooch of lead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.<lb/>
And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>You have put me out of countenance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>False; we have given thee faces.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>But you have out-faced them all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>An thou wert a lion, we would do so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.<lb/>
And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>For the latter end of his name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>For the ass to the Jude; give it him:&mdash;Jud-as, away!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HOLOFERNES</speaker>
<p>This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>HOLOFERNES retires</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>But is this Hector?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>His leg is too big for Hector's.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>More calf, certain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>No; he is best endued in the small.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>This cannot be Hector.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,<lb/>
Gave Hector a gift,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>A gilt nutmeg.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>A lemon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>Stuck with cloves.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>No, cloven.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Peace!&mdash;<lb/>
The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty<lb/>
Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;<lb/>
A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea<lb/>
From morn till night, out of his pavilion.<lb/>
I am that flower,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>That mint.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>That columbine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,<lb/>
beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,<lb/>
he was a man. But I will forward with my device.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To the PRINCESS</stage></p>


<p>
Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to BOYET]</stage></p><p>  He may not by the yard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she<lb/>
is two months on her way.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>What meanest thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor<lb/>
wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in<lb/>
her belly already: tis yours.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt<lb/>
die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is<lb/>
quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by<lb/>
him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Most rare Pompey!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>Renowned Pompey!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!<lb/>
Pompey the Huge!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Hector trembles.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them<lb/>
on! stir them on!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Hector will challenge him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will<lb/>
sup a flea.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>By the north pole, I do challenge thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:<lb/>
I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,<lb/>
let me borrow my arms again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Room for the incensed Worthies!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COSTARD</speaker>
<p>I'll do it in my shirt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Most resolute Pompey!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOTH</speaker>
<p>Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you<lb/>
not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean<lb/>
you? You will lose your reputation.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat<lb/>
in my shirt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Sweet bloods, I both may and will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>What reason have you for't?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go<lb/>
woolward for penance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOYET</speaker>
<p>True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of<lb/>
linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but<lb/>
a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next<lb/>
his heart for a favour.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MERCADE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCADE</speaker>
<p>God save you, madam!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Welcome, Mercade;<lb/>
But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCADE</speaker>
<p>I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring<lb/>
Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Dead, for my life!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCADE</speaker>
<p>Even so; my tale is told.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have<lb/>
seen the day of wrong through the little hole of<lb/>
discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Worthies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>How fares your majesty?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,<lb/>
For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,<lb/>
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe<lb/>
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide<lb/>
The liberal opposition of our spirits,<lb/>
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves<lb/>
In the converse of breath: your gentleness<lb/>
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!<lb/>
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:<lb/>
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks<lb/>
For my great suit so easily obtain'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>The extreme parts of time extremely forms<lb/>
All causes to the purpose of his speed,<lb/>
And often at his very loose decides<lb/>
That which long process could not arbitrate:<lb/>
And though the mourning brow of progeny<lb/>
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love<lb/>
The holy suit which fain it would convince,<lb/>
Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,<lb/>
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it<lb/>
From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost<lb/>
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable<lb/>
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>I understand you not: my griefs are double.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;<lb/>
And by these badges understand the king.<lb/>
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,<lb/>
Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,<lb/>
Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours<lb/>
Even to the opposed end of our intents:<lb/>
And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,&mdash;<lb/>
As love is full of unbefitting strains,<lb/>
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,<lb/>
Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,<lb/>
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,<lb/>
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll<lb/>
To every varied object in his glance:<lb/>
Which parti-coated presence of loose love<lb/>
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,<lb/>
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,<lb/>
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,<lb/>
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,<lb/>
Our love being yours, the error that love makes<lb/>
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,<lb/>
By being once false for ever to be true<lb/>
To those that make us both,&mdash;fair ladies, you:<lb/>
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,<lb/>
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>We have received your letters full of love;<lb/>
Your favours, the ambassadors of love;<lb/>
And, in our maiden council, rated them<lb/>
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,<lb/>
As bombast and as lining to the time:<lb/>
But more devout than this in our respects<lb/>
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves<lb/>
In their own fashion, like a merriment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>So did our looks.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>We did not quote them so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Now, at the latest minute of the hour,<lb/>
Grant us your loves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCESS</speaker>
<p>A time, methinks, too short<lb/>
To make a world-without-end bargain in.<lb/>
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,<lb/>
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:<lb/>
If for my love, as there is no such cause,<lb/>
You will do aught, this shall you do for me:<lb/>
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed<lb/>
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,<lb/>
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;<lb/>
There stay until the twelve celestial signs<lb/>
Have brought about the annual reckoning.<lb/>
If this austere insociable life<lb/>
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;<lb/>
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds<lb/>
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,<lb/>
But that it bear this trial and last love;<lb/>
Then, at the expiration of the year,<lb/>
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,<lb/>
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine<lb/>
I will be thine; and till that instant shut<lb/>
My woeful self up in a mourning house,<lb/>
Raining the tears of lamentation<lb/>
For the remembrance of my father's death.<lb/>
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,<lb/>
Neither entitled in the other's heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>If this, or more than this, I would deny,<lb/>
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,<lb/>
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!<lb/>
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p>

<p>And what to me, my love? and what to me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd,<lb/>
You are attaint with faults and perjury:<lb/>
Therefore if you my favour mean to get,<lb/>
A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,<lb/>
But seek the weary beds of people sick]<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>A beard, fair health, and honesty;<lb/>
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day<lb/>
I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:<lb/>
Come when the king doth to my lady come;<lb/>
Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUMAIN</speaker>
<p>I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KATHARINE</speaker>
<p>Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>What says Maria?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>At the twelvemonth's end<lb/>
I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LONGAVILLE</speaker>
<p>I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIA</speaker>
<p>The liker you; few taller are so young.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;<lb/>
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,<lb/>
What humble suit attends thy answer there:<lb/>
Impose some service on me for thy love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,<lb/>
Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue<lb/>
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,<lb/>
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,<lb/>
Which you on all estates will execute<lb/>
That lie within the mercy of your wit.<lb/>
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,<lb/>
And therewithal to win me, if you please,<lb/>
Without the which I am not to be won,<lb/>
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day<lb/>
Visit the speechless sick and still converse<lb/>
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,<lb/>
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit<lb/>
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>
<p>To move wild laughter in the throat of death?<lb/>
It cannot be; it is impossible:<lb/>
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSALINE</speaker>
<p>Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,<lb/>
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace<lb/>
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:<lb/>
A jest's prosperity lies in the ear<lb/>
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue<lb/>
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,<lb/>
Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,<lb/>
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,<lb/>
And I will have you and that fault withal;<lb/>
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,<lb/>
And I shall find you empty of that fault,<lb/>
Right joyful of your reformation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIRON</speaker>

I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.<lb/>

<p>I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am<lb/>
a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the<lb/>
plough for her sweet love three years. But, most<lb/>
esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that<lb/>
the two learned men have compiled in praise of the<lb/>
owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the<lb/>
end of our show.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FERDINAND</speaker>
<p>Call them forth quickly; we will do so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>Holla! approach.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD,	and others</stage></p>


<p>
This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;<lb/>
the one maintained by the owl, the other by the<lb/>
cuckoo. Ver, begin.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>THE SONG</stage></p>


<p>

SPRING.<lb/>
When daisies pied and violets blue<lb/>
And lady-smocks all silver-white<lb/>
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue<lb/>
Do paint the meadows with delight,<lb/>
The cuckoo then, on every tree,<lb/>
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;<lb/>
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,<lb/>
Unpleasing to a married ear!<lb/>

When shepherds pipe on oaten straws<lb/>
And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,<lb/>
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,<lb/>
And maidens bleach their summer smocks<lb/>
The cuckoo then, on every tree,<lb/>
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;<lb/>
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,<lb/>
Unpleasing to a married ear!<lb/>

WINTER.<lb/>
When icicles hang by the wall<lb/>
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail<lb/>
And Tom bears logs into the hall<lb/>
And milk comes frozen home in pail,<lb/>
When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,<lb/>
Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;<lb/>
Tu-who, a merry note,<lb/>
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.<lb/>

When all aloud the wind doth blow<lb/>
And coughing drowns the parson's saw<lb/>
And birds sit brooding in the snow<lb/>
And Marian's nose looks red and raw,<lb/>
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,<lb/>
Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;<lb/>
Tu-who, a merry note,<lb/>
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>ADRIANO DE ARMADO</speaker>
<p>The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of<lb/>
Apollo. You that way: we this way.<lb/>
