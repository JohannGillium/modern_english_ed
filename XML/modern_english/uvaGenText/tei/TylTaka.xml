TAKASAGO<lb/>  
(A god play)  
</head>  
  
<p>  
<hi rend="italic">Takasago</hi>, by Zeami, is perhaps the best loved of all the  
god plays. Its clear tone will endure, all but forgotten, until it is  
reaffirmed in a burst of energy at the close of the demon play&mdash;here  
<hi rend="italic">The Watchmen's Mirror</hi>.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
Takasago actually means "dune." The area is now an industrial city on the  
Inland Sea, but the Takasago Shrine is still there. Takasago has been  
famous in poetry since ancient times, and famous especially for the  
Takasago Pine. This pine is said to be paired with the Suminoe Pine, but  
Sumiyoshi (Suminoe is simply an older form of the same name) is far to the  
east, in the neighboring province, and one wonders how the two pines  
really can be paired. The answer is that their perfect attunement frees  
them from space. Moreover, the Paired Pines are free of time as well,  
since one is the distant past and the other the present.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
N&omacr; plays often hint that past and present can be one. In  
<hi rend="italic">Takasago</hi>, the past is called the time of the  
<hi rend="italic">Man'y&omacr;sh&umacr;</hi>, a great anthology of the earliest  
Japanese poetry compiled in the eighth century; and the present is called  
the time of the <hi rend="italic">Kokinsh&umacr;</hi>, another basic anthology  
compiled during the Engi era, in the early tenth century. It is tactful  
convention that makes the Engi era the present in <hi rend="italic">Takasago</hi>;  
no never treats the historical present.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
There is much talk of poetry in <hi rend="italic">Takasago</hi>, but in a very  
wide sense. The principal Japanese word for 'poem' is   
uta, which more generally means song. Thus we are told  
that "each sound of beings  
    
  
 <pb n="28" id="TylTaka28"/>   
feeling and non-feeling, every last one, is a song." This is why "all  
living things to the Blessed Isles, they say, draw nigh." For Blessed  
Isles (a tentative translation of the name   
Shikishima) is an ancient name for the islands of  
Japan, and here stands for Shikishima no  
michi, the way of the Blessed Isles: this is simply a term for  
poetry.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
The true function of poetry in the Japanese tradition is communication.  
When all sound is heard as song, that is, as communication of essence,  
there are no barriers anywhere to understanding.  (It is often  
specifically mentioned in god plays that all barriers, gates, and  
checkpoints stand open: the roads are free, communications are unimpeded.)  
When speech is coherent, as light can be coherent, truth is conveyed.  The  
unfailing leaves of speech spoken of in <hi rend="italic">Takasago</hi> are an  
everlasting flow of song that conveys the essence of man, and, in a wider  
sense, the endless hymn sung by all beings to that other singer, the one  
source of all being.  In this antiphon, both beings and source are at one.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
Leaves of speech: one can hardly fail to think of leaves of grass.  
"Words" is all the term means, and "leaves of speech"   
(ha is a pine needle as well as a leaf) is an  
overtranslation.  But the metaphor is so often followed up in n&omacr;  
that one must translate it, or mutilate whole passages.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
The fool tells the Sideman in <hi rend="italic">Takasago</hi> that the Paired  
Pines hold divine converse through these pine boughs: each needle is, or  
sings, a word of their song. And since the pine is always green, the song  
is indeed endless. This endless vigor and life (the pine was said to  
flower ten times, once every thousand years) are actually seen  
    
  
 <pb n="29" id="TylTaka29"/>   
in the pine's unchanging hue, and heard in the sound the wind makes as it  
blows through a pine tree. <hi rend="italic">Pining Wind</hi> is a play about this  
sound.  
</p>  
  
<p>  
The climax of <hi rend="italic">Takasago</hi> is the appearance and dance of the  
god pine himself, in the guise of the God of Sumiyoshi. The Sumiyoshi  
Shrine, near what is now the city of Osaka, is one of the greatest shrines  
in Japan, and the god there is the god of the sea. Perhaps sea and pine  
are one because the sea, too, is endlessly and murmurously alive. At any  
rate, the young and handsome god might well be nicknamed, like Henri IV of  
France, Le Vert Galant.

The Takasago Pine is famous indeed. But could you tell me about its  
connection with the Pine of Suminoe?  
</p>

<sp>  
<speaker>Fool</speaker>  
<p>

<p>  
They say the pines of Takasago and Suminoe stand for the   
Man'y&omacr;sh&umacr; and the   
Kokinsh&umacr;. One story has it that the God of  
Takasago and the God of Sumiyoshi were man and wife, and that when they  
called on each other they held divine converse through these pine boughs.  
That's why the pines are described as Paired. The glory of our own poetry,  
the vigor of courtship and marriage: for both of these we have the gods'  
divine power to thank.  
</p>  
  
<stage>  
He goes on to cite various classic texts in support of his theme.  
</stage>  
  
<p>  
By the way, didn't you meet an old man and an old woman cleaning around  
the base of the pine here?

<pb n="38" id="TylTaka38"/>   
<sp>  
<speaker>Sideman</speaker>

I did indeed. They spoke of the Paired Pines and of their fame, then  
suddenly stepped into a boat and set sail, they said, for Sumiyoshi.  
</p>  
</sp>  
  
<sp>  
<speaker>Fool</speaker>  
<p>  
Then no doubt that old couple were the spirits of the Takasago and Suminoe  
pines themselves. You really should go on pilgrimage to Sumiyoshi.  
</p>  
</sp>  
  
<sp>  
<speaker>Sideman</speaker>  
<p>  
But I have no boat.  
</p>  
</sp>  
  
<sp>  
<speaker>Fool</speaker>

In that case, please do this little craft, newly built as it is, the honor  
of being the first to sail it. It will take you safely to Sumiyoshi. See!  
A following breeze is blowing!

Doer is now facing front at main spot. Below, at 'the pine,' he gazes  
toward pines on bridgeway; then points with fan at his own image reflected  
in the sea down front; at 'For God,' goes to mark post, then sweeps left  
up to center; at 'pure,' glances at his own left sleeve, then turns right  
and up to flute; then strikes full excitement pose, as though sweeping  
away demons; then moves to center, mimes embracing something, stamps beat;  
at 'Thousand Autumns,' moves down front, pointing before him with fan,  
then rolls up the long, hanging length of his sleeves, then turns right  
and up to main spot; at first 'inspires,' opens toward front; then faces  
side and stamps final beat.
