<p>And he sold his birth-right unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave
Esau bread and pottage of lentiles.<lb/> GEN. xxv.33, 34.</p>

<p>.....So!  I let fall the curtain; he was dead.  For at least half an
hour I had stood there with the manuscript in my hand, watching that
face settling in its last stillness, watching the finger of the Composer
smoothing out the deeply furrowed lines on cheek and forehead, &mdash; the
faint recollection of the light that had perhaps burned behind his childish
eyes struggling up through the swarthy cheek, as if to clear the last
world's-dust from the atmosphere surrounding the man who had just
refound his youth.  His head rested on his hand, &mdash; and so satisfied and
content was his quiet attitude, that he looked as if resting from a long,
wearisome piece of work he was glad to have finished.  I don't know
how it was, but I thought, oddly enough, in connection with him, of a
little school-fellow of mine years ago, who one day, in his eagerness to
prove that he could jump farther than some of his companions, upset an
inkstand over his prize essay, and, overcome with mortification,
disappointment, and vexation, burst into tears, hastily scratched his name
from the list of competitors, and then rushed out of doors to tear his
ruined essay into fragments; and we found him that afternoon lying on
the grass, with his head on his hand, just as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> lay now,
having sobbed himself to sleep.</p>
<p>I dropped the curtains of the bed, drew those of the window more
closely, to exclude the shrill winter wind that was blowing the slant sleet
against the clattering window-panes, broke up the lump of cannel coal in
the grate into a bright blaze that subsided into a warm, steady glow of
heat and light, drew an arm-chair and a little table up to the cheerful
fire, and sat down to read the manuscript which the quiet man behind the
curtains had given me.  Why shouldn't I (I was his physician) make
myself as comfortable as possible at two o'clock of a stormy winter
night, in a house that contained but two persons beside my German
patient, &mdash; a half-stupid servingman, doubtless already asleep down-stairs,
and myself?  This is what I read that night, with the comfortable fire on
one side, and Death, holding strange colloquy

 <pb n="392"/>   with the fitful, screaming, moaning wind, on the other.
As I wish simply to relate what has happened to me, (thus the
manuscript began,) what I attempted, in what I sinned, and how I failed,
I deem no introduction or genealogies necessary to the first part of my
life.  I was an only child of parents who were passionately fond of me, --the more, perhaps, because an accident that had happened to me in my
childhood rendered me for some years a partial invalid.  One day, (I was
about five years old then,) a gentleman paid a visit to my father, riding a
splendid Arabian horse.  Upon dismounting, he tied the horse near the
steps of the piazza instead of the horseblock, so that I found I was just
upon the level with the stirrup, standing at a certain elevation.  Half as
an experiment, to try whether I could touch the horse without his
starting, I managed to get my foot into the stirrup, and so mounted upon
his back.  The horse, feeling the light burden, <hi rend="italic">did</hi> start,
broke from his fastening, and sped away with me on his back at the top
of his speed.  He ran several miles without stopping, and finished by
pitching me off his back upon the ground, in leaping a fence.  This fall
produced some disease of the spine, which clung to me till I was twelve
years old, when it was almost miraculously cured by an itinerant Arab
physician.  He was generally pronounced to be a quack, but he certainly
effected many wonderful cures, mine among others.</p>
<p>I had always been an imaginative child; and my long-continued
sedentary life compelling me (a welcome compulsion) to reading as my
chief occupation and amusement, I acquired much knowledge beyond my
years.</p>
<p>My reading generally had one peculiar tone: a certain kind of
mystery was an essential ingredient in the fascination that books which I
considered interesting had for me.  My earliest fairy tales were not those
unexciting stories in which the good genius appears at the beginning of
the book, endowing the hero with such an invincible talisman that
suspense is banished from the reader's mind, too well enabled to foresee
the triumph at the end; but stories of long, painful quests after hidden
treasure, &mdash; mysterious enchantments thrown around certain persons by
witch or wizard, drawing the subject in charmed circles nearer and
nearer to his royal or ruinous destiny, &mdash; strange spells cast upon
bewitched houses or places, that could be removed only by the one hand
appointed by Fate.  So I pored over the misty legends of the San Grail,
and the sweet story of "The Sleeping Beauty," as my first literature; and
as the rough years of practical boyhood trooped up to elbow my
dreaming childhood out of existence, I fed the same hunger for the
hidden and mysterious with Detective-Police stories, Captain Kidd's
voyages, and wild tales of wrecks on the Spanish Main, of those vessels
of fabulous wealth that strewed the deep sea's lap with gems (so the
stories ran) of lustre almost rare enough to light the paths to their secret
hiding-places.</p>
<p>But in the last year of my captivity as an invalid a new pleasure
fell into my hands.  I discovered my first book of travels in my father's
library, and as with a magical key unlocked the gate of an enchanted
realm of wondrous and ceaseless beauty.  It was Sir John Mandeville
who introduced me to this field of exhaustless delight; not a very
trustworthy guide, it must be confessed, &mdash; but my knowledge at that
time was too limited to check the boundless faith I reposed in his
narrative.  It was such an astonishment to discover that men,
black-coated and black-trousered men, such as I saw in crowds every day
in the street from my sofa-corner, (we had moved to the city shortly
after my accident,) had actually broken away from that steady stream of
people, and had traversed countries as wild and unknown as the lands in
the Nibelungen Lied, that my respect for the race rose amazingly.  I
scanned eagerly the sleek, complacent faces of the portly burghers, or
those of the threadbare schoolmasters, thinned like carving-
 <pb n="393"/>
knives by perpetual sharpening on the steel of Latin syntax, in search of
men who could have dared the ghastly terrors of the North with Ross or
Parry, or the scorching jungles of the Equator with Burckhardt and Park.
Cut off for so long a time from actual contact with the outside world, I
could better imagine the brooding stillness of the Great Desert, I could
more easily picture the weird ice-palaces of the Pole, waiting, waiting
forever in awful state, like the deserted halls of the Walhalla for their
slain gods to return, than many of the common street-scenes in my own
city, which I had only vaguely heard mentioned.</p>
<p>I followed the footsteps of the Great Seekers over the wastes, the
untrodden paths of the world; I tracked Columbus across the pathless
Atlantic, &mdash; heard, with Balboa, the "wave of the loud-roaring ocean
break upon the long shore, and the vast sea of the Pacific forever crash
on the beach," &mdash; gazed with Cortes on the temples of the Sun in the
startling Mexican empire, &mdash; or wandered with Pizarro through the
silver-lined palaces of Peru.  But a secret affection drew me to the
mysterious regions of the East and South, &mdash; towards Arabia, the wild
Ishmael bequeathing sworded Korans and subtile Aristotles as legacies to
the sons of the freed-woman,&mdash;
to solemn Egypt, riddle of nations, the
vast silent, impenetrable mystery of the world.  By continual pondering
over the footsteps of the Seekers, the Sought-for seemed to grow to vast
proportions, and the Found to shrink to inappreciable littleness.  For me,
over the dreary ice-plains of the Poles, over the profound bosom of
Africa, the far-stretching steppes of Asia, and the rocky wilds of
America, a great silence brooded, and in the unexplored void faint
footfalls could be heard here and there, threading their way in the
darkness.  But while the longing to plunge, myself, into these dim
regions of expectation grew more intense each day, the prison-chains that
had always bound me still kept their habitual hold upon me, even after
my recovery.  I dreamt not of making even the vaguest plans for
undertaking explorations myself.  So I read and dreamt, filling my room
with wild African or monotonous Egyptian scenery, until I was almost
weaned from ordinary Occidental life.</p>
<p>I passed four blissful years in this happy dream-life, and then it
was abruptly brought to an end by the death of my father and mother
almost simultaneously by an epidemic fever prevailing in the
neighborhood.  I was away from home at a bachelor uncle's at the time,
and so was unexpectedly thrown on his hands, an orphan, penniless,
except in the possession of the small house my father had owned in the
country before our removal to the city, and to be provided for.  My
uncle placed me in a mercantile house to learn business, and, after
exercising some slight supervision over me a few months, left me
entirely to my own resources.  As, however, he had previously taken
care that these resources should be sufficient, I got along very well upon
them, was regularly promoted, and in the space of six years, at the age
of twenty-one, was in a rather responsible situation in the house, with a
good salary.  But my whole attention could not be absorbed in the dull
routine of business, my most precious hours were devoted to reading, in
which I still pursued my old childish track of speculation, with the
difference that I exchanged Sinbad's valley of diamonds for Arabia
Petraea, Sir John Mandeville for Herodotus, and Robinson Crusoe for
Belzoni and Burckhardt.  Whether my interest in these Oriental studies
arose from the fact of the house being concerned in the importation of
the products of the Indies, or whether from the secret attraction that had
drawn me Eastward since my earliest childhood, as if the Arab doctor
had bewitched in curing me, I cannot say; probably it was the former,
especially as the India business became gradually more and more
intrusted to my hands.</p>
<p>Shortly after my twenty-first birthday, I received a note from my
uncle, from whom I had not heard for a year or two,

 <pb n="394"/>
informing me that my father's house, which he had kept rented for me
during the first years of my minority, had been without a tenant for a
year, and, as I had now come of age, I had better go down to D &mdash; -and
take possession of it.  This letter, touching upon a long train of
associations and recollections, awoke an intense longing in me to revisit
the home of my childhood, and meet those phantom shapes that had
woven that spell in those dreaming years, which I sometimes thought I
felt even now.  So I obtained a short leave of absence, and started the
next morning in the coach for D &mdash; -.</p>
<p>It was what is called a "raw morning," for what reason I know
not, for such days are really elaborated with the most exquisite finish.  A
soft gray mist hugged the country in a chilly embrace, while a fine rain
fell as noiselessly as snow, upon soaked ground, drenched trees, and
peevish houses.  There is always a sense of wonder about a mist.  The
outlines of what we consider our hardest tangibilities are melted away by
it into the airiest dream-sketches, our most positive and glaring facts are
blankly blotted out, and a fresh, clean sheet left for some new fantasy to
be written upon it, as groundless as the rest; our solid land dissolves in
cloud, and cloud assumes the stability of land.  For, after all, the only
really tangible thing we possess is man's Will; and let the presence and
action of that be withdrawn but for a few moments, and that mysterious
Something which we vainly endeavor to push off into the Void by our
pompous nothings of brick and plaster and stone closes down upon us
with the descending sky, writing <hi rend="italic">Delendum</hi> on all behind us,
<hi rend="italic">Unknown</hi> on all before.  At that time, the only actual Now,
that stands between these two infinite blanks, becomes identical with the
mind itself, independent of accidents of situation or circumstance; and
the mind thus becoming boldly prominent, amidst the fading away of
physical things, stamps its own character upon its shadowy surroundings,
moulding the supple universe to the shape of its emotions and
feelings.</p>
<p>I was the only inside passenger, and there was nothing to check the
entire surrender of my mind to all ghostly influence.  So I lay stretched
upon the cushions, staring blankly into the dense gray fog closing up all
trace of our travelled road, or watching the light edges of the trailing
mist curl coyly around the roofs of houses and then settle grimly all over
them, the fantastic shapes of trees or carts distorted and magnified
through the mist, the lofty outlines of some darker cloud stalking
solemnly here and there, like enormous dumb overseers faithfully
superintending the work of annihilation.  The monotonous patter of the
rain-drops upon the wet pavement or muddy roads, blending with the
low whining of the wind and the steady rumble of the coach-wheels,
seemed to make a kind of witch-chant, that wove with braided sound a
weird spell about me, a charm fating me for some service, I knew not
what.  That chant moaned, it wailed, it whispered, it sang gloriously, it
bound, it drowned me, it lapped me in an inextricable stream of misty
murmuring, till I was perplexed, bewildered, enchanted.  I felt surprised
at myself, when, at the end of the day's journey, I carried my bag to the
hotel, and ate my supper there as usual, &mdash; and felt natural again only
when, having obtained the key of my house, I sallied forth in the dim
twilight to make it my promised visit.</p>
<p>I found the place, as I had expected, in a state of utter desolation.
A year's silence had removed it so far from the noisy stream of life that
flowed by it, that I felt, as I pushed at the rusty door-lock, as if I were
passing into some old garret of Time, where he had thrown forgotten
rubbish too worn-out and antiquated for present use.  A strong scent of
musk greeted me at my entrance, which I found came from a box of it
that had been broken upon the hall-floor.  I had stowed it away (it was a
favorite perfume with me, because it was so associated with my Arabian
Nights' stories) upon a ledge over

 <pb n="395"/>
the door, where it had rested undisturbed while the house was tenanted,
and had been now probably dislodged by rats.  But I half fancied that
this odor which impregnated the air of the whole house was the essence
of that atmosphere in which, as a child, I had communicated with
Burckhardt and Belzoni, &mdash; and that, expelled by the solid, practical,
Occidental atmosphere of the last few years, it had flowed back again, in
these last silent months, in anticipation of my return.</p>
<p>Like a prudent householder, I made the tour of the house with a
light I had provided myself with, and mentally made memoranda of
repairs, alterations, etc., for rendering it habitable.  My last visit was to
be to the garret, where many of my books yet remained.  As I passed
once more through the parlor, on my way thither, a ray of light from my
raised lamp fell upon the wall that I had thought blank, and a majestic
face started suddenly from the darkness.  So sudden was the apparition,
that for the moment I was startled, till I remembered that there had
formerly been a picture in that place, and I stopped to examine it.  It
was a head of the Sphinx.  The calm, grand face was partially averted,
so that the sorrowful eyes, almost betraying the aching secret which the
still lips kept sacred, were hidden, &mdash; only the slight, tender droop in the
corner of the mouth told what their expression might be.  Around,
forever stretched the endless sands, &mdash; the mystery of life found in the
heart of death.  That mournful, eternal face gave me a strange feeling of
weariness and helplessness.  I felt as if I had already pressed eagerly to
the other side of the head, still only to find the voiceless lips and mute
eyes.  Strange tears sprang to my eyes; I hastily brushed them away,
and, leaving the Sphinx, mounted to my garret.</p>
<p>But the riddle followed me.  I sat down on the floor, beside a box
of books, and somewhat listlessly began pulling it over to examine the
contents.  The first book I took hold of was a little worn volume of
Herodotus that had belonged to my father.  I opened it; and as if it, too,
were a link in the chain of influences which I half felt was being forged
around me, it opened at the first part of "Euterpe," where Herodotus is
speculating upon the phenomena of the Nile.  Twenty-two hundred
years, &mdash; I thought, &mdash; and we are still wondering, the Sphinx is still
silent, and we yet in the darkness!  Alas, if this riddle be insoluble, how
can we hope to find the clue to deeper problems?  If there are places on
our little earth whither our feet cannot go, curtains that our hands cannot
withdraw, how can we expect to track paths through realms of thought, --how to voyage in those airy, impalpable regions whose existence we
are sure of only while we are there voyaging? </p>
<p>"Nilus in extremum fugit perterritus orbem</p>
<p>Occuluitque caput, quod adhuc latet."  Lost through reckless
presumption, might not earnest humility recover that mysterious
lurking-place?  Might not one, by devoted toil, by utter self-sacrifice,
with eyes purified by long searching from worldly and selfish pollution, --might not such a one tear away the veil of centuries, and, even though
dying in the attempt, gain one look into this arcanum?  Might not I? &mdash;
The unutterable thought thrilled me and left me speechless, even in
thinking.  I strained my forehead against the darkness, as if I could grind
the secret from the void air.  Then I experienced the following mental
sensation, &mdash; which, being purely mental, I cannot describe precisely as it
was, but will translate it as nearly as possible into the language of
physical phenomena.</p>
<p>It was as if my mind &mdash; or, rather, whatever that passive
substratum is that underlies our volition and more truly represents
ourselves &mdash; were a still lake, lying quiet and indifferent.  Presently the
sense of some coming Presence sent a breathing ripple over its waters;
and immediately afterward it felt a sweep as of trailing garments, and
two arms were thrown around it, and it was pressed against a
"life-giving bosom," whose vivifying

 <pb n="396"/>
warmth interpenetrating the whole body of the lake, its waters rose,
moved by a mighty influence, in the direction of that retreating Presence;
and again, though nothing was seen, I felt surely whither was that
direction.  It was NILE-WARD.  I knew, with the absolute certainty of
intuition, that henceforth I was one of the <hi rend="italic">kletoi</hi>, the
chosen, &mdash; selected from thousands of ages, millions of people, for this
one destiny.  Henceforth a sharp dividing-line cut me off from all others:
<hi rend="italic">their</hi> appointment was to trade, navigate, eat and drink,
marry and give in marriage, and the rest; mine was to discover the
Source of the Nile.  Hither had all the threads of my life been
converging for many years; they had now reached their focus, and
henceforth their course was fixed.</p>
<p>I was scarcely surprised the next day at receiving a letter from my
employers appointing me to a situation as supercargo of a
merchant-vessel bound on a three-years' voyage to America and China, --in returning thence, to sail up the Mediterranean, and stop at
Alexandria.  I immediately wrote an acceptance, and then busied myself
about obtaining a three-years' tenant for my house.  As the house was
desirable and well-situated, this business was soon arranged; and then, as
I had nothing further to do in the village, I left it for the last time, as it
proved, and returned to the city, &mdash; whence, after a fortnight of
preparation, I set sail on my eventful enterprise.  Although our voyage
was filled with incident that in another place would be interesting enough
to relate, yet here I must omit all mention of it, and, passing over three
years, resume my narrative at Alexandria, where I left the vessel, and
finally broke away from mercantile life.</p>
<p>From Alexandria I travelled to Cairo, where I intended to hire a
servant and a boat, for I wished to try the water-passage in preference to
the land.  The cheapness of labor and food rendered it no difficult matter
to obtain my boat and provision it for a long voyage, &mdash; for how long I
did not tell the Egyptian servant whom I hired to attend me.  A certain
feeling of fatality caused me to make no attempt at disguise, although
disguise was then much more necessary than it has been since: I openly
avowed my purpose of travelling on the Nile for pleasure, as a private
European.  My accoutrements were simple and few.  Arms, of course, I
carried, and the actual necessaries for subsistence; but I entirely forgot to
prepare for sketching, scientific surveys, etc.  My whole mind was
possessed with one idea: to see, to discover; &mdash; plans for turning my
discoveries to account were totally foreign to my thoughts.</p>
<p>So, on the 6th of November, 1824, we set sail.  I had been waiting
three years to arrive at this starting-point, &mdash; my whole life, indeed, had
been dumbly turning towards it, &mdash; yet now I commenced it with a
coolness and tranquillity far exceeding that I had possessed on many
comparatively trifling occasions.  It is often so.  We are borne along on
the current like drift-wood, and, spying jutting rocks or tremendous
cataracts ahead, fancy, "Here we shall be stranded, there buoyed up,
there dashed in pieces over those falls," &mdash; but, for all that, we glide over
those threatened catastrophes in a very commonplace manner, and are
aware of what we have been passing only upon looking back at them.
So no one sees the great light shining from Heaven, &mdash; for the people are
blear-eyed, and Saul is blinded.  But as I left Cairo in the greatening
distance, floating onward to the heart of the mysterious river, I floated
also into the twin current of thought, that, flowing full and impetuous
from the shores of the peopled Mediterranean, follows the silent river,
and tracks it to its hidden lurking-place in the blank desert.  Onward,
past the breathless sands of the Libyan Desert, past the hundred-gated
Thebes, past the stone guardians of Abou-Simbel, waiting in majestic
patience for their spell of silence to be broken, &mdash; onward.  It struck me
curiously to come to the cataract, and be obliged to leave my boat at the
foot of the first fall, and hire another above the second, &mdash; a forcible
reminder

 <pb n="397"/>
that I was travelling backwards, from the circumference to the centre
from which that circumference had been produced, faintly feeling my
way along a tide of phenomena to the <hi rend="italic">noumenon</hi> supporting
them.  So we always progress: from arithmetic to geometry, from
observation to science, from practice to theory, and play with edged
tools long before we know what knives mean.  For, like
Hop-o'-my-Thumb and his brothers, we are driven out early in the
morning to the edge of the forest, and are obliged to grope our way back
to the little house whence we come, by the crumbs dropped on the road.
Alack! how often the birds have eaten our bread, and we are captured by
the giant lying in wait!</p>
<p>On we swept, leaving behind the burning rocks and dreary sands
of Egypt and Lower Nubia, the green woods and thick acacias of
Dongola, the distant pyramids of Mount Birkel, and the ruins of Meroe,
just discovered footmarks of Ancient Ethiopia descending the Nile to
bequeathe her glory and civilization to Egypt.  At Old Dongola, my
companion was very anxious that we should strike across the country to
Shendy, to avoid the great curve of the Nile through Ethiopia.  He found
the sail somewhat tedious, as I could speak but little Egyptian, which I
had picked up in scraps, &mdash; he, no German or English.  I managed to
overrule his objections, however, as I could not bear to leave any part of
the river unvisited; so we continued the water-route to the junction of the
Blue and the White Nile, where I resolved to remain a week, before
continuing my route.  The inhabitants regarded us with some suspicion,
but our inoffensive appearance so far conquered their fears that they
were prevailed upon to give us some information about the country, and
to furnish us with a fresh supply of rice, wheat, and dourra, in exchange
for beads and bright-colored cloth, which I had brought with me for the
purpose of such traffic, if it should be necessary.  Bruce's discovery of
the source of the Blue Nile, fifty years before, prevented the necessity of
indecision in regard to my route, and so completely was I absorbed in
the one object of my journey, that the magnificent scenery and ruins
along the Blue Nile, which had so fascinated Cailliaud, presented few
allurements for me.</p>
<p>My stay was rather longer than I had anticipated, as it was found
necessary to make some repairs upon the boat, and, inwardly fretting at
each hour's delay, I was eager to seize the first opportunity for starting
again.  On the 1st of March, I made a fresh beginning for the more
unknown and probably more perilous portion of my voyage, having been
about four months in ascending from Cairo.  As my voyage had
commenced about the abatement of the sickly season, I had experienced
no inconvenience from the climate, and it was in good spirits that I
resumed my journey.  For several days we sailed with little eventful
occurring, &mdash; floating on under the cloudless sky, rippling a long white
line through the widening surface of the ever-flowing river, through
floating beds of glistening lotus-flowers, past undulating ramparts of
foliage and winged ambak-blossoms guarding the shores scaled by
adventurous vines that triumphantly waved their banners of white and
purple and yellow from the summit, winding amid bowery islands
studding the broad stream like gems, smoothly stemming the rolling
flood of the river, flowing, ever flowing, &mdash; lurking in the cool shade of
the dense mimosa forests, gliding noiselessly past the trodden lairs of
hippopotami and lions, slushing through the reeds swaying to and fro in
the green water, still borne along against the silent current of the
mysterious river, flowing, ever flowing.</p>
<p>We had now arrived at the land of the Dinkas, where the river, by
broadening too much upon a low country, had become partially devoured
by marsh and reeds, and our progress was very slow, tediously dragging
over a sea of water and grass.  I had become a little tired of my
complete loneliness, and was almost longing for some collision with the
tribes of savages that throng the shore, when

 <pb n="398"/>
the incident occurred that determined my whole future life.  One
morning, about seven o'clock, when the hot sun had already begun to
rob the day of the delicious freshness lingering around the tropical night,
we happened to be passing a tract of firmer land than we had met with
for some time, and I directed the vessel towards the shore, to gather
some of the brilliant lotus-flowers that fringed the banks.  As we neared
the land, I threw my gun, without which I never left the boat, on the
bank, preparatory to leaping out, when I was startled by hearing a loud,
cheery voice exclaim in English, &mdash; "Hilloa! not so fast, if you please!" --and first the head and then the sturdy shoulders of a white man raised
themselves slowly from the low shrubbery by which they were
surrounded.  He looked at us for a minute or two, and nodded with a
contented air that perplexed me exceedingly.</p>
<p>"So," he said, "you have come at last; I am tired of waiting for
you"; and he began to collect his gun, knife, etc., which were lying on
the ground beside him.</p>
<p>"And who are you," I returned, "who lie in wait for me?  I think,
Sir, you have the advantage."</p>
<p>Here the stranger interrupted me with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," he cried, "you are entirely mistaken.  The
technical advantage that you attribute to me is an error, as I do
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> have the honor of knowing your name, though you may
know mine without further preface, &mdash; Frederick Herndon; and the real
advantage which I wish to avail myself of, a boat, is obviously on your
side.  The long and the short of it is," he added, (composedly extricating
himself from the brushwood,) "that, travelling up in this direction for
discovery and that sort of thing, you know, I heard at Sennaar that a
white man with an Egyptian servant had just left the town, and were
going in my direction in a boat.  So I resolved to overtake them, and
with their, or your, permission, join company.  But they, or you, kept
just in advance, and it was only by dint of a forced march in the night
that I passed you.  I learned at the last Dinka village that no such party
had been yet seen, and concluded to await your arrival here, where I
pitched my tent a day and a night waiting for you.  I am heartily glad to
see you, I assure you."</p>
<p>With this explanation, the stranger made a spring, and leaped upon
the yacht.</p>
<p>"Upon my word," said I, still bewildered by his sudden
appearance, "you are very unceremonious."</p>
<p>"That," he rejoined, "is a way we Americans have.  We cannot
stop to palaver.  What would become of our manifest destiny?  But since
you are so kind, I will call my Egyptian.  Times are changed since we
were bondsmen in Egypt, have they not?  Ah, I forgot, &mdash; you are not an
American, and therefore cannot claim even our remote connection with
the Ten Lost Tribes."  Then raising his voice, "Here, Ibrahim!"</p>
<p>Again a face, but this time a swarthy one, emerged from behind a
bush, and in answer to a few directions in his own dialect the man came
down to the boat, threw in the tent and some other articles of traveller's
furniture, and sprang in with the <hi rend="italic">nonchalance</hi> of his
master.</p>
<p>A little recovered from my first surprise, I seized the opportunity
of a little delay in getting the boat adrift again to examine my new
companion.  He was standing carelessly upon the little deck of the vessel
where he had first entered, and the strong morning light fell full upon his
well-knit figure and apparently handsome face.  The forehead was rather
low, prominent above the eyebrows, and with keen, hollow temples, but
deficient both in comprehensiveness and ideality.  The hazel eyes were
brilliant, but restless and shallow, &mdash; the mouth of good size, but with
few curves, and perhaps a little too close for so young a face.  The
well-cut nose and chin, and clean fine outline of face, the self-reliant
pose of the neck and confident set of the shoulders characterized him as
decisive and energetic, while the pleasant and

 <pb n="399"/>
rather boyish smile that lighted up his face dispelled presently the
peculiarly hard expression I had at first found in analyzing it.  Whether
it was the hard, shrewd light from which all the tender and delicate grace
of the early morning had departed, I knew not; but it struck me that I
could not find a particle of shade in his whole appearance.  I seemed at
once to take him in, as one sees the whole of a sunny country where
there are no woods or mountains or valleys.  And, in fact, I never did
find any, &mdash; never any cool recesses in his character; and as no sudden
depths ever opened in his eyes, so nothing was ever left to be revealed in
his character; &mdash; like them, it could be sounded at once.  That picture of
him, standing there on my deck, with an indefinite expression of
belonging to the place, as he would have belonged on his own hearth-rug
at home, often recurred to me, again to be renewed and
confirmed.</p>
<p>And thus carelessly was swept into my path, as a stray waif, that
man who would in one little moment change my whole life!  It is always
so.  Our life sweeps onward like a river, brushing in here a little sand,
there a few rushes, till the accumulated drift-wood chokes the current,
or some larger tree falling across it turns it into a new channel.</p>
<p>I had been so long unaccustomed to company that I found it quite a
pleasant change to have some one to talk to; some one to sympathize
with I neither wanted nor expected; I certainly did not find such a one in
my new acquaintance.  For the first two or three days I simply regarded
him with the sort of wondering curiosity with which we examine a new
natural phenomenon of any sort.  His perfect self-possession and
coolness, the <hi rend="italic">nil-admirari</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nil-agitari</hi>
atmosphere which surrounded him, excited my admiration at first, till I
discovered that it arose, not from the composure of a mind too
deep-rooted to be swayed by external circumstances, but rather from a
peculiar hardness and unimpressibility of temperament that kept him on
the same level all the time.  He had been born at a certain temperature,
and still preserved it, from a sort of <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi> of
constitution.  This impenetrability had the effect of a somewhat buoyant
disposition, not because he could be buoyed on the tide of any strong
emotion, but because few things could disturb or excite him.  Unable to
grasp the significance of anything outside of himself and his attributes,
he took immense pride in stamping <hi rend="italic">his</hi> character,
<hi rend="italic">his</hi> nationality, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> practicality, upon every series
of circumstances by which he was surrounded: he sailed up the Nile as if
it were the Mississippi; although a well-enough-informed man, he
practically ignored the importance of any city anterior to the Plymouth
Settlement, or at least to London, which had the honor of sending
colonists to New England; and he would have discussed American
politics in the heart of Africa, had not my ignorance upon the topic
generally excluded it from our conversation.  He had what is most
wrongly termed an exceedingly practical mind, &mdash; that is, not one that
appreciates the practical existence and value of thought as such,
considering that a <hi rend="italic">praxis</hi>, but a mind that denied the
existence of a thought until it had become realized in visible
action.</p>
<p>"'The end of a man is an action, and not a thought, though it be
the noblest,' as Carlyle has well written," he triumphantly quoted to me,
as leaning over the little railing of the yacht, watching, at least I was, the
smooth, green water gliding under the clean-cutting keel, we had been
talking earnestly for some time.  "A thought has value only as it is a
potential action; if the action be abortive, the thought is as useless as a
crank that fails to move an engine-wheel."</p>
<p>"Then, if action is the wheel, and thought only the crank, what
does the body of your engine represent?  For what purpose are your
wheels turning?  For the sake of merely moving?"</p>
<p>"No," said he, "moving to promote another action, and
<hi rend="italic">that</hi> another, &mdash; and &mdash; so on <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi>."</p>

<p>"Then you leave out of your scheme a real engine, with a journey
to accomplish,

 <pb n="400"/>
and an end to arrive at; for so wheels would only move wheels, and
there would be an endless chain of machinery, with no plan, no object
for its existence.  Does not the very necessity we feel of having a reason
for the existence, the operation of anything, a large plan in which to
gather up all ravelled threads of various objects, proclaim thought as the
final end, the real thing, of which action, more especially human action,
is but the inadequate visible expression?  What kinds of action does
Carlyle mean, that are to be the wheels for our obedient thoughts to set
in motion?  Hand, arm, leg, foot action?  These are all our operative
machinery.  Does he mean that our 'noblest thought' is to be chained as
a galley-slave to these, to give them means for working a channel
through which motive power may be poured in upon them?  Are we to
think that our fingers and feet may move and so we live, or they to run
for our thought, and we live to think?"</p>
<p>"Supposing we <hi rend="italic">are</hi>," said Herndon, "what practical
good results from knowing it?  Action for action's sake, or for thinking's
sake, is still action, and all that we have to look out for.  What business
have the brakemen at the wheels with the destiny of the train?  Their
business is simply to lock and unlock the wheels; so that their end is in
the wheels, and not in the train."</p>
<p>"A somewhat dreary end," I said, half to myself.  "The whole
world, then, must content itself with spinning one blind action out of
another; which means that we must continually alter or displace
something, merely to be able to displace and alter something
else."</p>
<p>"On the contrary, we exchange vague, speculative mystifications
for definite, tangible fact.  In America we have too much reality, too
many iron and steam facts, to waste much time over mere thinking.
That, Sir, does for a sleepy old country, begging your pardon, like
yours; but for one that has the world's destiny in its hands, &mdash; that is
laying iron footpaths from the Atlantic to the Pacific for future
civilization to take an evening stroll along to see the sun set, &mdash; that is
converting black wool into white cotton, to clothe the inhabitants of
Borrioboolagha, &mdash;  that is trading, farming, electing, governing,
fighting, annexing, destroying, building, puffing, blowing, steaming,
racing, as our young two-hundred-year-old is, &mdash; we must work, we must
act, and think afterwards.  Whatsoever thy <hi rend="italic">hand</hi> findeth to
do, do it with thy might."</p>
<p>"And what," I said, "when hand-and-foot-action shall have ceased?
will you then allow some play for thought-action?"</p>
<p>"We have no time to think of that," he returned, walking away,
and thus stopping our conversation.</p>
<p>The man was consistent in his theory, at least.  Having exalted
physical motion (or action) to the place he did, he refused to see that the
action he prized was more valuable through the thought it developed;
consequently he reduced all actions to the same level, and prided himself
upon stripping a deed of all its marvellousness or majesty.  He did
uncommon things in such a matter-of-fact way that he made them
common by the performance.  The faint spiritual double which I found
lurking behind his steel and iron he either solidified with his metallic
touch or pertinaciously denied its existence.</p>
<p>"Plato was a fool," he said, "to talk of an ideal table; for,
supposing he could see it, and prove its existence, what good could it
do?  You can neither eat off it, nor iron on it, nor do anything else with
it; so, for all practical purposes, a pine table serves perfectly well
without hunting after the ideal.  I want something that I can go up to,
and know it is there by seeing and touching."</p>
<p>"But," said I, "does not that very susceptibility to bodily contact
remove the table to an indefinite distance from you?  If we can see and
handle a thing, and yet not be able to hold that subtile property of
generic existence, by which, one table being made, an infinite class is
created, so real that tables may actually be

 <pb n="401"/>
modelled on it, and yet so indefinite that you cannot get your hand on
any table or collection of tables and say, 'It is here,' &mdash; if we can be
absolutely conscious that we see the table, and yet have no idea how its
image reflected on our retina can produce that absolute consciousness,
does not the table grow dim and misty, and slip far away out of reach,
of apprehension, much more of comprehension?"</p>
<p>"Stuff!" cried my companion.  "If your metaphysics lead to
proving that a board that I am touching with my hand is not there, I'll
say, as I have already said, 'Throw (meta)physics to the dogs!  I'll none
of it!'  A fine preparation for living in a material world, where we have
to live in matter, by matter, and for matter, to wind one's self up in a
snarl that puts matter out of reach, and leaves us with nothing to live in,
or by, or for!  Now <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, for instance, are not content with
this poor old Nile as it stands, but must go fussing and wondering and
mystifying about it till you have positively nothing of a river left.  I look
at the water, the banks, the trees growing on them, the islands in which
we get occasionally entangled: here, at least, I have a real, substantial
river, &mdash; not equal for navigation to the Ohio or Mississippi, but still
very fair. &mdash; Confound these flies!" he added, parenthetically, making a
vigorous plunge at a dark cloud of the little pests that were closing down
upon us.</p>
<p>"Then you see nothing strange and solemn in this wonderful
stream? nothing in the weird civilization crouching at the feet, vainly
looking to the head of its master hidden in the clouds? nothing in the
echoing footsteps of nations passing down its banks to their destiny?
nothing in the solemn, unbroken silence brooding over the fountain
whence sprang this marvellous river, to bear precious gifts to thousands
and millions, and again retreat unknown?  Is there no mystery in
unsolved questions, no wonder in miracles, no awe in
inapproachability?"</p>
<p>"I see," said he, steadily, "that a river of some thousand miles
long has run through a country peopled by contented, or ignorant, or
barbarous people, none of whom, of course, would take the slightest
interest in tracing the river; that the dangers that have guarded the
marvellous secret, as you call it, are not intrinsic to the secret itself, but
are purely accidental and contingent.  There is no more reason why the
source of the Nile should not be found than that of the Connecticut; so I
do not see that it is really at all inapproachable or awful."</p>
<p>"What in the world, Herndon," cried I, in desperation, "what in
the name of common sense ever induced you to set out on this
expedition?  What do you want to discover the source of the Nile
for?"</p>
<p>He answered with the ready air of one who has long ago made up
his mind confidently on the subject he is going to speak about.</p>
<p>"It has long been evident to me, that civilization, flowing in a
return current from America, must penetrate into Africa, and turn its
immense natural advantages to such account, that it shall become the seat
of the most flourishing and important empires of the earth.  These,
however, should be consolidated, and not split up into multitudinous
missionary stations.  If a stream of immigration could be started from the
eastern side, up the Nile for instance, penetrating to the interior, it might
meet the increased tide of a kindred nature from the west, and uniting
somewhere in the middle of Soudan, the central point of action, the
capital city could be founded there, as a heart for the country, and a
complete system of circulation be established.  By this method of
entering the country at both sides simultaneously, of course its complete
subjugation could be accomplished in half the time that it would take for
a body of emigrants, however large, to make headway from the western
coast alone.  About the source of the Nile I intend to mark out the site
for my city, and then" &mdash; </p>
<p>"And call it," I added, "Herndonville."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," he said, gravely.  "At all

 <pb n="402"/>
events, my name will be inseparably connected with the enterprise; and
if I can get the steamboat started during my lifetime, I shall make a
comfortable fortune from the speculation."</p>
<p>"What a gigantic scheme!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Ah," he said, complacently, "we Americans don't stick at
trifles."</p>
<p>"Oh, marvellous practical genius of America!" I cried, "to eclipse
Herodotus and Diodorus, not to mention Bruce and Cailliaud, and
inscribe Herndonville on the arcanum of the Innermost!  If the
Americans should discover the origin of evil, they would run up
penitentiaries all over the country, modelled to suit 'practical
purposes.'"</p>
<p>"I think that would pay," said Herndon, reflectively.</p>
<p>But though I then stopped the conversation, yet I felt its influence
afterwards.  The divine enthusiasm for <hi rend="italic">knowing</hi>, that had
inspired me for the last three years, and had left no room for any other
thought in connection with the discovery, &mdash; this enthusiasm felt chilled
and deadened.  I felt reproached that I had not thought of founding a
Pottsville or Jenkinsville, and my grand purpose seemed small and vague
and indefinite.  The vivid, living thoughts that had enkindled me fell
back cold and lifeless into the tedious, reedy water.  For we had now
reached the immense shallow lake that Werne has since described, and
the scenery had become flat and monotonous, as if in sympathy with the
low, marshy place to which my mind had been driven.  The intricate
windings of the river, after we had passed the lake, rendered the
navigation very slow and difficult; and the swarms of flies, that plagued
us for the first time seriously, brought petty annoyances to view more
forcibly than we had experienced in all our voyage before.</p>
<p>After some days' pushing in this way, now driven by a strong head
wind almost back from our course, again, by a sudden change, carried
rapidly many miles on our journey, &mdash; after some days of this sailing, we
arrived at a long, low reef of rocks.  The water here became so shallow
and boisterous that further attempt at sailing was impossible, and we
determined to take our boat to pieces as much as we could, and carry it
with us, while we walked along the shore of the river.  I concluded,
from the marked depression in the ground we had just passed, that there
must be a corresponding elevation about here, to give the water a
sufficient head to pass over the high ground below; and the almost
cataract appearance of the river added strength to my hypothesis.  We
were all four armed to the teeth, and the natives had shown themselves,
hitherto, either so friendly or so indifferent that we did not have much
apprehension on account of personal safety.  So we set out with beating
hearts.  Our path was exceedingly difficult to traverse, leading chiefly
among low trees and over the sharp stones that had rolled from the river,
&mdash; now close by the noisy stream, which babbled and foamed as if it had
gone mad, &mdash; now creeping on our knees through bushes, matted with
thick, twining vines, &mdash; now wading across an open morass, &mdash; now in
mimosa woods, or slipping in and out of the feathery dhelb-palms.</p>

<p>Since our conversation spoken of above, Herndon and I had talked
little with each other, and now usually spoke merely of the incidents of
the journey, the obstacles, etc.; we scarcely mentioned that for which we
were both longing with intense desire, and the very thoughts of which
made my heart beat quicker and the blood rush to my face.  One day we
came to a place where the river made a bend of about two miles and
then passed almost parallel to our point of view.  I proposed to Herndon
that he should pursue the course of the river, and that I would strike a
little way back into the country, and make a short cut across to the other
side of the bend, where he and the men would stop, pitch our night-tent,
and wait for me.  Herndon assented, and we parted.  The low fields
around us changed, as I went on, to firm, hard, rising

 <pb n="403"/>
ground, that gradually became sandy and arid.  The luxuriant vegetation
that clung around the banks of the river seemed to be dried up little by
little, until only a few dusty bushes and thorn-acacias studded in clumps
a great, sandy, and rocky tract of country, which rolled monotonously
back from the river border with a steadily increasing elevation.  A sandy
plain never gives me a sense of real substance; it always seems as if it
must be merely a covering for something, &mdash; a sheet thrown over the bed
where a dead man is lying.  And especially here did this broad,
trackless, seemingly boundless desert face me with its blank negation,
like the old obstinate "No" which Nature always returns at first to your
eager questioning.  It provoked me, this staring reticence of the scenery,
and stimulated me to a sort of dogged exertion.  I think I walked steadily
for about three hours over the jagged rocks and burning sands,
interspersed with a few patches of straggling grass, &mdash; all the time up
hill, with never a valley to vary the monotonous climbing, &mdash; until the
bushes began to thicken in about the same manner as they had thinned
into the desert, the grass and herbage herded closer together under my
feet, and, beating off the ravenous sand, gradually expelled the last trace
of it, a few tall trees strayed timidly among the lower shrubbery,
growing more and more thickly, till I found myself at the border of an
apparently extensive forest.  The contrast was great between the view
before and behind me.  Behind lay the road I had achieved, the
monotonous, toilsome, wearisome desert, the dry, formal introduction,
as it were, to my coming journey.  Before, long, cool vistas opened
green through delicious shades, &mdash; a track seemed to be almost made over
the soft grass, that wound in and out among the trees, and lost itself in
interminable mazes.  I plunged into the profound depths of the still
forest, and confidently followed for path the first open space in which I
found myself.</p>
<p>It was a strangely still wood for the tropics, &mdash; no chattering
parroquets, no screaming magpies, none of the sneering, gibing
dissonances that I had been accustomed to, &mdash; all was silent, and yet
intensely living.  I fancied that the noble trees took pleasure in growing,
they were so energized with life in every leaf.  I noticed another
peculiarity, &mdash; there was little underbrush, little of the luxuriance of vines
and creepers, which is so striking in an African forest.  Parasitic-life,
luxurious idleness, seemed impossible here; the atmosphere was too
sacred, too solemn, for the fantastic ribaldry of scarlet runners, of
flaunting yellow streamers.  The lofty boughs interlaced in arches
overhead, and the vast dim aisles opened far down in the tender gloom
of the wood and faded slowly away in the distance.  And every little
spray of leaves that tossed airily in the pleasant breeze, every slender
branch swaying gently in the wind, every young sapling pushing its
childish head panting for light through the mass of greenery and
quivering with golden sunbeams, every trunk of aged tree gray with
moss and lichens, every tuft of flowers, seemed thrilled and vivified by
some wonderful knowledge which it held secret, some consciousness of
boundless, inexhaustible existence, some music of infinite unexplored
thought concealing treasures of unlimited action.  And it was the
knowledge, the consciousness, that it was unlimited which seemed to
give such elastic energy to this strange forest.  But at all events, it was
such a relief to find the everlasting negation of the desert nullified, that
my dogged resolution insensibly changed to an irrepressible enthusiasm,
which bore me lightly along, scarcely sensible of fatigue.</p>
<p>The ascent had become so much steeper, and parts of the forest
seemed to slope off into such sudden declivities and even precipices, that
I concluded I was ascending a mountain, and, from the length of time I
had been in the forest, I judged that it must be of considerable height.
The wood suddenly broke off as it had begun, and, emerging from the
cool shade, I found myself in a complete wilderness of rock.  Rocks of
enormous size were

 <pb n="404"/>
thrown about in apparently the wildest confusion, on the side of what I
now perceived to be a high mountain.  How near the summit I was I had
no means of determining, as huge boulders blocked up the view at a few
paces ahead.  I had had about eight hours' tramp, with scarcely any
cessation; yet now my excitement was too great to allow me to pause to
eat or rest.  I was anxious to press on, and determine that day the secret
which I was convinced lay entombed in this sepulchre.  So again I
pressed onward, &mdash; this time more slowly, &mdash; having to pick my way
among the bits of jagged granite filling up terraces sliced out of the
mountain, around enormous rocks projecting across my path, &mdash;
overhanging precipices that sheered straight down into dark abysses, (I
must have verged round to a different side from that I came up on,) --creeping through narrow passages formed by the junction of two
immense boulders.  Tearing my hands with the sharp corners of the
rocks, I climbed in vain hope of at last seeing the summit.  Still rocks
piled on rocks faced my wearied eyes, vainly striving to pierce through
some chink or cranny into the space behind them.  Still rocks, rocks,
rocks, against whose adamantine sides my feeble will dashed restlessly
and impotently.  My eyeballs almost burst, as it seemed, in the intense
effort to strain through those stone prison-walls.  And by one of those
curious links of association by which two distant scenes are united as
one, I seemed again to be sitting in my garret, striving to pierce the
darkness for an answer to the question then raised, and at the same
moment passed over me, like the sweep of angels' wings, the
consciousness of that Presence which had there infolded me.  And with
that consciousness, the eager, irritated waves of excitement died away,
and there was a calm, in which I no longer beat like a caged beast
against the never-ending rocks, but, borne irresistibly along in the strong
current of a mighty, still emotion, pressed on with a certainty that left no
room for excitement, because none for doubt.  And so I came upon it.
Swinging round one more rock, hanging over a breathless precipice, and
landing upon the summit of the mountain, I beheld it stretched at my
feet: a lake about five miles in circumference, bedded like an eye in the
naked, bony rock surrounding it, with quiet rippling waters placidly
smiling in the level rays of the afternoon sun, &mdash;  the Unfathomable
Secret, the Mystery of Ages, the long sought for, the Source of the
Nile.</p>
<p>For, from a broad cleft in the rocks, the water hurled itself out of
its hiding-place, and, dashing down over its rocky bed, rushed impetuous
over the sloping country, till, its force being spent, it waded tediously
through the slushing reeds of the hill-land again, and so rolled down to
sea.  For, while I stood there, it seemed as if my vision were
preternaturally sharpened, and I followed the bright river in its course,
through the alternating marsh and desert, &mdash; through the land where Zeus
went banqueting among the blameless Ethiopians, &mdash; through the land
where the African princes watched from afar the destruction of
Cambyses's army, &mdash; past Meroe, Thebes, Cairo; bearing upon its
heaving bosom anon the cradle of Moses, the gay vessels of the
inundation festivals, the stately processions of the mystic priesthood, the
gorgeous barge of Cleopatra, the victorious trireme of Antony, the
screaming vessels of fighting soldiers, the stealthy boats of Christian
monks, the glittering, changing, flashing tumult of thousands of years of
life, &mdash; ever flowing, ever ebbing, with the mystic river, on whose
surface it seethed and bubbled.  And the germ of all this vast varying
scene lay quietly hidden in the wonderful lake at my feet.  But human
life is always composed of inverted cones, whose bases, upturned to the
eye, present a vast area, diversified with countless phenomena; but when
the screen that closes upon them a little below the surface is removed,
we shall be able to trace the many-lined figures, each to its simple
apex, &mdash; one little point containing the essence and secret of the whole.
Once or twice in the course of a lifetime are a

 <pb n="405"/>
few men permitted to catch a glimpse of these awful Beginnings, &mdash; to
touch for a minute the knot where all the tangled threads ravel
themselves out smoothly.  I had found such a place, &mdash; had had such an
ineffable vision, &mdash; and overwhelmed with tremendous awe, I sank on my
knees, lost in GOD.</p>
<p>After a little while, as far as I can recollect, I rose and began to
take the customary observations, marked the road by which I had come
up the mountain, and planned a route for rejoining Herndon.  But ere
long all subordinate thoughts and actions seemed to be swallowed up in
the great tide of thought and feeling that overmastered me.  I scarcely
remember anything from the time when the lake first burst upon my
view, till I met Herndon again.  But I know, that, as the day was nearly
spent, I was obliged to give up the attempt to travel back that night,
especially as I now began to feel the exhaustion attendant upon my long
journey and fasting.  I could not have slept among those rocks, eternal
guardians of the mighty secret.  The absence of all breathing, transitory
existence but my own rendered it too solemn for me to dare to intrude
there.  So I went back to the forest, (I returned much quicker than I had
come,) ate some supper, and, wrapped in a blanket I had brought with
me, went to sleep under the arching branches of a tree.  I have as little
recollection of my next day's journey, except that I defined a diagonal
and thus avoided the bend.  I found Herndon waiting in front of the tent,
rather impatient for my arrival.</p>
<p>"Halloo, old fellow!" he shouted, jumping up at seeing me, "I was
really getting scared about you.  Where have you been?  What have you
seen?  What are our chances?  Have you had any adventures? killed any
lions, or anything?  By-the-by, I had a narrow escape with one
yesterday.  Capital shot; but prudence is the better part of valor, you
know.  But, really," he said again, apparently struck by my abstraction
of manner, "what <hi rend="italic">have</hi> you seen?"</p>
<p>"I have found the source of the Nile," I said, simply.</p>
<p>Is it not strange, that, when we have a great thing to say, we are
always compelled to speak so simply in monosyllables?  Perhaps this,
too, is an example of the law that continually reduces many to one, &mdash;
the unity giving the substance of the plurality; but as the heroes of the
"Iliad" were obliged to repeat the messages of the gods
<hi rend="italic">literatim</hi>, so we must say a great thing as it comes to us, by
itself.  It is curious to me now, that I was not the least excited in
announcing the discovery, &mdash; not because I did not feel the force of it,
but because my mind was so filled, so to speak, so saturated, with the
idea, that it was perfectly even with itself, though raised to an immensely
higher level.  In smaller minds an idea seizes upon one part of them,
thus inequalizing it with the rest, and so, throwing them off their
balance, they are literally <hi rend="italic">de</hi>-ranged (or disarranged) with
excitement.  It was so with Herndon.  For a minute he stared at me in
stupefied astonishment, and then burst into a torrent of incoherent
congratulations.</p>
<p>"Why, Zeitzer!" he cried, "you are the lucky man, after all.  Why,
your fortune's made, &mdash; you'll be the greatest man of the age.  You must
come to America; that is the place for appreciating such things.  You'll
have a Common-Council dinner in Boston, and a procession in New
York.  Your book will sell like wildfire.  You'll be a lion of the first
magnitude.  Just think!  The Man who discovered the Source of the
Nile!"</p>
<p>I stood bewildered, like one suddenly awakened from sleep.  The
unusual excitement in one generally so self-possessed and indifferent as
my companion made me wonder sufficiently; but these allusions to my
greatness, my prospects, completely astounded me.  What had I done, &mdash;
I who had been chosen, and led step by step, with little interference of
my own, to this end?  What did this talk of noise and clamorous
notoriety mean?</p>
<p>"To think," Herndon ran on, "that you should have beaten me,
after all!

 <pb n="406"/>
that you should have first seen, first drunk of, first bathed in" &mdash; </p>

<p>"Drunk of! bathed in!" I repeated, mechanically.  "Herndon, are
you crazy?  Would I dare to profane the sacred fountain?"</p>
<p>He made no reply, unless a quizzical smile might be considered as
such, &mdash; but drew me within the tent, out of hearing of the two
Egyptians, and bade me give an account of my adventures.  When I had
finished, &mdash; </p>
<p>"This is grand!" he exclaimed.  "Now, if you will share the
benefits of this discovery with me, I will halve the cost of starting that
steamboat I spoke of, and our plan will soon be afloat.  I shouldn't
wonder, now, if one might not, in order to start the town, get up some
kind of a little summer-pavilion there, on the top of the mountain, --something on the plan of the Tip-Top House at Mount Washington, you
know, &mdash; hang the stars and stripes off the roof, if you're not particular,
and call it The Teuton-American.  That would give you your rightful
priority, you see.  By the beard of the Prophet, as they say in Cairo, the
thing would take!"</p>
<p>I laughed heartily at this idea, and tried, at first in jest, then
earnestly, to make him understand I had no such plans in connection
with my discovery; that I only wanted to extend the amount of
knowledge in the world, &mdash; not the number of ice-cream pavilions.  I
offered to let him take the whole affair into his own hands, &mdash; cost,
profit, and all.  I wanted nothing to do with it.  But he was too honest,
as he thought, for that, and still talked and argued, &mdash; giving his most
visionary plans a definite, tangible shape and substance by a certain
process of metallicizing, until they had not merely elbowed away the last
shadow of doubt, but had effectually taken possession of the whole
ground, and seemed to be the only consequences possible upon such a
discovery.  My dislike to personal traffic in the sublimities of truth
began to waver.  I felt keenly the force of the argument which Herndon
used repeatedly, that, if I did not thus claim the monopoly, (he talked
almost as if I had invented something,) some one else would, and so
injustice be added to what I had termed vulgarity.  I felt that I must
prevent injustice, at least.  Besides, what should I have to show for all
my trouble, (ah! little had I thought of <hi rend="italic">"I"</hi> or my trouble a
short time ago!) &mdash; what should I have gained, after all, &mdash;  nay, what
would there be gained for any one, &mdash; if I merely announced my
discovery, without &mdash; starting the steamboat?  And though I did feebly
query whether I should be equally bound to establish a communication,
with pecuniary emolument, to the North Pole, in case I discovered that,
his remark, that this was the Nile, and had nothing to do with the North
Pole, was so forcible and pertinent, that I felt ashamed of my suggestion;
and upon second thought, that idea of the dinner and procession really
had a good deal in it.  I had been in New York, and knew the length of
Broadway; and at the recollection, felt flattered by the thought of being
conveyed in an open chariot drawn by four or even eight horses, with
nodding plumes, (literal ones for the horses, &mdash; only metaphorical ones
for me,) past those stately buildings fluttering with handkerchiefs, and
through streets black with people thronging to see the man who had
solved the riddle of Africa.  And then it would be pleasant, too, to make
a neat little speech to the Common Council, &mdash; letting the brave show
catch its own tail in its mouth, by proving, that, if America did not
achieve everything, she could appreciate &mdash; yes, appreciate was the
word &mdash; those who did.  Yes, this would be a fitting consummation; I
would do it.</p>
<p>But, ah! how dim became the vision of that quiet lake on the
summit of the mountain!  How that vivid lightning-revelation faded into
obscurity!  Was Pharaoh again ascending his fatal chariot?</p>
<p>The next day we started for the ascent.  We determined to follow
the course of the river backwards around the bend and set out from my
former starting-point, as any other course might lead us into a

 <pb n="407"/>
hopeless dilemma.  We had no difficulty in finding the sandy plain, and
soon reached landmarks which I was sure were on the right road; but a
tramp of six or eight hours &mdash;  still in the road I had passed before --brought us no nearer to our goal.  In short, we wandered three days in
that desert, utterly in vain.  My heart sunk within me at every failure;
with sickening anxiety I scanned the horizon at every point, but nothing
was visible but stunted bushes and white pebbles glistening in the glaring
sand.</p>
<p>The fourth day came, &mdash; and Herndon at last stopped short, and
said, in his steady, immobile voice, &mdash; </p>
<p>"Zeitzer, you must have made this grand discovery in your
dreams.  There is no Nile up this way, &mdash; and our water-skins are almost
dry.  We had better return and follow up the course of the river where
we left it.  If we again fail, I shall return to Egypt to carry out my plan
for converting the Pyramids into ice-houses.  They are excellently well
adapted for the purpose, and in that country a good supply of ice is a
<hi rend="italic">desideratum</hi>.  Indeed, if my plan meets with half the success
it deserves, the antiquaries two centuries hence will conclude that ice
was the original use of those structures."</p>
<p>"Shade of Cheops, forbid!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Cheops be hanged!" returned my irreverent companion.  "The
world suffers too much now from overcrowded population to permit a
man to claim standing-room three thousand years after his death, &mdash;
especially when the claim is for some acres apiece, as in the case of
these pyramid-builders.  Will you go back with me?"</p>
<p>I declined for various reasons, not all very clear even to myself;
but I was convinced that his peculiar enticements were the cause of our
failure, and I hated him unreasonably for it.  I longed to get rid of him,
and of his influence over me.  Fool that I was!  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was the
sinner, and not he; for he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not see, because he was born
blind, while <hi rend="italic">I</hi> fell with my eyes open.  I still held on to the
vague hope, that, were I alone, I might again find that mysterious lake;
for I knew I had not dreamed.  So we parted.</p>
<p>But we two (my servant and I) were not left long alone in the
Desert.  The next day a party of natives surprised us, and, after some
desperate fighting, we were taken prisoners, sold as slaves from tribe to
tribe into the interior, and at length fell into the hands of some traders on
the western coast, who gave us our freedom.  Unwilling, however, to
return home without some definite success, I made several voyages in a
merchant-vessel.  But I was born for one purpose; failing in that, I had
nothing further to live for.  The core of my life was touched at that fatal
river, and a subtile disease has eaten it out till nothing but the rind is
left.  A wave, gathering to the full its mighty strength, had upreared
itself for a moment majestically above its fellows, &mdash;  falling, its
scattered spray can only impotently sprinkle the dull, dreary shore.
Broken and nerveless, I can only wait the lifting of the curtain, quietly
wondering if a failure be always irretrievable, &mdash; if a prize once lost can
never again be found.</p>
