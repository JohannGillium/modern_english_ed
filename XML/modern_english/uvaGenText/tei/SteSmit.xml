SECTION I.From Mr. Smith's Birth till the Publication of the Theory of
Moral Sentiments</head>
<div2 type="subsection" id="d6">


<p>Adam Smith, author of the Inquiry into the Nature and Causes
of the Wealth of Nations, was the son of Adam Smith, comptroller
of the customs at Kirkaldy,
<ref target="n1">[1]</ref>
and of Margaret Douglas, daughter
of Mr Douglas of Strathenry. He was the only child of the
marriage, and was born at Kirkaldy on the 5th of June 1723, a few
months after the death of his father.
</p><p>His constitution during infancy was infirm and sickly, and
required all the tender solicitude of his surviving parent. She
was blamed for treating him with an unlimited indulgence; but it
produced no unfavourable effects on his temper or his
dispositions: -- and he enjoyed the rare satisfaction of being
able to repay here affection, by every attention that filial
gratitude could dictate, during the long period of sixty years.
</p><p>An accident which happened to him when he was about three
years old, is of too interesting a nature to be omitted in the
account of so valuable a life. He had been carried by his mother
to Strathenry, on a visit to his uncle Mr Douglas, and was one
day amusing himself alone at the door of the house, when he was
stolen by a party of that set of vagrants who are known in
Scotland by the name of tinkers. Luckily he was soon missed by
his uncle, who, hearing that some vagrants had passed, pursued
them, with what assistance he could find, till he overtook them
in Leslie wood; and was the happy instrument of preserving to the
world a genius, which was destined, not only to extend the
boundaries of science, but to enlighten and reform the commercial
policy of Europe.
</p><p>The school of Kirkaldy, where Mr Smith received the first
rudiments of his education, was then taught by Mr David Miller, a
teacher, in his day, of considerable reputation, and whose name
deserves to be recorded, on account of the eminent men whom that
very obscure seminary produced while under his direction. Of this
number were Mr Oswald of Dunikeir;
<ref target="n2">[2]</ref>
his brother, Dr John
Oswald, afterwards Bishop of Raphoe; and our late excellent
colleague, the Reverend Dr John Drysdale: all of them nearly
contemporary with Mr Smith, and united with him through life by
the closest ties of friendship. One of his school-fellows is
still alive;
<ref target="n3">[3]</ref>
and to his kindness I am principally indebted
for the scanty materials which form the first part of this
narrative.
</p><p>Among these companions of his earliest years, Mr Smith soon
attracted notice, by his passion for books, and by the
extraordinary powers of his memory. The weakness of his bodily
constitution prevented him from partaking in their more active
amusements; but he was much beloved by them on account of his
temper, which, though warm, was to an uncommon degree friendly
and generous. Even then he was remarkable for those habits which
remained with him through life, of speaking to himself when
alone, and of absence in company.
</p><p>From the grammar-school of Kirkaldy, he was sent, in 1737, to
the university of Glasgow, where he remained till 1740, when he
went to Baliol college, Oxford, as an exhibitioner<ref
target="n4">[4]</ref> on Snell's foundation.
</p><p>Dr Maclaine of the Hague, who was a fellow-student of Mr
Smith's at Glasgow, told me some years ago, that his favourite
pursuits while at that university were mathematics and natural
philosophy; and I remember to have heard my father remind him of
a geometrical problem of considerable difficulty, about which he
was occupied at the time when their acquaintance commenced, and
which had been proposed to him as an exercise by the celebrated
Dr Simpson.
</p><p>These, however, were certainly not the sciences in which he
was formed to excel; nor did they long divert him from pursuits
more congenial to his mind. What Lord Bacon says of Plato may be
justly applied to him: 'Illum, licet ad rempublicam non
accessisset, tamen natura et inclinatione omnino ad res civiles
propensum, vires eo praecipue intendisse; neque de Philosophia
Naturali admodum sollicitum esse; nisi quatenus ad Philosophi
nomen et celebritatem tuendam, et ad majestatem quandam moralibus
et civilibus doctrinis addendam et aspergendam sufficeret.'<ref
target="n5">[5]</ref> The study of human nature in all its branches, more particularly
of the political history of mankind, opened a boundless field to
his curiosity and ambition; and while it afforded scope to all
the various powers of his versatile and comprehensive genius,
gratified his ruling passion, of contributing to the happiness
and the improvement of society. To this study, diversified at his
leisure hours by the less severe occupations of polite
literature, he seems to have devoted himself almost entirely from
the time of his removal to Oxford; but he still retained, and
retained even in advanced years, a recollection of his early
acquisitions, which not only added to the splendour of his
conversation, but enabled him to exemplify some of his favourite
theories concerning the natural progress of the mind in the
investigation of truth, by the history of those sciences in which
the connection and succession of discoveries may be traced with
the greatest advantage. If I am not mistaken too, the influence
of his early taste for the Greek geometry may be remarked in the
elementary clearness and fulness, bordering sometimes upon
prolixity, with which he frequently states his political
reasonings. -- The lectures of the profound and eloquent Dr
Hutcheson, which he had attended previous to his departure from
Glasgow, and of which he always spoke in terms of the warmest
admiration, had, it may be reasonably presumed, a considerable
effect in directing his talents to their proper objects.<ref
target="n6">[6]</ref>
</p><p>I have not been able to collect any information with respect
to that part of his youth which was spent in England. I have
heard him say, that he employed himself frequently in the
practice of translation, (particularly from the French), with a
view to the improvement of his own style: and he used often to
express a favourable opinion of the utility of such exercises, to
all who cultivate the art of composition. It is much to be
regretted, that none of his juvenile attempts in this way have
been preserved; as the few specimens which his writings contain
of his skill as a translator, are sufficient to shew the eminence
he had attained in a walk of literature, which, in our country,
has been so little frequented by men of genius.
</p><p>It was probably also at this period of his life, that he
cultivated with the greatest care the study of languages. The
knowledge he possessed of these, both ancient and modern, was
uncommonly extensive and accurate; and, in him, was subservient,
not to a vain parade of tasteless erudition, but to a familiar
acquaintance with every thing that could illustrate the
institutions, the manners, and the ideas of different ages and
nations. How intimately he had once been conversant with the more
ornamental branches of learning; in particular, with the works of
the Roman, Greek, French, and Italian Poets, appeared
sufficiently from the hold which they kept of his memory, after
all the different occupations and inquiries in which his maturer
faculties had been employed.
<ref target="n7">[7]</ref>
In the English language, the
variety of poetical passages which he was not only accustomed to
refer to occasionally, but which he was able to repeat with
correctness, appeared surprising even to those, whose attention
had never been directed to more important acquisitions.
</p><p>After a residence at Oxford of seven years, he returned to
Kirkaldy, and lived two years with his mother; engaged in study,
but without any fixed plan for his future life. He had been
originally destined for the Church of England, and with that view
had been sent to Oxford; but not finding the ecclesiastical
profession suitable to his taste, he chose to consult, in this
instance, his own inclination, in preference to the wishes of his
friends; and abandoning at once all the schemes which their
prudence had formed for him, he resolved to return to his own
country, and to limit his ambition to the uncertain prospect of
obtaining, in time, some one of those moderate preferments, to
which literary attainments lead in Scotland.
</p><p>In the year 1748, he fixed his residence at Edinburgh, and
during that and the following years, read lectures on rhetoric
and belles lettres, under the patronage of Lord Kames. About this
time, too, he contracted a very intimate friendship, which
continued without interruption till his death, with Mr Alexander
Wedderburn, now Lord Loughborough, and with Mr William Johnstone,
now Mr Pulteney.
</p><p>At what particular period his acquaintance with Mr David Hume
commenced, does not appear from any information that I have
received; but from some papers, now in the possession of Mr
Hume's nephew, and which he has been so obliging as to allow me
to peruse, their acquaintance seems to have grown into friendship
before the year 1752. It was a friendship on both sides founded
on the admiration of genius, and the love of simplicity; and,
which forms an interesting circumstance in the history of each of
these eminent men, from the ambition which both have shewn to
record it to posterity.
</p><p>In 1751, he was elected Professor of Logic in the University
of Glasgow; and, the year following, he was removed to the
Professorship of Moral Philosophy in the same University, upon
the death of Mr Thomas Craigie, the immediate successor of Dr
Hutcheson. In this situation he remained thirteen years; a period
he used frequently to look back to, as the most useful and happy
of his life. It was indeed a situation in which he was eminently
fitted to excel, and in which the daily labours of his profession
were constantly recalling his attention to his favourite
pursuits, and familiarizing his mind to those important
speculations he was afterwards to communicate to the world. In
this view, though it afforded, in the meantime, but a very narrow
scene for his ambition, it was probably instrumental, in no
inconsiderable degree, to the future eminence of his literary
character.
</p><p>Of Mr Smith's lectures while a Professor at Glasgow, no part
has been preserved, excepting what he himself published in the
Theory of Moral Sentiments, and in the Wealth of Nations. The
Society therefore, I am persuaded, will listen with pleasure to
the following short account of them, for which I am indebted to a
gentleman who was formerly one of Mr Smith's pupils, and who
continued till his death to be one of his most intimate and
valued friends.
<ref target="n8">[8]</ref>

</p><p>'In the Professorship of Logic, to which Mr Smith was
appointed on his first introduction into this University, he soon
saw the necessity of departing widely from the plan that had been
followed by his predecessors, and of directing the attention of
his pupils to studies of a more interesting and useful nature
than the logic and metaphysics of the schools. Accordingly, after
exhibiting a general view of the powers of the mind, and
explaining so much of the ancient logic as was requisite to
gratify curiosity with respect to an artificial method of
reasoning, which had once occupied the universal attention of the
learned, he dedicated all the rest of his time to the delivery of
a system of rhetoric and belles lettres. The best method of
explaining and illustrating the various powers of the human mind,
the most useful part of metaphysics, arises from an examination
of the several ways of communicating our thoughts by speech, and
from an attention to the principles of those literary
compositions which contribute to persuasion or entertainment. By
these arts, every thing that we perceive or feel, every operation
of our minds, is expressed and delineated in such a manner, that
it may be clearly distinguished and remembered. There is, at the
same time, no branch of literature more suited to youth at their
first entrance upon philosophy than this, which lays hold of
their taste and their feelings.
</p><p>'It is much to be regretted, that the manuscript containing
Mr Smith's lectures on this subject was destroyed before his
death. The first part, in point of composition, was highly
finished; and the whole discovered strong marks of taste and
original genius. From the permission given to students of taking
notes, many observations and opinions contained in these lectures
have either been detailed in separate dissertations, or engrossed
in general collections, which have since been given to the
public. But these, as might be expected, have lost the air of
originality and the distinctive character which they received
from their first author, and are often obscured by that
multiplicity of common-place matter in which they are sunk and
involved.
</p><p>'About a year after his appointment to the Professorship of
Logic, Mr Smith was elected to the chair of Moral Philosophy. His
course of lectures on this subject was divided into four parts.
The first contained Natural Theology; in which he considered the
proofs of the being and attributes of God, and those principles
of the human mind upon which religion is founded. The second
comprehended Ethics, strictly so called, and consisted chiefly of
the doctrines which he afterwards published in his Theory of
Moral Sentiments. In the third part, he treated at more length of
that branch of morality which relates to justice, and which,
being susceptible of precise and accurate rules, is for that
reason capable of a full and particular explanation.
</p><p>'Upon this subject he followed the plan that seems to be
suggested by Montesquieu; endeavouring to trace the gradual
progress of jurisprudence, both public and private, from the
rudest to the most refined ages, and to point out the effects of
those arts which contribute to subsistence, and to the
accumulation of property, in producing correspondent improvements
or alterations in law and government. This important branch of
his labours he also intended to give to the public; but this
intention, which is mentioned in the conclusion of the Theory of
Moral Sentiments, he did not live to fulfil.
</p><p>'In the last part of his lectures, he examined those
political regulations which are founded, not upon the principle
of justice, but that of expediency, and which are calculated to
increase the riches, the power, and the prosperity of a State.
Under this view, he considered the political institutions
relating to commerce, to finances, to ecclesiastical and military
establishments. What he delivered on these subjects contained the
substance of the work he afterwards published under the title of
An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.
</p><p>'There was no situation in which the abilities of Mr Smith
appeared to greater advantage than as a Professor. In delivering
his lectures, he trusted almost entirely to extemporary
elocution. His manner, though not graceful, was plain and
unaffected; and, as he seemed to be always interested in the
subject, he never failed to interest his hearers. Each discourse
consisted commonly of several distinct propositions, which he
successively endeavoured to prove and illustrate. These
propositions, when announced in general terms, had, from their
extent, not unfrequently something of the air of a paradox. In
his attempts to explain them, he often appeared, at first, not to
be sufficiently possessed of the subject, and spoke with some
hesitation. As he advanced, however, the matter seemed to crowd
upon him, his manner became warm and animated, and his expression
easy and fluent. In points susceptible of controversy, you could
easily discern, that he secretly conceived an opposition to his
opinions, and that he was led upon this account to support them
with greater energy and vehemence. By the fulness and variety of
his illustrations, the subject gradually swelled in his hands,
and acquired a dimension which, without a tedious repetition of
the same views, was calculated to seize the attention of his
audience, and to afford them pleasure, as well as instruction, in
following the same object, through all the diversity of shades
and aspects in which it was presented, and afterwards in tracing
it backwards to that original proposition or general truth from
which this beautiful train of speculation had proceeded.
</p><p>'His reputation as a Professor was accordingly raised very
high, and a multitude of students from a great distance resorted
to the University, merely upon his account. Those branches of
science which he taught became fashionable at this place, and his
opinions were the chief topics of discussion in clubs and
literary societies. Even the small peculiarities in his
pronunciation or manner of speaking, became frequently the
objects of imitation.'
</p><p>While Mr Smith was thus distinguishing himself by his zeal
and ability as a public teacher, he was gradually laying the
foundation of a more extensive reputation, by preparing for the
press his system of morals. The first edition of this work
appeared in 1759, under the title of 'The Theory of Moral
Sentiments.'
</p><p>Hitherto Mr Smith had remained unknown to the world as an
author; nor have I heard that he had made a trial of his powers
in any anonymous publications, excepting in a periodical work
called The Edinburgh Review, which was begun in the year 1755, by
some gentlemen of distinguished abilities, but which they were
prevented by other engagements from carrying farther than the two
first numbers. To this work Mr Smith contributed a review of Dr
Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language, and also a letter,
addressed to the editors, containing some general observations on
the state of literature in the different countries of Europe. In
the former of these papers, he points out some defects in Dr
Johnson's plan, which he censures as not sufficiently
grammatical. 'The different significations of a word (he
observes) are indeed collected; but they are seldom digested into
general classes, or ranged under the meaning which the word
principally expresses: And sufficient care is not taken to
distinguish the words apparently synonymous.' To illustrate this
criticism, he copies from Dr Johnson the articles BUT and HUMOUR,
and opposes to them the same articles digested agreeably to his
own idea. The various significations of the word BUT are very
nicely and happily discriminated. The other article does not seem
to have been executed with equal care.
</p><p>The observations on the state of learning in Europe are
written with ingenuity and elegance; but are chiefly interesting,
as they shew the attention which the Author had given to the
philosophy and literature of the Continent, at a period when they
were not much studied in this island.
</p><p>In the same volume with the Theory of Moral Sentiments, Mr
Smith published a Dissertation 'on the Origin of Languages, and
on the different Genius of those which are original and
compounded.' The remarks I have to offer on these two discourses,
I shall, for the sake of distinctness, make the subject of a
separate section.</p>

<head>SECTION II. Of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, and the Dissertation on the
Origin of Languages</head>

<div2 type="subsection" id="d9">


<p>The science of Ethics has been divided by modern writers into
two parts; the one comprehending the theory of Morals, and the
other its practical doctrines. The questions about which the
former is employed, are chiefly the two following. First, By what
principle of our constitution are we led to form the notion of
moral distinctions; whether by that faculty which, in the other
branches of human knowledge, perceives the distinction between
truth and falsehood; or by a peculiar power of perception (called
by some the Moral Sense) which is pleased with one set of
qualities, and displeased with another? Secondly, What is the
proper object of moral approbation? or, in other words, What is
the common quality or qualities belonging to all the different
modes of virtue? Is it benevolence; or a rational self-love; or a
disposition (resulting from the ascendant of Reason over Passion)
to act suitably to the different relations in which we are
placed? These two questions seem to exhaust the whole theory of
Morals. The scope of the one is to ascertain the origin of our
moral ideas; that of the other, to refer the phenomena of moral
perception to their most simple and general laws.
</p><p>The practical doctrines of morality comprehend all those
rules of conduct which profess to point out the proper ends of
human pursuit, and the most effectual means of attaining them; to
which we may add all those literary compositions, whatever be
their particular form, which have for their aim to fortify and
animate our good dispositions, by delineations of the beauty, of
the dignity, or of the utility of Virtue.
</p><p>I shall not inquire at present into the justness of this
division. I shall only observe, that the words Theory and
Practice are not, in this instance, employed in their usual
acceptations. The theory of Morals does not bear, for example,
the same relation to the practice of Morals, that the theory of
Geometry bears to practical Geometry. In this last science, all
the practical rules are founded on theoretical principles
previously established: But in the former science, the practical
rules are obvious to the capacities of all mankind; the
theoretical principles form one of the most difficult subjects of
discussion that have ever exercised the ingenuity of
metaphysicians.
</p><p>In illustrating the doctrines of practical morality, (if we
make allowance for some unfortunate prejudices produced or
encouraged by violent and oppressive systems of policy), the
ancients seem to have availed themselves of every light furnished
by nature to human reason; and indeed those writers who, in later
times, have treated the subject with the greatest success, are
they who have followed most closely the footsteps of the Greek
and the Roman philosophers. The theoretical question, too,
concerning the essence of virtue, or the proper object of moral
approbation, was a favourite topic of discussion in the ancient
schools. The question concerning the principle of moral
approbation, though not entirely of modern origin, has been
chiefly agitated since the writings of Dr Cudworth, in opposition
to those of Mr Hobbes; and it is this question accordingly
(recommended at once by its novelty and difficulty to the
curiosity of speculative men), that has produced most of the
theories which characterize and distinguish from each other the
later systems of moral philosophy.
</p><p>It was the opinion of Dr Cudworth, and also of Dr Clarke,
that moral distinctions are perceived by that power of the mind,
which distinguishes truth from falsehood. This system it was one
great object of Dr Hutcheson's philosophy to refute, and in
opposition to it, to show that the words Right and Wrong express
certain agreeable and disagreeable qualities in actions, which it
is not the province of reason but of feeling to perceive; and to
that power of perception which renders us susceptible of pleasure
or of pain from the view of virtue or of vice, he gave the name
of the Moral Sense. His reasonings upon this subject are in the
main acquiesced in, both by Mr Hume and Mr Smith; but they differ
from him in one important particular, -- Dr Hutcheson plainly
supposing, that the moral sense is a simple principle of our
constitution, of which no account can be given; whereas the other
two philosophers have both attempted to analyze it into other
principles more general. Their systems, however, with respect to
it are very different from each other. According to Mr Hume, all
the qualities which are denominated virtuous, are useful either
to ourselves or to others, and the pleasure which we derive from
the view of them is the pleasure of utility. Mr Smith, without
rejecting entirely Mr Hume's doctrine, proposes another of his
own, far more comprehensive; a doctrine with which he thinks all
the most celebrated theories of morality invented by his
predecessors coincide in part, and from some partial view of
which he apprehends that they have all proceeded.
</p><p>Of this very ingenious and original theory, I shall endeavour
to give a short abstract. To those who are familiarly acquainted
with it as it is stated by its author, I am aware that the
attempt may appear superfluous; but I flatter myself that it will
not be wholly useless to such as have not been much conversant in
these abstract disquisitions, by presenting to them the leading
principles of the system in one connected view, without those
interruptions of the attention which necessarily arise from the
author's various and happy illustrations, and from the many
eloquent digressions which animate and adorn his composition.
</p><p>The fundamental principle of Mr Smith's theory is, that the
primary objects of our moral perceptions are the actions of other
men; and that our moral judgments with respect to our own conduct
are only applications to ourselves of decisions which we have
already passed on the conduct of our neighbour. His work
accordingly includes two distinct inquiries, which, although
sometimes blended together in the execution of his general
design, it is necessary for the reader to discriminate carefully
from each other, in order to comprehend all the different
bearings of the author's argument. The aim of the former inquiry
is, to explain in what manner we learn to judge of the conduct of
our neighbour; that of the latter, to shew how, by applying these
judgments to ourselves, we acquire a sense of duty, and a feeling
of its paramount authority over all our other principles of
action.
</p><p>Our moral judgments, both with respect to our own conduct and
that of others, include two distinct perceptions: first, A
perception of conduct as right or wrong; and, secondly, A
perception of the merit or demerit of the agent. To that quality
of conduct which moralists, in general, express by the word
Rectitude, Mr Smith gives the name of Propriety; and he begins
his theory with inquiring in what it consists, and how we are led
to form the idea of it. The leading principles of his doctrine on
this subject are comprehended in the following propositions.
</p><p>1. It is from our own experience alone, that we can form any
idea of what passes in the mind of another person on any
particular occasion; and the only way in which we can form this
idea, is by supposing ourselves in the same circumstances with
him, and conceiving how we should be affected if we were so
situated. It is impossible for us, however, to conceive ourselves
placed in any situation, whether agreeable or otherwise, without
feeling an effect of the same kind with what would be produced by
the situation itself; and of consequence the attention we give at
any time to the circumstances of our neighbour, must affect us
somewhat in the same manner, although by no means in the same
degree, as if these circumstances were our own.
</p><p>That this imaginary change of place with other men, is the
real source of the interest we take in their fortunes, Mr Smith
attempts to prove by various instances. 'When we see a stroke
aimed, and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm of another
person, we naturally shrink and draw back our own leg or our own
arm; and when it does fall, we feel it in some measure, and are
hurt by it as well as the sufferer. The mob, when they are gazing
at a dancer on the slackrope, naturally writhe and twist and
balance their own bodies, as they see him do, and as they feel
that they themselves must do if in his situation.' The same thing
takes place, according to Mr Smith, in every case in which our
attention is turned to the condition of our neighbour. 'Whatever
is the passion which arises from any object in the person
principally concerned, an analogous emotion springs up, at the
thought of his situation, in the breast of every attentive
spectator. In every passion of which the mind of man is
susceptible, the emotions of the bystander always correspond to
what, by bringing the case home to himself, he imagines should be
the sentiments of the sufferer.'
</p><p>To this principle of our nature which leads us to enter into
the situations of other men, and to partake with them in the
passions which these situations have a tendency to excite, Mr
Smith gives the name of sympathy or fellow-feeling, which two
words he employs as synonymous. Upon some occasions, he
acknowledges, that sympathy arises merely from the view of a
certain emotion in another person; but in general it arises, not
so much from the view of the emotion, as from that of the
situation which excites it.
</p><p>2. A sympathy or fellow-feeling between different persons is
always agreeable to both. When I am in a situation which excites
any passion, it is pleasant to me to know, that the spectators of
my situation enter with me into all its various circumstances,
and are affected with them in the same manner as I am myself. On
the other hand, it is pleasant to the spectator to observe this
correspondence of his emotions with mine.
</p><p>3. When the spectator of another man's situation, upon
bringing home to himself all its various circumstances, feels
himself affected in the same manner with the person principally
concerned, he approves of the affection or passion of this person
as just and proper, and suitable to its object. The exceptions
which occur to this observation are, according to Mr Smith, only
apparent. 'A stranger, for example, passes by us in the street
with all the marks of the deepest affliction: and we are
immediately told, that he has just received the news of the death
of his father. It is impossible that, in this case, we should not
approve of his grief; yet it may often happen, without any defect
of humanity on our part, that, so far from entering into the
violence of his sorrow, we should scarce conceive the first
movements of concern upon his account. We have learned, however,
from experience, that such a misfortune naturally excites such a
degree of sorrow; and we know, that if we took time to examine
his situation fully, and in all its parts, we should, without
doubt, most sincerely sympathize with him. It is upon the
consciousness of this conditional sympathy that our approbation
of his sorrow is founded, even in those cases in which that
sympathy does not actually take place; and the general rules
derived from our preceding experience of what our sentiments
would commonly correspond with, correct upon this, as upon many
other occasions, the impropriety of our present emotions.'
</p><p>By the propriety therefore of any affection or passion
exhibited by another person, is to be understood its suitableness
to the object which excites it. Of this suitableness I can judge
only from the coincidence of the affection with that which I
feel, when I conceive myself in the same circumstances; and the
perception of this coincidence is the foundation of the sentiment
of moral approbation.
</p><p>4. Although, when we attend to the situation of another
person, and conceive ourselves to be placed in his circumstances,
an emotion of the same kind with that which he feels naturally
arises in our own mind, yet this sympathetic emotion bears but a
very small proportion, in point of degree, to what is felt by the
person principally concerned. In order, therefore, to obtain the
pleasure of mutual sympathy, nature teaches the spectator to
strive, as much as he can, to raise his emotion to a level with
that which the object would really produce: and, on the other
hand, she teaches the person whose passion this object has
excited, to bring it down, as much as he can, to a level with
that of the spectator.
</p><p>5. Upon these two different efforts are founded two different
sets of virtues. Upon the effort of the spectator to enter into
the situation of the person principally concerned, and to raise
his sympathetic emotions to a level with the emotions of the
actor, are founded the gentle, the amiable virtues; the virtues
of candid condescension and indulgent humanity. Upon the effort
of the person principally concerned to lower his own emotions, so
as to correspond as nearly as possible with those of the
spectator, are founded the great, the awful, and respectable
virtues; the virtues of self-denial, of self-government, of that
command of the passions, which subjects all the movements of our
nature to what our own dignity and honour, and the propriety of
our own conduct, require.
</p><p>As a farther illustration of the foregoing doctrine, Mr Smith
considers particularly the degrees of the different passions
which are consistent with propriety, and endeavours to shew,
that, in every case, it is decent or indecent to express a
passion strongly, according as mankind are disposed, or not
disposed to sympathize with it. It is unbecoming, for example, to
express strongly any of those passions which arise from a certain
condition of the body; because other men, who are not in the same
condition, cannot be expected to sympathize with them. It is
unbecoming to cry out with bodily pain; because the sympathy felt
by the spectator bears no proportion to the acuteness of what is
felt by the sufferer. The case is somewhat similar with those
passions which take their origin from a particular turn or habit
of the imagination.
</p><p>In the case of the unsocial passions of hatred and
resentment, the sympathy of the spectator is divided between the
person who feels the passion, and the person who is the object of
it. 'We are concerned for both, and our fear for what the one may
suffer damps our resentment for what the other has suffered.'
Hence the imperfect degree in which we sympathize with such
passions; and the propriety, when we are under their influence,
of moderating their expression to a much greater degree than is
required in the case of any other emotions.
</p><p>The reverse of this takes place with respect to all the
social and benevolent affections. The sympathy of the spectator
with the person who feels them, coincides with his concern for
the person who is the object of them. It is this redoubled
sympathy which renders these affections so peculiarly becoming
and agreeable.
</p><p>The selfish emotions of grief and joy, when they are
conceived on account of our own private good or bad fortune, hold
a sort of middle place between our social and our unsocial
passions. They are never so graceful as the one set, nor so
odious as the other. Even when excessive, they are never so
disagreeable as excessive resentment; because no opposite
sympathy can ever interest us against them: and when most
suitable to their objects, they are never so agreeable as
impartial humanity and just benevolence; because no double
sympathy can ever interest us for them.
</p><p>After these general speculations concerning the propriety of
actions, Mr Smith examines how far the judgments of mankind
concerning it are liable to be influenced, in particular cases,
by the prosperous or the adverse circumstances of the agent. The
scope of his reasoning on this subject is directed to shew (in
opposition to the common opinion), that when there is no envy in
the case, our propensity to sympathize with joy is much stronger
than our propensity to sympathize with sorrow; and, of
consequence, that it is more easy to obtain the approbation of
mankind in prosperity than in adversity. From the same principle
he traces the origin of ambition, or of the desire of rank and
pre-eminence; the great object of which passion is, to attain
that situation which sets a man most in the view of general
sympathy and attention, and gives him an easy empire over the
affections of others.

</p><p>Having finished the analysis of our sense of propriety and of
impropriety, Mr Smith proceeds to consider our sense of merit and
demerit; which he thinks has also a reference, in the first
instance, not to our own characters, but to the characters of our
neighbours. In explaining the origin of this part of our moral
constitution, he avails himself of the same principle of
sympathy, into which he resolves the sentiment of moral
approbation.
</p><p>The words propriety and impropriety, when applied to an
affection of the mind, are used in this theory (as has been
already observed) to express the suitableness or unsuitableness
of the affection to its exciting cause. The words merit and
demerit have always a reference (according to Mr Smith) to the
effect which the affection tends to produce. When the tendency of
an affection is beneficial, the agent appears to us a proper
object of reward; when it is hurtful, he appears the proper
object of punishment.
</p><p>The principles in our nature which most directly prompt us to
reward and to punish, are gratitude and resentment. To say of a
person, therefore, that he is deserving of reward or of
punishment, is to say, in other words, that he is a proper object
of gratitude or of resentment; or, which amounts to the same
thing, that he is to some person or persons the object of a
gratitude or of a resentment, which every reasonable man is ready
to adopt and sympathize with.
</p><p>It is however very necessary to observe, that we do not
thoroughly sympathize with the gratitude of one man towards
another, merely because this other has been the cause of his good
fortune, unless he has been the cause of it from motives which we
entirely go along with. Our sense, therefore, of the good desert
of an action, is a compounded sentiment, made up of an indirect
sympathy with the person to whom the action is beneficial, and of
a direct sympathy with the affections and motives of the agent.
The same remark applies, mutatis mutandis, to our sense of
demerit, or of ill-desert.
</p><p>From these principles, it is inferred, that the only actions
which appear to us deserving of reward, are actions of a
beneficial tendency, proceeding from proper motives; the only
actions which seem to deserve punishment, are actions of a
hurtful tendency, proceeding from improper motives. A mere want
of beneficence exposes to no punishment; because the mere want of
beneficence tends to do no real positive evil. A man, on the
other hand, who is barely innocent, and contents himself with
observing strictly the laws of justice with respect to others,
can merit only, that his neighbours, in their turn, should
observe religiously the same laws with respect to him.
</p><p>These observations lead Mr Smith to anticipate a little the
subject of the second great division of his work, by a short
inquiry into the origin of our sense of justice, as applicable to
our own conduct; and also of our sentiments of remorse, and of
good desert.
</p><p>The origin of our sense of justice, as well as of all our
other moral sentiments, he accounts for by means of the principle
of sympathy. When I attend only to the feelings of my own breast,
my own happiness appears to me of far greater consequence than
that of all the world besides. But I am conscious, that, in this
excessive preference, other men cannot possibly sympathize with
me, and that to them I appear only one of the crowd, in whom they
are no more interested than in any other individual. If I wish,
therefore, to secure their sympathy and approbation (which,
according to Mr Smith, are the objects of the strongest desire of
my nature), it is necessary for me to regard my happiness, not in
that light in which it appears to myself, but in that light in
which it appears to mankind in general. If an unprovoked injury
is offered to me, I know that society will sympathize with my
resentment; but if I injure the interests of another, who never
injured me, merely because they stand in the way of my own, I
perceive evidently, that society will sympathize with his
resentment, and that I shall become the object of general
indignation.
</p><p>When, upon any occasion, I am led by the violence of passion
to overlook these considerations, and, in the case of a
competition of interests, to act according to my own feelings,
and not according to those of impartial spectators, I never fail
to incur the punishment of remorse. When my passion is gratified,
and I begin to reflect coolly on my conduct, I can no longer
enter into the motives from which it proceeded; it appears as
improper to me as to the rest of the world; I lament the effects
it has produced; I pity the unhappy sufferer whom I have injured;
and I feel myself a just object of indignation to mankind.
'Such,' says Mr Smith, 'is the nature of that sentiment which is
properly called remorse. It is made up of shame from the sense of
the impropriety of past conduct; of grief for the effects of it;
of pity for those who suffer by it; and of the dread and terror
of punishment from the consciousness of the justly provoked
resentment of all rational creatures.'
</p><p>The opposite behaviour of him who, from proper motives, has
performed a generous action, inspires, in a similar manner, the
opposite sentiment of conscious merit, or of deserved reward.
</p><p>The foregoing observations contain a general summary of Mr
Smith's principles with respect to the origin of our moral
sentiments, in so far at least as they relate to the conduct of
others. He acknowledges, at the same time, that the sentiments of
which we are conscious, on particular occasions, do not always
coincide with these principles; and that they are frequently
modified by other considerations, very different from the
propriety or impropriety of the affections of the agent, and also
from the beneficial or hurtful tendency of these affections. The
good or the bad consequences which accidently follow from an
action, and which, as they do not depend on the agent, ought
undoubtedly, in point of justice, to have no influence on our
opinion, either of the propriety or the merit of his conduct,
scarcely ever fail to influence considerably our judgment with
respect to both; by leading us to form a good or a bad opinion of
the prudence with which the action was performed, and by
animating our sense of the merit or demerit of his design. These
facts, however, do not furnish any objections which are
peculiarly applicable to Mr Smith's theory; for whatever
hypothesis we may adopt with respect to the origin of our moral
perceptions, all men must acknowledge, that, in so far as the
prosperous or the unprosperous event of an action depends on
fortune or on accident, it ought neither to increase nor to
diminish our moral approbation or disapprobation of the agent.
And accordingly it has, in all ages of the world, been the
complaint of moralists, that the actual sentiments of mankind
should so often be in opposition to this equitable and
indisputable maxim. In examining, therefore, this irregularity of
our moral sentiments, Mr Smith is to be considered, not as
obviating an objection peculiar to his own system, but as
removing a difficulty which is equally connected with every
theory on the subject which has ever been proposed. So far as I
know, he is the first philosopher who has been fully aware of the
importance of the difficulty, and he has indeed treated it with
great ability and success. The explanation which he gives of it
is not warped in the least by any peculiarity in his own scheme;
and, I must own, it appears to me to be the most solid and
valuable improvement he has made in this branch of science. It is
impossible to give any abstract of it in a sketch of this kind;
and therefore I must content myself with remarking, that it
consists of three parts. The first explains the causes of this
irregularity of sentiment; the second, the extent of its
influence; and the third, the important purposes to which it is
subservient. His remarks on the last of these heads are more
particularly ingenious and pleasing; as their object is to shew,
in opposition to what we should be disposed at first to
apprehend, that when nature implanted the seeds of this
irregularity in the human breast, her leading intention was, to
promote the happiness and perfection of the species.
</p><p>The remaining part of Mr Smith's theory is employed in
shewing, in what manner our sense of duty comes to be formed, in
consequence of an application to ourselves of the judgments we
have previously passed on the conduct of others.
</p><p>In entering upon this inquiry, which is undoubtedly the most
important in the work, and for which the foregoing speculations
are, according to Mr Smith's theory, a necessary preparation, he
begins with stating the fact concerning our consciousness of
merited praise or blame; and it must be owned, that the first
aspect of the fact, as he himself states it, appears not very
favourable to his principles. That the great object of a wise and
virtuous man is not to act in such a manner as to obtain the
actual approbation of those around him, but to act so as to
render himself the just and proper object of their approbation,
and that his satisfaction with his own conduct depends much more
on the consciousness of deserving this approbation than from that
of really enjoying it, he candidly acknowledges; but still he
insists, that although this may seem, at first view, to intimate
the existence of some moral faculty which is not borrowed from
without, our moral sentiments have always some secret reference,
either to what are, or to what upon a certain condition would be,
or to what we imagine ought to be, the sentiments of others; and
that if it were possible, that a human creature could grow up to
manhood without any communication with his own species, he could
no more think of his own character, or of the propriety or
demerit of his own sentiments and conduct, than of the beauty or
deformity of his own face. There is indeed a tribunal within the
breast, which is the supreme arbiter of all our actions, and
which often mortifies us amidst the applause, and supports us
under the censure of the world; yet still, he contends, that if
we inquire into the origin of its institution, we shall find,
that its jurisdiction is, in a great measure, derived from the
authority of that very tribunal whose decisions it so often and
so justly reverses.
</p><p>When we first come into the world, we, for some time, fondly
pursue the impossible project of gaining the good-will and
approbation of everybody. We soon however find, that this
universal approbation is unattainable; that the most equitable
conduct must frequently thwart the interests or the inclinations
of particular persons, who will seldom have candour enough to
enter into the propriety of our motives, or to see that this
conduct, how disagreeable soever to them, is perfectly suitable
to our situation. In order to defend ourselves from such partial
judgments, we soon learn to set up in our own minds, a judge
between ourselves and those we live with. We conceive ourselves
as acting in the presence of a person, who has no particular
relation, either to ourselves, or to those whose interests are
affected by our conduct; and we study to act in such a manner as
to obtain the approbation of this supposed impartial spectator.
It is only by consulting him that we can see whatever relates to
ourselves in its proper shape and dimensions.
</p><p>There are two different occasions, on which we examine our
own conduct, and endeavour to view it in the light in which the
impartial spectator would view it. First, when we are about to
act; and, secondly, after we have acted. In both cases, our views
are very apt to be partial.
</p><p>When we are about to act, the eagerness of passion seldom
allows us to consider what we are doing with the candour of an
indifferent person. When the action is over, and the passions
which prompted it have subsided, although we can undoubtedly
enter into the sentiments of the indifferent spectator much more
coolly than before, yet it is so disagreeable to us to think ill
of ourselves, that we often purposely turn away our view from
those circumstances which might render our judgment unfavourable.
-- Hence that self-deceit which is the source of half the
disorders of human life.
</p><p>In order to guard ourselves against its delusions, nature
leads us to form insensibly, by our continual observations upon
the conduct of others, certain general rules concerning what is
fit and proper either to be done or avoided. Some of their
actions shock all our natural sentiments; and when we observe
other people affected in the same manner with ourselves, we are
confirmed in the belief, that our disapprobation was just. We
naturally therefore lay it down as a general rule, that all such
actions are to be avoided, as tending to render us odious,
contemptible, or punishable; and we endeavour, by habitual
reflection, to fix this general rule in our minds, in order to
correct the misrepresentations of self-love, if we should ever be
called on to act in similar circumstances. The man of furious
resentment, if he were to listen to the dictates of that passion,
would perhaps regard the death of his enemy as but a small
compensation for a trifling wrong. But his observations on the
conduct of others have taught him how horrible such sanguinary
revenges are; and he has impressed it on his mind as an
invariable rule, to abstain from them upon all occasions. This
rule preserves its authority with him, checks the impetuosity of
his passion, and corrects the partial views which self-love
suggests; although, if this had been the first time in which he
considered such an action, he would undoubtedly have determined
it to be just and proper, and what every impartial spectator
would approve of. -- A regard to such general rules of morality
constitutes, according to Mr Smith, what is properly called the
sense of duty.
</p><p>I before hinted, that Mr Smith does not reject entirely from
his system that principle of utility, of which the perception in
any action or character constitutes, according to Mr Hume, the
sentiment of moral approbation. That no qualities of the mind are
approved of as virtues, but such as are useful or agreeable,
either to the person himself or to others, he admits to be a
proposition that holds universally; and he also admits, that the
sentiment of approbation with which we regard virtue, is
enlivened by the perception of this utility, or, as he explains
the fact, it is enlivened by our sympathy with the happiness of
those to whom the utility extends: But still he insists, that it
is not the view of this utility which is either the first or
principal source of moral approbation.
</p><p>To sum up the whole of his doctrine in a few words. 'When we
approve of any character or action, the sentiments which we feel
are derived from four different sources. First, we sympathize
with the motives of the agent; secondly, we enter into the
gratitude of those who receive the benefit of his actions;
thirdly, we observe that his conduct has been agreeable to the
general rules by which those two sympathies generally act; and,
lastly, when we consider such actions as making a part of a
system of behaviour which tends to promote the happiness either
of the individual or of society, they appear to derive a beauty
from this utility, not unlike that which we ascribe to any
well-contrived machine.' These different sentiments, he thinks,
exhaust completely, in every instance that can be supposed, the
compounded sentiment of moral approbation. 'After deducting, says
he, in any one particular case, all that must be acknowledged to
proceed from some one or other of these four principles, I should
be glad to know what remains; and I shall freely allow this
overplus to be ascribed to a moral sense, or to any other
peculiar faculty, provided any body will ascertain precisely what
this overplus is.'
</p><p>Mr Smith's opinion concerning the nature of virtue, is
involved in his theory concerning the principle of moral
approbation. The idea of virtue, he thinks, always implies the
idea of propriety, or of the suitableness of the affection to the
object which excites it; which suitableness, according to him,
can be determined in no other way than by the sympathy of
impartial spectators with the motives of the agent. But still he
apprehends, that this description of virtue is incomplete; for
although in every virtuous action propriety is an essential
ingredient, it is not always the sole ingredient. Beneficent
actions have in them another quality, by which they appear, not
only to deserve approbation, but recompense, and excite a
superior degree of esteem, arising from a double sympathy with
the motives of the agent, and the gratitude of those who are the
objects of his affection. In this respect, beneficence appears to
him to be distinguished from the inferior virtues of prudence,
vigilance, circumspection, temperance, constancy, firmness, which
are always regarded with approbation, but which confer no merit.
This distinction, he apprehends, has not been sufficiently
attended to by moralists; the principles of some affording no
explanation of the approbation we bestow on the inferior virtues;
and those of others accounting as imperfectly for the peculiar
excellency which the supreme virtue of beneficence is
acknowledged to possess.
<ref target="n9">[9]</ref>

</p><p>Such are the outlines of Mr Smith's Theory of Moral
Sentiments; a work which, whatever opinion we may entertain of
the justness of its conclusions, must be allowed by all to be a
singular effort of invention, ingenuity, and subtilty. For my own
part I must confess, that it does not coincide with my notions
concerning the foundation of Morals: but I am convinced, at the
same time, that it contains a large mixture of important truth,
and that, although the author has sometimes been misled by too
great a desire of generalizing his principles, he has had the
merit of directing the attention of philosophers to a view of
human nature which had formerly in a great measure escaped their
notice. Of the great proportion of just and sound reasoning which
the theory involves its striking plausibility is a sufficient
proof; for, as the author himself has remarked, no system in
morals can well gain our assent, if it does not border, in some
respects, upon the truth. 'A system of natural philosophy (he
observes) may appear very plausible, and be for a long time very
generally received in the world, and yet have no foundation in
nature; but the author who should assign as the cause of any
natural sentiment, some principle which neither had any
connection with it, nor resembled any other principle which had
some connection, would appear absurd and ridiculous to the most
injudicious and inexperienced reader.' The merit, however, of Mr
Smith's performance does not rest here. No work, undoubtedly, can
be mentioned, ancient or modern, which exhibits so complete a
view of those facts with respect to our moral perceptions, which
it is one great object of this branch of science to refer to
their general laws; and upon this account, it well deserves the
careful study of all whose taste leads them to prosecute similar
inquiries. These facts are indeed frequently expressed in a
language which involves the author's peculiar theories: But they
are always presented in the most happy and beautiful lights; and
it is easy for an attentive reader, by stripping them of
hypothetical terms, to state them to himself with that logical
precision, which, in such very difficult disquisitions, can alone
conduct us with certainty to the truth.
</p><p>It is proper to observe farther, that with the theoretical
doctrines of the book, there are everywhere interwoven, with
singular taste and address, the purest and most elevated maxims
concerning the practical conduct of life; and that it abounds
throughout with interesting and instructive delineations of
characters and manners. A considerable part of it too is employed
in collateral inquiries, which, upon every hypothesis that can be
formed concerning the foundation of morals, are of equal
importance. Of this kind is the speculation formerly mentioned,
with respect to the influence of fortune on our moral sentiments,
and another speculation, no less valuable, with respect to the
influence of custom and fashion on the same part of our
constitution.
</p><p>The style in which Mr Smith has conveyed the fundamental
principles on which his theory rests, does not seem to me to be
so perfectly suited to the subject as that which he employs on
most other occasions. In communicating ideas which are extremely
abstract and subtile, and about which it is hardly possible to
reason correctly, without the scrupulous use of appropriated
terms, he sometimes presents to us a choice of words, by no means
strictly synonymous, so as to divert the attention from a precise
and steady conception of his proposition: and a similar effect
is, in other instances, produced by that diversity of forms
which, in the course of his copious and seducing composition, the
same truth insensibly assumes. When the subject of his work leads
him to address the imagination and the heart, the variety and
felicity of his illustrations; the richness and fluency of his
eloquence; and the skill with which he wins the attention and
commands the passions of his readers, leave him, among our
English moralists, without a rival.

</p><p>The Dissertation on the Origin of Languages, which now forms
a part of the same volume with the Theory of Moral Sentiments,
was, I believe, first annexed to the second edition of that work.
It is an essay of great ingenuity, and on which the author
himself set a high value; but, in a general review of his
publications, it deserves our attention less, on account of the
opinions it contains, than as a specimen of a particular sort of
inquiry, which, so far as I know, is entirely of modern origin,
and which seems, in a peculiar degree, to have interested Mr
Smith's curiosity.
<ref target="n10">[10]</ref>
Something very similar to it may be
traced in all his different works, whether moral, political, or
literary; and on all these subjects he has exemplified it with
the happiest success.
</p><p>When, in such a period of society as that in which we live,
we compare our intellectual acquirements, our opinions, manners,
and institutions, with those which prevail among rude tribes, it
cannot fail to occur to us as an interesting question, by what
gradual steps the transition has been made from the first simple
efforts of uncultivated nature, to a state of things so
wonderfully artificial and complicated. Whence has arisen that
systematical beauty which we admire in the structure of a
cultivated language; that analogy which runs through the mixture
of languages spoken by the most remote and unconnected nations;
and those peculiarities by which they are all distinguished from
each other? Whence the origin of the different sciences and of
the different arts; and by what chain has the mind been led from
their first rudiments to their last and most refined
improvements? Whence the astonishing fabric of the political
union; the fundamental principles which are common to all
governments; and the different forms which civilized society has
assumed in different ages of the world? On most of these subjects
very little information is to be expected from history; for long
before that stage of society when men begin to think of recording
their transactions, many of the most important steps of their
progress have been made. A few insulated facts may perhaps be
collected from the casual observations of travellers, who have
viewed the arrangements of rude nations; but nothing, it is
evident, can be obtained in this way, which approaches to a
regular and connected detail of human improvement.
</p><p>In this want of direct evidence, we are under a necessity of
supplying the place of fact by conjecture; and when we are unable
to ascertain how men have actually conducted themselves upon
particular occasions, of considering in what manner they are
likely to have proceeded, from the principles of their nature,
and the circumstances of their external situation. In such
inquiries, the detached facts which travels and voyages afford
us, may frequently serve as land-marks to our speculations; and
sometimes our conclusions a priori, may tend to confirm the
credibility of facts, which, on a superficial view, appeared to
be doubtful or incredible.
</p><p>Nor are such theoretical views of human affairs subservient
merely to the gratification of curiosity. In examining the
history of mankind, as well as in examining the phenomena of the
material world, when we cannot trace the process by which an
event has been produced, it is often of importance to be able to
show how it may have been produced by natural causes. Thus, in
the instance which has suggested these remarks, although it is
impossible to determine with certainty what the steps were by
which any particular language was formed, yet if we can shew,
from the known principles of human nature, how all its various
parts might gradually have arisen, the mind is not only to a
certain degree satisfied, but a check is given to that indolent
philosophy, which refers to a miracle, whatever appearances, both
in the natural and moral worlds, it is unable to explain.
</p><p>To this species of philosophical investigation, which has no
appropriated name in our language, I shall take the liberty of
giving the title of Theoretical or Conjectutal History; an
expression which coincides pretty nearly in its meaning with that
of Natural History, as employed by Mr Hume<ref
target="n11">[11]</ref>, and with what
some French writers have called Histoire Raisonnee.
</p><p>The mathematical sciences, both pure and mixed, afford, in
many of their branches, very favourable subjects for theoretical
history; and a very competent judge, the late M. d'Alembert, has
recommended this arrangement of their elementary principles,
which is founded on the natural succession of inventions and
discoveries, as the best adapted for interesting the curiosity
and exercising the genius of students. The same author points out
as a model a passage in Montucla's History of Mathematics, where
an attempt is made to exhibit the gradual progress of
philosophical speculation, from the first conclusions suggested
by a general survey of the heavens, to the doctrines of
Copernicus. It is somewhat remarkable, that a theoretical history
of this very science (in which we have, perhaps, a better
opportunity than in any other instance whatever, of comparing the
natural advances of the mind with the actual succession of
hypothetical systems) was one of Mr Smith's earliest
compositions, and is one of the very small number of his
manuscripts which he did not destroy before his death.
</p><p>I already hinted, that inquiries perfectly analogous to these
may be applied to the modes of government, and to the municipal
institutions which have obtained among different nations. It is
but lately, however, that these important subjects have been
considered in this point of view; the greater part of politicians
before the time of Montesquieu, having contented themselves with
an historical statement of facts, and with a vague reference of
laws to the wisdom of particular legislators, or to accidental
circumstances, which it is now impossible to ascertain.
Montesquieu, on the contrary, considered laws as originating
chiefly from the circumstances of society; and attempted to
account, from the changes in the condition of mankind, which take
place in the different stages of their progress, for the
corresponding alterations which their institutions undergo. It is
thus that, in his occasional elucidations of the Roman
jurisprudence, instead of bewildering himself among the erudition
of scholiasts and of antiquaries, we frequently find him
borrowing his lights from the most remote and unconnected
quarters of the globe, and combining the casual observations of
illiterate travellers and navigators, into a philosophical
commentary on the history of law and of manners.
</p><p>The advances made in this line of inquiry since Montesquieu's
time have been great. Lord Kames, in his Historical Law Tracts,
has given some excellent specimens of it, particularly in his
Essays on the History of Property and of Criminal Law, and many
ingenious speculations of the same kind occur in the works of Mr
Millar.
</p><p>In Mr Smith's writings, whatever be the nature of his
subject, he seldom misses an opportunity of indulging his
curiosity, in tracing from the principles of human nature, or
from the circumstances of society, the origin of the opinions and
the institutions which he describes. I formerly mentioned a
fragment concerning the History of Astronomy which he has left
for publication; and I have heard him say more than once, that he
had projected, in the earlier part of his life, a history of the
other sciences on the same plan. In his Wealth of Nations,
various disquisitions are introduced which have a like object in
view, particularly the theoretical delineation he has given of
the natural progress of opulence in a country; and his
investigation of the causes which have inverted this order in the
different countries of modern Europe. His lectures on
jurisprudence seem, from the account of them formerly given, to
have abounded in such inquiries.
</p><p>I am informed by the same gentleman who favoured me with the
account of Mr Smith's lectures at Glasgow, that he had heard him
sometimes hint an intention of writing a treatise upon the Greek
and Roman republics. 'And after all that has been published on
that subject, I am convinced (says he), that the observations of
Mr Smith would have suggested many new and important views
concerning the internal and domestic circumstances of those
nations, which would have displayed their several systems of
policy, in a light much less artificial than that in which they
have hitherto appeared.'
</p><p>The same turn of thinking was frequently, in his social
hours, applied to more familiar subjects; and the fanciful
theories which, without the least affectation of ingenuity, he
was continually starting upon all the common topics of discourse,
gave to his conversation a novelty and variety that were quite
inexhaustible. Hence too the minuteness and accuracy of his
knowledge on many trifling articles, which, in the course of his
speculations, he had been led to consider from some new and
interesting point of view; and of which his lively and
circumstantial descriptions amused his friends the more, that he
seemed to be habitually inattentive, in so remarkable a degree,
to what was passing around him.
</p><p>I have been led into these remarks by the Dissertation on the
Formation of Languages, which exhibits a very beautiful specimen
of theoretical history, applied to a subject equally curious and
difficult. The analogy between the train of thinking from which
it has taken its rise, and that which has suggested a variety of
his other disquisitions, will, I hope, be a sufficient apology
for the length of this digression; more particularly, as it will
enable me to simplify the account which I am to give afterwards,
of his inquiries concerning political economy.
</p><p>I shall only observe farther on this head, that when
different theoretical histories are proposed by different
writers, of the progress of the human mind in any one line of
exertion, these theories are not always to be understood as
standing in opposition to each other. If the progress delineated
in all of them be plausible, it is possible at least, that they
may all have been realized; for human affairs never exhibit, in
any two instances, a perfect uniformity. But whether they have
been realized or no, is often a question of little consequence.
In most cases, it is of more importance to ascertain the progress
that is most simple, than the progress that is most agreeable to
fact; for, paradoxical as the proposition may appear, it is
certainly true, that the real progress is not always the most
natural. It may have been determined by particular accidents,
which are not likely again to occur, and which cannot be
considered as forming any part of that general provision which
nature has made for the improvement of the race.

</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>-------------

</p><p>In order to make some amends for the length (I am afraid I
may add for the tediousness) of this section, I shall subjoin to
it an original letter of Mr Hume's addressed to Mr Smith, soon
after the publication of his Theory. It is strongly marked with
that easy and affectionate pleasantry which distinguished Mr
Hume's epistolary correspondence, and is entitled to a place in
this Memoir, on account of its connection with an important event
of Mr Smith's life, which soon after removed him into a new
scene, and influenced, to a considerable degree, the subsequent
course of his studies. The letter is dated from London, 12th
April 1759.
</p><p>'I give you thanks for the agreeable present of your Theory.
Wedderburn and I made presents of our copies to such of our
acquaintances as we thought good judges, and proper to spread the
reputation of the book. I sent one to the Duke of Argyll, to Lord
Lyttleton, Horace Walpole, Soame Jennyns, and Burke, an Irish
gentleman, who wrote lately a very pretty treatise on the
Sublime. Millar desired my permission to send one in your name to
Dr Warburton. I have delayed writing to you till I could tell you
something of the success of the book, and could prognosticate
with some probability, whether it should be finally damned to
oblivion, or should be registered in the temple of immortality.
Though it has been published only a few weeks, I think there
appear already such strong symptoms, that I can almost venture to
foretel its fate. It is in short this --------- But I have been
interrupted in my letter by a foolish impertinent visit of one
who has lately come from Scotland. He tells me that the
University of Glasgow intend to declare Rouet's office vacant,
upon his going abroad with Lord Hope. I question not but you will
have our friend Ferguson in your eye, in case another project for
procuring him a place in the University of Edinburgh should fail.
Ferguson has very much polished and improved his treatise on
Refinement,
<ref target="n12">[12]</ref>
and with some amendments it will make an
admirable book, and discovers an elegant and a singular genius.
The Epigoniad, I hope, will do; but it is somewhat up-hill work.
As I doubt not but you consult the reviews sometimes at present,
you will see in the Critical Review a letter upon that poem; and
I desire you to employ your conjectures in finding out the
author. Let me see a sample of your skill in knowing hands by
your guessing at the person. I am afraid of Lord Kames's Law
Tracts. A man might as well think of making a fine sauce by a
mixture of wormwood and aloes, as an agreeable composition by
joining metaphysics and Scotch law. However, the book, I believe,
has merit; though few people will take the pains of diving into
it. But, to return to your book, and its success in this town, I
must tell you ---------. A plague of interruptions! I ordered
myself to be denied; and yet here is one that has broke in upon
me again. He is a man of letters, and we have had a good deal of
literary conversation. You told me that you was curious of
literary anecdotes, and therefore I shall inform you of a few
that have come to my knowledge. I believe I have mentioned to you
already Helvetius's book de l'Esprit. It is worth your reading,
not for its philosophy, which I do not highly value, but for its
agreeable composition. I had a letter from him a few days ago,
wherein he tells me that my name was much oftener in the
manuscript, but that the Censor of books at Paris obliged him to
strike it out. Voltaire has lately published a small work called
Candide, ou l'Optimisme. I shall give you a detail of it --------
But what is all this to my book? say you. -- My dear Mr Smith,
have patience: Compose yourself to tranquillity: Shew yourself a
philosopher in practice as well as profession: Think on the
emptiness, and rashness, and futility of the common judgments of
men: How little they are regulated by reason in any subject, much
more in philosophical subjects, which so far exceed the
comprehension of the vulgar.


</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> -------- Non si quid turbida Roma,
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Elevet, accedas: examenve improbum in illa
</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> Castiges trutina: nec te quaesiveris extra.

</p><p>A wise man's kingdom is his own breast; or, if he ever looks
farther, it will only be to the judgment of a select few, who are
free from prejudices, and capable of examining his work. Nothing
indeed can be a stronger presumption of falsehood than the
approbation of the multitude; and Phocion, you know, always
suspected himself of some blunder, when he was attended with the
applauses of the populace.
</p><p>'Supposing, therefore, that you have duly prepared yourself
for the worst by all these reflections, I proceed to tell you the
melancholy news, that your book has been very unfortunate; for
the public seem disposed to applaud it extremely. It was looked
for by the foolish people with some impatience; and the mob of
literati are beginning already to be very loud in its praises.
Three Bishops called yesterday at Millar's shop in order to buy
copies, and to ask questions about the author. The Bishop of
Peterborough said he had passed the evening in a company where he
heard it extolled above all books in the world. The Duke of
Argyll is more decisive than he uses to be in its favour. I
suppose he either considers it as an exotic, or thinks the author
will be serviceable to him in the Glasgow elections. Lord
Lyttleton says, that Robertson and Smith and Bowver are the
glories of English literature. Oswald protests he does not know
whether he has reaped more instruction or entertainment from it.
But you may easily judge what reliance can be put on his judgment
who has been engaged all his life in public business, and who
never sees any faults in his friends. Millar exults and brags
that two-thirds of the edition are already sold, and that he is
now sure of success. You see what a son of the earth that is, to
value books only by the profit they bring him. In that view, I
believe it may prove a very good book.
</p><p>'Charles Townsend, who passes for the cleverest fellow in
England, is so taken with the performance, that he said to Oswald
he would put the Duke of Buccleuch under the author's care, and
would make it worth his while to accept of that charge. As soon
as I heard this I called on him twice, with a view of talking
with him about the matter, and of convincing him of the propriety
of sending that young Nobleman to Glasgow: For I could not hope,
that he could offer you any terms which would tempt you to
renounce your Professorship. But I missed him. Mr Townsend passes
for being a little uncertain in his resolutions: so perhaps you
need not build much on this sally.
</p><p>'In recompence for so many mortifying things, which nothing
but truth could have extorted from me, and which I could easily
have multiplied to a greater number, I doubt not but you are so
good a Christian as to return good for evil; and to flatter my
vanity by telling me, that all the godly in Scotland abuse me for
my account of John Knox and the Reformation. I suppose you are
glad to see my paper end, and that I am obliged to conclude with

</p><p>Your humble servant,
 DAVID HUME.</p>

<head>SECTION III. From the Publication of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, til that
of the Wealth of Nations</head>

<div2 type="subsection" id="d12">

<p>After the publication of the Theory of Moral Sentiments, Mr
Smith remained four years at Glasgow, discharging his official
duties with unabated vigour, and with increasing reputation.
During that time, the plan of his lectures underwent a
considerable change. His ethical doctrines, of which he had now
published so valuable a part, occupied a much smaller portion of
the course than formerly: and accordingly, his attention was
naturally directed to a more complete illustration of the
principles of jurisprudence and of political economy.
</p><p>To this last subject, his thoughts appear to have been
occasionally turned from a very early period of life. It is
probable, that the uninterrupted friendship he had always
maintained with his old companion Mr Oswald, had some tendency to
encourage him in prosecuting this branch of his studies; and the
publication of Mr Hume's political discourses, in the year 1752,
could not fail to confirm him in those liberal views of
commercial policy which had already opened to him in the course
of his own inquiries. His long residence in one of the most
enlightened mercantile towns in this island, and the habits of
intimacy in which he lived with the most respectable of its
inhabitants, afforded him an opportunity of deriving what
commercial information he stood in need of, from the best
sources; and it is a circumstance no less honourable to their
liberality than to his talents, that notwithstanding the
reluctance so common among men of business to listen to the
conclusions of mere speculation, and the direct opposition of his
leading principles to all the old maxims of trade, he was able,
before he quitted his situation in the university, to rank some
very eminent merchants in the number of his proselytes.<ref
target="n13">[13]</ref>
</p><p>Among the students who attended his lectures, and whose minds
were not previously warped by prejudice, the progress of his
opinions, it may be reasonably supposed, was much more rapid. It
was this class of his friends accordingly that first adopted his
system with eagerness, and diffused a knowledge of its
fundamental principles over this part of the kingdom.
</p><p>Towards the end of 1763, Mr Smith received an invitation from
Mr Charles Townsend to accompany the Duke of Buccleuch on his
travels; and the liberal terms in which the proposal was made to
him, added to the strong desire he had felt of visiting the
Continent of Europe, induced him to resign his office at Glasgow.
With the connection which he was led to form in consequence of
this change in his situation, he had reason to be satisfied in an
uncommon degree, and he always spoke of it with pleasure and
gratitude. To the public, it was not perhaps a change equally
fortunate; as it interrupted that studious leisure for which
nature seems to have destined him, and in which alone he could
have hoped to accomplish those literary projects which had
flattered the ambition of his youthful genius.
</p><p>The alteration, however, which, from this period, took place
in his habits, was not without its advantages. He had hitherto
lived chiefly within the walls of an university; and although to
a mind like his, the observation of human nature on the smallest
scale is sufficient to convey a tolerably just conception of what
passes on the great theatre of the world, yet it is not to be
doubted, that the variety of scenes through which he afterwards
passed, must have enriched his mind with many new ideas, and
corrected many of those misapprehensions of life and manners
which the best descriptions of them can scarcely fail to convey.
-- But whatever were the lights that his travels afforded to him
as a student of human nature, they were probably useful in a
still greater degree, in enabling him to perfect that system of
political economy, of which he had already delivered the
principles in his lectures at Glasgow, and which it was now the
leading object of his studies to prepare for the public. The
coincidence between some of these principles and the
distinguishing tenets of the French economists, who were at that
very time in the height of their reputation, and the intimacy in
which he lived with some of the leaders of that sect, could not
fail to assist him in methodizing and digesting his speculations;
while the valuable collection of facts, accumulated by the
zealous industry of their numerous adherents, furnished him with
ample materials for illustrating and confirming his theoretical
conclusions.
</p><p>After leaving Glasgow, Mr Smith joined the Duke of Buccleuch
at London early in the year 1764, and set out with him for the
continent in the month of March following. At Dover they were met
by Sir James Macdonald, who accompanied them to Paris, and with
whom Mr Smith laid the foundation of a friendship, which he
always mentioned with great sensibility, and of which he often
lamented the short duration. The panegyrics with which the memory
of this accomplished and amiable person has been honoured by so
many distinguished characters in the different countries of
Europe, are a proof how well fitted his talents were to command
general admiration. The esteem in which his abilities and
learning were held by Mr Smith, is a testimony to his
extraordinary merit of still superior value. Mr Hume, too, seems,
in this instance, to have partaken of his friend's enthusiasm.
'Were you and I together (says he in a letter to Mr Smith), we
should shed tears at present for the death of poor Sir James
Macdonald. We could not possibly have suffered a greater loss
than in that valuable young man.'
</p><p>In this first visit to Paris, the Duke of Buccleuch and Mr
Smith employed only ten or twelve days,
<ref target="n14">[14]</ref>
after which they
proceeded to Thoulouse, where they fixed their residence for
eighteen months; and where, in addition to the pleasure of an
agreeable society, Mr Smith had an opportunity of correcting and
extending his information concerning the internal policy of
France, by the intimacy in which he lived with some of the
principal persons of the Parliament.
</p><p>From Thoulouse they went, by a pretty extensive tour, through
the south of France to Geneva. Here they passed two months. The
late Earl Stanhope, for whose learning and worth Mr Smith
entertained a sincere respect, was then an inhabitant of that
republic.
</p><p>About Christmas 1765, they returned to Paris, and remained
there till October following. The society in which Mr Smith spent
these ten months, may be conceived from the advantages he
enjoyed, in consequence of the recommendations of Mr Hume.
Turgot, Quesnai, Morellet,
<ref target="n15">[15]</ref>
Necker, d'Alembert, Helvetius,
Marmontel, Madame Riccoboni, were among the number of his
acquaintances; and some of them he continued ever afterwards to
reckon among his friends. From Madam d'Anville, the respectable
mother of the late excellent and much lamented Duke of la
Rochefoucauld,
<ref target="n16">[16]</ref>
he received many attentions, which he always
recollected with particular gratitude.
</p><p>It is much to be regretted, that he preserved no journal of
this very interesting period of his history; and such was his
aversion to write letters, that I scarcely suppose any memorial
of it exists in his correspondence with his friends. The extent
and accuracy of his memory, in which he was equalled by few, made
it of little consequence to himself to record in writing what he
heard or saw; and from his anxiety before his death to destroy
all the papers in his possession, he seems to have wished, that
no materials should remain for his biographers, but what were
furnished by the lasting monuments of his genius,and the
exemplary worth of his private life.
</p><p>The satisfaction he enjoyed in the conversation of Turgot may
be easily imagined. Their opinions on the most essential points
of political economy were the same; and they were both animated
by the same zeal for the best interests of mankind. The favourite
studies, too, of both, had directed their inquiries to subjects
on which the understandings of the ablest and the best informed
are liable to be warped, to a great degree, by prejudice and
passion; and on which, of consequence, a coincidence of judgment
is peculiarly gratifying. We are told by one of the biographers
of Turgot, that after his retreat from the ministry, he occupied
his leisure in a philosophical correspondence with some of his
old friends; and, in particular, that various letters on
important subjects passed between him and Mr Smith. I take notice
of this anecdote chiefly as a proof of the intimacy which was
understood to have subsisted between them; for in other respects,
the anecdote seems to me to be somewhat doubtful. It is scarcely
to be supposed, that Mr Smith would destroy the letters of such a
correspondent as Turgot; and still less probable, that such an
intercourse was carried on between them without the knowledge of
any of Mr Smith's friends. From some inquiries that have been
made at Paris by a gentleman of this Society since Mr Smith's
death, I have reason to believe, that no evidence of the
correspondence exists among the papers of M. Turgot, and that the
whole story has taken its rise from a report suggested by the
knowledge of their former intimacy. This circumstance I think it
of importance to mention, because a good deal of curiosity has
been excited by the passage in question, with respect to the fate
of the supposed letters.
</p><p>Mr Smith was also well known to M. Quesnai, the profound and
original author of the Economical Table; a man (according to Mr
Smith's account of him) 'of the greatest modesty and simplicity;'
and whose system of political economy he has pronounced, 'with
all its imperfections,' to be 'the nearest approximation to the
truth that has yet been published on the principles of that very
important science.' If he had not been prevented by Quesnai's
death, Mr Smith had once an intention (as he told me himself) to
have inscribed to him his 'Wealth of Nations.'
</p><p>It was not, however, merely the distinguished men who about
this period fixed so splendid an aera in the literary history of
France, that excited Mr Smith's curiosity while he remained in
Paris. His acquaintance with the polite literature both of
ancient and modern times was extensive; and amidst his various
other occupations, he had never neglected to cultivate a taste
for the fine arts; -- less, it is probable, with a view to the
peculiar enjoyments they convey, (though he was by no means
without sensibility to their beauties,) than on account of their
connection with the general principles of the human mind; to an
examination of which they afford the most pleasing of all
avenues. To those who speculate on this very delicate subject, a
comparison of the modes of taste that prevail among different
nations, affords a valuable collection of facts; and Mr Smith,
who was always disposed to ascribe to custom and fashion their
full share in regulating the opinions of mankind with respect to
beauty, may naturally be supposed to have availed himself of
every opportunity which a foreign country afforded him of
illustrating his former theories.
</p><p>Some of his peculiar notions, too, with respect to the
imitative arts, seem to have been much confirmed by his
observations while abroad. In accounting for the pleasure we
receive from these arts, it had early occurred to him as a
fundamental principle, that a very great part of it arises from
the difficulty of the imitation; a principle which was probably
suggested to him by that of the difficulte surmontee, by which
some French critics had attempted to explain the effect of
versification and of rhyme
<ref target="n17">[17]</ref>.
 This principle Mr Smith pushed
to the greatest possible length, and referred to it, with
singular ingenuity, a great variety of phenomena in all the
different fine arts. It led him, however, to some conclusions,
which appear, at first view at least, not a little paradoxical;
and I cannot help thinking, that it warped his judgment in many
of the opinions which he was accustomed to give on the subject of
poetry.
</p><p>The principles of dramatic composition had more particularly
attracted his attention; and the history of the theatre, both in
ancient and modern times, had furnished him with some of the most
remarkable facts on which his theory of the imitative arts was
founded. From this theory it seemed to follow as a consequence,
that the same circumstances which, in tragedy, give to blank
verse an advantage over prose, should give to rhyme an advantage
over blank verse; and Mr Smith had always inclined to that
opinion. Nay, he had gone so far as to extend the same doctrine
to comedy; and to regret that those excellent pictures of life
and manners which the English stage affords, had not been
executed after the model of the French school. The admiration
with which he regarded the great dramatic authors of France
tended to confirm him in these opinions; and this admiration
(resulting originally from the general character of his taste,
which delighted more to remark that pliancy of genius which
accommodates itself to established rules, than to wonder at the
bolder flights of an undisciplined imagination) was increased to
a great degree, when he saw the beauties that had struck him in
the closet, heightened by the utmost perfection of theatrical
exhibition. In the last years of his life, he sometimes amused
himself, at a leisure hour, in supporting his theoretical
conclusions on these subjects, by the facts which his subsequent
studies and observations had suggested; and he intended, if he
had lived, to have prepared the result of these labours for the
press. Of this work he has left for publication a short fragment;
but he had not proceeded far enough to apply his doctrine to
versification and to the theatre. As his notions, however, with
respect to these were a favourite topic of his conversation, and
were intimately connected with his general principles of
criticism, it would have been improper to pass them over in this
sketch of his life; and I even thought it proper to detail them
at greater length than the comparative importance of the subject
would have justified, if he had carried his plans into execution.
Whether his love of system, added to his partiality for the
French drama, may not have led him, in this instance, to
generalize a little too much his conclusions, and to overlook
some peculiarities in the language and versification of that
country, I shall not take upon me to determine.
</p><p>In October 1766, the Duke of Buccleuch returned to London.
His Grace, to whom I am indebted for several particulars in the
foregoing narrative, will, I hope, forgive the liberty I take in
transcribing one paragraph in his own words: 'In October 1766, we
returned to London, after having spent near three years together,
without the slightest disagreement or coolness;- on my part, with
every advantage that could be expected from the society of such a
man. We continued to live in friendship till the hour of his
death; and I shall always remain with the impression of having
lost a friend whom I loved and respected, not only for his great
talents, but for every private virtue.'
</p><p>The retirement in which Mr Smith passed his next ten years,
formed a striking contrast to the unsettled mode of life he had
been for some time accustomed to, but was so congenial to his
natural disposition, and to his first habits, that it was with
the utmost difficulty he was ever persuaded to leave it. During
the whole of this period, (with the exception of a few visits to
Edinburgh and London,) he remained with his mother at Kirkaldy;
occupied habitually in intense study, but unbending his mind at
times in the company of some of his old school-fellows, whose
'sober wishes' had attached them to the place of their birth. In
the society of such men, Mr Smith delighted; and to them he was
endeared, not only by his simple and unassuming manners, but by
the perfect knowledge they all possessed of those domestic
virtues which had distinguished him from his infancy.
</p><p>Mr Hume, who (as he tells us himself) considered 'a town as
the true scene for a man of letters,' made many attempts to
seduce him from his retirement. In a letter, dated in 1772, he
urges him to pass some time with him in Edinburgh. 'I shall not
take any excuse from your state of health, which I suppose only a
subterfuge invented by indolence and love of solitude. Indeed, my
dear Smith, if you continue to hearken to complaints of this
nature, you will cut yourself out entirely from human society, to
the great loss of both parties.' In another letter, dated in
1769, from his house in James's Court, (which commanded a
prospect of the Frith of Forth, and of the opposite coast of
Fife,) 'I am glad (says he) to have come within sight of you; but
as I would also be within speaking terms of you, I wish we could
concert measures for that purpose. I am mortally sick at sea, and
regard with horror and a kind of hydrophobia the great gulf that
lies between us. I am also tired of travelling, as much as you
ought naturally to be of staying at home. I therefore propose to
you to come hither, and pass some days with me in this solitude.
I want to know what you have been doing, and propose to exact a
rigorous account of the method in which you have employed
yourself during your retreat. I am positive you are in the wrong
in many of your speculations, especially where you have the
misfortune to differ from me. All these are reasons for our
meeting, and I wish you would make me some reasonable proposal
for that purpose. There is no habitation in the island of
Inchkeith, otherwise I should challenge you to meet me on that
spot, and neither of us ever to leave the place, till we were
fully agreed on all points of controversy. I expect General
Conway here tomorrow, whom I shall attend to Roseneath, and I
shall remain there a few days. On my return, I hope to find a
letter from you, containing a bold acceptance of this defiance.'
</p><p>At length (in the beginning of the year 1776) Mr Smith
accounted to the world for his long retreat, by the publication
of his 'Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
Nations.' A letter of congratulation on this event, from Mr Hume,
is now before me. It is dated 1st April 1776 (about six months
before Mr Hume's death), and discovers an amiable solicitude
about his friend's literary fame. 'Euge! Belle! Dear Mr Smith: I
am much pleased with your performance, and the perusal of it has
taken me from a state of great anxiety. It was a work of so much
expectation, by yourself, by your friends, and by the public,
that I trembled for its appearance; but am now much relieved. Not
but that the reading of it necessarily requires so much
attention, and the public is disposed to give so little, that I
shall still doubt for some time of its being at first very
popular. But it has depth and solidity and acuteness, and is so
much illustrated by curious facts, that it must at last take the
public attention. It is probably much improved by your last abode
in London. If you were here at my fire-side, I should dispute
some of your principles.................. But these, and a
hundred other points, are fit only to be discussed in
conversation. I hope it will be soon; for I am in a very bad
state of health, and cannot afford a long delay.'
</p><p>Of a book which is now so universally known as 'The Wealth of
Nations,' it might be considered perhaps as superfluous to give a
particular analysis; and, at any rate, the limits of this essay
make it impossible for me to attempt it at present. A few
remarks, however, on the object and tendency of the work, may, I
hope, be introduced without impropriety. The history of a
philosopher's life can contain little more than the history of
his speculations; and in the case of such an author as Mr Smith,
whose studies were systematically directed from his youth to
subjects of the last importance to human happiness, a review of
his writings, while it serves to illustrate the peculiarities of
his genius, affords the most faithful picture of his character as
a man.</p>

<note place="end" id="n14"><seg type="note-symbol">[14]</seg> <p>The day after his arrival at Paris, Mr Smith sent a formal
resignation of his Professorship to the Rector of the University
of Glasgow. 'I never was more anxious (says he in the conclusion
of this letter) for the good of the College, than at this moment;
and I sincerely wish, that whoever is my successor may not only
do credit to the office by his abilities, but be a comfort to the
very excellent men with whom he is likely to spend his life, by
the probity of his heart, and the goodness of his temper.'
<lb/>
The following extract from the records of the University,
which follows immediately after Mr Smith's letter of resignation,
is at once a testimony to his assiduity as a Professor, and a
proof of the just sense which that learned body entertained of
the talents and worth of the colleague they had lost:
<lb/>
'The meeting accept of Dr Smith's resignation, in terms of
the above letter, and the office of Professor of Moral Philosophy
in this University is therefore hereby declared to be vacant. The
University, at the same time, cannot help expressing their
sincere regret at the removal of Dr Smith, whose distinguished
probity and amiable qualities procured him the esteem and
affection of his colleagues; and whose uncommon genius, great
abilities, and extensive learning, did so much honour to this
society; his elegant and ingenious Theory of Moral Sentiments
having recommended him to the esteem of men of taste and
literature throughout Europe. His happy talent in illustrating
abstracted subjects, and faithful assiduity in communicating
useful knowledge, distinguished him as a Professor, and at once
afforded the greatest pleasure and the most important instruction
to the youth under his care.'</p></note>

<lb/>Mr Smith's last intercourse with this excellent man was in
the year 1789,when he informed him, by means of a friend who
happened to be then in Paris, that in the future editions of his
Theory the name of Rochefoucauld should no longer be classed with
that of Mandeville. In the enlarged edition, accordingly, of that
work, published a short time before his death, he has suppressed
his censure of the author of the Maximes; who seems indeed
(however exceptionable many of his principles may be) to have
been actuated, both in his life and writings, by motives very
different from those of Mandeville. The real scope of these
maxims is placed, I think, in a just light by the ingenious
author of the notice to the edition of them published at Paris in
1778.</p></note>

Nations<ref target="n18">[18]</ref>
</head>

<div2 type="subsection" id="d15">

<p>An historical view of the different forms under which human
affairs have appeared in different ages and nations, naturally
suggests the question, Whether the experience of former times may
not now furnish some general principles to enlighten and direct
the policy of future legislators? The discussion, however, to
which this question leads, is of singular difficulty: as it
requires an accurate analysis of by far the most complicated
class of phenomena that can possibly engage our attention, those
which result from the intricate and often the imperceptible
mechanism of political society; -- a subject of observation which
seems, at first view, so little commensurate to our faculties,
that it has been generally regarded with the same passive
emotions of wonder and submission, with which, in the material
world, we survey the effects produced by the mysterious and
uncontroulable operation of physical causes. It is fortunate that
upon this, as upon many other occasions, the difficulties which
had long baffled the efforts of solitary genius begin to appear
less formidable to the united exertions of the race; and that in
proportion as the experience and the reasonings of different
individuals are brought to bear upon the same objects, and are
combined in such a manner as to illustrate and to limit each
other, the science of politics assumes more and more that
systematical form which encourages and aids the labours of future
inquirers.
</p><p>In prosecuting the science of politics on this plan, little
assistance is to be derived from the speculations of ancient
philosophers, the greater part of whom, in their political
inquiries, confined their attention to a comparison of the
different forms of government, and to an examination of the
provisions they made for perpetuating their own existence, and
for extending the glory of the state. It was reserved for modern
times to investigate those universal principles of justice and of
expediency, which ought, under every form of government, to
regulate the social order; and of which the object is, to make as
equitable a distribution as possible, among all the different
members of a community, of the advantages arising from the
political union.
</p><p>The invention of printing was perhaps necessary to prepare
the way for these researches. In those departments of literature
and of science, where genius finds within itself the materials of
its labours; in poetry, in pure geometry, and in some branches of
moral philosophy; the ancients have not only laid the foundations
on which we are to build, but have left great and finished models
for our imitation. But in physics, where our progress depends on
an immense collection of facts, and on a combination of the
accidental lights daily struck out in the innumerable walks of
observation and experiment; and in politics, where the materials
of our theories are equally scattered, and are collected and
arranged with still greater difficulty, the means of
communication afforded by the press have, in the course of two
centuries, accelerated the progress of the human mind, far beyond
what the most sanguine hopes of our predecessors could have
imagined.
</p><p>The progress already made in this science, inconsiderable as
it is in comparison of what may be yet expected, has been
sufficient to shew, that the happiness of mankind depends, not on
the share which the people possesses, directly or indirectly, in
the enactment of laws, but on the equity and expediency of the
laws that are enacted. The share which the people possesses in
the government is interesting chiefly to the small number of men
whose object is the attainment of political importance; but the
equity and expediency of the laws are interesting to every member
of the community: and more especially to those whose personal
insignificance leaves them no encouragement, but what they derive
from the general spirit of the government under which they live.
</p><p>It is evident, therefore, that the most important branch of
political science is that which has for its object to ascertain
the philosophical principles of jurisprudence; or (as Mr Smith
expresses it) to ascertain 'the general principles which ought to
run through and be the foundation of the laws of all
nations.'
<ref target="n19">[19]</ref>
In countries where the prejudices of the people
are widely at variance with these principles, the political
liberty which the constitution bestows, only furnishes them with
the means of accomplishing their own ruin: And if it were
possible to suppose these principles completely realized in any
system of laws, the people would have little reason to complain,
that they were not immediately instrumental in their enactment.
The only infallible criterion of the excellence of any
constitution is to be found in the detail of its municipal code;
and the value which wise men set on political freedom, arises
chiefly from the facility it is supposed to afford, for the
introduction of those legislative improvements which the general
interests of the community recommend; combined with the security
it provides in the light and spirit of the people, for the pure
and equal administration of justice. -- I cannot help adding,
that the capacity of a people to exercise political rights with
utility to themselves and to their country, presupposes a
diffusion of knowledge and of good morals, which can only result
from the previous operation of laws favourable to industry, to
order, and to freedom.
</p><p>Of the truth of these remarks, enlightened politicians seem
now to be in general convinced; for the most celebrated works
which have been produced in the different countries of Europe,
during the last thirty years, by Smith, Quesnai, Turgot,
Campomanes, Beccaria, and others, have aimed at the improvement
of society, -- not by delineating plans of new constitutions, but
by enlightening the policy of actual legislators. Such
speculations, while they are more essentially and more
extensively useful than any others, have no tendency to unhinge
established institutions, or to inflame the passions of the
multitude. The improvements they recommend are to be effected by
means too gradual and slow in their operation, to warm the
imaginations of any but of the speculative few; and in proportion
as they are adopted, they consolidate the political fabric, and
enlarge the basis upon which it rests.
</p><p>To direct the policy of nations with respect to one most
important class of its laws, those which form its system of
political economy, is the great aim of Mr Smith's Inquiry. And he
has unquestionably had the merit of presenting to the world, the
most comprehensive and perfect work that has yet appeared, on the
general principles of any branch of legislation. The example
which he has set will be followed, it is to be hoped, in due
time, by other writers, for whom the internal policy of states
furnishes many other subjects of discussion no less curious and
interesting; and may accelerate the progress of that science
which Lord Bacon has so well described in the following passage:
'Finis et scopus quem leges intueri, atque ad quem jussiones et
sanctiones suas dirigere debent, non alius est, quam ut cives
feliciter degant; id fiet, si pietate et religione recte
instituti; moribus honesti; armis adversus hostes externos tuti;
legum auxilio adversus seditiones et privatas injurias muniti;
imperio et magistratibus obsequentes; copiis et opibus locupletes
et florentes fuerint. -- Certe cognitio ista ad viros civiles
proprie spectat; qui optime norunt, quid ferat societas humana,
quid salus populi, quid aequitas naturalis, quid gentium mores,
quid rerumpublicarum formae diversae: ideoque possint de legibus,
ex principiis et praeceptis tam aequitatis naturalis, quam
politices decernere. Quamobrem id nunc agatur, ut fontes
justitiae et utilitatis publicae petantur, et in singulis juris
partibus character quidam et idea justi exhibeatur, ad quam
particularium regnorum et rerumpublicarum leges probare, atque
inde emendationem moliri, quisque, cui hoc cordi erit et curae,
possit.' The enumeration contained in the foregoing passage, of
the different objects of law, coincides very nearly with that
given by Mr Smith in the conclusion of his Theory of Moral
Sentiments; and the precise aim of the political speculations
which he then announced, and of which he afterwards published so
valuable a part in his Wealth of Nations, was to ascertain the
general principles of justice and of expediency, which ought to
guide the institutions of legislators on these important
articles; -- in the words of Lord Bacon, to ascertain those leges
legum, 'ex quibus informatio peti possit, quid in singulis
legibus bene aut perperam positum aut constitutum sit.'
</p><p>The branch of legislation which Mr Smith has made choice of
as the subject of his work, naturally leads me to remark a very
striking contrast between the spirit of ancient and of modern
policy in respect to the Wealth of Nations.
<ref target="n20">[20]</ref>
The great object
of the former was to counteract the love of money and a taste for
luxury, by positive institutions; and to maintain in the great
body of the people, habits of frugality, and a severity of
manners. The decline of states is uniformly ascribed by the
philosophers and historians, both of Greece and Rome, to the
influence of riches on national character; and the laws of
Lycurgus, which, during a course of ages, banished the precious
metals from Sparta, are proposed by many of them as the most
perfect model of legislation devised by human wisdom. -- How
opposite to this is the doctrine of modern politicians! Far from
considering poverty as an advantage to a state, their great aim
is to open new sources of national opulence, and to animate the
activity of all classes of the people, by a taste for the
comforts and accommodations of life.
</p><p>One principal cause of this difference between the spirit of
ancient and of modern policy, may be found in the difference
between the sources of national wealth in ancient and in modern
times. In ages when commerce and manufactures were yet in their
infancy, and among states constituted like most of the ancient
republics, a sudden influx of riches from abroad was justly
dreaded as an evil, alarming to the morals, to the industry, and
to the freedom of a people. So different, however, is the case at
present, that the most wealthy nations are those where the people
are the most laborious, and where they enjoy the greatest degree
of liberty. Nay, it was the general diffusion of wealth among the
lower orders of men, which first gave birth to the spirit of
independence in modern Europe, and which has produced under some
of its governments, and especially under our own, a more equal
diffusion of freedom and of happiness than took place under the
most celebrated constitutions of antiquity.
</p><p>Without this diffusion of wealth among the lower orders, the
important effects resulting from the invention of printing would
have been extremely limited; for a certain degree of ease and
independence is necessary to inspire men with the desire of
knowledge, and to afford them the leisure which is requisite for
acquiring it; and it is only by the rewards which such a state of
society holds up to industry and ambition, that the selfish
passions of the multitude can be interested in the intellectual
improvement of their children. The extensive propagation of light
and refinement arising from the influence of the press, aided by
the spirit of commerce, seems to be the remedy provided by
nature, against the fatal effects which would otherwise by
produced, by the subdivision of labour accompanying the progress
of the mechanical arts: Nor is any thing wanting to make the
remedy effectual, but wise institutions to facilitate general
instruction, and to adapt the education of individuals to the
stations they are to occupy. The mind of the artist, which, from
the limited sphere of his activity, would sink below the level of
the peasant or the savage, might receive in infancy the means of
intellectual enjoyment, and the seeds of moral improvement; and
even the insipid uniformity of his professional engagements, by
presenting no object to awaken his ingenuity or to distract his
attention, might leave him at liberty to employ his faculties, on
subjects more interesting to himself, and more extensively useful
to others.
</p><p>These effects, notwithstanding a variety of opposing causes
which still exist, have already resulted, in a very sensible
degree, from the liberal policy of modern times. Mr Hume, in his
Essay on Commerce, after taking notice of the numerous armies
raised and maintained by the small republics in the ancient
world, ascribes the military power of these states to their want
of commerce and luxury. 'Few artisans were maintained by the
labour of the farmers, and therefore more soldiers might live
upon it.' He adds, however, that 'the policy of ancient times was
VIOLENT, and contrary to the NATURAL course of things;' -- by
which, I presume, he means, that it aimed too much at modifying,
by the force of positive institutions, the order of society,
according to some preconceived idea of expediency; without
trusting sufficiently to those principles of the human
constitution, which, wherever they are allowed free scope, not
only conduct mankind to happiness, but lay the foundation of a
progressive improvement in their condition and in their
character. The advantages which modern policy possesses over the
ancient, arise principally from its conformity, in some of the
most important articles of political economy, to an order of
things recommended by nature; and it would not be difficult to
shew, that, where it remains imperfect, its errors may be traced
to the restraints it imposes on the natural course of human
affairs. Indeed, in these restraints may be discovered the latent
seeds of many of the prejudices and follies which infect modern
manners, and which have so long bid defiance to the reasonings of
the philosopher and the ridicule of the satirist.
</p><p>The foregoing very imperfect hints appeared to me to form,
not only a proper, but in some measure a necessary introduction
to the few remarks I have to offer on Mr Smith's Inquiry; as they
tend to illustrate a connection between his system of commercial
politics, and those speculations of his earlier years, in which
he aimed more professedly at the advancement of human improvement
and happiness. It is this view of political economy that can
alone render it interesting to the moralist, and can dignify
calculations of profit and loss in the eye of the philosopher. Mr
Smith has alluded to it in various passages of his work, but he
has nowhere explained himself fully on the subject; and the great
stress he has laid on the effects of the division of labour in
increasing its productive powers, seems, at first sight, to point
to a different and very melancholy conclusion; that the same
causes which promote the progress of the arts, tend to degrade
the mind of the artist; and, of consequence, that the growth of
national wealth implies a sacrifice of the character of the
people.
</p><p>The fundamental doctrines of Mr Smith's system are now so
generally known, that it would have been tedious to offer any
recapitulation of them in this place; even if I could have hoped
to do justice to the subject, within the limits which I have
prescribed to myself at present.
<ref target="n21">[21]</ref>
I shall content myself,
therefore, with remarking, in general terms, that the great and
leading object of his speculations is, to illustrate the
provision made by nature in the principles of the human mind, and
in the circumstances of man's external situation, for a gradual
and progressive augmentation in the means of national wealth; and
to demonstrate, that the most effectual plan for advancing a
people to greatness, is to maintain that order of things which
nature has pointed out; by allowing every man, as long as he
observes the rules of justice, to pursue his own interest in his
own way, and to bring both his industry and his capital into the
freest competition with those of his fellow-citizens. Every
system of policy which endeavours, either by extraordinary
encouragements to draw towards a particular species of industry a
greater share of the capital of the society than what would
naturally go to it, or, by extraordinary restraints, to force
from a particular species of industry some share of the capital
which would otherwise be employed in it, is, in reality,
subversive of the great purpose which it means to promote.
</p><p>What the circumstances are, which, in modern Europe, have
contributed to disturb this order of nature, and, in particular,
to encourage the industry of towns, at the expence of that of the
country, Mr Smith has investigated with great ingenuity; and in
such a manner, as to throw much new light on the history of that
state of society which prevails in this quarter of the globe. His
observations on this subject tend to shew, that these
circumstances were, in their first origin, the natural and the
unavoidable result of the peculiar situation of mankind during a
certain period; and that they took their rise, not from any
general scheme of policy, but from the private interests and
prejudices of particular orders of men.
</p><p>The state of society, however, which at first arose from a
singular combination of accidents, has been prolonged much beyond
its natural period, by a false system of political economy,
propagated by merchants and manufacturers; a class of
individuals, whose interest is not always the same with that of
the public, and whose professional knowledge gave them many
advantages, more particularly in the infancy of this branch of
science, in defending those opinions which they wished to
encourage. By means of this system, a new set of obstacles to the
progress of national prosperity has been created. Those which
arose from the disorders of the feudal ages, tended directly to
disturb the internal arrangements of society, by obstructing the
free circulation of labour and of stock, from employment to
employment, and from place to place. The false system of
political economy which has been hitherto prevalent, as its
professed object has been to regulate the commercial intercourse
between different nations, has produced its effect in a way less
direct and less manifest, but equally prejudicial to the states
that have adopted it.
</p><p>On this system, as it took its rise from the prejudices, or
rather from the interested views of mercantile speculators, Mr
Smith bestows the title of the Commercial or Mercantile System;
and he has considered at great length its two principal
expedients for enriching a nation; restraints upon importation,
and encouragements to exportation. Part of these expedients, he
observes, have been dictated by the spirit of monopoly, and part
by a spirit of jealousy against those countries with which the
balance of trade is supposed to be disadvantageous. All of them
appear clearly, from his reasonings, to have a tendency
unfavourable to the wealth of the nation which imposes them. His
remarks with respect to the jealousy of commerce are expressed in
a tone of indignation, which he seldom assumes in his political
writings.
</p><p>'In this manner (says he) the sneaking arts of underling
tradesmen are erected into political maxims for the conduct of a
great empire. By such maxims as these, nations have been taught
that their interest consisted in beggaring all their neighbours.
Each nation has been made to look with an invidious eye upon the
prosperity of all the nations with which it trades, and to
consider their gain as its own loss. Commerce, which ought
naturally to be among nations as among individuals, a bond of
union and friendship, has become the most fertile source of
discord and animosity. The capricious ambition of Kings and
Ministers. has not, during the present and the preceding century,
been more fatal to the repose of Europe, than the impertinent
jealousy of merchants and manufacturers. The violence and
injustice of the rulers of mankind is an ancient evil, for which
perhaps the nature of human affairs can scarce admit of a remedy.
But the mean rapacity, the monopolizing spirit of merchants and
manufacturers, who neither are nor ought to be the rulers of
mankind, though it cannot perhaps be corrected, may very easily
be prevented from disturbing the tranquillity of any body but
themselves.'
</p><p>Such are the liberal principles which, according to Mr Smith,
ought to direct the commercial policy of nations; and of which it
ought to be the great object of legislators to facilitate the
establishment. In what manner the execution of the theory should
be conducted in particular instances, is a question of a very
different nature, and to which the answer must vary, in different
countries, according to the different circumstances of the case.
In a speculative work, such as Mr Smith's, the consideration of
this question did not fall properly under his general plan; but
that he was abundantly aware of the danger to be apprehended from
a rash application of political theories, appears not only from
the general strain of his writings, but from some incidental
observations which he has expressly made upon the subject. 'So
unfortunate (says he, in one passage) are the effects of all the
regulations of the mercantile system, that they not only
introduce very dangerous disorders into the state of the body
politic, but disorders which it is often difficult to remedy,
without occasioning, for a time at least, still greater
disorders. -- In what manner, therefore, the natural system of
perfect liberty and justice ought gradually to be restored, we
must leave to the wisdom of future statesmen and legislators to
determine.' In the last edition of his Theory of Moral
Sentiments, he has introduced some remarks, which have an obvious
reference to the same important doctrine. The following passage
seems to refer more particularly to those derangements of the
social order which derived their origin from the feudal
institutions:
</p><p>'The man whose public spirit is prompted altogether by
humanity and benevolence, will respect the established powers and
privileges even of individuals, and still more of the great
orders and societies into which the state is divided. Though he
should consider some of them as in some measure abusive, he will
content himself with moderating, what he often cannot annihilate
without great violence. When he cannot conquer the rooted
prejudices of the people by reason and persuasion, he will not
attempt to subdue them by force; but will religiously observe
what, by Cicero, is justly called the divine maxim of Plato,
never to use violence to his country no more than to his parents.
He will accommodate, as well as he can, his public arrangements
to the confirmed habits and prejudices of the people; and will
remedy, as well as he can, the inconveniencies which may flow
from the want of those regulations which the people are averse to
submit to. When he cannot establish the right, he will not
disdain to ameliorate the wrong; but, like Solon, when he cannot
establish the best system of laws, he will endeavour to establish
the best that the people can bear.'
</p><p>These cautions with respect to the practical application of
general principles were peculiarly necessary from the Author of
'The Wealth of Nations;' as the unlimited freedom of trade, which
it is the chief aim of his work to recommend, is extremely apt,
by flattering the indolence of the statesman, to suggest to those
who are invested with absolute power, the idea of carrying it
into immediate execution. 'Nothing is more adverse to the
tranquillity of a statesman (says the author of an Eloge on the
Administration of Colbert) than a spirit of moderation; because
it condemns him to perpetual observation, shews him every moment
the insufficiency of his wisdom, and leaves him the melancholy
sense of his own imperfection; while, under the shelter of a few
general principles, a systematical politician enjoys a perpetual
calm. By the help of one alone, that of a perfect liberty of
trade, he would govern the world, and would leave human affairs
to arrange themselves at pleasure, under the operation of the
prejudices and the self-interests of individuals. If these run
counter to each other, he gives himself no anxiety about the
consequence; he insists that the result cannot be judged of till
after a century or two shall have elapsed. If his contemporaries,
in consequence of the disorder into which he has thrown public
affairs, are scrupulous about submitting quietly to the
experiment, he accuses them of impatience. They alone, and not
he, are to blame for what they have suffered; and the principle
continues to be inculcated with the same zeal and the same
confidence as before.' These are the words of the ingenious and
eloquent author of the Eloge on Colbert, which obtained the prize
from the French Academy in the year 1763; a performance which,
although confined and erroneous in its speculative views, abounds
with just and important reflections of a practical nature. How
far his remarks apply to that particular class of politicians
whom he had evidently in his eye in the foregoing passage, I
shall not presume to decide.
</p><p>It is hardly necessary for me to add to these observations,
that they do not detract in the least from the value of those
political theories which attempt to delineate the principles of a
perfect legislation. Such theories (as I have elsewhere
observed)
<ref target="n22">[22]</ref>
ought to be considered merely as descriptions of
the ultimate objects at which the statesman ought to aim. The
tranquillity of his administration, and the immediate success of
his measures, depend on his good sense and his practical skill;
and his theoretical principles only enable him to direct his
measures steadily and wisely, to promote the improvement and
happiness of mankind, and prevent him from being ever led astray
from these important ends, by more limited views of temporary
expedience. 'In all cases (says Mr Hume) it must be advantageous
to know what is most perfect in the kind, that we may be able to
bring any real constitution or form of government as near it as
possible, by such gentle alterations and innovations as may not
give too great disturbance to society.'
</p><p>The limits of this Memoir make it impossible for me to
examine particularly the merit of Mr Smith's work in point of
originality. That his doctrine concerning the freedom of trade
and of industry coincides remarkably with that which we find in
the writings of the French Economists, appears from the slight
view of their system which he himself has given. But it surely
cannot be pretended by the warmest admirers of that system, that
any one of its numerous expositors has approached to. Mr Smith in
the precision and perspicuity with which he has stated it, or in
the scientific and luminous manner in which he has deduced it
from elementary principles. The awkwardness of their technical
language, and the paradoxical form in which they have chosen to
present some of their opinions, are acknowledged even by those
who are most willing to do justice to their merits; whereas it
may be doubted, with respect to Mr Smith's Inquiry, if there
exists any book beyond the circle of the mathematical and
physical sciences, which is at once so agreeable in its
arrangement to the rules of a sound logic, and so accessible to
the examination of ordinary readers. Abstracting entirely from
the author's peculiar and original speculations, I do not know
that, upon any subject whatever, a work has been produced in our
times, containing so methodical, so comprehensive, and so
judicious a digest of all the most profound and enlightened
philosophy of the age.
<ref target="n23">[23]</ref>

</p><p>In justice also to Mr Smith, it must be observed, that
although some of the economical writers had the start of him in
publishing their doctrines to the world, these doctrines appear,
with respect to him, to have been altogether original, and the
result of his own reflections. Of this, I think, every person
must be convinced, who reads the Inquiry with due attention, and
is at pains to examine the gradual and beautiful progress of the
author's ideas: But in case any doubt should remain on this head,
it may be proper to mention, that Mr Smith's political lectures,
comprehending the fundamental principles of his Inquiry, were
delivered at Glasgow as early as the year 1752 or 1753; at a
period, surely, when there existed no French performance on the
subject, that could be of much use to him in guiding his
researches.
<ref target="n24">[24]</ref>
In the year 1756, indeed, M. Turgot (who is said
to have imbibed his first notions concerning the unlimited
freedom of commerce from an old merchant, M. Gournay), published
in the Encyclopedie, an article which sufficiently shews how
completely his mind was emancipated from the old prejudices in
favour of commercial regulations: But that even then, these
opinions were confined to a few speculative men in France,
appears from a passage in the Memoires Sur la Vie et les Ouvrages
de M. Turgot; in which, after a short quotation from the article
just mentioned, the author adds: 'These ideas were then
considered as paradoxical; they are since become common, and they
will one day be adopted universally.'
</p><p>The Political Discourses of Mr Hume were evidently of greater
use to Mr Smith, than any other book that had appeared prior to
his lectures. Even Mr Hume's theories, however, though always
plausible and ingenious, and in most instances profound and just,
involve some fundamental mistakes; and, when compared with Mr
Smith's, afford a striking proof, that, in considering a subject
so extensive and so complicated, the most penetrating sagacity,
if directed only to particular questions, is apt to be led astray
by first appearances; and that nothing can guard us effectually
against error, but a comprehensive survey of the whole field of
discussion, assisted by an accurate and patient analysis of the
ideas about which our reasonings are employed. -- It may be worth
while to add, that Mr. Hume's Essay 'on the Jealousy of Trade,'
with some other of his Political Discourses, received a very
flattering proof of M. Turgot's approbation, by his undertaking
the task of translating them into the French language.<ref
target="n25">[25]</ref>
</p><p>I am aware that the evidence I have hitherto produced of Mr
Smith's originality may be objected to as not perfectly decisive,
as it rests entirely on the recollection of those students who
attended his first courses of moral philosophy at Glasgow; a
recollection which, at the distance of forty years, cannot be
supposed to be very accurate. There exists, however, fortunately,
a short manuscript drawn up by Mr Smith in the year 1755, and
presented by him to a society of which he was then a member; in
which paper, a pretty long enumeration is given of certain
leading principles, both political and literary, to which he was
anxious to establish his exclusive right; in order to prevent the
possibility of some rival claims which he thought he had reason
to apprehend, and to which his situation as a Professor, added to
his unreserved communications in private companies, rendered him
peculiarly liable. This paper is at present in my possession. It
is expressed with a good deal of that honest and indignant
warmth, which is perhaps unavoidable by a man who is conscious of
the purity of his own intentions, when he suspects that
advantages have been taken of the frankness of his temper. On
such occasions, due allowances are not always made for those
plagiarisms, which, however cruel in their effects, do not
necessarily imply bad faith in those who are guilty of them; for
the bulk of mankind, incapable themselves of original thought,
are perfectly unable to form a conception of the nature of the
injury done to a man of inventive genius, by encroaching on a
favourite speculation. For reasons known to some members of this
Society, it would be improper, by the publication of this
manuscript, to revive the memory of private differences; and I
should not have even alluded to it, if I did not think it a
valuable document of the progress of Mr Smith's political ideas
at a very early period. Many of the most important opinions in
The Wealth of Nations are there detailed; but I shall quote only
the following sentences: 'Man is generally considered by
statesmen and projectors as the materials of a sort of political
mechanics. Projectors disturb nature in the course of her
operations in human affairs; and it requires no more than to let
her alone, and give her fair play in the pursuit of her ends,
that she may establish her own designs.' -- And in another
passage: 'Little else is requisite to carry a state to the
highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism, but peace,
easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice; all the
rest being brought about by the natural course of things. All
governments which thwart this natural course, which force things
into another channel, or which endeavour to arrest the progress
of society at a particular point, are unnatural, and to support
themselves are obliged to be oppressive and tyrannical. -- A
great part of the opinions (he observes) enumerated in this paper
is treated of at length in some lectures which I have still by
me, and which were written in the hand of a clerk who left my
service six years ago. They have all of them been the constant
subjects of my lectures since I first taught Mr Craigie's class,
the first winter I spent in Glasgow, down to this day, without
any considerable variation. They had all of them been the
subjects of lectures which I read at Edinburgh the winter before
I left it, and I can adduce innumerable witnesses, both from that
place and from this, who will ascertain them sufficiently to be
mine.'
</p><p>After all, perhaps the merit of such a work as Mr Smith's is
to be estimated less from the novelty of the principles it
contains, than from the reasonings employed to support these
principles, and from the scientific manner in which they are
unfolded in their proper order and connection. General assertions
with respect to the advantages of a free commerce, may be
collected from various writers of an early date. But in questions
of so complicated a nature as occur in political economy, the
credit of such opinions belongs of right to the author who first
established their solidity, and followed them out to their remote
consequences; not to him who, by a fortunate accident, first
stumbled on the truth.
</p><p>Besides the principles which Mr Smith considered as more
peculiarly his own, his Inquiry exhibits a systematical view of
the most important articles of political economy, so as to serve
the purpose of an elementary treatise on that very extensive and
difficult science. The skill and the comprehensiveness of mind
displayed in his arrangement, can be judged of by those alone who
have compared it with that adopted by his immediate predecessors.
And perhaps, in point of utility, the labour he has employed in
connecting and methodizing their scattered ideas, is not less
valuable than the results of his own original speculations: For
it is only when digested in a clear and natural order, that
truths make their proper impression on the mind, and that
erroneous opinions can be combated with success.
</p><p>It does not belong to my present undertaking (even if I were
qualified for such a task) to attempt a separation of the solid
and important doctrines of Mr Smith's book from those opinions
which appear exceptionable or doubtful. I acknowledge, that there
are some of his conclusions to which I would not be understood to
subscribe implicitly; more particularly in that chapter, where he
treats of the principles of taxation; -- a subject, which he has
certainly examined in a manner more loose and unsatisfactory than
most of the others which have fallen under his review.
<ref target="n26">[26]</ref>
</p><p>It would be improper for me to conclude this section without
taking notice of the manly and dignified freedom with which the
author uniformly delivers his opinions, and of the superiority
which he discovers throughout, to all the little passions
connected with the factions of the times in which he wrote.
Whoever takes the trouble to compare the general tone of his
composition with the period of its first publication, cannot fail
to feel and acknowledge the force of this remark. -- It is not
often that a disinterested zeal for truth has so soon met with
its just reward. Philosophers (to use an expression of Lord
Bacon's) are 'the servants of posterity;' and most of those who
have devoted their talents to the best interests of mankind, have
been obliged, like Bacon, to 'bequeath their fame' to a race yet
unborn, and to console themselves with the idea of sowing what
another generation was to reap:

</p><p>Insere Daphni pyros, carpent tua poma nepotes.

</p><p>Mr Smith was more fortunate; or rather, in this respect, his
fortune was singular. He survived the publication of his work
only fifteen years; and yet, during that short period, he had not
only the satisfaction of seeing the opposition it at first
excited, gradually subside, but to witness the practical
influence of his writings on the commercial policy of his
country. </p>

<head>SECTION V. Conclusion of the Narrative</head>

<div2 type="subsection" id="d18">

<p>About two years after the publication of 'The Wealth of
Nations,' Mr Smith was appointed one of the Commissioners of his
Majesty's Customs in Scotland; a preferment which, in his
estimation, derived an additional value from its being bestowed
on him at the request of the Duke of Buccleuch. The greater part
of these two years he passed in London, enjoying a society too
extensive and varied to afford him any opportunity of indulging
his taste for study. His time, however, was not lost to himself;
for much of it was spent with some of the first names in English
literature. Of these no unfavourable specimen is preserved by Dr
Barnard, in his well-known 'Verses addressed to Sir Joshua
Reynolds and his friends.'</p>

<lg>
<l>If I have thoughts, and can't express 'em,</l>
<l>Gibbon shall teach me how to dress 'em</l>
<l>In words select and terse:</l>
<l>Jones teach me modesty and Greek,</l>
<l>Smith how to think, Burke how to speak,</l>
<l>And Beauclerc to</l>
<l>converse.
<ref target="n27">[27]</ref>
</l>
</lg>

<p>In consequence of Mr Smith's appointment to the Board of
Customs, he removed, in 1778, to Edinburgh, where he spent the
last twelve years of his life; enjoying an affluence which was
more than equal to all his wants; and, what was to him of still
greater value, the prospect of passing the remainder of his days
among the companions of his youth.
</p><p>His mother, who, though now in extreme old age, still
possessed a considerable degree of health, and retained all her
faculties unimpaired, accompanied him to town; and his cousin
Miss Jane Douglas, (who had formerly been a member of his family
at Glasgow, and for whom he had always felt the affection of a
brother) while she divided with him those tender attentions which
her aunt's infirmities required, relieved him of a charge for
which he was peculiarly ill qualified, by her friendly
superintendence of his domestic economy.
</p><p>The accession to his income which his new office brought him,
enabled him to gratify, to a much greater extent than his former
circumstances admitted of, the natural generosity of his
disposition; and the state of his funds at the time of his death,
compared with his very moderate establishment, confirmed, beyond
a doubt, what his intimate acquaintances had often suspected,
that a large proportion of his annual savings was allotted to
offices of secret charity. A small, but excellent library, which
he had gradually formed with great judgment in the selection; and
a simple, though hospitable table, where, without the formality
of an invitation, he was always happy to receive his friends,
were the only expences that could be considered as his own.
<ref target="n28">[28]</ref>
</p><p>The change in his habits which his removal to Edinburgh
produced, was not equally favourable to his literary pursuits.
The duties of his office, though they required but little
exertion of thought, were yet sufficient to waste his spirits and
to dissipate his attention; and now that his career is closed, it
is impossible to reflect on the time they consumed, without
lamenting, that it had not been employed in labours more
profitable to the world, and more equal to his mind. During the
first years of his residence in this city, his studies seemed to
be entirely suspended; and his passion for letters served only to
amuse his leisure, and to animate his conversation. The
infirmities of age, of which he very early began to feel the
approaches, reminded him at last, when it was too late, of what
he yet owed to the public, and to his own fame. The principal
materials of the works which he had announced, had been long ago
collected; and little probably was wanting, but a few years of
health and retirement, to bestow on them that systematical
arrangement in which he delighted; and the ornaments of that
flowing, and apparently artless style, which he had studiously
cultivated, but which, after all his experience in composition,
he adjusted, with extreme difficulty, to his own taste.
<ref target="n29">[29]</ref>
</p><p>The death of his mother in 1784, which was followed by that
of Miss Douglas in 1788, contributed, it is probable, to
frustrate these projects. They had been the objects of his
affection for more than sixty years; and in their society he had
enjoyed, from his infancy, all that he ever knew of the
endearments of a family.
<ref target="n30">[30]</ref>
He was now alone, and helpless;
and, though he bore his loss with equanimity, and regained
apparently his former cheerfulness, yet his health and strength
gradually declined till the period of his death, which happened
in July 1790, about two years after that of his cousin, and six
after that of his mother. His last illness, which arose from a
chronic obstruction in his bowels, was lingering and painful; but
had every consolation to sooth it which he could derive from the
tenderest sympathy of his friends, and from the complete
resignation of his own mind.
</p><p>A few days before his death, finding his end approach
rapidly, he gave orders to destroy all his manuscripts, excepting
some detached essays, which he entrusted to the care of his
executors; and they were accordingly committed to the flames.
What were the particular contents of these papers, is not known
even to his most intimate friends; but there can be no doubt that
they consisted, in part, of the lectures on rhetoric, which he
read at Edinburgh in the year 1748, and of the lectures on
natural religion and on jurisprudence, which formed part of his
course at Glasgow. That this irreparable injury to letters
proceeded, in some degree, from an excessive solicitude in the
author about his posthumous reputation, may perhaps be true; but
with respect to some of his manuscripts, may we not suppose, that
he was influenced by higher motives? It is but seldom that a
philosopher, who has been occupied from his youth with moral or
with political inquiries, succeeds completely to his wish in
stating to others, the grounds upon which his own opinions are
founded; and hence it is, that the known principles of an
individual, who has approved to the public his candour, his
liberality, and his judgment, are entitled to a weight and an
authority, independent of the evidence which he is able, upon any
particular occasion, to produce in their support. A secret
consciousness of this circumstance, and an apprehension that, by
not doing justice to an important argument, the progress of truth
may be rather retarded than advanced, have probably induced many
authors to withhold from the world the unfinished results of
their most valuable labours; and to content themselves with
giving the general sanction of their suffrages to truths which
they regarded as peculiarly interesting to the human race.
<ref target="n31">[31]</ref>
</p><p>The additions to the Theory of Moral Sentiments, most of
which were composed under severe disease, had fortunately been
sent to the press in the beginning of the preceding winter; and
the author lived to see the publication of the work. The moral
and serious strain that prevails through these additions, when
connected with the circumstance of his declining health, adds a
peculiar charm to his pathetic eloquence, and communicates a new
interest, if possible, to those sublime truths, which, in the
academical retirement of his youth, awakened the first ardours of
his genius, and on which the last efforts of his mind reposed.
</p><p>In a letter addressed, in the year 1787, to the Principal of
the University of Glasgow, in consequence of being elected Rector
of that learned body, a pleasing memorial remains of the
satisfaction with which he always recollected that period of his
literary career, which had been more peculiarly consecrated to
these important studies. 'No preferment (says he) could have
given me so much real satisfaction. No man can owe greater
obligations to a society than I do to the University of Glasgow.
They educated me; they sent me to Oxford. Soon after my return to
Scotland, they elected me one of their own members; and
afterwards preferred me to another office, to which the abilities
and virtues of the never to be forgotten Dr Hutcheson had given a
superior degree of illustration. The period of thirteen years
which I spent as a member of that society, I remember as by far
the most useful, and therefore as by far the happiest and most
honourable period of my life; and now, after three and twenty
years absence, to be remembered in so very agreeable a manner by
my old friends and protectors, gives me a heart-felt joy which I
cannot easily express to you.'
</p><p>The short narrative which I have now finished, however barren
of incident, may convey a general idea of the genius and
character of this illustrious Man. Of the intellectual gifts and
attainments by which he was so eminently distinguished; -- of the
originality and comprehensiveness of his views; the extent, the
variety, and the correctness of his information; the
inexhaustible fertility of his invention; and the ornaments which
his rich and beautiful imagination had borrowed from classical
culture; -- he has left behind him lasting monuments. To his
private worth the most certain of all testimonies may be found in
that confidence, respect, and attachment, which followed him
through all the various relations of life. The serenity and
gaiety he enjoyed, under the pressure of his growing infirmities,
and the warm interest he felt to the last, in every thing
connected with the welfare of his friends, will be long
remembered by a small circle, with whom, as long as his strength
permitted, he regularly spent an evening in the week; and to whom
the recollection of his worth still forms a pleasing, though
melancholy bond of union.
</p><p>The more delicate and characteristical features of his mind,
it is perhaps impossible to trace. That there were many
peculiarities, both in his manners, and in his intellectual
habits, was manifest to the most superficial observer. but
although, to those who knew him, these peculiarities detracted
nothing from the respect which his abilities commanded; and
although, to his intimate friends, they added an inexpressible
charm to his conversation, while they displayed, in the most
interesting light, the artless simplicity of his heart; yet it
would require a very skilful pencil to present them to the public
eye. He was certainly not fitted for the general commerce of the
world, or for the business of active life. The comprehensive
speculations with which he had been occupied from his youth, and
the variety of materials which his own invention continually
supplied to his thoughts, rendered him habitually inattentive to
familiar objects, and to common occurrences; and he frequently
exhibited instances of absence, which have scarcely been
surpassed by the fancy of La Bruyere. Even in company, he was apt
to be engrossed with his studies; and appeared, at times, by the
motion of his lips, as well as by his looks and gestures, to be
in the fervour of composition. I have often, however, been
struck, at the distance of years, with his accurate memory of the
most trifling particulars; and am inclined to believe, from this
and some other circumstances, that he possessed a power, not
perhaps uncommon among absent men, of recollecting, in
consequence of subsequent efforts of reflection, many
occurrences, which, at the time when they happened, did not seem
to have sensibly attracted his notice.
</p><p>To the defect now mentioned, it was probably owing, in part,
that he did not fall in easily with the common dialogue of
conversation, and that he was somewhat apt to convey his own
ideas in the form of a lecture. When he did so, however, it never
proceeded from a wish to engross the discourse, or to gratify his
vanity. His own inclination disposed him so strongly to enjoy in
silence the gaiety of those around him, that his friends were
often led to concert little schemes, in order to engage him in
the discussions most likely to interest him. Nor do I think I
shall be accused of going too far, when I say, that he was
scarcely ever known to start a new topic himself, or to appear
unprepared upon those topics that were introduced by others.
Indeed, his conversation was never more amusing than when he gave
a loose to his genius, upon the very few branches of knowledge of
which he only possessed the outlines.
</p><p>The opinions he formed of men, upon a slight acquaintance,
were frequently erroneous; but the tendency of his nature
inclined him much more to blind partiality, than to ill-founded
prejudice. The enlarged views of human affairs, on which his mind
habitually dwelt, left him neither time nor inclination to study,
in detail, the uninteresting peculiarities of ordinary
characters; and accordingly, though intimately acquainted with
the capacities of the intellect, and the workings of the heart,
and accustomed, in his theories, to mark, with the most delicate
hand, the nicest shades, both of genius and of the passions; yet,
in judging of individuals, it sometimes happened, that his
estimates were, in a surprising degree, wide of the truth.
</p><p>The opinions, too, which, in the thoughtlessness and
confidence of his social hours, he was accustomed to hazard on
books, and on questions of speculation, were not uniformly such
as might have been expected from the superiority of his
understanding, and the singular consistency of his philosophical
principles. They were liable to be influenced by accidental
circumstances, and by the humour of the moment; and when retailed
by those who only saw him occasionally, suggested false and
contradictory ideas of his real sentiments. On these, however, as
on most other occasions, there was always much truth, as well as
ingenuity, in his remarks; and if the different opinions which,
at different times, he pronounced upon the same subject, had been
all combined together, so as to modify and limit each other, they
would probably have afforded materials for a decision, equally
comprehensive and just. But, in the society of his friends, he
had no disposition to form those qualified conclusions that we
admire in his writings; and he generally contented himself with a
bold and masterly sketch of the object, from the first point of
view in which his temper, or his fancy, presented it. Something
of the same kind might be remarked, when he attempted, in the
flow of his spirits, to delineate those characters which, from
long intimacy, he might have been supposed to understand
thoroughly. The picture was always lively, and expressive; and
commonly bore a strong and amusing resemblance to the original,
when viewed under one particular aspect; but seldom, perhaps,
conveyed a just and complete conception of it in all its
dimensions and proportions. -- In a word, it was the fault of his
unpremeditated judgments, to be too systematical, and too much in
extremes.
</p><p>But, in whatever way these trifling peculiarities in his
manners may be explained, there can be no doubt, that they were
intimately connected with the genuine artlessness of his mind. In
this amiable quality, he often recalled to his friends, the
accounts that are given of good La Fontaine; a quality which in
him derived a peculiar grace from the singularity of its
combination with those powers of reason and of eloquence, which,
in his political and moral writings, have long engaged the
admiration of Europe.
</p><p>In his external form and appearance, there was nothing
uncommon. When perfectly at ease, and when warmed with
conversation, his gestures were animated, and not ungraceful:
and, in the society of those he loved, his features were often
brightened with a smile of inexpressible benignity. In the
company of strangers, his tendency to absence, and perhaps still
more his consciousness of this tendency, rendered his manner
somewhat embarrassed; -- an effect which was probably not a
little heightened by those speculative ideas of propriety, which
his recluse habits tended at once to perfect in his conception,
and to diminish his power of realizing. He never sat for his
picture; but the medallion of Tassie conveys an exact idea of his
profile, and of the general expression of his countenance.
</p><p>His valuable library, together with the rest of his property,
was bequeathed to his cousin Mr David Douglas, Advocate.
<ref target="n32">[32]</ref> In
the education of this young gentleman, he had employed much of
his leisure; and it was only two years before his death (at a
time when he could ill spare the pleasure of his society), that
he had sent him to study law at Glasgow, under the care of Mr
Millar; -- the strongest proof he could give of his disinterested
zeal for the improvement of his friend, as well as of the esteem
in which he held the abilities of that eminent Professor.
</p><p>The executors of his will were Dr Black and Dr Hutton; with
whom he had long lived in habits of the most intimate and cordial
friendship; and who, to the many other testimonies which they had
given him of their affection, added the mournful office of
witnessing his last moments.</p>

<note place="end" id="n27"><seg type="note-symbol">[27]</seg> <p>Some very affecting instances of Mr Smith's beneficence, in
cases where he found it impossible to conceal entirely his good
offices, have been mentioned to me by a near relation of his, and
one of his most confidential friends, Miss Ross, daughter of the
late Patrick Ross, Esq. of Innernethy. They were all on a scale
much beyond what might have been expected from his fortune; and
were accompanied with circumstances equally honourable to the
delicacy of his feelings and the liberality of his heart.</p></note>

<note place="end" id="n28"><seg type="note-symbol">[28]</seg> <p>Mr Smith observed to me, not long before his death, that
after all his practice in writing, he composed slowly, and with
as great difficulty, as at first. He added, at the same time,
that Mr Hume had acquired so great a facility in this respect,
that the last volumes of his History were printed from his
original copy, with a few marginal corrections.
<lb/>It may gratify the curiosity of some readers to know, that
when Mr Smith was employed in composition, he generally walked up
and down his apartment, dictating to a secretary. All Mr Hume's
works (I have been assured) were written in his own hand. A
critical reader may, I think, perceive in the different styles of
these two classical writers, the effects of their different modes
of study.</p></note>

<note place="end" id="n30"><seg type="note-symbol">[30]</seg> <p>Since writing the above, I have been favoured by Dr Hutton
with the following particulars.
<lb/>"Some time before his last illness, when Mr Smith had
occasion to go to London, he enjoined his friends, to whom he had
entrusted the disposal of his manuscripts, that, in the event of
his death, they should destroy all the volumes of his lectures,
doing with the rest of his manuscripts what they pleased. When
now he had become weak, and saw the approaching period of his
life, he spoke to his friends again upon the same subject. They
entreated him to make his mind easy, as he might depend upon
their fulfilling his desire. He was then satisfied. But some days
afterwards, finding his anxiety not entirely removed, he begged
one of them to destroy the volumes immediately. This accordingly
was done; and his mind was so much relieved, that he was able to
receive his friends in the evening with his usual complacency.

<lb/>They had been in use to sup with him every Sunday; and that
evening there was a pretty numerous meeting of them. Mr Smith not
finding himself able to sit up with them as usual, retired to bed
before supper; and, as he went away, took leave of his friends by
saying "I believe we must adjourn this meeting to some other
place." He died a very few days afterwards."

<lb/>Mr Riddell, an intimate friend of Mr Smith's, who was present
at one of the conversations on the subject of the manuscripts,
mentioned to me, in addition to Dr Hutton's note, that Mr Smith
regretted 'he had done so little'. But I meant (said he) to have
done more; and there are materials in my papers, of which I could
have made a great deal. But that is now out of the question.'

<lb/>That the idea of destroying such unfinished works as might be
in his possession at the time of his death, was not the effect of
any sudden or hasty resolution, appears from the following letter
to Mr Hume, written by Mr Smith in 1773, at a time when he was
preparing himself for a journey to London, with the prospect of a
pretty long absence from Scotland.

<lb/>Edinburgh, 16th April 1773. <lb/>
My dear Friend,

<lb/>As I have left the care of all my literary papers to you,
I must tell you, that except those which I carry along with me,
there are none worth the publication, but a fragment of a great
work, which contains a history of the astronomical systems that
were successively in fashion down to the time of Des Cartes.
Whether that might not be published as a fragment of an intended
juvenile work, I leave entirely to your judgment, though I begin
to suspect myself that there is paper book in my back room. All
the other loose papers which you will find in that desk, or
within the glass folding doors of a bureau which stands in my bed
room, together with about eighteen thin paper folio books, which
you will likewise find within the same glass folding doors, I
desire to be destroyed without any examination. Unless I die very
suddenly, I shall take care that the papers I carry with me shall
be carefully sent to you.
<lb/>I ever am, my dear Friend, most faithfully your's<lb/>
Adam Smith.

<lb/>To David Hume, Esq.

<p>[A]<lb/>
<lb/>
'Of this number were Mr Oswald of Dunikeir,' etc.] -- The
late James Oswald, Esq. -- for many years one of the most active,
able and public spirited of our Scottish representatives in
Parliament. He was more particularly distinguished by his
knowledge in matters of finance, and by his attention to whatever
concerned the commercial or the agricultural interests of the
country. From the manner in which he is mentioned in a paper of
Mr Smith's which I have perused, he appears to have combined,
with that detailed information which he is well known to have
possessed as a statesman and man of business, a taste for the
more general and philosophical discussions of political economy.
He lived in habits of great intimacy with Lord Kames and Mr Hume;
and was one of Mr Smith's earliest and most confidential friends.

</p><p>[B]<lb/>
<lb/>
'The lectures of the profound and eloquent Dr Hutcheson,'
etc.] Those who have derived their knowledge of Dr Hutcheson
solely from his publications, may, perhaps, be inclined to
dispute the propriety of the epithet eloquent, when applied to
any of his compositions; more particularly, when applied to the
System of Moral Philosophy, which was published after his death,
as the substance of his lectures in the University of Glasgow.
His talents, however, as a public speaker, must have been of a
far higher order than what he has displayed as a writer; all his
pupils whom I have happened to meet with (some of them,
certainly, very competent judges) having agreed exactly with each
other in their accounts of the extraordinary impression which
they made on the minds of his hearers. I have mentioned, in the
text, Mr Smith as one of his warmest admirers; and to his name I
shall take this opportunity of adding those of the late Earl of
Selkirk; the late Lord President Miller; and the late Dr
Archibald Maclaine, the very learned and judicious translator of
Mosheim's Ecclesiastical History. My father, too, who had
attended Dr Hutcheson's lectures for several years, never spoke
of them without much sensibility. On this occasion we can only
say, as Quinctilian has done of the eloquence of Hortensius;
'Apparet placuisse aliquid eo dicente, quod legentes non
invenimus.'
</p><p>Dr Hutcheson's Inquiry into our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue;
his Discourse on the Passions; and his Illustrations of the Moral
Sense, are much more strongly marked with the characteristical
features of his genius, than his posthumous work. His great and
deserved fame, however, in this country, rests now chiefly on the
traditionary history of his academical lectures, which appear to
have contributed very powerfully to diffuse, in Scotland, that
taste for analytical discussion, and that spirit of liberal
inquiry, to which the world is indebted for some of the most
valuable productions of the eighteenth century.

</p><p>[C]<lb/>
<lb/>
According to the learned English translator of 'Aristotle's
Ethics and Politics,' the general idea which runs through Mr
Smith's Theory, was obviously borrowed from the following passage
of Polybius: 'From the union of the two sexes, to which all are
naturally inclined, children are born. When any of these,
therefore, being arrived at perfect age, instead of yielding
suitable returns of gratitude and assistance to those by whom
they have been bred, on the contrary, attempt to injure them by
words or actions, it is manifest that those who behold the wrong,
after having also seen the sufferings and the anxious cares that
were sustained by the parents in the nourishment and education of
their children, must be greatly offended and displeased at such
proceeding. For man, who among all the various kinds of animals
is alone endowed with the faculty of reason, cannot, like the
rest, pass over such actions: but will make reflection on what he
sees; and comparing likewise the future with the present, will
not fail to express his indignation at this injurious treatment;
to which, as he foresees, he may also, at some time, be exposed.
Thus again, when any one who has been succoured by another in the
time of danger, instead of shewing the like kindness to this
benefactor, endeavours at any time to destroy or hurt him; it is
certain, that all men must be shocked by such ingratitude,
through sympathy with the resentment of their neighbour; and from
an apprehension also, that the case may be their own. And from
hence arises, in the mind of every man, a certain notion of the
nature and force of duty, in which consists both the beginning
and the end of justice. In like manner, the man, who, in defence
of others, is seen to throw himself the foremost into every
danger, and even to sustain the fury of the fiercest animals,
never fails to obtain the loudest acclamations of applause and
veneration from all the multitude; while he who shews a different
conduct is pursued with censure and reproach. And thus it is,
that the people begin to discern the nature of things honourable
and base, and in what consists the difference between them; and
to perceive that the former, on account of the advantage that
attends them, are fit to be admired and imitated, and the latter
to be detested and avoided.'
</p><p>'The doctrine' (says Dr Gillies) 'contained in this passage
is expanded by Dr Smith into a theory of moral sentiments. But he
departs from his author, in placing the perception of right and
wrong, in sentiment or feeling, ultimately and simply. Polybius,
on the contrary, maintains with Aristotle, that these notions
arise from reason, or intellect, operating on affection or
appetite; or, in other words, that the moral faculty is a
compound, and may be resolved into two simpler principles of the
mind.' -- (Gillies's Aristotle, Vol. I. pp. 302, 303, 2d Edit.)
</p><p>The only expression I object to in the two preceding
sentences, is the phrase, his author, which has the appearance of
insinuating a charge of plagiarism against Mr Smith; a charge
which, I am confident, he did not deserve; and to which the above
extract does not, in my opinion, afford any plausible colour. It
exhibits, indeed, an instance of a curious coincidence between
two philosophers in their views of the same subject; and as such,
I have no doubt that Mr Smith himself would have remarked it, had
it occurred to his memory, when he was writing his book. Of such
accidental coincidences between different minds, examples present
themselves every day to those, who, after having drawn from their
internal resources all the lights they could supply on a
particular question, have the curiosity to compare their own
conclusions with those of their predecessors: And it is extremely
worthy of observation, that, in proportion as any conclusion
approaches to the truth, the number of previous approximations to
it may be reasonably expected to be multiplied.
</p><p>In the case before us, however, the question about
originality is of little or no moment; for the peculiar merit of
Mr Smith's work does not lie in his general principle, but in the
skilful use he has made of it to give a systematical arrangement
to the most important discussions and doctrines of Ethics. In
this point of view, the Theory of Moral Sentiments may be justly
regarded as one of the most original efforts of the human mind in
that branch of science to which it relates; and even if we were
to suppose that it was first suggested to the author by a remark
of which the world was in possession for two thousand years
before, this very circumstance would only reflect a stronger
lustre on the novelty of his design, and on the invention and
taste displayed in its execution.
</p><p>I have said, in the text, that my own opinion about the
foundation of morals does not agree with that of Mr Smith; and I
propose to state, in another publication, the grounds of my
dissent from his conclusions on that question.
<ref target="n33">[33]</ref>
At present, I
shall only observe, that I consider the defects of his Theory as
originating rather in a partial, than in a mistaken view of the
subject; while, on some of the most essential points of ethics,
it appears to me to approximate very nearly to a correct
statement of the truth. I must not omit to add, in justice to the
author, that his zeal to support his favourite system never has
led him to vitiate or misrepresent the phenomena which he has
employed it to explain; and that the connected order which he has
given to a multiplicity of isolated facts, must facilitate
greatly the studies of any of his successors, who may hereafter
prosecute the same inquiry, agreeably to the severe rules of the
inductive logic.

</p><p>After the passage which I have quoted in the beginning of
this note, I hope I shall be pardoned if I express my doubts,
whether the learned and ingenious writer has not, upon this, as
well as on some other occasions, allowed his partiality to the
ancients to blind him a little too much to the merits of his
contemporaries. Would not his laborious and interesting
researches into the remains of the Greek philosophy, have been
employed still more usefully in revealing to us the systems and
discoveries to which our successors may yet lay claim, than in
conjectures concerning the origin of those with which we are
already acquainted? How does it happen that those men of profound
erudition, who can so easily trace every past improvement to the
fountain-head of antiquity, should not sometimes amuse
themselves, and instruct the world, by anticipating the future
progress of the human mind.
</p><p>In studying the connection and filiation of successive
Theories, when we are at a loss, in any instance, for a link to
complete the continuity of philosophical speculation, it seems
much more reasonable to search for it in the systems of the
immediately preceding period, and in the inquiries which then
occupied the public attention, than in detached sentences, or
accidental expressions gleaned from the relics of distant ages.
It is thus only, that we can hope to seize the precise point of
view, in which an author's subject first presented itself to his
attention; and to account, to our own satisfaction, from the
particular aspect under which he saw it, for the subsequent
direction which was given to his curiosity. In following such a
plan, our object is not to detect plagiarisms, which we suppose
men of genius to have intentionally concealed; but to fill up an
apparent chasm in the history of Science, by laying hold of the
thread which insensibly guided the mind from one station to
another. By what easy and natural steps Mr Smith's Theory arose
from the state of ethical discussion in Great Britain, when he
began his literary career, I shall endeavour elsewhere to
explain.
</p><p>A late author, of taste and learning, has written a pleasing
and instructive essay on the Marks of Poetical Imitation. The
marks of Philosophical Plagiarism, are not less discernible by an
unprejudiced and discriminating eye; and are easily separable
from that occasional similarity of thought and of illustration,
which we may expect to meet with in writers of the most remote
ages and countries, when employed in examining the same
questions, or in establishing the same truths.
</p><p>As the foregoing observations apply with fully as great force
to the Wealth of Nations, as to the Theory of Moral Sentiments, I
trust some allowance will be made for the length of this
note.

<lb/>
Dr. Adam Smith to Mr. George Baird<lb/>
Glasgow, February 7, 1763.<lb/>

</p><p>'DEAR SIR, I have read over the contents of your
friend's
<ref target="n34">[34]</ref>
work with very great pleasure; and heartily wish it
was in my power to give, or to procure him all the encouragement
which his ingenuity and industry deserve. I think myself greatly
obliged to him for the very obliging notice he has been pleased
to take of me, and should be glad to contribute anything in my
power towards completing his design. I approve greatly of his
plan for a Rational Grammar, and am convinced that a work of this
kind, executed with his abilities and industry, may prove not
only the best system of grammar, but the best system of logic in
any language, as well as the best history of the natural progress
of the human mind in forming the most important abstractions upon
which all reasoning depends. From the short abstract which Mr
Ward has been so good as to send me, it is impossible for me to
form any very decisive judgement concerning the propriety of
every part of his method, particularly of some of his divisions.
If I was to treat the same subject, I should endeavour to begin
with the consideration of verbs; these being, in my apprehension,
the original parts of speech, first invented to express in one
word a complete event: I should then have endeavoured to show how
the subject was divided from the attribute; and afterwards, how
the object was distinguished from both; and in this manner I
should have tried to investigate the origin and use of all the
different parts of speech, and of all their different
modifications, considered as necessary to express all the
different qualifications and relations of any single event. Mr
Ward, however, may have excellent reasons for following his own
method; and, perhaps, if I was engaged in the same task, I should
find it necessary to follow the same, -- things frequently
appearing in a very different light when taken in a general view,
which is the only view that I can pretend to have taken of them,
and when considered in detail.
</p><p>Mr Ward, when he mentions the definitions which different
authors have given of nouns substantive, takes no notice of that
of the Abbe Girard, the author of a book called Les vrais
Principes de la Langue Francaise, which made me think it might be
possible he had not seen it. It is a book which first set me a
thinking upon these subjects, and I have received more
instruction from it than from any other I have yet seen upon
them. If Mr Ward has not seen it, I have it at his service. The
grammatical articles, too, in the French Encyclopedie have given
me a good deal of entertainment. Very probably Mr Ward has seen
both these works, and, as he may have considered the subject more
than I have done, may think less of them. Remember me to Mrs
Baird, and Mr Oswald; and believe me to be, with great truth,
dear Sir, sincerely yours,<lb/>
(Signed) ADAM SMITH.'

</p><p>[E]<lb/>
<lb/>
I ought to have mentioned, among the number of Mr Smith's
friends at Paris, the Abbe Morellet, of whom I have frequently
heard him speak with much respect. But his name, with which I was
not then very well acquainted, happened to escape my recollection
while writing this Memoir; nor was I at all aware that they had
been so well known to each other, as I have since learned that
they were. On this subject I might quote the Abbe Morellet
himself, of whom I had the pleasure to see much in the year 1806;
but I prefer a reference to his own words, which coincide exactly
with what he stated to myself. 'J'avais connu Smith dans un
voyage qu'il avait fait en France, vers 1762; il parlait fort mal
notre langue; mais La Theorie des Sentimens Moraux, publiee en
1758, m'avait donne une grande idee de sa sagacite et de sa
profondeur. Et veritablement je le regarde encore aujourd'hui
comme un des hommes qui a fait les observations et les analyses
les plus completes dans toutes les questions qu'il a traitees. M.
Turgot, qui aimait ainsi que moi la metaphysique, estimait
beaucoup son talent. Nous le vimes plusieurs fois; il fut
presente chez Helvetius; nous parlames de la theorie commerciale,
banque, credit public, et de plusieurs points du grand ouvrage
qu'il meditait.' -- Memoires de l'Abbe Morellet, Tome I. p. 257,
(Paris, 1821).</p>

<p>[F]<lb/>
<lb/>
The Theory of Moral Sentiments does not seem to have
attracted so much notice in France as might have been expected,
till after the publication of the Wealth of Nations. Mr Smith
used to ascribe this in part to the Abbe Blavet's translation,
which he thought was but indifferently executed. A better reason,
however, may perhaps be found in the low and stationary condition
of Ethical and Metaphysical science in that country, previous to
the publication of the Encyclopedie. On this head I beg leave to
transcribe a few sentences from an anonymous paper of his own,
printed in the Edinburgh Review for the year 1755. The remarks
contained in them, so far as they are admitted to be just, tend
strongly to confirm an observation which I have elsewhere quoted
from D'Alembert, with respect to the literary taste of his
countrymen. (See Philosophical Essays, pp. 110- 111) Part I,
Essay iii; Works Vol.V. p. 126.
</p><p>'The original and inventive genius of the English, has not
only discovered itself in Natural Philosophy, but in morals,
metaphysics, and part of the abstract sciences. Whatever attempts
have been made in modern times towards improvement in this
contentious and unprosperous philosophy, beyond what the ancients
have left us, have been made in England. The meditations of Des
Cartes excepted, I know nothing in French that aims at being
original on that subject; for the philosophy of M. Regis, as well
as that of Father Malebranche, are but refinements on the
meditations of Des Cartes. But Mr Hobbes, Mr Locke, and Dr
Mandeville, Lord Shaftesbury, Dr Butler, Dr Clarke, and Mr
Hutcheson, have all of them, according to their different and
inconsistent systems, endeavoured at least, to be, in some
measure, original; and to add something to that stock of
observations with which the world had been furnished before them.
This branch of the English Philosophy, which seems now to be
entirely neglected by the English themselves, has, of late, been
transported into France. I observe some traces of it, not only in
the Encyclopedie, but in the Theory of agreeable sentiments by M.
de Pouilly, a work that is in many respects original; and above
all, in the late Discourse upon the origin and foundation of the
inequality amongst mankind, by M. Rousseau of Geneva.'
</p><p>A new translation of Mr Smith's Theory, (including his last
additions), was published at Paris in 1798 by Madame de
Condorcet, with some ingenious letters on Sympathy annexed to it,
written by the translator.

</p><p>[G]<lb/>
<lb/>
By way of explanation of what is hinted at in the foot-note,
I think it proper for me now to add, that at the period when this
memoir was read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, it was not
unusual, even among men of some talents and information, to
confound, studiously, the speculative doctrines of Political
Economy, with those discussions concerning the first principles
of Government which happened unfortunately at that time to
agitate the public mind. The doctrine of a Free Trade was itself
represented as of a revolutionary tendency; and some who had
formerly prided themselves on their intimacy with Mr Smith, and
on their zeal for the propagation of his liberal system, began to
call in question the expediency of subjecting to the disputations
of philosophers, the arcana of State Policy, and the unfathomable
wisdom of the feudal ages. In reprinting this Section at present,
I have, from obvious motives, followed scrupulously the text of
the first edition, without any alterations or additions
whatsoever; reserving any comments and criticisms which I have to
offer on Mr Smith's work, for a different publication. (1810.)

</p><p>[H]<lb/>
<lb/>
Notwithstanding the unqualified praise I have bestowed, in
the text, on Mr Smith's arrangement, I readily admit, that some
of his incidental discussions and digressions might have been
more skilfully and happily incorporated with his general design.
Little stress, however, will be laid on blemishes of this sort,
by those who are aware of the extreme difficulty of giving any
thing like a systematic shape to researches so various, and, at
first view, so unconnected, as his plan embraces: Some of them
having for their aim to establish abstract principles of
universal application; and others bearing a particular reference
to the circumstances and policy of our own country. It ought to
be remembered, besides, how much our taste, in matters of
arrangement, is liable to be influenced by our individual habits
of thought; by the accidental conduct of our early studies; and
by other circumstances which may be expected to present the same
objects under different aspects to different inquirers. Something
of this kind is experienced even in those more exact Sciences,
where the whole business of an elementary writer is to state
known and demonstrated truths, in a logical and pleasing series.
It has been experienced most remarkably in pure geometry, the
elements of which have been modelled into a hundred different
forms by the first mathematicians of modern Europe; while none of
them has yet been able to unite the suffrages of the public in
favour of any one arrangement as indisputably the best. What
allowances, then, are those entitled to, who, venturing upon a
vast and untrodden field, aspire to combine with the task of
original speculation, a systematical regard to luminous method,
if they should sometimes happen to mistake the historical order
of their own conclusions for the natural procedure of the human
understanding!</p>

<p>[I]
<ref target="n35">[35]</ref>
<lb/>

When this memoir was first written, I was not fully aware to
what an extent the French Economists had been anticipated in some
of their most important conclusions, by writers (chiefly British)
of a much earlier date. I had often, indeed, been struck with the
coincidence between their reasonings concerning the advantages of
their territorial tax, and Mr Locke's speculations on the same
subject, in one of his political discourses published sixty years
before; as well as with the coincidence of their argument against
corporations and exclusive companies, with what had been urged at
a still earlier period, by the celebrated John de Witt; by Sir
Josiah Child; by John Cary of Bristol; and by various other
speculative men, who appeared in the latter part of the
seventeenth century. To these last writers, my attention had been
directed by some quotations and references of the Abbe Morellet,
in his very able Memoir on the East India Company of France,
printed in 1769. Many passages, however, much more full and
explicit than those which had fallen in his way, have been
pointed out to me by the Earl of Lauderdale, in his curious and
valuable collection of rare English Tracts relating to political
economy. In some of these, the argument is stated in a manner so
clear and so conclusive, as to render it surprising, that truths
of which the public has been so long in possession, should have
been so completely overborne by prejudice and misrepresentation,
as to have had, to a large proportion of readers, the appearance
of novelty and paradox, when revived in the philosophical
theories of the present age.
<ref target="n36">[36]</ref>

</p><p>The system of political economy which professes to regulate
the commercial intercourse of different nations, and which Mr
Smith has distinguished by the title of the Commercial, or
Mercantile System, had its root in prejudices still more
inveterate than those which restrained the freedom of commerce
and industry among the members of the same community. It was
supported not only by the prejudices with which all innovations
have to contend, and by the talents of very powerful bodies of
men interested to defend it, but by the mistaken and clamorous
patriotism of many good citizens, and their blind hostility to
supposed enemies or rivals abroad. The absurd and delusive
principles, too, formerly so prevalent, with respect to the
nature of national wealth, and the essential importance of a
favourable balance of trade (principles which, though now so
clearly and demonstrably exploded by the arguments of Mr Smith,
must be acknowledged to fall in naturally, and almost inevitably,
with the first apprehensions of the mind when it begins to
speculate concerning the Theory of Commerce), communicated to the
Mercantile System a degree of plausibility, against which the
most acute reasoners of our own times are not always sufficiently
on their guard. It was accordingly, at a considerably later
period, that the wisdom of its maxims came to be the subject of
general discussion; and, even at this day, the controversy to
which the discussion gave rise cannot be said to be completely
settled, to the satisfaction of all parties. A few enlightened
individuals, however, in different parts of Europe, very early
got a glimpse of the truth;
<ref target="n37">[37]</ref>
and it is but justice, that the
scattered hints which they threw out should be treasured up as
materials for literary history. I have sometimes thought of
attempting a slight sketch on that subject myself; but am not
without hopes that this suggestion may have the effect of
recommending the task to some abler hand. At present, I shall
only quote one or two paragraphs from a pamphlet published in
1734, by Jacob Vanderlint;
<ref target="n38">[38]</ref>
an author whose name has been
frequently referred to of late years, but whose book never seems
to have attracted much notice till long after the publication of
the Wealth of Nations. He describes himself, in his Preface, as
an ordinary tradesman, from whom the conciseness and accuracy of
a scholar is not to be expected; and yet the following passages
will bear a comparison, both in point of good sense and of
liberality, with what was so ably urged by Mr Hume twenty years
afterwards, in his Essay on the Jealousy of Trade.
</p><p>'All nations have some commodities peculiar to them, which,
therefore, are undoubtedly designed to be the foundation of
commerce between the several nations, and produce a great deal of
maritime employment for mankind, which probably, without such
peculiarities, could not be; and in this respect, I suppose, we
are distinguished, as well as other nations; and I have before
taken notice, that if one nation be by nature more distinguished
in this respect than another, as they will, by that means, gain
more money than such other nations, so the prices of all their
commodities and labour will be higher in such proportion, and
consequently, they will not be richer or more powerful for having
more money than their neighbours.
</p><p>'But, if we import any kind of goods cheaper than we can now
raise them, which otherwise might be as well raised at home; in
this case, undoubtedly, we ought to attempt to raise such
commodities, and thereby furnish so many new branches of
employment and trade for our own people; and remove the
inconvenience of receiving any goods from abroad, which we can
anywise raise on as good terms ourselves: and, as this should be
done to prevent every nation from finding their account with us
by any such commodities whatsoever, so this would more
effectually shut out all such foreign goods than any law can do.
</p><p>'And as this is all the prohibitions and restraints whereby
any foreign trade should be obstructed, so, if this method were
observed, our gentry would find themselves the richer,
notwithstanding their consumption of such other foreign goods, as
being the peculiarities of other nations, we may be obliged to
import. For if, when we have thus raised all we can at home, the
goods we import after this is done be cheaper than we can raise
such goods ourselves, (which they must be, otherwise we shall not
import them), it is plain, the consumption of any such goods
cannot occasion so great an expence as they would, if we could
shut them out by an act of parliament, in order to raise them
ourselves.
</p><p>'From hence, therefore, it must appear, that it is impossible
any body should be poorer, for using any foreign goods at cheaper
rates than we can raise them ourselves, after we have done all we
possibly can to raise such goods as cheap as we import them, and
find we cannot do it; nay, this very circumstance makes all such
goods come under the character of the peculiarities of those
countries, which are able to raise any such goods cheaper than we
can do; for they will necessarily operate as such.' -- (pp. 97,
98, 99.)
</p><p>The same author, in another part of his work, quotes from
Erasmus Philips, a maxim which he calls a glorious one: 'That a
trading nation should be an open warehouse, where the merchant
may buy what he pleases, and sell what he can. Whatever is
brought to you, if you don't want it, you won't purchase it; if
you do want it, the largeness of the impost don't keep it from
you.'
</p><p>'All nations of the world, therefore,' (says Vanderlint)
'should be regarded as one body of tradesmen, exercising their
various occupations for the mutual benefit and advantage of each
other.' -- (p. 42.) 'I will not contend,' (he adds, evidently in
compliance with national prejudices,) 'I will not contend for a
free and unrestrained trade with respect to France, though I
can't see it could do us any harm even in that case.' -- (p. 45.)
</p><p>In these last sentences, an argument is suggested for a free
commerce all over the globe, founded on the same principle on
which Mr Smith has demonstrated the beneficial effects of a
division and distribution of labour among the members of the same
community. The happiness of the whole race would, in fact, be
promoted by the former arrangement, in a manner exactly analogous
to that in which the comforts of a particular nation are
multiplied by the latter.
</p><p>In the same Essay, Mr Vanderlint, following the footsteps of
Locke, maintains, with considerable ingenuity, the noted doctrine
of the Economists, that all taxes fall ultimately on land; and
recommends the substitution of a land-tax, in place of those
complicated fiscal regulations, which have been everywhere
adopted by the statesmen of modern Europe; and which, while they
impoverish and oppress the people, do not, in the same degree,
enrich the sovereign.
<ref target="n39">[39]</ref>

</p><p>The doctrine which more exclusively distinguishes this
celebrated sect, is neither that of the freedom of trade, nor of
the territorial tax, (on both of which topics they had been, in
part, anticipated by English writers), but what they have so
ingeniously and forcibly urged, with respect to the tendency of
the existing regulations and restraints, to encourage the
industry of towns in preference to that of the country. To revive
the languishing agriculture of France was the first and the
leading aim of their speculations; and it is impossible not to
admire the metaphysical acuteness and subtlety, with which all
their various discussions are so combined as to bear
systematically upon this favourite object. The influence of their
labours in turning the attention of French statesmen, under the
old monarchy, to the encouragement of this essential branch of
national industry, was remarked by Mr Smith more than thirty
years ago; nor has it altogether ceased to operate in the same
direction, under all the violent and fantastic metamorphoses
which the government of that country has since exhibited.
<ref target="n40">[40]</ref>
</p><p>In combating the policy of commercial privileges, and in
asserting the reciprocal advantages of a free trade among
different nations, the founders of the economical sect candidly
acknowledged, from the beginning, that their first lights were
borrowed from England. The testimony of M. Turgot upon this point
is so perfectly decisive, that I hope to gratify some of my
readers (in the present interrupted state of our communication
with the continent), by the following quotations from a memoir,
which, till lately, was very little known, even in France. They
are transcribed from his Eloge on M. Vincent de Gournay; a name
which has always been united with that of Quesnay, by the French
writers who have attempted to trace the origin and progress of
the now prevailing opinions on this branch of legislation.
(Oeuvres de M. Turgot, Tome III. Paris, 1808.)
</p><p>'JEAN-CLAUDE-MARIE VINCENT, Seigneur DE GOURNAY, etc. est

</p><p>'Aux lumi res que M. de Gournay tiroit de sa propre

diff rentes nations de l'Europe, et en particulier la nation
Angloise, la plus riche de toutes en ce genre, et dont il s' toit
rendu, Pour cette raison, la langue famili re. Les ouvrages qu'il
lut avec plus de plaisir, et dont il gota le plus la doctrine,
furent les trait s du fameux Josias Child, qu'il a traduits
depuis en Francois, et les m moires du Grand Pensionnaire Jean de
Witt. On sait que ces deux grands hommes sont consid r s, l'un en
Angleterre, l'autre en Hollande, comme les l gislateurs du
commerce; que leurs principes sont devenus les principes
nationaux, et que l'observation de ces principes est regard e
comme une des sources de la prodigieuse sup riorit  que ces deux
nations ont acquise dans le commerce sur toutes les autres
puissances. M. de Gournay trouvoit sans cesse dans la pratique
d'un commerce  tendu la v rification de ces principes simples et
lumineux, il se les rendoit propres sans pr voir qu'il  toit
destin    en repandre un jour la lumi re en France, et   m riter
de sa patrie le mme tribut de reconnoissance, que l'Angleterre
et la Hollande rendent   la m moire de ces deux bienfaiteurs de
leur nation et de l'humanit .' -- (pp. 324, 325.)
</p><p>'M. de Gournay, apr s avoir quitt  l'Espagne, prit la
resolution d'employer quelques ann es   voyager dans les
diff rentes parties de l'Europe, soit pour augmenter ses
connoissances, soit pour  tendre ses correspondances et former
des liaisons avantageuses pour le commerce, qu'il se proposoit de
continuer. Il voyagea   Hambourg; il parcourut la Hollande et
l'Angleterre; partout il faisoit des observations et rassembloit
des m moires sur l'etat du commerce et de la marine, et sur les
principes d'administration adopt s par ces diff rentes nations
relativement   ces grands objets. Il entretenoit pendant ses
voyages une correspondance suivie avec M. de Maurepas, auquel il
faisoit part des lumi res qui'il recueilloit.' -- (pp. 325, 326.)
</p><p>'M. de Gournay acheta, en 1749, une charge de conseiller au
grand conseil; et une place d'intendant du commerce etant venue
v quer au commencement de 1751, M. de Machault,   qui le m rite
de M. de Gournay etoit tr sconnu, la lui fit donner. C'est de ce
moment que la vie de M. de Gournay devint celle d'un homme
public: son entr e au Bureau du commerce parut itre l'epoque
d'une r volution. M. de Gournay, dans une pratique de vingt ans
du commerce le plus  tendu et le plus vari , dans la
fr quentation des plus habiles n gocians de Hollande et
d'Angleterre, dans la lecture des autsurs les plus estim s de ces
deux nations, dans l'observation attentive des causes de leur
 tonnante prosp rit , s'itoit fait des principes qui parurent
nouveaux   quelques-uns des magistrats qui composoient le Bureau
du Commerce.'-- (pp. 327, 328.)
</p><p>'M. de Gournay n'ignoroit pas que plusieurs des abus auxquels
il s'opposoit, avoient  t  autrefois  tablis dans une grande
partie de l'Europe, et qu'il en restoit mime encore des vestiges
en Angleterre; mais il savoit aussi que le gouvernement Anglois
en avoit d truit une partie; que s'il en restoit encore
quelques-unes, bien loin de les adopter comme des  tablissemens
utiles, il cherchoit   les restreindre,   les empicher de
s' tendre, et ne les tol roit encore, que parceque la
constitution r publicaine met quelquefois des obstacles   la
r formation de certains abus, lorsque ces abus ne peuvent itre
corrig s que par une autorit  dont l'exercice le plus avantageux
au peuple excite toujours sa d fiance. Il savoit enfin que depuis
un si cle toutes les Personnes  clair es, soit en Hollande, soit
en Angleterre, regardoient ces abus comme des restes de la
barbarie Gothique et de la foiblesse de tous les gouvernemens qui
n'avoient ni connu l'importancs de la libert  publique, ni su la
prot ger des invasions de l'esprit monopoleur et de l'int rit
particulier.
<ref target="n41">[41]</ref>

</p><p>'M. de Gournay avoit fait et vu faire, pendant vingt ans, le
plus grand commerce de l'univers sans avoir eu occasion
d'apprendre autrement que par les livres l'existence de toutes
ces loix auxquelles il voyoit attacher tant d'importance, et il
ne croyoit point alors qu'on le prendroit pour un novateur et un
homme   systimes, lorsqu' il ne feroit que d velopper les
principes que l'experience lui avoit enseign s, et qu'il voyoit
universellement reconnus par les n gocians les plus  clair s
avec lesquels il vivoit.
</p><p>'Ces principes, qu'on qualifioit de systime nouveau, ne lui
paroissoient que les maximes du plus simple bon sens. Tout ce
pr tendu systime itoit appuy  sur cette maxime, qu'en general
tout homme connoit mieux son propre int rit qu'un autre homme
qui cet int rit est enti rement indiff rent.
<ref target="n42">[42]</ref>
</p><p>'De l  M. de Gournay concluoit, que lorsque l'int rit des
particuliers est pr cis ment le mime que l'int rit general, ce
qu'on peut faire de mieux est de laisser chaque homme libre de
faire ce qu'il veut. -- Or il trouvoit impossible que dans le
commerce abandonn    lui-meme, l'int rit particulier ne concourt
pas avec l'int rit g n ral.' -- (pp. 334, 335, 336.)
</p><p>In mentioning M. de Gournay's opinion on the subject of
taxation, M. Turgot does not take any notice of the source from
which he derived it. But on this head (whatever may be thought of
the justness of that opinion) there can be no doubt among those
who are acquainted with the writings of Locke and of Vanderlint.
'Il pensoit' (says Turgot) 'que tous les impts, sont en derniere
analyse, toujours pay s par le propri taire, qui vend d'autant
moins les produits de sa terre, et que si tous les impits itoient
r partis sur les fonds, les propri taires et le royaume y
gagneroient tout ce qu' absorbent les fraix de r gie, toute la
consommation ou l'emploi st rile des hommes perdus, soit
percevoir les impits, soit   faire la contrebande, soit
l'empecher, sans compter la prodigieuse augmentation des
richesses et des valeurs r sultantes de l'augmentation du
commerce.' -- (pp. 350, 351.)
</p><p>In a note upon this passage by the Editor, this project of a
territorial tax, together with that of a free trade, are
mentioned among the most important points in which Gournay and
Quesnay agreed perfectly together:
<ref target="n43">[43]</ref>
and it is not a little
curious, that the same two doctrines should have been combined
together as parts of the same system, in the Treatise of
Vanderlint, published almost twenty years before.
<ref target="n44">[44]</ref>
</p><p>It does not appear from Turgot's account of M. de Gournay,
that any of his original works were ever published; nor have I
heard that he was known even in the capacity of a translator,
prior to 1752. 'Il eut le bonheur' (says M. Turgot) 'de
rencontrer dans M. Trudaine, le mime amour de la vrit  et du
bien public qui l'animoit; comme il n'avoit encore d velopp  ses
principes que par occasion, dans la discussion des affaires ou
dans la conversation, M. Trudaine l'engagea   donner comme une
esp ce de corps de sa doctrine; et c'est dans cette vue qu'il a
traduit, en 1752, les trait s sur le commerce et sur l'int rit de
l'argent, de Josias Child et de Thomas Culpepper.' -- (p. 354.) I
quote this passage, because it enables me to correct an
inaccuracy in point of dates, which has escaped the learned and
ingenious writer to whom we are indebted for the first complete
edition which has yet appeared of Turgot's works. After dividing
the Economists into two schools, that of Gournay, and that of
Quesnay, he classes under the former denomination (among some
other very illustrious names), Mr David Hume; whose Political
Discourses, I must take the liberty of remarking, were published
as early as 1752, the very year when M. Gournay published his
translations of Child and of Culpepper.
</p><p>The same writer afterwards adds: 'Entre ces deux  coles,
profitant de l'une et de l'autre, mais  vitant avec soin de
parotre tenir   aucune, se sont  lev s quelques philosophes
 clectiques,   la tite desquels il faut placer M. Turgot, l'Abb
de Condillac, et le c l bre Adam Smith; et parmi lesquels on doit
compter tr s-honorablement le traducteur de celui-ci, M. le
S nateur Germain Garnier, en Angleterre my Lord Landsdown,
Paris M. Say.   Genve M. Simonde.'
</p><p>How far Mr Smith has availed himself of the writings of the
Economists in his Wealth of Nations, it is not my present
business to examine. All that I wish to establish is, his
indisputable claim to the same opinions which he professed in
common with them, several years before the names of either
Gournay or of Quesnay were at all heard of in the republic of
letters.
</p><p>With respect to a very distinguished and enlightened English
statesman, who is here included along with Mr Smith among the
eclectic disciples of Gournay and of Quesnay, I am enabled to
state, from his own authority, the accidental circumstance which
first led him into this train of thought. In a letter which I had
the honour to receive from his Lordship in 1795, he expresses
himself thus:
</p><p>'I owe to a journey I made with Mr Smith from Edinburgh to
London, the difference between light and darkness through the
best part of my life. The novelty of his principles, added to my
youth and prejudices, made me unable to comprehend them at the
time, but he urged them with so much benevolence, as well as
eloquence, that they took a certain hold, which, though it did
not develope itself so as to arrive at full conviction for some
few years after, I can fairly say, has constituted, ever since,
the happiness of my life, as well as any little consideration I
may have enjoyed in it.'
</p><p>As the current of public opinion, at a particular period (or
at least the prevailing habits of study), may be pretty
accurately judged of by the books which were then chiefly in
demand, it may be worth mentioning, before I conclude this note,
that in the year 1751 (the same year in which Mr Smith was
promoted to his professorship), several of our choicest tracts on
subjects connected with political economy were re-published by
Robert and Andrew Foulis, printers to the University of Glasgow.
A book of Mr Law's entitled, Proposals and Reasons for
constituting a Council of Trade in Scotland, etc. reprinted in
that year, is now lying before me; from which it appears, that
the following works had recently issued from the university
press: -- Child's Discourse of Trade; Law's Essay on Money and
Trade; Gee's Trade and Navigation of Great Britain considered;
and Berkeley's Querist. In the same list, Sir William Petty's
Political Arithmetic is advertised as being then in the press.
</p><p>Mr Smith's Lectures, it must be remembered (to the fame of
which he owed his appointment at Glasgow), were read at Edinburgh
as early as 1748.

</p><p>[J]<lb/>
<lb/>
Among the questionable doctrines to which Mr Smith has lent
the sanction of his name, there is perhaps none that involves so
many important consequences as the opinion he has maintained
concerning the expediency of legal restrictions on the rate of
interest. The inconclusiveness of his reasoning on this point,
has been evinced, with a singular degree of logical acuteness, by
Mr Bentham, in a short treatise entitled A Defence of Usury; a
performance to which (notwithstanding the long interval that has
elapsed since the date of its publication), I do not know that
any answer has yet been attempted; and which a late writer,
eminently acquainted with the operations of commerce, has
pronounced (and, in my opinion, with great truth), to be
'perfectly unanswerable.'
<ref target="n45">[45]</ref>
It is a remarkable circumstance,
that Mr Smith should, in this solitary instance, have adopted, on
such slight grounds, a conclusion so strikingly contrasted with
the general spirit of his political discussions, and so
manifestly at variance with the fundamental principles which, on
other occasions, he has so boldly followed out, through all their
practical applications. This is the more surprising, as the
French Economists had, a few years before, obviated the most
plausible objections which are apt to present themselves against
this extension of the doctrine of commercial freedom. See, in
particular, some observations in M. Turgot's Reflections on the
Formation and Distribution of Riches; and a separate Essay, by
the same author, entitled, 'M moire sur le prt inter t, et sur
le Commerce des Fers.'
<ref target="n46">[46]</ref>

</p><p>Upon this particular question, however, as well as upon those
mentioned in the preceding Note, I must be allowed to assert the
prior claims of our own countrymen to those of the Economists.
From a memoir presented by the celebrated Mr Law (before his
elevation to the ministry), to the Regent Duke of Orleans, that
very ingenious writer appears to have held the same opinion with
M. Turgot; and the arguments he employs in support of it are
expressed with that clearness and conciseness which, in general,
distinguish his compositions. The memoir to which I refer is to
be found in a French work entitled, Recherches et Consid rations
sur les Finances de France, depuis 1595 jusqu'en 1721. (See Vol.
VI. p. 181. Edit. printed at Lige, 1758.) In the same volume,
this doctrine is ascribed by the editor, to Mr Law as its author,
or, at least, as its first broacher in France. 'Une opinion
apport e en France pour la premi re fois par M. Law, c'est que
l'etat ne doit jamais donner de r glemens sur le taux de
l'inter t.' -- p. 64.
</p><p>To this opinion Law appears evidently to have been led by
Locke, whose reasonings (although he himself declares in favour
of a legal rate of interest), seem, all of them, to point at the
opposite conclusion. Indeed the apology he suggests for the
existing regulations is so trifling and so slightly urged, that
one would almost suppose he was prevented merely by a respect for
established prejudices, from pushing his argument to its full
extent. The passage I allude to, considering the period when it
was written, does no small credit to Locke's sagacity. -- (See
the folio edit. of his Works, Vol. II. p. 31, et seq.)

</p><p>I would not have entered here into the historical details
contained in the two last Notes, if I had not been anxious to
obviate the effect of that weak, but inveterate prejudice which
shuts the eyes of so many against the most manifest and important
truths, when they are supposed to proceed from an obnoxious
quarter. The leading opinions which the French Economists
embodied and systematized were, in fact, all of British origin;
and most of them follow as necessary consequences, from a maxim
of natural law, which (according to Lord Coke), is identified
with the first principles of English jurisprudence. 'La loi de la
libgrt  entire de tout commerce est un corollaire du droit de
propri t .'
</p><p>The truly exceptionable part of the economical system (as I
have elsewhere remarked), is that which relates to the power of
the Sovereign. Its original authors and patrons were the decided
opposers of political liberty, and, in their zeal for the right
of property and the freedom of commerce, lost sight of the only
means by which either the one or the other can be effectually
protected.</p>

<p>[K]<lb/>
<lb/>
In the early part of Mr Smith's life it is well known to his
friends, that he was for several years attached to a young lady
of great beauty and accomplishment. How far his addresses were
favourably received, or what the circumstances were which
prevented their union, I have not been able to learn; but I
believe it is pretty certain that, after this disappointment, he
laid aside all thoughts of marriage. The lady to whom I allude
died also unmarried. She survived Mr Smith for a considerable
number of years, and was alive long after the publication of the
first edition of this Memoir. I had the pleasure of seeing her
when she was turned of eighty, and when she still retained
evident traces of her former beauty. The powers of her
understanding and the gaiety of her temper seemed to have
suffered nothing from the hand of time.
<lb/>

 END OF THE NOTES

<lb/>
</p><p>P.S. Soon after the foregoing account of Mr Smith was read
before the Royal Society, a Volume of his Posthumous Essays was
published by his executors and friends, Dr Black and Dr Hutton.
In this volume are contained three Essays on the Principles which
lead and direct Philosophical Inquiries; -- illustrated, in the
first place, by the History of Astronomy; in the second, by the
History of the Ancient Physics; in the third, by the History of
the Ancient Logics and Metaphysics. To these are subjoined three
other Essays; -- on the Imitative Arts; on the Affinity between
certain English and Italian Verses; and on the External Senses.
'The greater part of them appear' (as is observed in an
advertisement subscribed by the Editors) 'to be parts of a plan
the Author had once formed, for giving a connected history of the
liberal sciences and elegant arts.' -- 'This plan' (we are
informed by the same authority) 'he had long abandoned as far too
extensive; and these parts of it lay beside him neglected till
his death.'

</p><p>As this posthumous volume did not appear till after the
publication of the foregoing Memoir, it would be foreign to the
design of these Notes, to offer any observations on the different
Essays which it contains. Their merits were certainly not
overrated by the two illustrious editors, when they expressed
their hopes, 'that the reader would find in them that happy
connection, that full and accurate expression, and that clear
illustration which are conspicuous in the rest of the author's
works; and that, though it is difficult to add much to the great
fame he so justly acquired by his other writings, these would be
read with satisfaction and pleasure.' The three first Essays,
more particularly the fragment on the History of Astronomy, are
perhaps as strongly marked as any of his most finished
compositions, with the peculiar characteristics of his rich,
original, and comprehensive mind.

</p><p>In order to obviate a cavil which may possibly occur to some
of those readers who were not personally acquainted with Mr
Smith, I shall take this opportunity of mentioning, that in
suppressing, through the course of the foregoing narrative, his
honorary title of LL. D. (which was conferred on him by the
University of Glasgow a very short time before he resigned his
Professorship), I have complied not only with his own taste, but
with the uniform practice of that circle in which I had the
happiness of enjoying his society. To have given him, so soon
after his death, a designation, which he never assumed but on the
title-pages of his books; and by which he is never mentioned in
the letters of Mr Hume and of his other most intimate friends,
would have subjected me justly to the charge of affectation from
the audience before whom my paper was read; but the truth is (so
little was my ear then accustomed to the name of Doctor Smith),
that I was altogether unconscious of the omission, till it was
pointed out to me, several years afterwards, as a circumstance
which, however trifling, had been magnified by more than one
critic, into a subject of grave animadversion.

<note place="end" id="n33"><seg type="note-symbol">[33]</seg> <p>I shall have occasion afterwards to vindicate Mr Smith's
claims to originality in the former of these works, against the
pretensions of some foreign writers. As I do not mean, however,
to recur again to his alleged plagiarisms from the ancients. I
shall introduce here, though somewhat out of place, two short
quotations; from which it will appear, that the germ of his
speculations concerning national wealth, as well as concerning
the principles of ethics, is (according to Dr Gillies) to found
in the Greek philosophers.
<lb/>
'By adopting Aristotle's principles on the subjects of
exchangeable value, and of national wealth, Dr Smith has rescued
the science of political economy from many false subtilties and
many gross errors.' Vol. I. p. 377, 2d edit.
<lb/>
'The subject of money is treated above, Vol. I. p. 374, et seq.
In that passage, compared with another in the Magna Moralia, we
find the fundamental principles of the modern economists.' Vol.
II. p. 43.
<lb/>
In reply to these observations, I have only to request my readers
to compare them with the well-known passage in the first book of
Aristotle's Politics, with respect to the lawfulness of usury.
When we consider how much the interest of money enters as an
element into all our modern disquisitions concerning commercial
policy, is it possible to imagine, that there should be any thing
more than the most general and fortuitous coincidence between the
reasonings of such writers as Smith, or Hume, or Turgot; and
those of an author whose experience of the nature and effects of
commerce was so limited, as to impress his mind with a
conviction, that to receive a premium for the use of money was
inconsistent with the rules of morality? Compare the subsequent
edition of Gillies's Ethics and Politics of Aristotle.</p></note>

money; the intercourse of things being so establish'd throughout
the whole world, that there is a perpetual derivation of all that
can be necessary to mankind. Thus, your commodities will ever
find out money; while, not to go far, I shall produce our own
merchants only, who, (let me assure you) will be always as glad
of your corn and cattel as you can be of any thing they bring
you." -- The Life and Reign of King Henry the Eighth, London,

<note place="end" id="n39"><seg type="note-symbol">[39]</seg> <p>Lord Lauderdale has traced some hints of what are commonly
considered as the peculiarities of the economical system, in
various British publications now almost forgotten. The following
extract, from a Treatise published by Mr Asgill, in 1696,
breathes the very spirit of Quesnay's philosophy.
<lb/>'What we call commodities is nothing but land severed from
the soil. Man deals in nothing but earth. The merchants are the
factors of the world, to exchange one part of the earth for
another. The king himself is fed by the labour of the ox: and the
clothing of the army, and victualling of the navy, must all be
paid for to the owner of the soil as the ultimate receiver. All
things in the world are originally the produce of the ground, and
there must all things be raised.' -- (Inquiry into the Nature and
Origin of Public Wealth. p. 113)
<lb/>The title of Asgill's Treatise is, 'Several assertions
proved, in order to create another species of Money than Gold.'
Its object was to support Dr Chamberlayne's proposition for a
Land Bank, which he laid before the British House of Commons in
1693, and before the Scottish Parliament in 1703.</p></note>

<note place="end" id="n40"><seg type="note-symbol">[40]</seg> <p>It is but justice to the Economists to add, that they have
laid more stress than any other class of writers whatsoever, on
the principles of political economy, considered in their
connection with the intellectual and moral character of a people.</p></note>

<note place="end" id="n41"><seg type="note-symbol">[41]</seg> <p>Some of these liberal principles found their way into France
before the end of the 17th century. -- See a very curious book
entitled, Le D tail de la France sous le Rogne Present. The first
edition (which I have never met with), appeared in 1698 or 1699;
the second was printed in 1707. Both editions are anonymous; but
the author is well known to have been M. de Bois-Guilbert; to
whom Voltaire has also (erroneously) ascribed the Projet d'une
dixme Royale, published in the name of the Mar chal de Vauban.

12, 13.)
<lb/>The fortunate expression laissez nous faire, which an old
merchant (Le Gendre) is said to have used in a conversation with
Colbert; and the still more significant maxim of the Marquis
d'Argenson, pas trop gouverner, are indebted chiefly for that
proverbial celebrity which they have now acquired, to the
accidental lustre reflected upon them by the discussion of more
modern times. They must, at the same time, be allowed to evince
in their authors, a clear perception of the importance of a
problem, which Mr Burke has somewhat pronounced to be 'one of the
finest in legislation; -- to ascertain, what the state ought to
take upon itself to direct by the public wisdom; and what it
ought to leave, with as little interference as possible, to
individual discretion.' The solution of this problem, in some of
its most interesting cases, may be regarded as one of the
principal objects of Mr Smith's Inquiry; and among the many happy
changes which that work has gradually produced in prevailing
opinions, none is, perhaps, of greater consequence, than its
powerful effect in discrediting that empirical spirit of
tampering Regulation, which the multitude is so apt to mistake
for the provident sagacity of political experience.</p></note>

<note place="end" id="n42"><seg type="note-symbol">[42]</seg> <p>I have endeavoured, in a former work, to vindicate, upon  the
very same principle, some of Mr Smith's political speculation
against the charge of being founded rather on theory than on
actual experience. I was not aware, till very lately, that this
view of the subject had been sanctioned by such high authorities
as M. de Gournay and M. Turgot. -- See Philosophy of the Human
Mind, pp. 254, 255, 256, 3d edit.</p></note>

<note place="end" id="n43"><seg type="note-symbol">[43]</seg> <p>Ceci est, avec la libert  du commerce et du travail, un des
principaux points sur lesquels M. de Gournay et M. Quesnay on  t
complettement d'accord.</p></note>

<note place="end" id="n44"><seg type="note-symbol">[44]</seg> <p>I have already quoted, from Vanderlint, his opinion about the
freedom of trade. His ideas with respect to taxation I shall also
state in his own words: "I can't dismiss this head without
shewing, that if all the taxes were taken off goods, and levied
on lands and houses only, the gentlemen would have more nett rent
left out of their estates, than they have now when the taxes are
almost wholly levied out of goods." For his argument in proof of
this proposition, see his Essay on Money, p. 109 et seq. See also
Locke's Considerations on the lowering of interest and raising
the Value of Money; published in 1691.
<lb/>As to the discovery (as it has been called) of the luminous
distinction between the 'produit total' and the 'produit net de
la culture', [See the Eph m rides du Citoyen for the year 1769,
T. I pp. 13, 25 and 26, and T. IX, p. 9.] it is not worth while
to dispute about its author. Whatever merit this theory of
taxation may possess, the whole credit of it evidently belongs to
those who first proposed the doctrine stated in the foregoing
paragraph. The calculations of M. Quesnay, however interesting
and useful they may have appeared in a country where so great a
proportion of the territory was cultivated by Mtayers or Coloni
Partiarii, cannot surely be considered as throwing any new light
on the general principles of Political Economy.</p></note>

<note place="end" id="n46"><seg type="note-symbol">[46]</seg> <p>In an Essay read before a literary society in Glasgow, some
years before the publication of the Wealth of Nations, Dr Reid
disputed the expediency of legal restrictions on the rate of
interest; founding his opinion on some of the same considerations
which were afterwards so forcibly stated by Mr Bentham. His
attention had probably been attracted to this question by a very
weak defence of these restrictions in Sir James Steuart's
Political Economy; a book which had then been recently published,
and which (though he differed widely from many of its doctrines),
he was accustomed, in his academical lectures, to recommend
warmly to his students. It was indeed the only systematical work
on the subject that had appeared in our language, previous to Mr
Smith Inquiry.</p></note>
